   BEIJING (AP) -- Rescuers in southwest China are searching for
workers who have been missing since a mudslide destroyed a power
station last week, killing 14 people and injuring 27 others, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The mudslide, which happened on Aug. 13 in Yingjiang county,
Yunnan province, leveled the power station, which had 45 workers
inside, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers were still searching for the four missing workers, the
news agency said. The disaster caused an estimated $2.4 million in
damages, it said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Celebrates 54th Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton celebrated a quiet
54th birthday Saturday with his family in the Adirondack Mountains,
careful not to divert attention from Al Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The president, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, daughter
Chelsea and family dog Buddy holed up at the home of Arthur Lussi,
a wealthy real estate man who owns area resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meantime, was continuing his Mississippi River boat trip --
and celebrating wife Tipper's 52nd birthday, also Saturday -- on his
first post-convention political trip as the Democratic nominee for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons drove into town for dinner, following a 2&AMP;frac12;-hour
walk in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took Buddy with us. He was having a wild adventure,'' the
first lady said while greeting local residents who gathered outside
the restaurant. ''He went bounding off and returned looking
exhausted. Whatever it was, it outran him, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   On his way to dinner, the president stopped his motorcade twice
to greet people standing with ''Happy Birthday'' signs. One sign
said ''Chelsea for Congress.'' About 30 people, some wearing paper
party hats and blowing noisemakers, waited for more than three
hours to see Clinton, who got out of his vehicle and shook hands
and signed hats.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton brushed off questions about what she got the
president for his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't opened anything yet,'' the president said, and then
added: ''One of the young men who works for me gave me an antique
pair of cufflinks. I put off everything to the end. I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the Clintons stopped at a Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream
shop, the president choosing a double-decker black raspberry and
Cherry Garcia cone.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his birthday wish, Clinton put his arm around his wife and
said: ''I think you know what my birthday wish is. I want Hillary
to win (her Senate race in New York) and I want Al Gore to win.''
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, the Clintons called Mrs. Gore and sang
''Happy Birthday'' to her.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the birthday wishes started long before the actual
day.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, singer Carly Simon sang ''Happy Birthday, Mr.
President'' to him at a party on Martha's Vineyard in
Massachusetts, where he has celebrated his birthday the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Adirondack Daily Enterprise printed pictures of
birthday greetings drawn by local children. Maria Trumbell of
Saranac Lake, N.Y., wrote: ''Roses are red, violets are blue, blow
out the candles so your wish will come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, in Dubuque, Iowa, Gore arranged to have a string
quartet play a birthday greeting as his wife emerged from an
elevator into a hotel lobby. The vice president, daughter Karenna,
and her husband, Drew Schiff, softly sang ''Happy Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh that's nice,'' said a surprised Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A family celebration was planned for late Saturday in Clinton,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Clinton has celebrated one birthday in Washington,
one in Wyoming, four in Massachusetts and two now in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His 49th birthday was marred by sadness over an accident in
Bosnia that killed three top U.S. diplomats trying to broker and
end to the civil war. When he turned 50, Clinton attended a glitzy,
$10 million fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
   His next three birthdays were celebrated on Martha's Vineyard
with friends, including actor Ted Danson and golfing partner and
confidant, Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating his 52nd birthday with family was a bit strained: It
came just two days after he publicly apologized to them for an
inappropriate relationship with a young White House intern, Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   This birthday comes five days after his farewell speech at the
Democratic National Convention where he noted his own gray hair and
reminisced: ''I was born in a summer storm to a young widow in a
small Southern town ... .''

<HEADLINE> Russia: Trapped Sailors Likely Dead  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Norwegian divers with video equipment went down to
a sunken Russian submarine Sunday in a final attempt to find
survivors trapped for a week, even though Russian officials said
all 118 seamen aboard were probably dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Western rescue effort, delayed by initial Russian reluctance
to accept foreign aid, also involved a British mini-submarine that
waited its turn to dive into the cold depths of the northern
Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian and British teams were brought to the disaster
site by two Norwegian ships which moved into position above the
mangled Kursk before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, working at a depth of 350 feet, would assess the
damage suffered by the submarine when it sank Aug. 12, a task that
would take ''several hours,'' a spokesman for the British Defense
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian reports, the divers would try to manually
unscrew a lid leading to the submarine's escape chamber.
Pressure-measuring devices located inside the hatch would give the
rescue team an idea about conditions inside the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure within the vessel must be low enough to provide for
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The divers would also assess chances for the British
mini-submarine to latch on to the damaged escape hatch. The Russian
ITAR-Tass news agency said rescuers would be using underwater
robots to clear away debris.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the Western rescue effort moved into high gear,
Russia's Navy announced that most of the crew apparently died when
a massive explosion shattered the Kursk on Aug. 12, slamming it to
the bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Kursk's crew apparently died in the first minutes of
the disaster, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov told reporters
Saturday. Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak said in a special announcement
on state-run RTR television that any survivors likely drowned as
the ship filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most possibly, we will have to admit that our worst
expectations have materialized,'' Motsak said.
</P>
<P>
   Though officials said they had not ruled out all hope, it was
their starkest statement so far after days of insisting that there
were survivors and hope of rescuing at least part of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The navy said Saturday there had been no contact with the crew
at least since Monday, and remarks from some officials indicated
there had never been contact. Motsak indicated the emphasis would
be on finding what had happened to the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The essential thing is to find them -- alive or dead -- and get
them to shore to do what must be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came several hours before the British
mini-submarine arrived at the site, followed later by the divers.
Russian news reports said the divers would try to open the damaged
hatch on the Kursk and determine whether the pressure inside is low
enough for anyone to have survived inside. If it is, they will
summon the British mini-submarine and guide it to the hatch.
</P>
<P>
   British commander Mike Finney said the divers would go down
first to check out safety conditions for the mini-sub. ''They will
also have a good look around to see if they can detect any signs of
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians said the Western aid was too late to make any
difference. They expressed anger about the way President Vladimir
Putin's government handled the rescue effort and took so long to
ask for foreign help.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course it was absurd that they were misleading us for so
long. It was clear that if people were not saved in the first two
or three days they're no longer alive,'' said Galina Klimova, a
resident of Murmansk, an Arctic city where the rescue effort was
headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the Kursk's crew, who had been trickling into
Murmansk from all across Russia, were closeted Saturday at a nearby
navy facility. Throughout the city, despair and resignation were
mixed with disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a waste of time,'' retiree Valentina Boldyreva
said sadly of the rescue effort. ''It's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to criticism that he did not interrupt his summer
vacation when news of the disaster broke, Putin returned to Moscow
ahead of schedule Saturday and held meetings with top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow initially refused Western offers of aid. The navy's
announcement that the crew was almost certainly dead was likely to
be seen as an attempt by some Russian officials to show that the
Western squads could do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that the British submersible will not be able to
latch on, since it will be using the same methods the Russian
capsules used,'' Klebanov said in Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
   Seas were calm in the rescue area for the first time in days
Saturday. Russian rescuers continued struggling to reach the
submarine, but were frustrated by powerful currents and almost zero
visibility on the sea floor. The escape hatch they were trying to
reach at the rear of the submarine is badly damaged, and repeated
efforts to dock have failed.
</P>
<P>
   A government commission investigating the disaster said Saturday
that the Kursk suffered a massive explosion which ripped through
the confined space of the submarine. The explosion apparently was
in the forward torpedo compartment, which was loaded with up to 30
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unclear what triggered the explosion. Russian officials
have cited either a collision or an internal problem.
</P>
<P>
   A probable scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's forward
compartment blew up, setting off a much bigger explosion. U.S. and
Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the area last
Saturday at the time the Kursk was lost. There have been no reports
of other vessels in the area with which the Kursk might have
collided.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the damage raised new questions about the
conditions of the two nuclear reactors aboard the Kursk, which
Russian officials had initially insisted were safely shut down.

<HEADLINE> Broncos 36, Cowboys 23  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Brian Griese threw two touchdown passes barely two
minutes apart in the second quarter, and the Denver Broncos rolled
to a 36-23 preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Griese's scoring passes helped give Denver a 24-6 halftime lead.
The Broncos (3-0) expanded the lead to 31-6 on Olandis Gary's
4-yard touchdown run midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Stoerner, Dallas' fourth-string quarterback, rallied the
Cowboys (0-4) to 17 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
   Griese, playing only the first half, completed 12 of 18 passes
for 153 yards. Dallas' Troy Aikman, also playing a half, was
7-of-20 for 95 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, continuing his steady progress from
reconstructive knee surgery last October, ran for 31 yards on six
carries in the first quarter, including a 5-yard scoring run. Davis
ran for an 11-yard gain on the final play of the quarter and did
not return as a precaution because of a sore left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys lost two challenges on touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Galloway's apparent 14-yard TD catch early in the second
quarter was challenged by the Broncos and reversed by referee Dick
Hantak when replays showed Galloway's second foot landed out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the period, the Cowboys challenged Byron Chamberlain's
21-yard scoring reception, but the score was upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Two fumbles on kickoff returns by Dallas' Darran Hall helped the
Broncos take a 10-0 lead before the Cowboys' offense ever got on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's first fumble was recovered at the Dallas 23, and Davis
scored five plays later on a darting run up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   After Hall's second fumble at the Dallas 34, Jason Elam kicked a
35-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was 4-of-8 for 46 yards on Dallas' first series, which
lasted 14 plays but stalled at the 7-yard line and resulted in Tim
Seder's 25-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, Aikman passed 24 yards to Wane
McGarity, but Galloway's TD catch was nullified and Seder kicked a
20-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the ensuing series, Griese passed 20 yards to Ed McCaffrey
and then hit Rod Smith on a 36-yard TD throw with 6:09 left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   After Dallas went three-and-out, Griese passed 20 yards to Smith
and 11 to Ed McCaffrey. Gary ran for 20 yards, and Griese hit
Chamberlain for a touchdown at 3:42 for a 24-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos made it 31-6 early in the third quarter. Rookie
Deltha O'Neal returned a punt 20 yards to the Dallas 38, and Gary
ran 4 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner then drove the Cowboys 75 yards in eight plays for
their first touchdown, a 21-yard pass to Chris Brazzell.
</P>
<P>
   After a Denver turnover, Seder kicked a 36-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's 58-yard kickoff return set up Elam's 45-yard field goal
early in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the period, Stoerner fumbled the snap but picked
up the loose ball and ran through a hole on the right side 50 yards
for another score.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos honored long-time safety Steve Atwater before the
game. Atwater signed a ceremonial one-year contract on Friday and
then retired as a Bronco.
</P>
<P>
   Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski, who faces four felony counts
for fraudulently obtaining a diet drug and was accused this week in
a magazine article of uttering a racial slur which he angrily
denied, was cheered lustily in pregame warmups and whenever he made
a tackle.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 11, Cubs 3  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona tied a franchise record with eight runs
in the third inning and gave Jon Lieber his first loss in 11 starts
Saturday night as the Diamondbacks pounded the Chicago Cubs 11-3
for their sixth victory in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 41st home run, and third
in two nights, for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, on their second-longest winning streak of the
season, had a club-record eight hits in the third, including a
two-run homer by Steve Finley and two-run double by Luis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was 3-for-5, including a triple, to extend his hitting
streak to 12 games. Damian Miller hit a three-run homer and an RBI
single for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has outscored the Cubs 22-5 in the first two games of
the three-game series to stay 1&AMP;frac12; games behind first-place San
Francisco in the NL West. All but one of Chicago's runs have come
on Sosa's homers.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit a two-run homer in the sixth. The Cubs have lost seven
of eight and have scored more than three runs only twice during
that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks led 9-0 after three innings of Friday night's
11-2 victory and were up 11-1 after three innings Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber (11-6) was 6-0 in his last 10 starts and hadn't lost
since June 23. In 2 2-3 innings, his shortest outing of the season,
he allowed nine runs on 10 hits, struck out two, walked two and hit
a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Anderson (10-5) earned just his second victory in 10
starts. He allowed three runs on seven hits in seven innings. He
struck out two and didn't walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Already leading 3-1 on Miller's 10th home run of the season, the
Diamondbacks sent 11 batters to the plate in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Finley had two hits in the inning, a leadoff single and his 30th
home run of the year. Gonzalez doubled in two more, Miller, Matt
Williams and Tony Womack had RBI singles and Craig Counsell drove
in a run with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago took a 1-0 lead in the second on Jose Nieves' RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Todd Stottlemyre pitched three innings of a simulated game
Saturday and is on target to return to the Diamondbacks' rotation
Sept. 2 or 3. He is to have two rehabilitation starts in the minors
before then. ... Lieber is 0-4 lifetime against the Diamondbacks.
... Womack has tied his career high with 50 RBIs. ... The crowd of
47,404 was the third sellout of the season at Bank One Ballpark.
... David Dellucci was 2-for-4 for Arizona in his first start since
being recalled from Triple-A Tucson. ... Sosa tied Norm Cash for
No. 45 on the career homer list with 377.

Russia Losing Hope For Sub Survivors
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Grim Russian officials admitted Saturday that all 118 sailors
trapped for a week in a mangled submarine were probably dead, even as a British
mini-sub and Norwegian divers joined the effort to reach the vessel sunken in
the Arctic depths. Most of the Kursk's crew apparently died in the first minutes

<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- An underground natural gas pipeline exploded Saturday,
killing nine people who had been camping nearby. Three other campers were in
critical condition. The victims, four of them children, were members of at least
two southeastern New Mexico families who were camping along the Pecos River
about 200 to 300 yards from where the explosion occurred, said state police
Capt. John Balderston. The pipeline was 8 to 15 feet underground at the rupture
point, El Paso Natural Gas Co. spokeswoman Norma Dunn said. The rupture occurred
about 500 feet east of the river, around 20 to 30 miles south of Carlsbad in

Lawyer Files Suit Over Tire Recall

   CINCINNATI (AP) -- A new class-action lawsuit says a recall of 6.5 million
Firestone tires is so complicated it discourages motorists from seeking
replacements.''If the companies can spread this out over several years by giving
customers the runaround, then they can discourage people from even trying to get
replacement tires,'' said attorney Stanley Chesley, who filed the lawsuit Friday
against Ford Motor Co. and Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. Bridgestone/Firestone
announced a rolling recall Aug. 9 of 6.5 million P235/75R15 size radial ATX and
ATX II brands, as well as Wilderness AT tires of the same size made at a plant
in Decatur, Ill. The tires are mostly on Ford trucks and sport utility vehicles.

Warmer Weather Melts North Pole Ice

   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in 50 million years, visitors to the
North Pole can see something extraordinary: water. The thick ice that covers the
Arctic Ocean at the North Pole has melted, leaving a mile-wide stretch of water
at the top of the world, The New York Times reported Saturday. The water could
be the result of global warming, although there is a debate among experts about
the cause. Some believe it could simply be a natural occurrence rather than the
result of a ''greenhouse effect'' caused by manmade pollution and increased
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 4, Mets 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gary Sheffield is trying to keep the Los
Angeles Dodgers from fading too far back in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield homered twice Saturday, leading the Dodgers to a 4-1
victory over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   His 40 homers match Mike Piazza for the most by a Dodgers player
since the team moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958.
Sheffield is one behind Sammy Sosa for the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to bring the same intensity, no matter what the
circumstances may be,'' said Sheffield, who is three homers shy of
the franchise record Duke Snider set in 1956. ''We have to
concentrate on every pitch and every at-bat and do the things it
takes to win, all through the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros also homered and Chan Ho Park (12-8) pitched a
four-hitter for his second complete game of the season, as the
Dodgers remained eight games behind San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander handed New York its sixth loss in 26 games. He
struck out 10 and walked two en route to his third victory in 11
starts. Park, who pitched seven scoreless innings against the Mets
on May 29 at Dodger Stadium, has a 1.95 career ERA against them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Derek Bell's first-inning homer, the Mets did not get
another runner past first base against Park -- who has never allowed
fewer than four hits in six career complete games.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you throw your fastball when you're ahead in the count
like that, and then throw your breaking ball when you're behind,
it's tough for the guys to make adjustments,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said. ''And he had good control with both pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who joined the Dodgers in a seven-player trade that
sent Piazza to the Florida Marlins in 1998, reached the 40-homer
mark for the second time in his 13-year career, and the first time
since hitting 42 with Florida in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield wasn't always a home-run threat. He began his career
with the Milwaukee Brewers, hitting only 21 in 294 games before
recording 33 in 1992, his first season with the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't allowed to hit home runs in Milwaukee,'' he said. ''I
was asked to get on base and steal bases, so I just tried to do
whatever the Brewers needed me to do. But San Diego just let me
loose to go ahead and swing the bat. And that's when I became a
home-run hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bell opened the scoring with his 16th homer, the Dodgers
took a 3-1 lead in the third against Rick Reed (7-4).
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield drove a first-pitch curveball into the left-field
pavilion after a single by Tom Goodwin. One out later, Karros hit
his 28th homer -- his third in 134 at-bats since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield ended the scoring with another leadoff homer in the
eighth, on a 1-1 fastball from Pat Mahomes. It was the 21st time he
has homered twice in a game, and the sixth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last three weeks I've really tried to go out of my way to
do something extra instead of letting the game come to me, like I
have all year,'' Sheffield said. ''I got out of my game plan and
started chasing the pitcher's pitch and started looking bad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then I got out of rhythm trying to go back to the basics. As
long as I'm swinging the bat well, the way I'm seeing the ball now,
I can just wait all day on my pitch and drive it when it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was Reed's first in five career decisions at Dodger
Stadium, and first in nine road starts since a 7-2 setback at San
Francisco on May 4. The right-hander lost consecutive starts for
the first time this season. He was charged with three runs and
seven hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Saturday's crowd of 53,051 on ''Backpack Day'' was the
Dodgers' sixth home sellout this season. The other five sellouts
were on Opening Day, ''Pokemon Trading Card Day,'' ''T-Shirt
Night,'' ''Sports Watch Night,'' and ''Rally Towel Night.'' ...
Park has allowed fewer than two earned runs in each of his last
five starts. ... Sheffield has 22 homers at Dodger Stadium,
matching the record Piazza set in 1997. ... Bell's homer gave him
seven hits and seven RBIs in his 15 career at-bats against Park.
... After a leadoff single by Jay Payton in the first inning, Todd
Pratt went sprawling on a high tight pitch from Park and catcher
Chad Kreuter caught Payton leaning the wrong way. It was the first
pickoff by a Dodgers catcher this season. ... Pratt started
Saturday's game behind the plate instead of Piazza, who caught
Friday night's 3 hour, 42-minute marathon.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Pipe Explosion Kills 9  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- An underground natural gas pipeline
exploded Saturday, killing 10 people who had been camping nearby.
Two other campers were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, five of them children, were members of at least two
southeastern New Mexico families who were camping along the Pecos
River about 200 to 300 yards from where the explosion occurred,
said state police Capt. John Balderston.
</P>
<P>
   Balderston said a woman who survived recalled being awakened by
shouts about a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''She stands up and discovers she's on fire and jumps in the
river,'' Balderston said, ''then returns to get her children -- and
can't, because it's so intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the river, investigators found sleeping bags and tents
melted by the heat, Balderston said. ''The only reason we could
tell it was a tent was the geometric design of the poles,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline was 8 to 15 feet underground at the rupture point,
El Paso Natural Gas Co. spokeswoman Norma Dunn said. The rupture
occurred about 500 feet east of the river, around 20 to 30 miles
south of Carlsbad in southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an absolute mystery right now as to why that blew,''
Balderston said. Dunn said investigators may never be able to say
what sparked it.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion left a large crater, which Balderston estimated
was 86-feet long, about 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep. The fire was
visible from Carlsbad, 20 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw a large ball of flames,'' Balderston said. ''The fire
department was able to find six people in the river, walking west
of the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the victims were taken to a hospital in Lubbock, Texas,
about 160 miles from Carlsbad. Four died there Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The rest were in critical condition. ''It's going to be nip and
tuck for the next 24 hours,'' spokeswoman Kim Davis said. ''It's
very grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those killed was Roy Lee Heady, 20, of Carlsbad, N.M. and
his daughters, 22-month-old Kelsy and 6-month-old twins Timber and
Tamber, said Richard Heady, the girls' grandfather. The girls'
mother, Amy Heady, 18 died at the hospital Saturday, hospital
spokeswoman Kim Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old who had burns on 80 percent of her body was
pronounced dead on arrival at Shriners Hospital in Galveston,
Texas, where she was airlifted from Lubbock, Shriners nursing
supervisor Bill Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso Natural Gas Co. spokeswoman Norma Dunn said the
explosion could have been ignited by anything from a spark from
striking rocks to someone lighting a cigarette or coal for a
barbecue. The line was shut off to the rupture by 6:15 a.m.,
meaning the fire was out, Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a
six-member crew to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Gas from the pipeline goes to customers in Texas, New Mexico and
California.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Racing Against Flames  </HEADLINE>
By TOM LACEKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOSTON, Mont. (AP) -- Firefighters raced to make as much progress
as possible against a menacing wildfire Saturday before expected
windy weather could whip the flames into another dash across the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze near Toston had swept across 45,000 acres in three
days. Officials had given a 100,000-acre estimate Friday, but said
Saturday that poor visibility and the amount of smoke led them to
overestimate the size of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Cool temperatures and light rain kept it quiet during the night,
officials reported Saturday, but a cold front was expected to
arrive during the night with strong wind and no moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ''The winds today are estimated at the top of the ridges to be
40 mph plus,'' said Graver Johnson, information officer for the
fire near Toston, 60 miles southeast of Helena.
</P>
<P>
   ''Historically, we know those weather systems can undo
everything that has been done. We have a heads-up today for all
firefighters,'' said Jon Silvius, information officer at a fire
near Hamilton, in extreme western Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 firefighters, including 200 National Guard troops,
battled the Toston fire Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials announced Saturday that about 500 soldiers had
been called up from the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell,
Ky., to help fight wildfires in Montana, bumping the Army's numbers
on the fire lines to more than 1,600. Montana Gov. Marc Racicot
also announced that a Marine battalion from Camp Lejeune, N.C.,
would be joining the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven major fires in Montana had burned more than half a
million acres, including more than 242,000 acres in the Bitterroot
Valley of southwestern Montana. They have destroyed 175 homes and
other buildings since late July.
</P>
<P>
   They were among 94 fires burning Saturday in Arizona,
California, Florida, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Utah,
Washington and Wyoming, according to the National Interagency Fire
Center in Boise, Idaho. Those fire had blackened more than 1.1
million acres.
</P>
<P>
   The Toston blaze started Tuesday as a spark in a wheat field,
burning 20,000 acres by Thursday, then exploded Thursday night and
swept across some 80,000 additional acres of rangeland and
scattered timber.
</P>
<P>
   No houses were lost to the fire near Toston, but some rural
families were still out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Service had been restored Saturday on twin 500,000-volt power
lines that shut down automatically Friday when the fire burned
underneath them. Workers took one down again for several hours
Saturday to replace insulators. The lines carry electricity from a
southeastern Montana power complex to the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers and volunteers fanned out across the countryside
Saturday to rescue cattle herds. Ranchers abandoned several hundred
head of cattle Friday in the Wall Mountain area as the fire drove
to within a couple of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Most other fires in Montana were relatively quiet overnight, but
new evacuations were ordered near Darby, in southwestern Montana,
and near Libby, in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   After Montana, the next major fire center was Idaho, where the
25 large fires active Saturday had blackened 421,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   This year could become a repeat of the great fires of 1910, said
Jim Caswell, supervisor of the Clearwater National Forest in
northern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In that year, several large fires in northern Idaho and western
Montana combined and swept across 3 million acres, killing more
than 80 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are set up for a huge event if the right things fall into
place,'' Caswell said.
</P>
<P>
   One fire in the Clearwater National Forest jumped containment
lines Friday, gaining 12,000 acres in 24 hours to reach 40,000.

Russia Losing Hope For Sub Survivors

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Grim Russian officials admitted Saturday that all 118 sailors
trapped for a week in a mangled submarine were probably dead, even as a British
mini-sub and Norwegian divers joined the effort to reach the vessel sunken in
the Arctic depths. Most of the Kursk's crew apparently died in the first minutes
of the disaster, when a massive explosion shattered the vessel Aug. 12 and it
slammed into the bottom of the sea, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov told
reporters Saturday. Vice Adm. Mikhail Motsak said in a special announcement on
state-run RTR television that any survivors likely drowned as the ship filled
with water.

record, intensified Saturday as it spun over the open Atlantic with maximum
winds of 110 mph. Chris, the third named storm of the hurricane season, weakened
and its winds dropped to 25 mph as it continued its northwesterly course. Its
remnants were 225 miles northwest of the Caribbean island of Antigua and not
expected to threaten any islands during the weekend, forecasters said. Alberto
was about 1,065 miles west of the Azores islands, west of Portugal. It was
moving north at about 5 mph. Alberto formed Aug. 4 and hasn't posed a threat to
land.

Warmer Weather Melts North Pole Ice

   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in 50 million years, visitors to the
North Pole can see something extraordinary: water. The thick ice that covers the
Arctic Ocean at the North Pole has melted, leaving a mile-wide stretch of water
at the top of the world, The New York Times reported Saturday. The water could
be the result of global warming, although there is a debate among experts about
the cause. Some believe it could simply be a natural occurrence rather than the
result of a ''greenhouse effect'' caused by manmade pollution and increased
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Padres 4, Expos 3, 11 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Desi Relaford singled home the winning run with
two outs in the 11th inning to give the San Diego Padres a 4-3
victory over the Montreal Expos on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Relaford's single off Julio Santana (0-3) scored Ruben Rivera
from second base. Second baseman Jose Vidro made a diving stab at
the ball but it rolled off his glove in short right field.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was able to score ahead of Vidro's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera led off the inning with his third walk of the game and
was sacrificed to second. With two outs, Santana intentionally
walked Eric Owens to get to Relaford.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Walker (7-1) pitched the 11th for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro tied it at 3 with a two-run homer off Padres reliever
Donne Wall in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro connected with two outs for his 19th home run.
Pinch-hitter Wilton Guerrero had drawn a leadoff walk.
</P>
<P>
   Padres starter Brian Tollberg allowed one run and three hits in
seven innings. The no-decision was the rookie's eighth in his last
10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The only run Montreal scored off Tollberg came on an infield
single by Vidro and Lee Stevens' run-scoring triple in the fourth.
Tollberg retired 11 of the final 12 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens went 4-for-4 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego took a 3-1 lead on consecutive RBI doubles by Ryan
Klesko and Phil Nevin in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal starter Javier Vazquez allowed three runs on nine hits
in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 1-0 lead in the second when Nevin scored on a
double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: With an infield single in his first at-bat, Nevin has
reached base by a hit or walk in 40 consecutive games. ... The
Expos turned three double plays, giving them seven in the first two
games of the three-game series. Montreal infielders have not
committed an error in the last 23 games, spanning 204 innings. ...
San Diego's Bret Boone snapped an 0-for-15 skid with an infield
single in the first. In his last seven games, he was 2-for-26
before the hit. ... Expos OF Peter Bergeron missed his second
straight start with a bruised left thumb, but did come into the
game as a defensive replacement in the eighth. ... Dave Winfield
was inducted into the Padres Hall of Fame. Winfield, who played the
first eight years of his career with San Diego, had his uniform
number (31) retired and a banner with his picture hung from the top
of Qualcomm Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks 25, 49ers 21  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Brock Huard passed seven yards to rookie James
Williams for a touchdown with 33 seconds left to give the Seattle
Seahawks a 25-21 victory Saturday night over the San Francisco
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks (2-1) came back to beat the 49ers (1-3) with the
only touchdown of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, a second-year quarterback who is battling to become the
backup to Jon Kitna, drove the Seahawks 59 yards in seven plays in
70 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointing defeat for the 49ers, who carried a 21-18
halftime lead into the final minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Garcia and Rick Mirer each passed for a touchdown for the
49ers, who intercepted Kitna twice.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Eloms intercepted a pass by rookie Gio Carmazzi and
returned it 43 yards to the San Francisco 11 to end the 49ers' last
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers got an interception of a Kitna pass attempt by safety
Lance Schulters at the San Francisco 1-yard line and then won an
instant replay reversal of what would have been a go-ahead
touchdown by the Seahawks in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna drove the Seahawks from their own 24 to a first down at
the San Francisco 10 on their first possession of the second half.
But Kitna was intercepted by Schulters while attempting a pass to
Derrick Mayes.
</P>
<P>
   On the 49ers' drive from the 1, Travis Jervey fumbled the ball
when he was hit by Anthony Simmons on a third-and-5 carry from the
San Francisco 42. Reggie Tongue picked up the ball and ran it back
48 yards for an apparent touchdown, but 49ers coach Steve Mariucci
challenged the play. Referee Mike Carey ruled that Jervey was down
before the fumble, allowing the 49ers to keep possession of the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks appeared to have all the momentum at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was 7-for-7 for 74 yards, including an 8-yard touchdown
pass to Sean Dawkins, and then passed to Derrick Mayes for a
2-point conversion to cut San Francisco's lead to 21-18 with 1:04
left in the first half. Kitna had a 37-yard completion to Dawkins
nullified when Dawkins was called for pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   Former Seahawks quarterback Mirer replaced Garcia in the second
quarter and led the 49ers 80 yards in nine plays for a touchdown,
teaming with Jerry Rice on a 34-yard touchdown pass to give San
Francisco a 21-10 lead. Mirer is playing with his fourth team in
four years since the Seahawks traded him to Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia played four series and led the 49ers to two touchdowns.
He was 6-for-7 for 59 yards and one TD.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's first play, Kitna was intercepted by linebacker
Jeff Ulbrich, giving the 49ers the ball on the Seattle 20. The
49ers scored six plays later on a 4-yard pass from Garcia to J.J.
Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks came back in the opening period to tie it on a
4-yard TD pass from Kitna to Derrick Mayes and then went ahead 10-7
on a 22-yard field goal by Todd Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia directed the 49ers to a touchdown early in the second
quarter with Terry Jackson scoring on a fourth-and-1.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer was 8-for-14 for 115 yards and one touchdown with one
interception. Kitna was 20-for-29 for 233 yards and two touchdowns
with two interceptions.

<HEADLINE> Trapped Sailors Likely Dead  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Norwegian divers examined a Russian nuclear
submarine Sunday, trying to find a way into the shattered vessel
after an initial check showed that the escape hatch was badly
damaged, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A British rescue mini-submarine waited on the surface as the
divers checked the hull of the Kursk, knocking on the side to see
if there was air inside. A decision would be made later Sunday
about deploying the British LR5 vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said the escape hatch was so
badly damaged that it was unlikely the British mini-submarine could
latch on. He said hopes of entering the submarine now focused on
the Norwegian divers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The British submarine is similar to ours, so we believe that
it will be unable to dock either,'' Klebanov told Russia's RTR
television from the rescue scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy has virtually ruled out hope that any of the
Kursk's crew are still alive. The navy said Saturday that most of
the 118-man crew died Aug. 12 when a huge explosion wrecked the
Kursk and any survivors almost certainly drowned on the sea bed.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov gave further details on the damage Sunday, saying the
submarine's front five or six compartments were flooded within
seconds. He said some crew might have survived for a while in the
back three compartments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Water almost instantly flooded the submarine's hull up to the
fifth or sixth compartments. The crew in those sections died almost
instantaneously and the submarine became uncontrollable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The escape hatch is at the rear of the submarine, but it too
suffered major damage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, working at a depth of 350 feet, were moving slowly
because of the depth and difficult conditions around the Kursk,
navy officials said. Each dive was taking several hours, they said.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be the first time divers had descended to the
Kursk since rescue efforts began a week ago. Russian escape
capsules tried to reach the Kursk repeatedly, but the Russian navy
reportedly had no skilled divers.
</P>
<P>
   A Norwegian video camera was first lowered to check the hull and
the water was checked for possible radiation leaks from the Kursk's
two nuclear reactors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said the rescue operations would continue at
least through Sunday, but indicated the emphasis was shifting to
what caused the tragedy on the Kursk, one of the navy's newest and
most powerful submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians said the Western aid was too late to make any
difference, and expressed anger about the way President Vladimir
Putin's government handled the rescue effort and took so long to
ask for foreign help. Moscow for days declined offers of Western
help.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should have accepted help as soon as they learned that
the vessel was in distress,'' said Tikhon Bagryantsev, a Navy
retiree whose son, Capt. Vladimir Bagryantsev, was feared among the
dead. ''Every minute counts there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's announcement that the crew was almost certainly dead,
just as the British rescue team arrived Saturday, could be seen as
an attempt by some Russian officials to show that the Western
squads could do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   A government commission investigating the disaster said Saturday
that the Kursk suffered a massive explosion, which ripped through
the confined space of the submarine. The explosion apparently was
in the forward torpedo compartment, which was loaded with up to 30
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unclear what triggered the explosion. Russian officials
cite either a collision or an internal problem.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said Sunday a World War II mine or a collision with a
foreign submarine were possible scenarios. The U.S. navy, which had
two submarines in the area at the time, said none of its vessels
was involved in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said there were up to three foreign submarines in the
area when the Kursk was lost.
</P>
<P>
   A probable scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's forward
compartment exploded, setting off a much bigger explosion. U.S. and
Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the area Aug. 12
at the time the Kursk was lost.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the damage raised new questions about the
conditions of the two nuclear reactors aboard the Kursk, which
Russian officials had initially insisted were safely shut down.

<HEADLINE> Value of havens for abandoned children questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) - In the chill of a new spring, one baby was
found dead in the trash, another in a river - and Gigi Kelly, a
mother and registered nurse, came up with a simple idea.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Kelly organized a program she called Baskets for
Babies, encouraging families around the state to set out baskets
lined with warm blankets on their front porches, ready to take in
unwanted infants who might otherwise die.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a year later, the baskets of 600 members have yet
to receive a single baby - and more sophisticated programs aimed at
preventing infant abandonment are getting similarly dismal results,
even while mothers continue to abandon their children.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, not a single baby has been turned in since a law was
passed last year that offered a form of clemency to mothers who
leave children with designated medical providers. In Houston alone,
seven babies have since been abandoned, none with medical
providers, and one died.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, however, saw the first use of its abandonment law
last week when an infant boy unwanted by his mother was turned in
to the pediatric emergency room at a Newark hospital. The
two-day-old boy was brought to the hospital on Thursday evening by
a police officer and a volunteer from an anti-abortion
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not for or against (safe havens),'' Joyce Johnston, a
spokeswoman for the Child Welfare League of America, told the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ''But we do have some concerns about the
effectiveness of some of these programs, which don't seem to get at
real issues, like prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is movement in 28 states - including Pennsylvania
- for legislation that would grant amnesty to mothers who abandon
newborns in a safe place. Some cities have already started their
own programs, including Pittsburgh, where Mayor Tom Murphy is
expected to unveil his plan Wednesday that will be operated by four
area hospitals. A nonprofit organization is raising money for an ad
campaign to get word of the Pittsburgh program out to those who
might need it.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services survey counted 65
''discarded infants'' in 1991; eight of them died. In 1998, the
most recent year statistics were available, there were 105; 33 of
them died. That doesn't include 31,000 abandoned at hospitals in
1998, and some social workers believe the true numbers are much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''For every baby that's found, think about those (who) were
successfully drowned or buried, lost forever; and there's this
mother you never hear about with that terrible secret she carries
around for the rest of her life,'' said Mary Winter, a director at
Mom's House, a Pittsburgh agency that provides support services for
unwed pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Cmdr. Gwen Elliott, head of the Pittsburgh Police's Sex Assault
and Family Crisis Unit, questioned whether a mother distraught
enough to abandon a child would be sufficiently rational to find a
safe haven instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We once found a newborn in a picnic basket under a porch in
East Liberty, where the mother had placed a bottle and a rattle,''
said Elliott. ''She wanted to do the right thing, but she wasn't
reality-based. The idea of (going) someplace (safe) to drop off her
baby ... I don't think that would have occurred to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott also said if mothers trusted hospitals, they probably
would have sought prenatal care in the first place. She suggested
the money would be better used to encourage counseling for women
with unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, 75 billboards sprouted up around the city to promote
the program, with little success.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to say it's a failure. We don't really know yet,'' said
Judith Hay, a spokeswoman for the program's administrator, Harris
County Child Protective Services.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't really know who these women are. There just isn't any
good data or research on this. What is her state of mind? What kind
of law would prevent her from becoming a criminal?''

<HEADLINE> United they stood at Democratic convention  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - United was the official airline of last
week's Democratic National Convention. It was also the theme of the
New Jersey delegation that traveled here.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli and Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey
exchanged cordial words just weeks after Torricelli tried but
failed to dislodge McGreevey as the presumptive nominee for
governor in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Warring power brokers George Norcross of Camden County and state
Sen. Raymond Lesniak of Union County exchanged an unlikely hug at a
party held by McGreevey.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Bradley paid an emotional visit to his home-state
Democrats and thanked them for their support, even though he
received few endorsements from New Jersey leaders in his
unsuccessful primary challenge to Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the 124-member delegation lavished praise on
their presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Many delegates from ethnically diverse New Jersey were inspired
by Gore's selection of a Jewish running mate, Connecticut Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, and moved by the convention speeches of Lieberman
and his wife Hadassah.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought it would happen in my lifetime. And the
acceptance has been extraordinary,'' said June Fischer of Scotch
Plains, a Jewish delegate who attended her eighth convention. ''For
me to stand and carry a sign that said 'Hadassah' is overwhelming.
I got misty-eyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Simon, the 29-year-old president of New Jersey Young
Democrats, said her peers will be energized at the idea of helping
elect the first Jewish vice president.
</P>
<P>
   She said she noticed ''a lot more young people out here as
delegates than in years before.''
</P>
<P>
   For some New Jersey candidates, the convention offered a chance
at brief national exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin, challenging Rep. Jim Saxton
of Mount Holly, introduced herself to America as a ''mother of two
wonderful daughters .. proud that our party has done so much to
help parents like me who want to find a balance between work and
family.''
</P>
<P>
   First-term Rep. Rush Holt of Pennington, a top target of
Republicans this fall, told the convention that as a scientist, he
understands ''that education and research and development are the
keys to keeping and expanding America's prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate candidate Jon Corzine used his time at the podium to
reject ''irresponsible and unjust tax cuts that would squander''
the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Robert Menendez of Union City, the highest-ranking New
Jersey representative in House leadership, nailed down a prime
speaking spot on Wednesday to help nominate Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike the Republican convention, we Democrats don't need to
masquerade as inclusionary. We live that creed in every way - and
Joe Lieberman is a shining example,'' Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, some moments of discontent.
</P>
<P>
   LaQuetta Nelson, a delegate and president of a New Jersey
gay-rights group, objected that the delegation's breakfast meetings
never mentioned the needs of gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the convention, some members of the Congressional
Black Caucus expressed concerns about Lieberman's position on
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman addressed black leaders on Tuesday and seemed to
win them over.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good that the meeting was held, venting was done,
clarification was given and we can look forward,'' said Rep. Donald
Payne of Newark, a black congressman who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''I think overwhelmingly, almost unanimously in my
opinion, the Congressional Black Caucus will be 100 percent
supportive of the Gore-Lieberman ticket.''.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the final word on the convention came from former
Gov. and perennial comedian Brendan Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, attending his fifth convention, addressed the delegates
on the morning of the final day and lamented that party gatherings
no longer use his favorite song.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, he led the delegates in a chorus of ''Happy Days
Are Here Again.''

<HEADLINE> 16 Killed in Kenya Train Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHI RIVER, Kenya (AP) -- Nine runaway train cars, six carrying
liquefied gas, derailed at a station south of Nairobi, igniting a
fireball that killed 16 people, injured dozens and consumed nearby
houses, witnesses and officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the dead, 13 were railway employees or their family members
who lived in homes inside Athi station's grounds, 15 miles south of
the capital, Kenya Railways said in a statement. The dead were
believed to be sleeping when the train cars derailed and exploded
around midnight Saturday. The three others killed were in the area
from nearby slums, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 36 were injured, some with severe burns, local
hospitals reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''They looked like ashes. Only two could be seen as bodies,''
said Richard Njiru, an ambulance driver who transported some of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   There were some 30 houses around the station, a number of which
had been reduced to charred rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was liquid fire in the air which was dropping like it
was raining fire,'' said Anthony Chira, whose house was damaged in
the accident. ''I thank God for being alive because some people
were burnt beyond recognition. People were running and shouting
with fire on their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Chira, who lives in a railway-owned house within the station's
grounds, 50 yards from where the explosions took place, told The
Associated Press that he was woken around midnight by the ''feel of
heat.'' He then saw fire everywhere and heard explosions ''again
and again.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire gutted two of the three rooms in Chira's home, which he
shares with his wife, three children and a railway employee.
</P>
<P>
   More than 16 hours after the crash, houses and carriages were
still smoldering as firefighters and railway engineers cleaned up
the site. The mangled carriages were spread across six lines of
track, and trees and grass within a 100-yard radius were scorched.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened after the train cars reversed down the
track out of control after being detached from a freight train.
</P>
<P>
   Police and railway officials at the scene said the cars were
detached at a station a few miles from Athi River as the train
headed toward Nairobi from Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
   On reaching Athi station, which is in Athi River, the cars
derailed and exploded on impact, said Kariuki Kimani, the police
officer in charge of Athi River.
</P>
<P>
   ''They call it runaways, maybe something went wrong. We need to
investigate,'' said Esther Otieno, deputy operations director at
the station. Detaching the cars was ''normal'' procedure, Otieno
said.
</P>
<P>
   A railway official at the scene said there had been a problem
with the train's pulling power so the nine rail cars had been
detached to reduce its load.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not expected that the carriages would roll back,'' the
official, who did not want to be named, said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya has seen a series of deadly train derailments in the last
year. Seven passengers died and 38 were injured Wednesday after a
train went off the tracks in western Kenya. Last year, 32 people
were killed when a passenger train derailed on the same line as
Sunday's train.

<HEADLINE> Militants Kill Four in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By BINOO JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMMU, India (AP) -- Militants with assault rifles barged into
the homes of two Hindu families in India's troubled Kashmir state,
killing at least four villagers and critically wounding two, police
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants sprayed bullets on the sleeping villagers
Saturday night in Udhampur district, said Rajesh Kumar, the
superintendent of police.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second attack on Hindu villagers within 48 hours. On
Friday, six Hindus were shot and killed in Kotdhara village after
gunmen knocked on a door and began firing when it opened. Two
neighbors who rushed outside were among those killed. Six people
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Indian authorities blame Muslim militants for the attacks, but
none of Kashmir's separatist militant groups have claimed
responsibility. Nearly a dozen such attacks have left more than 120
civilians dead -- most of them Hindus -- during the past month.
</P>
<P>
   The Himalayan province of Kashmir is divided between India and
Pakistan, both of which claim it in its entirety. Islamic rebels
seeking independence for Kashmir or its unification with Muslim
Pakistan have fought for 11 years, leaving 25,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, the main guerrilla group in Kashmir,
declared a cease-fire last month and said it was ready to talk
peace with the Indian government. But it ended the cease-fire two
weeks later when New Delhi refused to include Pakistan in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   In New Delhi, defense ministry spokesman Pramod Sharan Bhatnagar
said the government had ordered emergency funds to build civilian
bunkers in areas battered by shelling near the cease-fire line with
Pakistan. India and Pakistani forces regularly fire artillery
shells across the mountainous Kashmir frontier.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Pakistan of arming and funding the insurgents in
Kashmir. Pakistan says it provides only moral support to the
guerrillas, not material help.

<HEADLINE> Clinic Offers Hope for Dentaphobics  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BAILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Absolutely nothing gets Johnna Estep's
heart racing, palms sweaty and stomach in knots faster than the
thought of going to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a child, my mom used to have to drag me in, literally
kicking and screaming,'' said Estep, 36, of Versailles. ''I would
get so worked up before I would go that I honestly couldn't
function.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Estep has learned to manage her 'dentaphobia' with
the help of a University of Kentucky professor and dentist who
specializes in treating adults with just such a paralyzing fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't treat teeth; I treat people,'' says Dr. Ted Raybould,
a professor of general dentistry and preventative medicine as well
as director of adult special patient care at the University of
Kentucky Chandler Medical Center. ''In the process, they get their
teeth taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Americans share Estep's phobia, which once kept her
from getting even a routine checkup for nearly five years. During
the past 16 years, Raybould has treated thousands of patients who
would rather be anywhere than tilted back in cold leather chairs
with sharp instruments in their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a true phobia,'' said Raybould. ''Some people are scared
of heights, some people are frightened by snakes or spiders and
some people are terrified of dentists.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Smith, a professor of behavioral science at the school, has
treated and referred hundreds of patients to Raybould over the
years, creating a two-man dental fear clinic at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fear of the dentist is a very common thing,'' said Smith.
''I've done three statewide surveys over the years in Kentucky, and
an average of 19 percent claim they have significant dental fear.
Surveys like this are done all over the country as well and the
results are similar. Neither time nor geography seem to change the
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the fear normally stems from some type of traumatic
event in a patient's life that grows stronger and more intense as
that person grows older.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always amazed at the pain people will endure over a period
of months or even years to avoid seeing a dentist,'' he said.
''Nearly all of the people that I see haven't been to the dentist
for years, even for a routine cleaning or check up. They had a
negative experience early in their lives and, once they were old
enough that mom couldn't make them go, simply quit going because
the dentist was associated with pain and anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what happened to Estep. Often sick as a child,
she developed an intense fear of needles. That and several bad
experiences at the dentist made her loathe even the thought of
getting in the chair.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was about 5, my dentist would slap me on the leg and
one time I even peed in his chair,'' she said. ''He got so angry
and that was it for me. I've never been able to forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ever peeking into patients' mouths, Raybould meets with
them in a non-threatening environment to discuss their fears and
treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to establish a rapport with the patient and gain
their trust or you have no shot,'' he said. ''So I meet with them
the first time and let them know we're not going to do any
treatment that day. Instead, we talk and try to figure out a way to
handle their dentistry in the way they can best tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain management causes the most anxiety, Raybould said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can do drugs by mouth or nitrous oxide,'' he said. ''But to
really foster the most amount of confidence, I'll have to do an
IV-conscious sedation where I can control the level of sleepiness
better than I can with the nitrous or oral drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of my patients are so fearful that we have to take them
to the operating room and use anesthesia to knock them completely
out. I currently have about 200 patients and about 75 of them
choose to go the operating room route, even for routine checkups
and cleanings.''
</P>
<P>
   Estep has been treated by Raybould for the past 15 years. Each
treatment, including a dreaded root canal, was performed while she
was under intravenous sedation.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as he puts the needle into my hand, I start talking to
him and just go to sleep,'' she said. ''When I wake up, it's all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   It took only a handful of visits before Estep felt that trust
and confidence that Raybould says is so important.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was completely at ease with him in no time,'' she said. ''I
learned quickly that when I come here I'm going to be fine, and
that he's going to do everything he can to make the experience as
painless as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One way Raybould gains that trust is to let his patients know
they are in complete control of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell them right off that no matter what -- no matter where I
am in the procedure -- if you can't handle it, get up and walk right
out. I'm not going to force anybody to do anything,'' he said.
''That gives people confidence that they can make things happen --
or not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Raybould knows firsthand what his patients are experiencing. He
had negative episodes with dentists as a boy and, upon choosing
dentistry as a profession, decided he would focus on helping people
overcome some of the same anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it kind of developed naturally because I'm a fear
patient myself,'' he said. ''I was hurt by a dentist as a child and
I really empathize with these people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It also puts me in a position where I can train more residents
to help patients manage their fears. There's not enough of me to go
around, so I need to have other people out there doing what I'm
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Estep, for one, is thrilled with that prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a young woman, I have to keep my appearance up -- that's
very important to me,'' she said. ''I have to keep my teeth. That's
not negotiable. And I'm so thankful that Dr. Raybould has been able
to help me manage a fear that has been with me as long as I can
remember.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't ever say that I look forward to going to the dentist.
But I know that when I come now, it's going to be a breeze.''

<HEADLINE> The Birds: A key to tracking West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELMAR, N.Y. (AP) - Dead birds are piling up at Ward Stone's
door by the van load - a blue jay in a picnic cooler, frozen crows
packed in dry ice, sparrows, hawks and warblers.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are potentially infected with West Nile virus and
Stone, the state's wildlife pathologist, will pluck some out for
examination. Organs of sick-looking birds will then receive a final
diagnosis at a nearby state health lab, where Dr. Laura Kramer and
her staff are already inundated with hundreds of birds and
thousands of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the West Nile virus is watched in New York state.
The disease's alarming spread this summer has been tracked mostly
through dead birds and mosquitoes. It's a huge and exhausting job.
Kramer's researchers work weekends, and her lab is running out of
space for specimen jars. Stone starts at 3 a.m. and works 16-hour
days to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I go five minutes in a day without thinking of
West Nile,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile has become a very public health threat for a second
straight summer, with three elderly Staten Island residents testing
positive for the disease this year. All are recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who contract the disease experience flu-like
symptoms. But the virus is more dangerous in children under 5, the
elderly and people with compromised immune systems. Given that
threat, New York is among the many eastern states on the lookout
for the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Birds and mosquitoes can act like a canary in a coal mine
because certain types of mosquitoes can carry the virus and the
birds contract it. Finding an infected animal in an area tips local
health officials off to the virus' presence. Cities can then decide
whether to roll out insecticide-spraying trucks or to take other
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're an early warning system,'' said Stone.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a lot of warnings this summer, especially with
birds. As of Friday, 240 birds were diagnosed positive statewide.
Most of these birds were crows and most were found in the New York
City metropolitan area. But infected birds are now turning up
around upstate New York, indicating the virus is present statewide.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of state health officials, counties and private
citizens have been shipping dead birds for months to the state
Department of Environmental Conservation's wildlife pathology lab
just south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and his small staff perform triage on the hundreds of
bagged and boxed birds arriving daily. They must decide which birds
to perform a necropsy on - fresh corpses are better than old ones,
crows are better indicators than some other birds.
</P>
<P>
   Stone looks for West Nile symptoms like lesions on the birds'
hearts or enlarged livers and spleens. If he finds symptoms in a
bird, four specimen jars are shipped to the state Health
Department's nearby Griffin Lab - one jar each for a bird's brain,
heart, spleen and kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's staff performs molecular tests on the tissue for a
final diagnosis. From the tight confines of a converted horse
stable, Kramer's arbovirus lab receives about 200 birds a week. On
top of that, tests are done each week on some 600 pools of
mosquitoes shipped in on dry ice from around the state.
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a lot of work. Kramer came out from California in
May to head the lab and has been hustling to keep up since.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really am amazed at the level to which the virus has
spread,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of 17 states, along with the District of
Columbia, that keep surveillance on West Nile in cooperation with
the Centers for Disease Control. The states stretch along the
Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Massachusetts to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts vary among the states.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any other states are handling the quantity or
doing as intense an analysis as New York is,'' said Linda Glaser of
the federal government's Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The work is not expected to let up anytime soon. Kramer said the
virus is increasing. Stone said a let-up might not be in sight
until a little after Labor Day. With luck, disease-carrying
mosquitoes will perish with the first frost.
</P>
<P>
   The would give Stone a chance to get back to pathology work that
was put on a back burner, things like checking contaminated turtles
and diseased ducks. Kramer wants to spend the winter researching
West Nile research, instead of reacting to it.

<HEADLINE> Airman to be buried in Florida, 56 years after WWII bomber crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) - Robert Kearsey left Florida for the slag piles
and steel mills of the Pittsburgh suburb of McKees Rocks, where
many managed to find work despite the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 56 years after he was killed in a World War II bomber crash
in China, Kearsey is going home.
</P>
<P>
   Kearsey and nine others who perished in the crash will be
honored in a burial service at Arlington National Cemetery in
Arlington, Va., on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the airmen will be buried at Arlington after Monday's
ceremony; but Kearsey's remains, and those of three others who died
in the crash, will be or have already been released to their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Kearsey will be buried later in Jacksonville, Fla., where his
family now lives and where a plot has been set aside to memorialize
him and his brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Two farmers found the crash site while searching for rare herbs
on 7,000-foot Kitten Mountain in Guangxi Province in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials have spent the intervening years gathering
and identifying the remains of Kearsey and the others, which were
most recently examined at the Defense Department's forensic
laboratory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Another Pennsylvanian who died in the crash, Staff Sgt. Anthony
DeLucia, was buried earlier this month in his hometown of Bradford,
McKean County.
</P>
<P>
   Kearsey was 27 and single when he died. His nieces and nephews
plan to attend the Arlington service to honor his memory.
</P>
<P>
   They consider him a hero because he requested a dangerous
overseas combat post instead of accepting stateside duty to which
he was originally assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kearsey's younger brother, Grady, followed him to western
Pennsylvania's steel mills, but both were in the service by 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Grady Kearsey was killed that summer when his Army Air Corps
plane was shot down over Germany, though his body was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kearsey was transferred to a base in Langley Va. after
his brother's death, but felt guilty about finishing the war as a
stateside gunnery instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ''His motivation was to get even,'' said Grady Robert Kearsey,
56, a nephew named after both uncles.
</P>
<P>
   The Army fulfilled Robert Kearsey's request to return to active
duty.
</P>
<P>
   A bombing attack on Takao Harbor in Taiwan was his last mission.
The B-24 helped pound Japanese boats and docks, then headed home
but instead crashed into the side of Kitten Mountain on Aug. 31,
1944.
</P>
<P>
   The other airmen on the bomber were identified as 1st Lt. George
H. Pierpont of Salem, Va.; 2nd Lt. Franklin A. Tomenendale of
Shabbona, Ill.; 2nd Lt. Robert L. Deming of Seattle, Wash.; 2nd Lt.
George A. Ward of Jersey City, N.J.; Sgt. Ellsworth V. Kelley of
Newark, Ohio; Pfc. Charles Buckley of Garden City, Kansas; Staff
Sgt. William A. Drager of Washington, N.J.; and Private Vincent J.
Netherwood of Kingston, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> H.Kong Immigration Officer Mourned  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARET WONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Top Chinese officials were among about a
thousand mourners at the funeral of a civil servant who died after
an arson attack at Hong Kong's immigration headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration senior officer Leung Kam-kwong, 42, died two weeks
ago from burns suffered when a group of illegal mainland migrants
set off an explosion at the government office. It was Hong Kong's
most violent episode in a simmering debate over residency rights.
</P>
<P>
   Leung and residency rights seeker Lam Siu-sing, 26, who died on
the same day, were among 50 people injured in the Aug. 2 attack.
Four of the seven people still hospitalized Sunday were in serious
condition, a government spokeswoman said. A total of 21 mainlanders
face charges related to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration from mainland China is the most delicate issue to
confront the island of Hong Kong since it reverted from British to
Chinese sovereignty three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong says it must control immigration to avoid having its
social services overwhelmed by millions of new citizens. But
thousands of mainlanders are in Hong Kong illegally and fighting to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government has battled in court to limit the
number of migrants, at one point last year persuading Beijing to
overrule Hong Kong's top court in a case that had favored migrants
who sought a better life in capitalist Hong Kong. The border with
the mainland is still tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral parlor Sunday, mourners sobbed quietly as two
immigration officers with black bands strapped on their left arms
placed a national flag on Leung's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Mainlanders seeking the right of abode in Hong Kong expressed
sorrow for Leung and frustration over their own future.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was completely innocent. He was there to carry out his duty
only,'' said Wu Hong-kun, a 34-year-old illegal migrant from Fujian
Province.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Plan More Reunions in Sept.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea are likely to
hold a second round of reunions for separated relatives in
mid-September, South Korea's Red Cross chief said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on a KBS-TV program, Chang Chung-shik, president of
South Korea's National Red Cross, said he discussed the issue
during a visit to North Korea last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chang led 100 South Koreans who visited the reclusive, communist
North for four days of temporary reunions with long-lost kin. An
equal number of people from North Korea visited Seoul for reunions
which ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I discussed with North Korean Red Cross officials the
possibility of arranging another reunion for dispersed family
members around Chusok,'' Chang said. Chusok, or thanksgiving day,
falls on Sept. 12 and is a major holiday in both Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 12 meeting with 46 South Korean media executives,
North Korean leader Kim Jong Il promised to arrange more reunions
in September and October.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million North Koreans fled to South Korea before or
during the 1950-53 Korean War, and thousand of South Koreans are
believed to have gone to the North voluntarily or after being
drafted into the North's army. The two Koreas are separated by a
heavily militarized border, and people on one side have been unable
to contact those on the other for almost half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Following last week's successful reunions, Seoul is under public
pressure to expand the program. South Korean officials said
reunions will be a major topic at a second round of high-level
inter-Korea government talks to be held in the North's capital,
Pyongyang, next week.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of talks was held in Seoul late last month, when
the Koreas agreed to reconnect a railway across their border. They
also reopened border liaison offices.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, led by Cabinet-level officials, are a follow-up to an
accord reached at a historic summit of the two sides' leaders in
June. The summit between Kim Jong Il and South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung provided the best chance yet for peace on the divided
Korean peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Northernmost colony of pelicans thrives in Chesapeake Bay  </HEADLINE>
By TOM STUCKEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAR BLOODSWORTH ISLAND, Md. (AP) - Seven young pelicans,
squawking angrily at the human intruders who have invaded their
desolate island, try an end run around Dave Brinker.
</P>
<P>
   Squatting near a chest-high salt marsh elderberry, the
Department of Natural Resources ecologist grabs the biggest bird
and thrusts it between his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grab the ringleader and you've got everything covered,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the six remaining pelicans mill about in noisy
protest, making no real effort to escape, as Brinker and two
helpers attach a metal band to one leg of each bird.
</P>
<P>
   This is Brinker's third and final visit this year to the
northernmost colony of brown pelicans on the Atlantic Coast. Their
home is a small narrow island, maybe a quarter of a mile long, off
the southern tip of Dorchester County near Bloodsworth Island.
Brinker keeps the name of the island secret to protect the birds
from their only potential predators, human beings.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1970s, pelicans were on the federal
endangered species list, as their numbers plummeted because of the
negative effects of the pesticide, DDT. Small concentrations of the
pesticide that were ingested as pelicans fed on fish caused them to
lay eggs with thin shells or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   But with the banning of DDT, they made a remarkable comeback,
filling nesting grounds in the southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Brinker, Roger Stone of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
Chris Crow, an intern with the federal agency, spend about an hour
on this muggy early August morning banding young pelicans who have
not yet learned to fly. Each band contains a telephone number and a
request that anyone finding a banded bird call and provide the
identification number pressed into the lightweight band.
</P>
<P>
   Birds banded by Brinker have been found as far north as New
Jersey and as far south as Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the banding is to find out how long pelicans
live, where they disperse to when they leave the island,'' Brinker
said. ''It helps us make decisions about what kinds of habitat we
protect.''
</P>
<P>
   On this visit, Brinker bands 45 young birds to go with 185
banded on the two previous trips. They are the stragglers in this
year's class, and most other pelicans hatched this year already can
fly and have left their nests.
</P>
<P>
   The only other colony in Maryland is at Smith Island just north
of the boundary with Virginia, where pelicans began to nest in
1987, 11 years before they were first found on the second island a
little farther north. The Smith Island colony is much larger, and
Brinker has banded 1,480 young birds there this year.
</P>
<P>
   As the boat bearing Brinker and his helpers nears the mystery
island, flocks of birds take to the air, circling overhead while
keeping a wary eye on the intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are a mixture of pelicans, double crested cormorants
and three species of gulls. The pelicans, Brinker explains, are the
brownish birds that look like small pterodactyls. Their wings,
which can extend to six feet when fully grown, fold back on their
bodies, allowing them to plunge into the water to catch fish.
</P>
<P>
   On the island, just a few tan eggs remain in rough nests of
large sticks and twigs- about the size of large Thanksgiving turkey
platters - built just off the ground on logs and in low elderberry
bushes, the largest vegetation on the island.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the first nests encountered by Stone, a small purplish
baby pelican is pecking its way out of its shell. The baby bird
probably won't make it, Brinker said. It is so late in the season
that the bird likely will not mature in time to make the journey
south when other birds leave for winter grounds located from North
Carolina south to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A few ''naked birds,'' gray featherless babies that are blind
and helpless, sit in their nests, making little squawking noises
and thrusting their open mouths skyward, waiting for a parent to
feed them small pieces of fish. They are too small to be banded,
and it may be too late for them, too.
</P>
<P>
   The first pelicans begin to leave about the end of August, and
most are gone by the end of October, although a few may stay around
until December if the early winter is mild and fish are available
to feed on.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of summer approaching, most of the juveniles are
almost ready to take to the air. They are now covered with white
and brown feathers and already are larger than the plumpest
chickens grown in Eastern Shore poultry houses.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs take about five weeks to hatch, and young pelicans learn to
fly within eight weeks of hatching.
</P>
<P>
   After about an hour, with all the young pelicans banded,
Brinker's party leaves the island, giving the adults a chance to
return and check on their young.
</P>
<P>
   Brinker said there is no historical record of pelicans ever
existing in large numbers in Maryland. The first sightings were
''in the early 1930s, one here, one there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That changed with the establishment of the colony on Smith
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pelicans are here to stay unless something dramatic happens,''
Brinker said.
</P>
<P>
   And, unless climate changes produce considerably colder winters,
he expects them to move even farther north.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine it just stopping here. What's happening here
makes it almost a certainty they will be in New Jersey within 10
years,'' Brinker said.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Magnate Oppenheimer Dies  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Harry Oppenheimer, the
billionaire South African businessman who led the world's largest
diamond and gold mining companies for a quarter century and spoke
out against apartheid, has died. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer was admitted to the intensive care unit Friday at a
Johannesburg hospital with abdominal pains and a severe headache,
Clifford Elphick, a spokesman for the Oppenheimer family, told the
South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   He died Saturday night. The exact cause of death was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of diamond giant De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.,
Oppenheimer was credited with marketing diamonds as the ultimate
gift of love -- an advertising campaign that culminated with the
famous ''A Diamond is Forever'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer's family was reported to be worth $2.5 billion,
according to Forbes magazine's 1997 list of the world's super rich.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer, arguably South Africa's most respected businessman,
was also a vocal opponent of his country's racist regime that
sanctioned apartheid for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Disagreeable though it may be, we must admit that the racial
policy which has been pursued here over the last 40 years has made
South Africa stink in the nostrils of decent, humane people around
the world,'' Oppenheimer said in a speech in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But Oppenheimer's role as the leading businessman in South
Africa made his position within the racist regime ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   His labor-intensive mines thrived on a migrant labor system that
forced black workers to live apart from their families, and his
companies paid black workers far less than whites.
</P>
<P>
   His economic success was also considered crucial to the survival
of the apartheid government, which ruled until during South
Africa's first all-race elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Oppenheimer was a man of great intellect, huge personal
charm and extraordinary generous philanthropy,'' said Tony Leon,
leader of the opposition Democratic Party. ''He was also first and
foremost a non-racial liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oppenheimer dynasty began in 1917, when Harry Oppenheimer's
father, Ernest, founded the Anglo American Corp., a mining company.
Ernest Oppenheimer took control of De Beers in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing college in England, Harry Oppenheimer became
heavily immersed in his father's businesses and in South African
politics. He was elected as an opposition member of Parliament in
1948, while he was already managing director of Anglo American.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish to acknowledge the contribution Mr. Oppenheimer made
in building the economy of our country, as well as ... creating
employment for hundreds of thousands of South Africans as well as
citizens of our neighboring countries,'' said Nat Serache,
spokesman for the ruling African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his father's death in 1957, Harry Oppenheimer resigned his
parliamentary seat and took command of both Anglo American and De
Beers.
</P>
<P>
   He greatly diversified Anglo American's international holdings
and turned De Beers into a cartel that still controls the vast
majority of the world's diamond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Under Oppenheimer's leadership, De Beers made huge profits, not
only by selling diamonds, but by stockpiling them in times of great
supply to increase their price artificially.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the darkest days of international sanctions against
South African companies, Oppenheimer managed to prosper by using an
inscrutably tangled web of holdings to mask his international
business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer retired in 1982 as Anglo American chairman and in
1984 for De Beers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never dictatorial, his style rather was one of rational
argument and persuasion, and his influence on the course of
politics in South Africa, as well as business, was as remarkable as
it was pervasive,'' said Anglo-American chairman, Julian
Ogilvy-Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer had also served in the ceremonial post of chancellor
of the University of Cape Town, and he was chairman of the Urban
Foundation, an organization to promote black housing and education
formed by local businessmen after racial unrest in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer is survived by his wife, Bridget; his daughter,
Mary; and his son, Nicholas, who is chairman of De Beers and
AngloGold.

<HEADLINE> Russian Church Canonizes Last Czar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Thousands of people crowded into a Moscow
cathedral Sunday to watch as white-robed clerics officially
canonized Russia's last czar, his family and hundreds of other
victims of Soviet repression.
</P>
<P>
   The Archbishops Council, the Russian Orthodox Church's highest
body, decided last week to canonize Nicholas II, his wife and their
five children for the humility with which they faced a Bolshevik
firing squad in 1918. The seven deserved sainthood for their
''meekness during imprisonment and poise and acceptance of their
martyrs' death,'' according to a church statement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people who packed into Christ the Savior Cathedral
for Sunday's service carried icons bearing Nicholas' image. Members
of the Archbishops Council, dressed in embroidered white robes and
miters sparkling with gold and silver, officiated.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, the church also canonized 1,147 other
Russians from the 20th century, many of them priests and monks
killed by the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas was a largely ineffective monarch who only grudgingly
implemented political reforms. He was helpless to stop the
Bolshevik revolution and abdicated as czar on March 15, 1917, as
revolutionary fervor swept Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family were detained. In April 1918 they were sent to
the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, where a firing squad
lined them up in the basement of a palace and shot them on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on canonizing Nicholas II and his family dragged on for
years. Some believers regarded him as a saint and claimed that
icons of the czar have worked miracles, but the church was
concerned that canonizing Nicholas could be seen as an endorsement
of his political actions.
</P>
<P>
   Canonizing the royal family as so-called ''passion bearers'' --
the lowest level of sainthood -- is intended to appease Nicholas'
supporters and avoid controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, which split from the
Moscow-based church in the 1920s, has already made Nicholas II and
his family saints, along with thousands of other Soviet-era
victims. The issue had been a major obstacle to reuniting the two
churches.

<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A bar fight apparently led to the fatal
shooting of an Albany man early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Vraden Branch, 45, was shot multiple times in the chest around
4:52 a.m. and walked several steps before collapsing, police said.
</P>
<P>
   When police responded to the scene, they chased a car that was
speeding away from the shooting. One man got out of the car and
began running with a 9mm handgun. He was caught and is in police
custody, though he has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Branch had argued with several men in a city bar, police said.
The same men allegedly spotted Branch walking, and one got out of
the car and shot him, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Branch was pronounced dead at Albany Medical Center.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Head Wants U.S. Relationship  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- As a child, he would ride north to Texas in a
pickup truck to sell vegetables and buy pigs for the family farm.
Now, as Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox is heading north
again, hoping to sell U.S. and Canadian leaders on his dream of a
unified North America.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from defeating the party that has ruled Mexico since the
Depression, Fox plans to appeal to America's conscience and
pocketbook to help him remedy the most unequal border in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to fire up the Mexican-American community with his
new vision for their homeland, hoping to lure many of them back. At
the same time, he says he wants the United States to ease border
controls and also come up with billions of dollars in development
aid.
</P>
<P>
   The election last month of this tall, tough-talking businessman
in cowboy boots was a political earthquake, ousting a party that
had ruled Mexico since 1929. Now, as he heads north, Mexicans
expect his visit to deliver an emotional charge and freshness
unmatched since Fidel Castro visited Harlem 40 years ago as a young
revolutionary in combat fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day trip, which starts Tuesday, includes rallies in New
York's Spanish Harlem and with Dallas' huge Mexican-American
community, as well as meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. presidential
candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Lorenzo Meyer calls the Jesuit-educated former
Coca-Cola executive ''a populist of the right.'' Fox calls himself
a dreamer -- but a stubborn one.
</P>
<P>
   The dream is to bring Mexico up to par with the United States,
in much the same way the richer European Union nations helped
backward member states like Spain and Greece expand their economies
by abolishing customs and immigration barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants to train Mexicans to legally fill U.S. labor
shortages, rather than have to sneak across the border for low-paid
work. He would move the maquiladoras -- U.S. assembly plants set up
to take advantage of cheap Mexican labor -- away from the border and
into the interior to spread the jobs. And he would appeal to
Mexicans working in the United States to invest some of their
earnings back home.
</P>
<P>
   That, he says, would free up American aid money to be spent on
remedying environmental problems along the border.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would like to see concrete action from Mexico
to crack down on immigrant smugglers and stop the human traffic
before it reaches the border. Fox pledges to clean up corruption
and revamp Mexican law enforcement, and says he is confident that
the northward flow of migrants ''will be reduced pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Fox can meet American expectations remains to be seen.
But he has the advantage of straightforward, workable English, and
close familiarity with American ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been traveling to the United States since I was 5, 10
years old,'' Fox said. ''My father used to send us up to McAllen
(Texas) in a pickup truck to sell vegetables and bring back pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his top foreign policy advisers are leftists like Adolfo
Aguilar Zinser, who help provide cover against criticism that Fox
is too pro-American. Although fears have been voiced about making
undue demands on American largess, Aguilar doesn't hide his believe
that Mexico should be amply rewarded for embracing full-blooded
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''OK, you wanted democracy in Mexico, now you have it. But
democracy has a cost, and it is massive (U.S) investment,'' Aguilar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he won't be sworn in until Dec. 1, Fox has already had
his share of missteps.
</P>
<P>
   First, he tripped over tax-collection issues, the centerpiece of
his program to spur economic growth and keep Mexicans from going
abroad. His advisers suggested charging sales tax on food and
medicine, drawing howls of protest and charges of insensitivity
toward the nation's poor.	   His repeated invitations to the leftist rebels in
the southern
state of Chiapas to restart negotiations went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Then, some militant legislators of Fox's socially conservative
National Action Party voted to outlaw abortions for rape victims,
reviving fears that the Roman Catholic church might use his
administration to reassert its grip on Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexican newspapers found children as young as 14 --
and one only 12 years old -- picking vegetables at his family's
ranch, albeit at a relatively good wage.
</P>
<P>
   Fox acknowledged child labor is illegal but frequent -- ''this is
a reality in Mexico, and it's something we want to change'' -- and
noted that relatives, not he, run the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Poor Mexico,'' goes the well-worn saying, ''so close to the
United States and so far from God.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the kind of myopia I want to correct,'' says Fox. ''All
we need is a little help.''

<HEADLINE> Military Takes On Spread of Racism  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEONARD WOOD, Mo. (AP) -- T.J. Leyden, a hulking man with a
closely shaved head and tattoos covering half his body, struts back
and forth in front of an auditorium packed wall-to-wall with
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The faces staring back at him reflect many races and ethnic
groups, but that doesn't stop Leyden from blurting slurs.
</P>
<P>
   His words-- shocking epithets that cause the crowd to shift
uncomfortably -- identify those he routinely assaulted and ridiculed
as a neo-Nazi in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious of the squirming audience, Leyden goes on, explaining
how he was a leading skinhead recruiter and organizer for 15 years,
and how he did some of his most successful recruiting on U.S.
military bases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked for the young, scared white kids who just wanted a
group to fit in with,'' he says. ''We warned them of a New World
Order and offered them the chance to get aboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of spreading a message of hate, Leyden uses his
unique brand of bluntness to spread a different kind of warning to
the military bases he once targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. military is the best trained group of people in the
world. And that's why the racist groups send their people here -- to
get trained,'' he tells the soldiers at Fort Leonard Wood, an Army
base in central Missouri. ''If you don't think it's happening here,
you need to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Marine is waging a war against the hate groups he
once embraced.
</P>
<P>
   As a full-time consultant for the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Task
Force Against Hate, Leyden travels the country speaking to
thousands of military personnel and law enforcement officials about
his experiences in the white supremacy movement and the recruitment
methods he used.
</P>
<P>
   His stories are shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I joined the Marines, I brought my racism and bigotry
with me. I had a swastika tattoo two inches high on my neck and
hung Nazi flags on my barracks walls. There was no way the Marines
could have denied I was a racist,'' he says. ''Yet, as long as my
commanding officers thought I was a passive Nazi, it was OK with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military is aware of the presence of racism in its
ranks. A 1994 House Armed Services Committee report found that
overt cases of racism and subtle forms of discrimination existed at
some military facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Secretary of the Army created a Task Force
on Extremist Activities after the slaying of a black couple in what
prosecutors said was a skinhead initiation rite in Fayetteville,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Three white soldiers from nearby Fort Bragg were charged in the
case. Follow-up investigations led to the discharge of 19 other
soldiers who allegedly followed some type of skinhead ideology.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has taken several steps since then to flush out
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The task force is gone, but its legacy continues,'' said Maj.
Ryan Yantis of Army public affairs in Washington, D.C. ''The
findings have helped bring heightened awareness at all levels as to
what kind of conduct constitutes extremist behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   New rules require Army personnel to ''reject participation in
extremist organizations and activities.'' Army recruiters can also
reject people who display racist tattoos or have a tendency toward
extremist behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since Fort Bragg, the military is slowly starting to tighten
the noose on hate groups,'' Leyden says. ''Military recruiters are
becoming more intelligent about spotting the quieter racists -- they
sit down in counseling sessions with privates and look for signs of
attitude. They question the white recruits who only approach their
white commanding officers as opposed to the minority officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, groups do slip through the cracks. Nine Marines were
released from a base in San Diego last year because of racist
activity, Leyden says. And the Wiesenthal Center -- which tracks
hate groups -- has noted at least one supremacist Web site geared
toward active-duty military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Leyden says, he has seen white power groups backing off
from full-time active-duty military. Instead, the groups are
pushing their young recruits to join National Guard units.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one weekend a month, and it's a lot easier to hide
their racist sentiments that way,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a Marine, Leyden says, he did most of his recruiting
for the neo-Nazis at bars, inciting racially motivated fights
between Marines and then backing his ''new white buddies'' in the
scuffle. Other groups recruit by sending women into bars to gain
the soldiers' trust, slowly enlisting them for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Leyden used his own Marine training to educate fellow
supremacists back home in skills like camouflage concealment and
close combat training.
</P>
<P>
   Change for Leyden came about four years ago, after watching his
3-year-old son recoil at seeing blacks on television. At first, he
said, he was proud of his son's revulsion.
</P>
<P>
   But a slow, steady transformation changed his mind, he said.
Pressure built from his family including his brother, a police
officer, to leave the group known as ''Hammerskins.'' He also began
to question the teachings of his church, which preached hate.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually decided to quit the neo-Nazi movement and his
marriage to a fellow skinhead.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 34-year-old is a full-time consultant to the
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles where he wages a personal war
against the 457 active hate groups in the United States -- from the
old-fashioned Ku Klux Klan to new and growing supremacist groups in
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Since Leyden started his crusade, three attempts have been made
on his life, he says. Several skinhead Web sites have posted
threats, declaring that he has ''sold out his race.''
</P>
<P>
   The threats fuel his anger, Leyden says, provoking him to do
more to educate others and help strengthen hate crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am always shocked by the number of people I talk to that
don't know diddly about these groups,'' he says. ''There are people
who still think racism doesn't exist.''

<HEADLINE> Pope Ends World Youth Day in Rome  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Pope John Paul II closed his latest World Youth Day
on Sunday with an invitation to the next one, in Toronto in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before we leave this great and beautiful gathering, I want to
announce that the next World Youth Day will be held in Toronto''
two summers from now, John Paul told a crowd of an estimated 2
million young pilgrims at Tor Vergata outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now I invite the young people of the world to set out
for Toronto,'' the pontiff said.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of Canadian officials had an audience with the pope
later in the day. Afterward, they praised the Rome event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll go back energized with lots of experience,'' said the
Rev. Thomas Rosica, who will be the director of Toronto's World
Youth Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian delegation said it would cost about $120 million to
host World Youth Day and that Toronto had ample meeting space for
large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can handle very easily a million and half to 2 million
young people,'' said Mike Harris, the Ontario premier. ''Probably
there will be some temporary requirements, as in Tor Vergata, but
we don't need new massive structures.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, which also included Mayor Mel Lastman, said
Toronto was first advanced as a candidate a few years ago at the
World Youth Day in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hosting Youth Days 2002 in Toronto is a great opportunity and
a real gift to the Canadian church and the town,'' said the
president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Rev.
Gerald Weisner.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul started World Youth Days in 1985 in Rome, drawing
200,000 people. The largest crowd it has drawn was 4 million
pilgrims, in the Philippines in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Part-time residents seeking votes at the shore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A voting-rights struggle has emerged
at the New Jersey shore - with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the debate are using slogans that date back to the
Revolutionary War. But while most such debates have involved
marginalized members of society, it is the largely affluent owners
of second homes at the shore who are demanding a say in the towns
where they pay property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a classic example of taxation without
representation,'' Philadelphia resident Marvin Levin, who also owns
a home in Ventnor, told The Press of Atlantic City for Sunday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and many year-round residents of shore towns
oppose changing voting rights in New Jersey, saying that would
violate the principle of ''one person, one vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have a vote in the community where they reside,'' said
Brigantine Mayor Phil Guenther.
</P>
<P>
   Guenther also said certain year-round services, such as
education, could be shortchanged if people who do not send their
children to local schools nonetheless vote on budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who live here year-round have more of a stake and
should have more of a say than those that live here for two or
three months at a time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite elements of class conflict, the argument comes down to
whether voting rights are based on residency or property ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Several states, including Connecticut and Tennessee, allow local
governments to decide whether to grant voting rights to nonresident
property owners. Residents of resort towns in New York, Michigan
and Massachusetts have asked for similar laws in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Assemblyman Gerald Zecker, who represents parts of
Essex and Passaic counties, has introduced a resolution proposing
an amendment to New Jersey's constitution to permit nonresident
property owners to vote in local elections.
</P>
<P>
   Brigantine resident Tina Chaplin, who supports the resolution,
said summer residents' inability to vote increases the contrast
between them and full-time residents. Chaplin used to spend only
her summers in the resort town and the rest of the year in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ''A person who lives on a park bench can have a vote, but a
businessperson who works hard and lives in the community cannot?''
she asked. ''That just doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill went nowhere in the state Senate, where it was opposed
by Republican Sen. Bill Gormley, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, who represents Atlantic County, said allowing
nonresidents to vote runs counter to the America's basic democratic
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what this country was based on,'' he said. ''It's just
such a fundamental part of what our society is about, I'd never
vote to change that.''

<HEADLINE> Stolen Hall of Fame memorabilia resurfacing in catalogues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - Federal investigators are tracing the
trails of six baseballs signed by U.S. presidents, photos, and
other items worth millions that were stolen from the Baseball Hall
of Fame more than 25 years ago before resurfacing in catalogs, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Four baseballs signed by presidents have been recovered, but the
FBI is looking into who took them during a time when security there
was more relaxed than officials say it is today, according to The
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly the collection of Walter ''Big Train'' Johnson, who was
inducted in 1939, the balls were stolen in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall quietly filed a police report.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt it was better at the time to say nothing to publicize
this,'' said Howard Talbot, Hall of Fame director from 1976 and
1993. ''We hoped they would resurface and we'd get them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Hank Thomas, Johnson's grandson, went to
Cooperstown expecting to find his grandfather's treasures. When the
collection was missing, Thomas was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   He said his family should have been contacted about the missing
collection and wanted to know why there seemed to be no effort to
recover the stolen balls.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the most frustrating thing of all,'' Thomas said.
''They just gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the only theft in Cooperstown's history.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1980s, when the value of baseball memorabilia
inflated, the Hall of Fame may have been an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the heist of the balls, worth millions today, a
Joe DiMaggio cap was stolen from a display locker. Hall of Fame
officials put another one there, wiring it to lockers. But wire
cutters were used to remove the second cap.
</P>
<P>
   When officials put plexiglass over the display lockers, people
pulled pieces of jersey through air vents and cut away scraps.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, photos and World Series programs were commonly
found at memorabilia shows sporting the Hall of Fame stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas himself saw a baseball signed by President Warren Harding
in a catalog. When Thomas demanded an investigation, it was
returned to the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The surfacing of items attracted attention from federal
investigators, who are now working with Hall of Fame officials and
professional baseball, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if the balls we sold were the ones that were
stolen,'' said Bill Mastro, founder of Mastronet Inc., which had
been advertising presidential baseballs. ''None of our balls had
the Hall of Fame markings.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastro said last year, the FBI asked for a list of presidential
ball-buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''But none of my buyers have told me the FBI took their item,''
he said. ''We would have given them their money back.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame said no one was available to comment on the
story Sunday.

<HEADLINE> NYPD story: From cigar-puffing volunteers to today's 40,000-strong force </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Even Davy Crockett found New York City
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I would rather risque myself in an Indian fight than
venture among these creatures after night,'' the legendary
frontiersman wrote after an 1835 visit.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers of the day agreed and clamored for safe streets. So
a night watch of moonlighting citizens began to patrol the city
and, in 1845, the first official police force was formed.
</P>
<P>
   The rich history of how the police grew from a ragtag bunch of
cigar-smoking men with no weapons to today's 40,000-strong force is
told in a book published this month, ''NYPD: A City And Its
Police.''
</P>
<P>
   Authors Thomas Reppetto and James Lardner have taken a broad
view they hope will give citizens - and officers - a true picture
of the nation's largest police force.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, too much attention has been paid to the repeated
charges of police corruption, said Lardner, a former Washington,
D.C., policeman and now a senior writer for U.S. News &AMP; World
Report.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you only see the corruption, you miss so much of the
history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 368-page book touches on the scandals but also offers little
known details - from the tidbit on Davy Crockett to the career of
William Bratton, the innovative police commissioner of the
mid-1990s known for his high-tech tactics against crime.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main characters are: the Presbyterian minister who
instigated the first efforts to reform the department; the first
black officer on the force; an Italian-American cop who made a
fatal, top-secret mission to Italy; two forgotten detectives with
an uncanny ability to catch crooks; and the commissioner deemed the
most effective by the authors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The book aimed to bring these characters to life,'' said
Reppetto, president of the city's Citizen Crime Commission and a
former Chicago police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The book, with its long view of history, does not concentrate on
the incidents that set off racial tension in recent years: the
police torture of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, and the police
killings of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo and
Haitian-American Patrick Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of let our history come to an end with Bratton,''
Lardner said. The Louima, Diallo and Dorismond cases happened under
Bratton's successor, Howard Safir, who is leaving the department
after four years.
</P>
<P>
   Readers learn how the Rev. Charles Parkhurst was ridiculed for
blaming the police for ''making New York a very hotbed of knavery,
debauchery, and bestiality.'' Determined to prove himself right,
Parkhurst went undercover in 1892 and exposed houses of ill-repute
rife with gambling and nude women.
</P>
<P>
   It was the NYPD's first - but certainly not last - big scandal.
Indeed, the book outlines a saga of scandal and reform that has
rocked the city at 20-year intervals since. It also covers a wide
range of tragedies and triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909, one of the force's first Italian-American cops was sent
on a secret mission to Italy to investigate the Mafia. A
publicity-seeking police commissioner blabbed the details to the
press, blowing Lt. Joseph Petrosino's cover and leading to his
murder on the streets of Palermo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, Sam Battle became New York's first black policeman. He
was ignored by white colleagues but became a tourist attraction as
hansom cab drivers took fares past his beat near Central Park to
see him.
</P>
<P>
   A chapter called ''The Great Detective'' tells how Thomas Byrnes
organized the detective bureau into a real crimefighting squad in
the late 1800s, instituting the practice of photographing and
keeping files on criminals and allowing his men to branch off into
specialties, such as homicide.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter on ''Celebrity Cops,'' Detective Johnny Cordes from
the 1920s is shown as a character Hollywood would love today. Since
he hated to carry a gun, he often had to disarm suspects before
arresting them. He once managed to disarm two burglars after being
shot - then was shot twice more by a drunken sergeant who stumbled
on the scene. He survived and returned to duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cordes certainly seemed to have had a kind of cult of admirers
inside the force because people were just bowled over by his
doggedness,'' Lardner said.
</P>
<P>
   While Byrnes and Cordes were famous in their day, Lewis
Valentine toiled in anonymity as a ''shoofly,'' police slang in the
early 1900s for an internal affairs cop. Valentine was taunted for
years by fellow officers until Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia - admiring
his pursuit of bad cops - appointed him commissioner in 1934. He
went on to serve 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took over the force just as prohibition ended, when the
force was thoroughly corrupt,'' Reppetto said. ''He managed to end
a lot of the corruption so probably of all of them, he was the most
effective commissioner in the NYPD.''
</P>
<P>
   Among modern-day commissioners, Bratton is given an entire
chapter focusing on his introducing new concepts such as COMPSTAT,
a computerized tracking of crime statistics credited for helping
bring down crime rates to new lows.
</P>
<P>
   Reppetto said the little space given to Howard Safir's term was
not meant as a slight. Safir ''never quite got the credit for
keeping the crime reductions going,'' he said. ''He tried to move
toward the community with his CPR (courtesy, professionalism,
respect) program, but everytime something happened - Louima, then
Diallo, then Dorismond.''
</P>
<P>
   The book ends with an observation by Zachary Carter, a former
federal prosecutor who told a symposium on race relations: ''The
relationship between the police and inner-city residents is a love
affair waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reppetto and Lardner said Carter, a black man, is right.
Reppetto added that police in the past had difficulties with newly
arrived minorities - such as Irish and Italians - who eventually
became strong supporters of the police as their own members joined
the force.
</P>

   ''I suspect that will be the story in the early 21st century,
that the minority community will come to strongly support the

will happen.''

<HEADLINE> Athletes Unfazed by Malaysia Threat  </HEADLINE>
By ALVIN UNG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEMPORNA, Malaysia (AP) -- Shrugging off the threat of
kidnapping, hundreds of athletes began a 12-day wilderness race
Sunday near the tropical island where an Islamic rebel group
snatched foreign tourists in April.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the executive producer of the hit CBS show
''Survivor,'' the Eco-Challenge 2000 opened amid the fears of local
people that the Philippine rebels, emboldened by massive ransom
payments, could return to take new hostages.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Burnett, the former British paratrooper who founded the
Eco-Challenge seven years ago, said organizers had been assured by
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad that security would be
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've received full support from the Malaysian military and
state police, and assurances from the highest level of the
government,'' Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   The 76 teams -- made up of triathletes and endurance runners from
the United States, New Zealand, Finland and two dozen other
countries -- began the Eco-Challenge 2000 race Sunday by paddling in
canoes toward Sipadan Island, where a group of tourists was
kidnapped in April. A helicopter circled overhead while policemen
armed with M-16 rifles patrolled the shore of Semporna, the coastal
town close to Sipadan.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny, coral-fringed Sipadan was regarded as a nirvana by diving
aficionados until Abu Sayyaf rebels from the Philippines seized 21
foreign tourists and resort workers at gunpoint and took them to
Jolo, a Philippine island an hour away by boat.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who seek an independent Islamic state in the
southern Philippines, later grabbed three French journalists and 12
Filipino Christian evangelists who came to their remote jungle
camp. Some hostages have been released for ransom, but the rebels
still hold 24 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf had been expected to release the remaining
hostages Saturday, but negotiations failed.
</P>
<P>
   Eco-Challenge organizers say they never considered canceling the
event, even after learning that the hundreds of islands dotting the
vast Sulu and Celebes Seas are a hide-out for pirates and Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
   What attracted Burnett to the region for both ''Survivor'' --
filmed on Pulau Tiga, another small Malaysian island -- and the
Eco-Challenge was the romance and danger associated with Borneo,
the huge island divided between Indonesia and Malaysia that
dominates the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Borneo -- the very name itself -- is a great brand,'' Burnett
enthused. ''People from all over have now heard of Borneo, a
mystical place, with great legends of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The press kit for Eco-Challenge plays this up, saying the race
course runs over ''ancient headhunting trails.''
</P>
<P>
   The race involves about 300 athletes and more than 700 support
staff and volunteers, plus two dozen camera crews. USA Network, an
Eco-Challenge partner, will broadcast four hours of edited footage
in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 continuous days, the four-person teams -- one includes
three Playboy centerfolds -- will hike, climb, sail, rappel, cave
and even scuba dive to an underwater coral reef checkpoint. Each
team paid $12,500 to compete.

<HEADLINE> Former Spy To Return to Britain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALAIS, France (AP) -- Former British spy David Shayler said
Sunday that he has decided to risk arrest and return home to
Britain after nearly three years in France as a means of proving he
did ''nothing wrong'' in leaking information about British
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference in the French port town of Calais, Shayler
repeated his allegations that British foreign intelligence officers
were involved in a plot to assassinate Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi -- a claim the government denies.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler, who worked for Britain's domestic espionage agency MI5
from 1994 until 1997, expected to sail to Dover with his family and
girlfriend Monday after three years in France, where he fled after
selling stories to a British newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that I've come back should send a very strong signal
to people that I have nothing to fear,'' Shayler said. ''I have
done nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old former agent spent four months in Paris' La
Sante prison in 1998 before French authorities refused to extradite
him to Britain for trial under the Official Secrets Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate civil suit filed last December by the British
government, Shayler is accused of breach of copyright and breach of
contract for releasing secret documents.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler said he believed he would be charged and then freed on
bail upon his return to Britain. Despite the risk of arrest on
arrival, he said he is determined to go home to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did what I did because I love my country,'' he said. ''I'm
not a traitor to it. ... What I did was free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Shayler's lawyer, John Wadham, said his client had always hoped
for ''a proper investigation'' of his allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why he produced the information in the first place,''
Wadham said.
</P>
<P>
   Shayler claimed the Metropolitan Police Service was
investigating his allegations on the Gadhafi plot.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to face a trial in Britain, and said he hoped to use
European human rights laws to challenge any charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   The former spy said he spent three difficult years in France
trying to raise money to return home.
</P>
<P>
   During his time here, he wrote a novel, ''The Organisation,'' a
fiction story he has described as ''a gritty thriller about spies,
sex and football.'' This summer, British government censors
screened the book without making changes.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Wants Improved Ties With U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- The United States and Sudan could resolve
their differences with serious talks, Sudan's Foreign Ministry said
Sunday on the second anniversary of a U.S. military strike on a
Khartoum factory.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, which Washington considers a sponsor of terrorism, also
called for U.S. flexibility in its attitude and policies toward
Sudan, and made an apparent plea to end economic and trade
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''A serious dialogue with the United States is the best means
for solving points of difference between the two sides, which is in
the interest of both our people,'' the ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. officials said there was nothing new in the
statement, but that relations between the two governments cannot
get better without improvements in Sudan's human rights record. A
major obstacle is Sudan's failure to surrender suspects in a 1995
assassination attempt against President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, as
demanded in a U.N. Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Sudanese relations sank to new lows with the Aug. 20, 1998,
U.S. attack on a pharmaceutical plant suspected of producing
chemical weapons agents. President Clinton ordered the attack,
which killed one person and wounded nine, in retaliation for U.S.
embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also claimed El Shifa factory, owned by
Saudi-Sudanese businessman Salah Idris, was linked to the United
States' most-wanted terrorist suspect, Osama bin Laden. The
Sudanese government and Idris have denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, which remains under U.S. economic and trade sanctions, is
a poor country also suffering from the effects of famine and a
17-year civil war, making the sanctions more onerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sudan calls on the United States to resort to the voice of
wisdom and to back off from stiffened positions and respond to the
desire of the world community in lifting the injustice done to and
the damages inflicted on our country,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some signs of improvement in the Sudan-U.S.
relationship. Last year, Washington appointed Harry Johnston as a
U.S. envoy to Sudan. An American diplomat also has returned to work
at the embassy in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has been pushing hard to repair its international image
since late last year, when President Omar el-Bashir began to
sideline Hassan Turabi, an Islamic ideologue and politician once
viewed by many as the true power in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Lopez's 'Cell' Proves Top Seller  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A dark journey into a murderer's mind and a
lively jaunt with four comedians led a slow weekend at theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cell,'' a glossy thriller starring Jennifer Lopez as a
psychologist who ventures into a serial killer's head, debuted as
the top film with $17.2 million, according to studio estimates
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee's documentary-style ''The Original Kings of Comedy,''
capturing a hit comic tour both on stage and backstage, opened at
No. 2 with $11.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's favorite monster had a modest return to theaters as
''Godzilla 2000'' opened at No. 11 with $4.6 million. The movie is
a lower-budget Japanese film, not a sequel to the Hollywood version
from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While ''The Cell'' and ''The Original Kings of Comedy'' did a
bit better than studios had forecast, the late-summer doldrums
continued for Hollywood overall. The top 12 movies grossed an
estimated $88.7 million, off 35.5 percent from the same weekend
last year, when ''The Sixth Sense'' continued to rule the box
office.
</P>
<P>
   With just two weekends left, summer 2000 likely will come in
about $200 million below last year's record $3 billion in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a foregone conclusion that the summer record is not going
to be broken,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor
Relations, which tracks movie attendance. ''Last year was an
anomaly and impossible to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cell'' co-stars Vincent D'Onofrio as the serial killer and
Vince Vaughn as an FBI agent pursuing him. Directed by Tarsem
Singh, a commercial and music-video veteran, ''The Cell'' features
striking images to represent the killer's twisted mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Visually, it's a stunning picture, and it's wildly
inventive,'' said David Tuckerman, head of distribution for New
Line, which released ''The Cell.'' ''And Jennifer Lopez is a star.
It's those three ingredients that did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in just 847 cinemas, ''The Original Kings of Comedy''
posted an impressive $13,813 per-theater average, compared with
$7,134 at 2,411 locations for ''The Cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee shot two performances in Charlotte, N.C., of the comedy tour
starring Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and
Bernie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Such concert films normally are niche releases, but distributor
Paramount decided to open it more widely after it proved a hit with
test audiences, said Wayne Lewellen, head of distribution. The
weekend crowds were about 80 percent black, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though ''Godzilla 2000'' finished out of the top 10, it was a
cheap release for distributor Sony, which probably will turn a
small profit once it plays out in theaters and on video.
</P>
<P>
   The studio's cost to acquire U.S. rights, re-edit the movie and
dub it into English are estimated at less than $1 million. Sony
spent a modest $10 million to $12 million on prints and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ''Godzilla 2000'' is expected to gross $15 million to $20
million in theaters, said Ed Russell, Sony executive president for
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''The Cell,'' $17.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Original Kings of Comedy,'' $11.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Space Cowboys,'' $9.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''The Replacements,'' $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''What Lies Beneath,'' $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,'' $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Hollow Man,'' $6.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''Autumn in New York,'' $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Coyote Ugly,'' $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Bless the Child,'' $4.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Group Picks Female Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An outlawed Muslim movement that advocates
the imposition of strict Islamic law in Egypt has for the first
time named a woman to run in parliamentary elections, a group
leader said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim Brotherhood movement also expressed readiness to
accept Coptic Christians as candidates in the November election of
the People's Assembly, said Ali Abdel-Fattah.
</P>
<P>
   ''Islam does not prejudice men against women, and our nomination
of a woman to run in the election is a practical application of the
fact that women are half of the society,'' Abdel-Fattah told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike militant groups such as al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or Islamic
Group, and the Jihad, the Brotherhood rejects violence as a means
to impose strict Islamic law in the country. But the Egyptian
government maintains that the Brotherhood has links with these
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim Brotherhood was banned in 1954 after an alleged
attempt on the life of late Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel-Nasser. The
government of President Hosni Mubarak has tolerated the movement
with occasional campaigns of arrests, the last in 1995 when police
detained 270 members before parliamentary elections. Twenty
Brotherhood members are now on trial before a military court.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its outlaw status, the 72-year-old Brotherhood has an
organized hierarchy and a political platform that includes pledges
to end government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel-Fattah said the female candidate, Jihan Abdel-Latif
el-Hafnawi, will be among some 80 candidates the party is planning
to name for the 455-seat parliament. Each will run on an individual
basis and not on party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hafnawi, 48, is a university graduate who is engaged in
social causes. She is the wife of Ibrahim el-Zaafarani, another
Brotherhood leader and secretary-general of the doctor's syndicate
in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria. He spent three years in
jail after the 1995 crackdown, Abdel-Fattah said.
</P>
<P>
   Abel-Fattah said the Brotherhood movement will cooperate with
other opposition parties and even with the candidates of the ruling
National Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will open our hearts for anyone, man or woman, from the
opposition, the government and the Copts on the basis of each one's
role in serving the country,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Salutes Best-Loved Saint  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX BANDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Hungarians marked a millennium of
statehood and Christianity on Sunday with fireworks, parades and
the canonization of their beloved King Stephen, whose rule began
1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever, the Eastern Orthodox Church canonized a
saint of the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's festivities began with an air show over the Danube with
parachuters dropping into the cool waters, much to the envy of
thousands of onlookers jamming the bridges and embankment in the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Military parades, air acrobatics and costume balls were held
across the country. The capital was planning for an enormous street
dance and gala fireworks display, accompanied by music composed
especially for the event by Robert Erdesz.
</P>
<P>
   Each year Hungarians mark St. Stephen's Day, to honor King
Stephen, who ruled Hungary from 1000 to 1038. The king is credited
with bringing Christianity to the country's barbaric tribes and was
elevated to sainthood by the Roman Catholic Church in 1686.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eastern Orthodox Church which split from Rome in 1054,
did not recognize King Stephen as a saint, as it did not recognize
anyone canonized by Rome.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of more than 25,000 people gathered outside Budapest's
Basilica, where a Mass was celebrated by an emissary of Pope John
Paul II, Cardinal Angelo Sodano.
</P>
<P>
   ''St. Stephen left not only the crown he had received from Pope
Sylvester II to his people, but also his spiritual legacy,'' the
pope said in a message to the Hungarian people, delivered by
Sodano.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mass, Patriarch Bartholomeos I of Constantinople,
head of the Eastern Orthodox Church, read a statement recognizing
King Stephen as a saint of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He then
presented it to Hungary's Cardinal Primate Laszlo Paskai.
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch also canonized Bishop Hierotheos of the Carpathian
Basin, a contemporary of Stephen's and called for the revival of
the Orthodox Church in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 60 percent of Hungary's 10 million people are Catholic,
while fewer than 1 percent are Eastern Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier statement to the state Hungarian news agency,
Sodano welcomed the canonization of St. Stephen by the Eastern
Orthodox Church, saying the move may mean a return to unity of the
two Churches, despite the painful differences of the past
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, the festivities continued with a religious
procession in which the king's right hand, called the Holy Right,
was taken from its usual display in the Basilica to the House of
Parliament, where St. Stephen's crown is on permanent display.
</P>
<P>
   Another relic, a part of St. Stephen's skull, is now on display
in the Basilica. It's on loan from a Dominican monastery in
Dubrovnik, Croatia, where it has been since 1590, when it was
hidden for safekeeping from Tartars or Turks who invaded the
region.

<HEADLINE> Russian Navy Faces Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Lacking its own expert deep-sea divers, the
Russian navy had to wait for days for foreign divers to arrive at
the sunken nuclear submarine Kursk, and Russian divers discharged
by the navy for lack of funds say their own offers to help were
rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The navy's failure to get divers to the scene in the early days
of the crisis has sparked wide criticism. Officials initially said
the weather was too bad for divers, but that claim was questioned
by many experts.
</P>
<P>
   After saying for days that foreign aid wasn't needed, Russia
finally requested British and Norwegian rescue crews. Russian
officials began describing Norwegian divers as the last chance to
save any of 118 crewmen of the Kursk, which sank in the Barents Sea
on Aug. 12 after a devastating explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Until Norwegian divers began rescue efforts on Sunday, the navy
spent days trying to reach the Kursk with rescue capsules that are
essentially mini-submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Facing angry questions about the Navy's failure to get Russian
or foreign divers to the scene earlier, Vice Adm. Nikolai Konorev
gave little explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a painful question to answer,'' he told reporters. ''We
had deep confidence that we would be able to do the work with
rescue capsules.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure has brought rebukes from former divers.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Filchenkov, a former navy diver with 15 years experience,
was quoted in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda on Saturday as
saying that he called the Navy to offer his help just as first
reports about the disaster appeared, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days he helplessly listened to reports
describing the numerous vain attempts by the Russian rescue craft
to latch on to the Kursk submarine lying at a depth of 350 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''In stormy seas, you can't get a rescue craft connected with a
hatch without a diver helping it,'' Filchenkov was quoted as
saying. As a result, he said, futile attempts by Russian rescue
capsules to dock with the Kursk ''were only driving their exhausted
crews to the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Filchenkov said he and other former divers were eager to rush to
the disaster site, but it was unclear whether the Navy still had
the pressurized suits and other gear necessary to carry out the
work. Specialized ships on which deep divers were based have been
mothballed years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet navy had two schools for training deep divers, and
deep diving units existed in each of Russia's four fleets until the
mid-1990s, when the navy disbanded them because of a shortage of
funds, according to former naval officials and media reports.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Vyrelkin, who formerly headed a Northern Fleet
deep-diving unit, said it would have taken his men less than one
day to reach the Kursk during Soviet times. Vyrelkin said divers
would have been able to evacuate survivors quickly using diving
bells pressurized from the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there is not a single specialized ship in the Northern
Fleet now, and the people manning rescue capsules have never
carried out a real-life exercise on docking to a submarine,''
Vyrelkin said, according to Komsomolskaya Pravda. ''And there isn't
a single deep water diver available.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the rescue capsules have even failed to
adequately film the submarine surface, despite official assurances
that it was thoroughly examined. When a Norwegian robot camera
surveyed the submarine's exit hatch, officials extolled the footage
as major news.

<HEADLINE> Newark Airport monorail to close for repairs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Just over four years after it opened, the
monorail at Newark International Airport is closing for massive
repairs that are expected to last into the winter months.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Labor Day, the 30,000 people who take the six- to
eight-minute monorail daily will return to buses for the time being
- rides that could take 30 to 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing cracks and corrosion on the tracks caused by cold weather
will cost the contractors who built the monorail $25 million, but
some who were involved in the original construction say the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey is partly to blame.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sunday's editions of The Record of Hackensack, the
Port Authority, the bistate agency that runs the airport and
oversaw the contract, failed to foresee major problems, despite the
failure of a test ride six weeks before the monorail opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bulk of the responsibility has to lie with the Port
Authority,'' said Roy Pleasant, a former Port Authority official
who was brought in to oversee the project years after construction
had begun.
</P>
<P>
   ''The design was inherently weak, but its demise was hastened by
the materials used, and the method of construction was flawed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency admitted that it made a mistake in choosing a
monorail design that had never been used at an airport or in cold
weather, and needed upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Lombardi, the Port Authority's chief engineer,
defended the choice of monorail, conceding only that the design
should have undergone more testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''You needed a system that would make that shuttle run as easily
as possible,'' he said. ''Given the constraints we have with the
way the terminals are laid out, this is the best system we can
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi said the contractors ''are totally responsible'' for
the damages requiring the massive repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The system cost $354 million to purchase, design and build and
took five years to finish. It was supposed to last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rail was built, passengers at the Newark airport rode
buses to move among terminals, parking lots and rental car
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of carriers wanted to bring foreign flights to Newark
but couldn't because passenger movement time, from customs to
domestic gates, was so unpredictable,'' Pleasant said. ''They could
not guarantee making connections because buses took 45 minutes.''

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Rocks Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Two moderate earthquakes rocked central
Taiwan on Sunday, seismologists said. No injuries or damages were
immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The first, a magnitude 4 temblor, struck at 9:46 a.m. Its
epicenter was 1.3 miles southwest of Chiayi city, which is about
110 miles south of the capital, Taipei, the Central Weather Bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was followed by a 4.4-magnitude quake at 2:59 p.m. Its
epicenter was 8.5 miles southeast of Taoyuan city, which is about
125 miles south of Taipei, seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is often hit by tremors because it sits atop two tectonic
plates, which are huge, moving slabs of the Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of minor tremors and aftershocks have rattled Taiwan
since a 7.6-magnitude quake devastated parts of central Taiwan in
September, killing about 2,400 people and destroying thousands of
homes.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Vote for Parliament Deputy  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- The Russian government conducted elections
Sunday for a Chechnya deputy to the Russian parliament, but the
balloting was criticized by human rights groups and faced wide
skepticism among voters in the war-ravaged republic.
</P>
<P>
   The voting was run by the Russian military, which entered
Chechnya last September, and no outside election observers were
present. Results were expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of Chechnya's eligible voters cast ballots,
election officials said. But many Chechens said they would not vote
and there was little information available about the 13 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Grozny didn't even know the election was going
on, while others said they were indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't vote because I do not know the candidates,''
28-year-old Adam Beroyev said. ''Anyway, Moscow will appoint the
person it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been fears of rebel attacks to disrupt the voting, but
the capital, Grozny, was reported quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Some 23,000 Russian soldiers permanently based in Chechnya -- 5
percent of the registered voters -- voted earlier, officials said.
Chechen refugees living at a camp in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia also cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya in defeat at the end of a
1994-96 war, then moved back in last September in a bid to end the
republic's de facto independence and quash what the Kremlin called
a breeding ground for terrorists. Elections for the lower house of
parliament were held in the rest of Russia in December, when
fighting in Chechnya made it impossible to hold a local election.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups claimed the election here would be a farce
because parts of Chechnya are still in rebel hands and most areas
controlled by Russian forces aren't safe. Russian troops were on
high alert in the republic Sunday, and civilian movement was
severely restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics also criticized having Russian soldiers vote. They said
the election would only sacrifice lives because rebels promised to
step up attacks to discourage Chechens from electing a deputy to
the lower house, or State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin-appointed civilian leader of Chechnya, Mufti Akhmad
Kadyrov, said the election would finally make Chechnya a legitimate
part of Russia after years of war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chechnya will now return to its legal place in Russian
political life,'' Kadyrov said, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, rebels attacked a polling station, killing one
Russian serviceman and wounding three, military officials said. An
Interior Ministry lieutenant was injured in a separate attack on a
polling station overnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Four other servicemen were wounded overnight in grenade attacks
in villages, Russian news reports said.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Rocks Eastern Turkey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A moderate earthquake rattled eastern
Turkey early Sunday, sending panicked residents jumping from
balconies and out windows. At least nine people were reported
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude-4 quake hit the city of Erzurum just after
midnight Sunday, the Anatolia news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   No serious damage was reported in Erzurum, 560 miles east of
Ankara. But a soldier was critically wounded when he threw himself
out of the second floor of a military barracks in a panic, reports
said. One woman suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of the quake was about 20 miles southwest of the
city, just along the Palandoken fault. Two aftershocks followed,
Erzurum's Ataturk University observatory said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's entire eastern region sits on an earthquake-prone belt.
A magnitude-6.8 earthquake ravaged Erzurum and its environs in
1983, killing more than 1,300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Two strong quakes killed some 18,000 people in Turkey's
northwest last year.

<HEADLINE> FAA data shows despite Burlington crash, airways are not more crowded </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The collision of two small planes above a
tract of suburban homes in Burlington Township two weeks ago has
caused concern that New Jersey skies are becoming dangerously
crowded.
</P>
<P>
   However, federal registrations of small aircraft in New Jersey
and neighboring states show the number of these planes has not
increased in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, aircraft counts provided to The Associated Press by the
Federal Aviation Administration's registration office in Oklahoma
City show that since 1995, the number of small planes of various
types based in the state has declined slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Oklahoma City register and assign numbers to all
noncommercial aircraft classified under the heading ''general
aviation'' - privately owned planes and corporate aircraft,
including small jets.
</P>
<P>
   Their data shows that in July, 4,636 planes were registered to
New Jersey owners, corporate and private. That is a drop of 2.3
percent from 1995, when 4,745 planes were registered. In the same
period of time, New Jersey added 300,000 cars and trucks to its
roads, for a current total of about 5.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a perception that when you say that the two airplanes
came together in the sky, that automatically means that the skies
are too crowded,'' said Emmitt O'Hare, director of the
Transportation Department's office that monitors aviation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a tractor trailer driving down the road hits a house, then
people say there are too many tractor trailers on that road,''
O'Hare said. He said the Burlington collision that killed 11
''could have just as easily happened over the Pinelands, or over
Arizona. It was a great tragedy, and it was very, very unfortunate,
but it does not mean there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While the FAA has exclusive jurisdiction over general aviation
since the planes cross between states so easily, O'Hare's state
agency reviews applications for airfield expansion. The state has
49 airports, and all but a handful are rural fields used
exclusively for general aviation.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's aircraft trend holds true for its neighbors, where
aircraft can readily cross into the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, aircraft registration has decreased 3.6
percent in Pennsylvania and 2.5 percent in New York. It held steady
in Maryland. New Jersey and its three largest neighbors combined
had 26,218 aircraft registered in July, down 2.3 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is Delaware, where aircraft registrations leaped
60 percent, from 6,100 in 1995 to 9,700 last month. Officials
attribute this to the state's popularity as a corporate
headquarters location because of its low business taxes, making it
likely the majority of those aircraft never cross or touch down in
that state.
</P>
<P>
   The trend in New Jersey and its neighbors is not typical.
Nationally, general aviation is up, with 178,310 planes registered
in July, an increase of about 10 percent from 1995. But by 1999
that rate of growth had slowed to less than one percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Those who monitor general aviation look at other statistics to
draw a picture of what is going on. For instance, while the number
of aircraft increased only 10 percent nationally since 1995, flight
time increased 14 percent and fuel consumption increased 54
percent. Such figures were not readily available by state.
</P>
<P>
   These flight and fuel trends show more of the larger,
twin-engine aircraft are in use for business purposes, planes that
despite the Aug. 9 tragedy in Burlington County are considered the
safest of general aviation in part because they usually have
professional pilots.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare said his office is not responsible for investigating the
Aug. 9 crash, and neither for that matter is the FAA, although the
agency is tasked with monitoring overall aviation safety. The
National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the
collision.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Burlington crash, U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., an influential lawmaker in aviation issues, has called upon
the FAA to examine whether unregulated travel should be permitted
to continue for small aircraft over New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the FAA figures showing no increase in the number of
aircraft, the senator's office issued a statement Friday saying he
still wanted the question studied.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it's more people flying due to our strong economy, or
more flights per day coming in and out of New Jersey, I want to
make sure that the FAA's safety measures can keep pace with the
amount of air traffic,'' Lautenberg's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Hare said state officials do not take lightly
requests to expand airfields, which they do regulate. Organized
protests have met the proposal to expand the South Jersey Regional
Airport in Lumberton, just a few miles from the Aug. 9 crash,
though neither plane involved came from there.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare said the environmental impact airfield owners are
required to assess includes the noise increase air traffic will
produce.

<HEADLINE> Middlesex court workers break occupancy law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - Nine judges and their staffs
unwittingly broke the law when - for the past two weeks - they
illegally occupied the Middlesex County Family Court building.
</P>
<P>
   City inspectors denied the new building a certificate of
occupancy for various safety reasons. But the judges and 150
courthouse workers were told they could move into the building Aug.
7.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of a county employees union said they learned of the
lack of certificate after workers complained that the air
conditioning in the building had failed and an interpreter became
trapped in one of the courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you administer justice when you're in a building
that's breaking the law,'' Jeff Demos, a shop steward for
Communications Workers of America Local 1034, told The Star-Ledger
of Newark for Sunday's editions. ''It impacts upon the integrity of
the (judicial) system.''
</P>
<P>
   The construction company, Keating Building Corp., has taken
responsibility for the mistake, saying it happened because company
officials believed they would have the certificate in time.
</P>
<P>
   Project manager Bruce Auerbach said the safety of courthouse
employees was never an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the safety systems were in place, fully operating the
fully tested by the city, prior to the move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach said the company received a temporary certificate on
Friday, after showing that the air conditioning was working
properly.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said Keating was being fined the maximum of $500
a week until the building's problems are corrected.

<HEADLINE> Two Sides To Tense Hebron Story  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Husam Jabari, a vegetable vendor in
Hebron, says the trouble started when Jewish settlers marched in
and overturned market stalls.
</P>
<P>
   David Wilder, a Jewish settler, says it began when fruits and
vegetables flew out of the market, aimed at Jewish worshippers
returning home for a quiet Sabbath meal.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever version of Saturday's clash you hear, both sides draw
the same conclusion: A recent escalation in violence in this
troubled West Bank town is attributable to last month's Camp David
summit -- and Hebron, a sensitive flashpoint, has the potential to
pose a real obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient town, home to 130,000 Palestinians, is known for its
religious fervor. Hamas, the militant Islamic group that rejects
Israel's existence, does well in elections here.
</P>
<P>
   But Hebron is also home to 400 Jews who see themselves as
guardians of Judaism's second-holiest city, the site of the tomb of
biblical patriarchs worshipped by Jews, Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Jews here are among the hardest-line of the Jewish settlers
living in the heavily Palestinian West Bank. Parties that advocate
emptying Israel and the West Bank of Arabs do well here and in the
neighboring settlement of Kiryat Arba.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want us to be here,'' David Wilder said of the
Arabs. Minutes earlier, Husam Jabari said of the Jews: ''They don't
want us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Such feelings are not new. Relations reached their nadir in
1993-94, the year when a series of Jews were killed and Baruch
Goldstein, a Jewish Kiryat Arba doctor, gunned down 29 Muslim
worshippers in a mosque. That act nearly scuttled nascent peace
talks, and a repeat could undermine efforts to convene another
Mideast summit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a truce of sorts has been maintained since 1997, when
Israel handed much of Hebron to Palestinian control. Israel still
administers the quarter in the center of the city where the Jews
and about 30,000 Arabs live.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to deteriorate on July 15, when Shlomit Arnon -- the
14-year-old daughter of Noam Arnon, the Jewish community's leader --
claimed she was sexually assaulted by an Arab during a stroll. She
told police her screams drove off her attacker.
</P>
<P>
   That led settlers to attack Arab passers-by and rampage through
the market, a warren of covered stalls that spills into the
glistening paved stones of the Jewish enclave. Israeli troops
separated the sides.
</P>
<P>
   That incident occurred during Camp David, when news first leaked
that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was ready to make
far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians. Palestinians said
settler fears of further concessions led to the riots -- a bid, they
say, to scuttle the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''When something happens in the United States, they take it out
on us here,'' Jabari said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder, who helps administer the Hebron Jewish community, also
blamed Camp David -- for encouraging the Arabs around him to believe
they can attack with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been told by the Arabs that they expect our expulsion as
a result of Camp David,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern has repeated itself at least three times since then.
On Saturday, the spark was a traffic incident. A Palestinian cabbie
hit a 13-year-old Jewish boy, injuring his leg; the cabbie fled the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Jabari said Palestinian vendors in the market started packing up
their stalls as soon as they heard of the hit-and-run, knowing that
stall-overturning was inevitable. He wasn't quick enough with his:
He said he lost about $625 in the subsequent attack, biting into
his monthly profits of $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Arabs starting the provocations made no sense,
Jabari said -- they had everything to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like a government is running things here, it's like
the mob,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder did not deny the overturned stalls, but he said it was
the culmination of a day of frustrations, including stoning
incidents. The last straw was when the Arabs taunted settlers by
tossing tomatoes and fruit at them, Wilder said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Jabari's why-disrupt -life argument, he said the
settlers couldn't be at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one would start this just as the Sabbath lunch is
beginning,'' Wilder said of his religious community. ''On the
Sabbath, I want to eat and sleep and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder said it was hard for settlers to accept that what would
be considered a simple hit-and-run -- or sexual assault -- elsewhere
is not part of an organized effort to intimidate Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a limit to how long people can sit and say 'Maybe he
didn't mean it,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side appears ready to trust the other anytime soon. On
Sunday, the Hebron Jews held a memorial service for 67 Jews
massacred by Arabs in 1929 riots -- an act that led survivors to
flee the town, ending hundreds of years of a continuous Jewish
presence. Jewish settlers returned after the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   ''They lived a pious life, in friendship with their Arab
neighbors,'' Noam Arnon eulogized at the cemetery, which overlooks
Hebron's cluttered tumble of ancient and modern dwellings. ''Then
they were slaughtered.''

<HEADLINE> Nursing shortage causes some families to step in for patient care  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey nursing organizations and unions
say years of staffing cutbacks are catching up with hospitals in
the form of a nursing shortage. The shortage is apparent to some
patients' relatives, who say they have had to step in to help busy
nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ''When my son was in the hospital, I always stayed with him, and
pretty much everyone I know does, too,'' Sharon Kroll, of
Annandale, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions.
The Hunterdon County woman's 6-year-old son, who has a seizure
disorder, has been hospitalized five times, mostly at Robert Wood
Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not due to lack of caring,'' Kroll said. ''It's just that
the nurses are so busy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 months, the state Department of Health and Senior
Services has cited 9 hospitals so far this year for failing to keep
enough nurses on their floors, said Marilyn Dahl, who oversees
enforcement for the department. That's more than the number of
facilities cited in all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The fine amounts have increased, prompting the New Jersey
Hospital Association to argue recently that a nursing shortage is
making it difficult for hospitals to fill jobs, especially in areas
where specialized nursing skills are required.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would rather use that money to recruit nurses than to pay
fines,'' said Geri Moon, vice president of hospital operations for
the association.
</P>
<P>
   But union representatives say hospitals created the problem in
the mid-1990s, when many nursing schools were closed and hospitals
cut tuition programs that helped nursing aides become more skilled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hospitals can't now say, 'Where did all the nurses go?' They
cut nurses,'' said Jeanne Otersen, a spokeswoman for the Health
Professional and Allied Employees, a nurses union. ''Nurses are
leaving the business.''
</P>
<P>
   A May survey by the New Jersey Hospital Association reported the
average nurse-to-patient ratio at most hospitals for general care
floors is 1-to-6 during day and 1-to-7 or 8 patients at night.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nurses Association has said many of its members
report taking care of 10 or 12 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I look down the hall and see three, even four call
lights on,'' said Jean Cunningham, a nurse for 23 years at Pascack
Valley Hospital in Westwood, Bergen County. ''You think, where do
you go first?''
</P>
<P>
   Nurses said in many cases, families are staying with
hospitalized relatives. Some change bandages, feed and dress
patients to help them to the restroom. Others have hired private
nursing aides to sit bedside with elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people won't leave their parents in the hospitals by
themselves; they stay overnight,'' said Helen Litvak, who chairs a
support group in Livingston for women with aging parents. ''In our
group, people feel the nurses may not be able to answer the call
bell.''
</P>
<P>
   But nurses say families can't do the job of nurses. Nurses are
better able to assess how a patient is doing, said Stephanie
Orrico, a nurse at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center since
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Several hospitals have tried to attract nurses by making hours
flexible for working mothers. Others are considering hiring nurses
from overseas or are offering sign-on bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite financial difficulties hospitals face, they must
continue to improve working conditions to keep qualified nurses and
attract new ones, said Irma Lupia, a lobbyist for the New Jersey
Nurses Association.
</P>
<P>
   Lupia said nurses have left hospitals to work at insurance
companies, schools and doctors' offices. Some have left nursing
entirely to sell real estate or start businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to work hard to get those nurses back in hospitals,''
Lupia said.

<HEADLINE> Protests Against Turkish Prisons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish police detained about 40
relatives of prisoners Sunday during a second consecutive day of
protests against plans to break up the country's large prison
wards, the Anatolia news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the protests were not available. Istanbul police
detained a total of 80 relatives over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tension is running high in prisons, where the government plans
to move inmates from large dormitories to cells that hold one to
three people.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners call the smaller cells ''coffins.'' Human rights
groups and families of inmates say the cells would leave prisoners
more vulnerable to prison guard abuse, something rights groups say
is common in Turkish prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, inmates live in wards of up to 100
prisoners and officials claim political inmates run their wards
like indoctrination centers. Authorities say about 10,000 of
Turkey's 74,500 inmates are linked to leftist, Kurdish or radical
Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the new system is aimed at ending the inmates'
virtual control of overcrowded and understaffed prisons, which are
often rocked by hostage-takings and hunger strikes.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Search for AWOL American  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli police said Sunday they are searching
for a U.S. Army Reserve officer in military intelligence who went
AWOL from his base in San Antonio, Texas, and is believed to be in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli authorities are cooperating fully with U.S. attempts to
locate Lt. Col. Jeremiah Mattysse, who failed to report to duty
Aug. 8 after a vacation, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry
Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Until February, Mattysse, who had converted to Judaism,
commanded the Army Reserve Intelligence Support Center at Camp
Bullis in San Antonio, as a full-time reserve officer. The unit's
primary mission was to train reservists in intelligence work.
</P>
<P>
   But in March his wife filed for divorce and accused him of an
extramarital affair, and the army reassigned him while it
investigated the claim.
</P>
<P>
   A San Antonio rabbi who knew Mattysse said he was upset by the
divorce case and the claims of an affair, which he denied. ''He was
distressed because it seemed his career was ruined because of all
of this,'' Rabbi Chaim Block told the San Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, a woman named Rivka Artzi-Nir told newspapers and
television that she was Mattysse's girlfriend and that he had
become devoted to helping Israel since he converted to Judaism 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Block said Mattysse had told him a woman was claiming to be his
lover, but ''he said he had never as much as touched her and she
latched onto him,'' Block said. He did not specify if Artzi-Nir was
the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hanley, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Reserve Command in
Atlanta, said that because of Mattysse's intelligence background,
his disappearance ''is of heightened concern.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't give details of the inquiry, but said it would be
logical for an investigation to include ensuring that nothing was
missing from offices where Mattysse, 49, previously worked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously when somebody disappears like that, particularly in
the case of an individual with a sensitive background -- he is
military intelligence -- we would want to take normal and prudent
steps to make sure military intelligence is intact,'' Hanley said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Should Mattysse return voluntarily, which he could do by turning
himself over to the embassy in Israel, and should he be convicted
of the charges in a court martial, punishment might be less severe,
Hanley said.
</P>
<P>
   A charge of absent without leave usually carries penalties of
separation from the military, loss of benefits and two or three
years of incarceration, based on whether the AWOL individual
returns voluntarily or has to be apprehended, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The military also would take into consideration causes for the
desertion during a court martial.
</P>
<P>
   Mattysse had been reassigned to the 90th Reserve Support Group
in San Antonio during the investigations into the alleged affair.

<HEADLINE> Gore leads Bush by 10 points in NJ  </HEADLINE>
The Associated Press:
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democratic National Convention boosted Vice President Al
Gore to a lead of 10 percentage points over Republican George W.
Bush in New Jersey, according to the latest Gannett New Jersey
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the poll, released Sunday, show Gore leading the
Texas governor 44 percent to 34 percent. A similar poll taken just
after the Republican National Convention two weeks ago showed Bush
leading Gore by 9 points.
</P>
<P>
   Before the conventions, the candidates were running about even
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Among those whose votes are undecided is Alice Bass of
Lavallette, who said she is a registered Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm waiting for a debate,'' she said. ''I want to see how they
handle themselves when they both have to answer the same
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Results released Sunday of a national poll by CNN-USA
Today-Gallup had Democrat Gore at 47 percent, Republican Bush at 46
percent, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader at 3 percent and Reform
Party candidate Pat Buchanan at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed in the New Jersey poll said Gore deserved
credit for choosing as his running mate Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the
first Jewish candidate for that office. But 51 percent thought the
choice wouldn't affect the campaign either positively or
negatively. Twenty-five percent thought the choice of Lieberman
would help Gore, and 17 percent thought it would hurt his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey poll indicated that New Jersey Senate candidate
Jon Corzine did not fare as well as the vice president. Corzine's
lead over Republican Bob Franks was 2 points, one point down from
the 3-point lead he held after the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 429 people who were registered and identified as
likely voters were interviewed for the poll. The margin of error is
plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three percent of New Jersey voters say Gore should not
be linked with the sex scandals of the Clinton administration,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   But 56 percent also said he played just a little part in the
administration's achievements, compared with 30 percent who said he
played a big part in those achievements and 5 percent who said he
played no part in them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people are funny,'' said Robin Collier of
Sayreville. ''Many people will try to link him to the sex scandal,
and they shouldn't. He had no part in it. But Republicans are
trying awfully hard to make the link. And they don't want to give
him credit for the economic policies, but he deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the news that another grand jury had been impaneled
to investigate the president in connection with the Monica Lewinsky
matter, 68 percent said they thought the matter should be over, and
24 percent agreed with the decision to continue the inquiry. The
rest were undecided.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Gov. Race May Affect Peace  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE DEL RIO, Mexico (AP) -- There are no polling places for
Sunday's election in this tiny village on the muddy road to La
Realidad.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest voting is a couple of hours away by foot. Most say
they won't bother.
</P>
<P>
   But even if many don't vote from this village near La Realidad --
the unofficial capital of the Zapatista rebels -- backers of the
rebels will have much to do with whether the new governor elected
in the Chiapas state elections succeeds. These are the first
elections held since the party that ruled Mexico for 71 years was
toppled in the July 2 presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   The still-unresolved Zapatista revolt looms over Chiapas
politics. The past six years have seen four governors, three of
them emergency replacements for men driven from office by crises
linked to the Zapatista revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sami David of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party and Pablo Salazar of an eight-party coalition claim they
would be most effective at helping end a struggle that got the
world's attention on Jan. 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, the Zapatista National Revolutionary Army staged a
rebellion to demand greater justice and democracy for Chiapas' poor
Indians. Though open warfare lasted only two weeks, the guerrilla
presence in the state's jungle canyons has led to repeated clashes
between emboldened dissident groups and pro-government forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's voting, electoral officials and observers had
reported only scattered problems by midday. Businessmen in jackets
lined up to vote alongside barefoot Indian women toting infants in
brightly embroidered shawls as the polls opened near the cathedral
in San Cristobal de las Casas.
</P>
<P>
   For some, voting was an act of courage.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of a 1997 massacre of 45 people in the village of
Acteal marched for four hours through the mountains to vote in Los
Chorros, the town that had expelled them and home to many of their
paramilitary attackers.
</P>
<P>
   State officials failed to install polling places for absentee
voters near the towns where the refugees are sheltered.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest fear the people have in coming to the polls is
suffering an attack by the paramilitaries along the way,'' said
Agustin Vasquez Ruiz, spokesman for the Las Abejas group of
refugees from the Los Chorros area.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 polling places were scattered throughout Mexico's
poorest and most rural state, one where disputes over land,
religion and Indian rights have often erupted into violence. It is
a tough place to govern.
</P>
<P>
   In 176 years, the state has had more than 160 governors --
despite Mexico's practice of six-year terms over the past six
decades.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose del Rio is only 105 miles from the state capital,
Tuxtla Gutierrez, but a hard six-hour's drive, some on tracks
unpassable to most cars. The unofficial Zapatista capital of La
Realidad is an hour by dirt road to the east.
</P>
<P>
   The impoverished coffee farmers in this Lacandon Jungle canyon
describe themselves as rebel ''sympathizers,'' but they show the
discipline of Zapatista stalwarts. While friendly, few will talk
politics. None will give his name, saying they are forbidden to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   All say they are ''neutral'' in the election, echoing Zapatista
communiques. And they express a studied lack of enthusiasm for
either candidate.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian man with bare feet and ragged pants who denounces
capitalist exploitation says there will be no interference with the
election, ''so they cannot say it is the fault of the EZLN,'' the
rebel movement's Spanish initials.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about President-elect Vicente Fox's promise to meet key
Zapatista demands and renew peace talks, the man replies: ''We
still do not know if he will comply.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When they are in their positions of power, they forget about
the Indians,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after Fox ended 71 years of rule by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, Salazar holds a strong lead in most polls over
David, despite the fact Chiapas has been a PRI stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has sent some of its top national campaigners to aid
David -- who has a reputation as a PRI reformist -- hoping to halt a
national crisis of party confidence caused by its first
presidential loss.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar is a former PRI senator who quit the party last year,
arguing that it should move faster to solve the Zapatista revolt
and accusing the state government of backing paramilitary groups to
battle the Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   As senator, he was a member of a commission that negotiated a
partial peace deal with the Zapatistas rejected by the federal
government. He says his election would be a key element in bringing
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not friends'' with the Zapatistas, he said in a recent
interview. ''I know them from the negotiations. I am not a
Zapatista. But they have a great advantage with me: I am not
anti-Zapatista.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to give the Zapatistas ''the dignified out they
have been fighting for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> May, Woods Share Lead at PGA  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Bob May, hardly a household name, was
holding his own with the biggest name in golf.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Californian, who started the day a shot behind
Tiger Woods at the PGA Championship, led by as many as two shots
early Sunday but was tied with Woods midway through the final round
at Valhalla Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Woods began his round at 13 under, with May and Scott Dunlap at
12 under. Woods lost a three-shot lead midway through the third
round when he double-bogeyed the 12th and had a bogey at the 15th.
A two-putt birdie on the closing hole gave him sole possession of
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, seeking his third major title of the year, continued to
have difficulty in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   After a huge drive on the 1st hole, he hit his second shot to 8
feet but missed the downhill birdie putt. At the par-5 2nd hole, he
hit another big drive but his 4-iron second shot sailed into the
rough right of the green. His downhill chip rolled past the pin and
into the fringe. From there, he chipped 4 feet past the hole -- and
missed the putt for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   His playing partner took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   May, who has never won a PGA Tour event, saw his second shot at
the 2nd hole land in the gaping bunker on the left side of the
green, but he blasted out to 3 feet and hit the birdie putt. The
two-shot swing put him a stroke ahead of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   May found the deep rough off the tee on the par-4 4th. But his
iron shot landed softly on the green and gently rolled over a ridge
to within 2&AMP;frac12; feet of the cup. The birdie that followed gave him a
two-shot advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Both May and Woods bogeyed the 6th. May hit over the green and
failed to get up and down, while Woods three-putted from 45 feet
after finding the deep rough off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Woods started his comeback after hitting into the no-man's-land
between the two fairways at the par-5 7th. He recovered with a shot
into the right fairway, then chipped to 6 inches for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   At the 166-yard 8th hole, Woods knocked his iron shot to 10 feet
and made the birdie putt to pull even with May at 13 under.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Langham, a Georgian making his first appearance in any
major championship, was alone in third place at 12 under.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Olazabal, who set the course record and tied the
Grand Slam tournament low with a 63 in the third round, was at 11
under, along with Denmark's Thomas Bjorn, Stuart Appleby, Greg
Chalmers and Dunlap.

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Orlando Predators won the ArenaBowl for
the second time in three years Sunday, beating the Nashville Kats
41-38 on David Cool's 19-yard field goal as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Connell Maynor threw for four touchdowns and Cool redeemed
himself with the game-winning kick after missing two extra points
and three field goals to help Nashville stay in the game after a
slow start.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando, appearing in its third straight Arena Football League
title game under coach Jay Gruden, built a 29-7 lead before the
Kats scored 23 consecutive points to go ahead 30-29 early in the
third quarter.

   The Predators regained the lead on Cool's 38-yard field goal,
but the kicker missed the extra point after Orlando (14-3) scored
again to take a 38-30 lead with 12:23 remaining. Nashville set up
the dramatic finish with a touchdown and 2-point conversion with
just over five minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   Maynor, voted the game's MVP, was 17-of-28 for 202 yards,
including 4-of-6 for 34 yards on the game-winning 35-yard drive.
The Predators ran the ball four straight plays before calling a
timeout with 1.7 seconds left to give Cool his opportunity to
become the first player to decide an ArenaBowl on the final snap.
</P>
<P>
   The kicker, who earlier missed on attempts of 52, 57 and 22
yards, set off a wild celebration among the crowd of 15,989. He was
mobbed by teammates, music blared and confetti dropped from the
ceiling of the TD Waterhouse Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kelly threw for 180 yards and four touchdowns before
leaving with a sprained left ankle early in the fourth quarter. He
was replaced by James Brown, who threw a 45-yard TD pass to Darryl
Hammond before tying the game with a 2-point conversion throw to
Cory Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL title was the sixth for Gruden as a player and coach. He
won four ArenaBowls as the quarterback for the Tampa Bay Storm, and
his two championships as a coach ties him for second-place on the
career list with Danny White.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators beat Tampa Bay in the ArenaBowl two years ago, but
lost the 1999 game to Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville (12-6) was 8-1 on the road before Sunday, but hurt its
chances for a third straight playoff upset by allowing a safety and
losing two fumbles while Orlando was building its 22-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly rallied the Kats with TD passes of 1 yards to Fleming and
5 yards to Hammond in the final 39 seconds of the first half to
trim the Predators' lead to 29-23. He also threw scoring passes of
33 yards to Jeff Russell and 28 yards to James Baron, the later
giving Nashville its shortlived 30-29 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who was 13-of-24, was injured with 11:06 remaining when
he was sacked from behind by Orlando's Rich McKenzie. Brown threw
an interception two plays later, but bounced back with his TD pass
to Hammond and finished 1-of-3 for 45 yards.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Henry Blanco doubled in the go-ahead run in the
ninth inning as the Milwaukee Brewers snapped the Houston Astros'
six-game winning streak with a 6-5 win Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hayes singled with one out in the ninth off Wayne
Franklin, who was relieved by Jose Cabrera (2-3). Rafael Belliard
followed with a grounder between first and second. The ball hit
Hayes, who was ruled out on the play, and Belliard reached on a
single.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco then doubled to right center to score Belliard with the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic (4-3) pitched two hitless innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit his 38th homer and ninth in the past 10 games
for Houston. Richard Hidalgo added his 31st homer, a solo shot in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins tied his career high with four hits for Milwaukee.
He had an RBI double in the third and a run-scoring single in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 4-2 in the seventh, Houston scored three runs to take
the lead. Hidalgo and Moises Alou each singled and advanced to
second and third on a sacrifice. Tony Eusebio's two-run single to
left center tied the game and he scored the go-ahead run on Chris
Truby's double.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Loretta's RBI single off Marc Valdes in the eighth inning
tied it at 5 for Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's solo homer off Paul Rigdon in the fourth inning gave
Houston a 2-1 lead and extended his hitting streak to a career-high
tying 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes' sacrifice fly tied the game at 2 in the fifth, and an
error by second baseman Bill Spiers allowed Jenkins to score the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta singled to right in the eighth inning to drive in Blanco
to tie the game again at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jenkins was momentarily stunned in a collision with 3B
Truby while running the bases in the third inning. After several
minutes to collect himself, he stayed in the game ... Tony Eusebio
stretched his career-high hitting streak to 19 games, longest
active streak in the majors ... Jeff Bagwell has become the only
the fourth player in major league history to have 300 home runs,
1,000 runs scored and 1,000 RBI. The other three were Joe DiMaggio,
Frank Robinson and Ted Williams.

<HEADLINE> Kerik tours precincts, tastes ethnic NYC on first day  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Newly minted Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik
spent his first day in office on Sunday meeting cops in precinct
houses and visiting a Baptist church in Brooklyn, where he asked
the black congregation to ''give me a chance'' in the demanding
job.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Joseph Dunne, who was named
first deputy commissioner after losing out to Kerik for the top
post, Kerik promised to ''reach out to the community'' and try to
forge a new degree of mutual respect between the 41,000-member
department and the city's minorities.
</P>
<P>
   A decorated former narcotics detective and longtime friend of
Giuliani who has won praise for jail reforms as the city's
commissioner of corrections, Kerick was named by the mayor on
Saturday to succeed Howard Safir, who resigned to take a post in
private business.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the pulpit at the small Greater Bright Light
Missionary Baptist Church in East New York, Kerik described himself
as a ''hands on'' executive and asked the several dozen worshippers
to tell other people that ''I'm going to work with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want you to tell them one thing - 'give him a chance,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, seeking to reassure listeners that he would not tolerate
police misconduct while reducing crime, cited a sweeping reduction
in jailhouse violence during his tenure as corrrections chief as
evidence of his ability and strategic approach.
</P>
<P>
   He said stabbings and slashings had been reduced from 120-130 to
only four or five a month, and incidents leading to someone being
hospitalized with injuries were down by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did it by talking and interacting and using equipment we
never had before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerick also showed little patience with police department
critics who had attacked his appointment almost as soon as Giuliani
announced it. ''They don't even know me. They have nothing to do
with me. They have never interacted with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said earlier that Kerik should focus first on
issues of police brutality, and Rev. Al Sharpton faulted Giuliani
for failing to consult with community leaders before picking a
chief cop.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also scoffed at the critics of Kerik's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't win with some people,'' he said. ''We're doing
everything we can to reach out. There are people who make their
reputations, and their money, criticizing the police department.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, Dunne and Giuliani sat in a front row with City Council
member Priscilla Wooten, a deaconess in the church, and gathered
with other worshippers at the altar as the pastor, Rev. H. DeVore
Chapman, segued from his fire-and-brimstone sermon into a
hand-clapping hymn.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that John the Baptist sought to preach in ''lifting
language'' to his audiences, Chapman said, ''We've got to change
the rhetoric - we need some lifting language,'' he said. ''We're
looking for somebody we can talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   The new commissioner began the day by attending roll call at the
33rd precinct in Washington Heights, near his Riverdale home, then
visited other precincts in Brooklyn on the way to East New York.
Later, he, Giuliani and Dunne marched in Brooklyn's Puerto Rican
parade in Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Another organization frequently critical of Giuliani's policies
announced a 30-day ''moratorium'' to allow Kerik time to become
familiar with his new post and the department's issues.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Eric Adams, founder and president of One Hundred Blacks
in Law Enforcement, said he would ask Kerik to meet and ''start a
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good faith measure,'' Adams said in a telephone
interview. ''We want to express our desire to work with the new
police commissioner on improving relations in communities of color
and share some of our initiatives.''

<HEADLINE> Whitey Ford Honored by Yankees  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A half-century ago, Whitey Ford made one of the
more forgettable debuts in Yankees history. On Sunday, he was
praised for all he accomplished in pinstripes after that first
game.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by fellow Hall of Famers Yogi Berra and Phil Rizzuto
and showered with gifts that included a new car, a mini-van and
trips to the Bahamas and Hawaii, the great left-hander was honored
on Whitey Ford Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't been this nervous since I pitched against Ted
Williams for the first time,'' Ford told the big crowd before New
York played Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   It was on July 1, 1950, that Ford -- who had joined the Yankees
system three years earlier -- faced the Boston Red Sox in his debut
at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Working in relief, Ford gave up five runs on seven hits and six
walks in 4 2-3 innings. Relatively unknown at the time, he was
referred to as ''Eddye'' Ford in local newspaper accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Charles Ford went on to set team records for wins (236),
strikeouts (1,956), ERA (2.54), innings (3,170 1-3) and shutouts
(45). He excelled in October, winning six championship rings as he
set the World Series record with 10 victories and broke Babe Ruth's
mark by pitching 33 2-3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never knew Ruth was a good pitcher. I thought he was a lousy
pitcher that became a hitter,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   After his first season with the Yankees -- he won the clinching
Game 4 of the 1950 World Series sweep against Philadelphia -- Ford
served two years in the U.S. Army. He returned to pitch from
1953-67, earning the nickname the ''Chairman of the Board.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been a Yankee for 53 years and I'll be a Yankee
forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, looking dapper at 71 with his white hair, has overcome two
bouts with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He had surgery in December 1994 to remove a cancerous tumor
behind one ear, and was diagnosed last November with a form of skin
cancer. By all accounts, he's doing fine these days.
</P>
<P>
   Ford already had a plaque in Monument Park in left-center field,
and his No. 16 was painted onto the field for the day along the
first- and third-base lines. Former teammates Luis Arroyo, Hank
Bauer and Moose Skowron joined Berra and Rizzuto for the half-hour
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to love to play ball behind him,'' said Bauer, an
outfielder. ''He didn't walk anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-time All-Star was 236-106 overall. His .690 winning
percentage is the highest ever for pitchers with at least 200 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Ford recalled attending his first Yankees game when he was 9
years old and watching Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio. He said he sat
in the center-field bleachers that day, and drew a cheer when he
waved at that area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Little did I know that 12 years later I'd be on that mound,''
he said. ''It's been 50 years since I first stepped on this field
and it's still a thrill every time I come back.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the celebration, a montage of Ford's highlights was
shown on the video board, including a tribute from the late Mickey
Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was presented with several gifts, among them a 2001 Dodge
Stratus R-T Coupe and a 2000 Ford Winstar mini-van.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and his wife, Joan, also received the round-trip airplane
tickets, a 36-inch television, a watch, a set of golf clubs,
re-creations of his six World Series rings and a statuette
commemorating his military service.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a baseball field in New York was renamed ''Whitey
Ford Field.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's son and daughter took part in the festivities. Always
known for his composure while pitching, Ford appeared to get choked
up only once, when he remembered his son, Tommy, who died last year
of a heart attack shortly before Old-Timers Day.
</P>
<P>
   In Tommy's name, a $25,000 donation was made to the Whitey Ford
Children's Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Ford went to the mound and threw out the first
ball. Before making the toss, he spoke a few seconds to Yankees
starter David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   It was on Yogi Berra Day -- July 18, 1999 -- that Cone pitched a
perfect game against Montreal at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him to go out there and do something close to that
today,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone did his best, striking out the side in the first inning and
retiring the first nine batters. He was pulled after six innings
with a 3-0 lead, and the Angels rallied to beat the Yankees 5-4.

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Arrington a Non-Starter  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Even though LaVar Arrington is finally
showing some big-play ability for the Washington Redskins, coach
Norv Turner makes it sound increasingly likely the No. 2 overall
draft pick will not be in the starting lineup on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington forced a fumble, recovered a fumble and had three
tackles, including a jarring hit on running back Rahshon Spikes for
a 3-yard loss, in Saturday night's 24-0 exhibition victory at
Cleveland. Arrington also got to the play with the first-string
unit for the first time, replacing Greg Jones in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington also showed some flashes of someone who could dominate
a game, a vast improvement from the tentative, out-of-shape
linebacker who debuted against Tampa Bay two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to playing strongside linebacker than dashing
full-throttle toward the backfield every play. Turner said Sunday
that the game plan against Cleveland played to Arrington's
instinctive strengths, and it wasn't the well-rounded performance
needed to move ahead of fourth-year veteran Jones on the depth
chart.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did exactly what I know he can do -- he can make big
plays,'' Turner said. ''We did some things specifically for him. We
blitzed him. The thing we have to do is get LaVar to where he
doesn't give up big plays or negative plays. I think he's
progressing in that area, and that just comes from learning the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're in great shape there with Greg Jones as the
starter and LaVar as the backup. In a regular season game, I could
see both of them playing. We found a nice mix for the two guys
because Greg certainly gives us stability and experience in the
spot. LaVar gives us some of that big play ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrington's training camp was hampered by a weeklong holdout,
after which he showed up nowhere near football shape. By contrast,
the Redskins' No. 3 overall draft pick, tackle Chris Samuels, was
instantly made a starter after a brief holdout and has been
impressive since his first practice.
</P>
<P>
   On draft day in April, it seemed improbable -- barring injury --
that Arrington would not be starting and making an impact on
opening day. The fact that the Redskins can show some patience
further demonstrates how deep the team is.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game showed several more examples. Skip Hicks scored
two touchdowns, yet he's fighting for the second-string running
back job with Adrian Murrell. Backup quarterback Jeff George was
9-of-14, including a rifle shot to Albert Connell for a 36-yard
touchdown. Kenard Lang, a defensive end playing tackle while Dan
Wilkinson recovers from a knee injury, batted down three passes.
</P>
<P>
   The one area of concern is still at center, where untested Mark
Fischer make his first start since Cory Raymer injured a knee.
Turner said Fischer did OK, but there were obvious plays that will
get a good analysis in the film room -- including one in which
Fischer tripped guard Tre Johnson, which allowed a blindside hit on
quarterback Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did fine,'' Turner said of Fischer. ''He needs to play a
little bit lower, but I thought he did a lot of good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Fischer will start the opener against Carolina on
Sept. 3. Another backup center, Jay Leeuwenburg, will start at
guard that game because Johnson will be serving a one-game
suspension for striking an official last season.

<HEADLINE> Baggage Woes Haunt Sydney Airport  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The fifth breakdown this month in
Sydney Airport's baggage system delayed more than 6,000
international passengers Sunday and renewed doubts about the
airport's Olympic readiness.
</P>
<P>
   At least 27 flights were delayed for up to 80 minutes, and
airline workers said at least 200 bags were left behind or wrongly
tagged because of the breakdown in the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Aubert, a spokesman for Sydney Airports Corporation, said
the problem in the $25 million baggage system's computers caused up
to 20 flights to be delayed and that ''the impact on passengers was
an average delay of 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   But as bags piled up in the terminal, and United Airlines
brought in rented trucks to create its own temporary baggage
system, airline workers said 14 Qantas flights and 13 other foreign
flights were delayed for up to 80 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One baggage handler, who did not give his name, told The Sydney
Morning Herald that when the system failed Sunday morning,
officials promised it would be fixed within 10 minutes. It took
about three hours to fix, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their assurances are worth nothing, and if they don't start
listening then the Olympics are going to be even worse,'' the
baggage handler said. ''We are rapidly becoming an international
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is simply the latest with the new system, which also
caused the delay of four outbound flights last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In May, two baggage handlers narrowly avoided being hit by
falling luggage. Last month, 2,000 pieces of luggage were left
behind when the system crashed for 20 minutes, delaying 6,000
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The airport also has experienced problems with the power supply
to its air traffic control tower, forcing two serious power outages
in recent weeks at an airport that has just completed a $351
million overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was paralyzed earlier this month by a power failure
that grounded all international and domestic takeoffs -- stranding
thousands of costumers for up to several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are happening less than a month before the busiest
period in Australian aviation history -- the Sept. 15-Oct. 1
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Titans' McNair: Shoulder Healed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve
McNair threw in practice Sunday for the first time in nearly a week
and he pronounced his sore right shoulder healed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The soreness is all gone,'' McNair said with a smile. ''I'm
looking forward to getting back out there. Today was just a little
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair had been bothered by soreness in his throwing shoulder
for the past couple of weeks, and he sat out two practices before
playing the first half of the Titans' 30-3 exhibition victory over
the St. Louis Rams on Aug. 14. He had not thrown in practice since
that game and watched the Titans' 34-32 loss to the Philadelphia
Eagles on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, McNair threw in every drill except the last where the
Titans worked on correcting mistakes with Kevin Daft and rookie
Billy Volek. Coach Jeff Fisher was happy with what he saw from
McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt pretty good and was throwing well, had good velocity
on the ball,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   McNair will be busy this week as the Titans prepare for their
season opener at Buffalo the next two days before turning their
attention to the Chicago Bears for their final exhibition game.
Fisher said he may play McNair and several other starters through
halftime after resting them against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds very good to McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ''That'll be good for us to get into a rhythm and be ready for
Buffalo,'' McNair said. ''You've got to keep them in your mind. Now
we've got one preseason game to go, and we've got to get better in
order to be ready for Buffalo.''

<HEADLINE> Braves 8, Giants 5  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Chipper Jones hit two home runs and Tom
Glavine won his league-leading 16th game as the Atlanta Braves beat
the Giants 8-5 on Sunday, snapping San Francisco's six-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks homered twice for the second straight game for the
Giants, who were outhit 15-4.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants leading 4-3, Jones led off the fifth inning with
his 27th home run to tie the game. Jones went 4-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga reached on shortstop Rich Aurilia's throwing
error, then scored on Brian Jordan's double off Kirk Rueter (8-8)
to put the Braves ahead. Walt Weiss added an RBI single later in
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also led off the third with a solo shot. It was the fifth
time this year he has homered twice in one game, the 17th time in
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Burks gave San Francisco the lead in the third with a three-run
homer off Glavine (16-6) over the right-field wall -- short of
McCovey Cove and San Francisco Bay. He also hit a solo shot with
one out in the ninth off John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, 5-1 in his last six starts, sent the Giants to just
their 19th loss in 60 games at Pacific Bell Park. Glavine is 3-0
against the Giants this year. He allowed four runs -- three earned --
and three hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter allowed six runs -- five earned -- and 10 hits in 4 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter got in trouble early. With one out in the first, Andruw
Jones singled, went to third on Chipper Jones' single, and scored
with Galarraga's single.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan added another single to load the bases, and Javy
Lopez's sacrifice fly scored Chipper Jones. Reggie Sanders popped
out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, the Giants narrowed it to 2-1 on
Jeff Kent's RBI single. He scored Aurilia, who reached on a
throwing error by Weiss at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Burks' 17th homer of the season made it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Furcal added an RBI double in the seventh inning, and
Javy Lopez hit an RBI single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Sanders was 4-for-4, with singles in the second, fourth,
fifth and seventh inning, matching a career high.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burks has 19 career multihomer games. ... J.T. Snow needs
six hits to reach 1,000 for his career. He was hitless on Sunday.
... As the Braves' team bus pulled up to the stadium, a small but
vocal faction shouted ''Go home, Rocker!'' in reference to Atlanta
controversial reliever. ...The Giants have not swept the Braves at
home since Sept. 10-12, 1990 at Candlestick Park. Some fans brought

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tamika Whitmore scored eight of her 10 points
during a 19-0 first-half burst, and the New York Liberty held on
for a 51-45 victory over the Cleveland Rockers to tie their WNBA
playoff series 1-1 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore had the first two baskets and the last two during the
10-minute run that turned a 7-5 deficit into a 24-7 lead for the
Liberty, who lost the best-of-three series opener 56-43.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, who have won 12 straight at Madison Square Garden,
play host for the series finale Monday night. The winner advances
to the WNBA Finals against Los Angeles or Houston, which has won
all three league titles, twice defeating New York in the final
round.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Hammon led the Liberty with 13 points, and Tari Phillips
scored 12. Merlakia Jones led Cleveland with 18 points, and Chasity
Melvin had 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers, trailing by 19 at halftime, started the second half
with an 8-2 spurt to make it 37-25, and a 6-0 run closed them to
45-36 with 6:47 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Hammon responded with a jumper and a steal that led to a
layup by Vickie Johnson, giving New York a 49-36 advantage with
5:51 remaining
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Jones closed the Rockers to 51-43 with 1:53 left,
but they missed three 3-pointers down the stretch and managed just
one more basket with 8.7 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made its first two field-goal attempts and its last
four of the first half, but in between, the Rockers missed 17
straight. They went 14&AMP;frac12; minutes, from 18:52 left to 4:42 to go in
the half, without a basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers also had 12 first-half turnovers and trailed 36-17
at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Kills Two Police in Spain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUESCA, Spain (AP) -- A bomb ripped apart a Spanish Civil Guard
car killing the two officers inside on Sunday in an attack blamed
on Basque separatists, the latest in a wave of deadly attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb, which was stuck to the vehicle with a magnet, went off
just after 6 a.m. in the eastern town of of Sallent de Gallego near
Spain's border with France.
</P>
<P>
   A woman agent died instantly, while the second agent, a man,
died later in the hospital, police said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast,
but police blamed the separatist group ETA -- whose name is a
Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The blast brought to 11 the number of deaths blamed on ETA since
it ended a 14-month truce last December. Violence has escalated
recently, with four people killed and 11 injured in attacks over
the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Fernandez Pereda, 32, was the first Civil Guard woman
killed in separatist violence. The 22-year-old man, Jose Angel de
Jesus Encinas, had only three months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''The car was absolutely pulverized,'' said Jose Luis Sanchez,
the mayor of Sallent de Gallego.
</P>
<P>
   Television images showed the car doors and parts of the chassis
scattered over several yards along with bloody rags and rescue
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said residents near the bomb heard a vehicle driving
fast in the area an hour before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has killed some 800 people -- 204 of them Civil Guard members
-- in its 32-year-old war for independence on Spain's northern
Basque region on the border with France.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago Lopez Valdivielso, director general of the Civil Guard,
pledged an intensified crackdown. ''We're here today to cry and
honor our dead,'' he told reporters. ''It's a day of pain but you
can be convinced that, starting tomorrow, these deaths will be a
stimulus in the fight against ETA.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain's King Juan Carlos sent a telegram of condolences to
Valdivielso and condemned the ''brutal and cowardly murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Sallent de Gallego is in Spain's Huesca province, outside the
Basque region. Police have said ETA frequently uses Huesca to
transport explosives and members from France to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack, police found a car with false license plates
nearby. Bomb experts blew up the car, fearing it might contain
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja told reporters the
attackers likely fled over the Pyrenees mountains to the French
border nine miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens groups throughout Spain called for nationwide protests
for Monday morning while hundreds of mourners gathered in Sallent
de Gallego late Sunday at a ceremony for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Huesca, police blew up a car loaded 220 pounds of
explosives found abandoned alongside a highway.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Cubs 4  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks overcame Sammy Sosa's
42nd home run of the season and fourth in three games and rallied
from a four-run deficit to win their seventh straight, 5-4 over the
Chicago Cubs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson (16-4), winless in his previous five starts, threw
a four-hitter for his first victory since July 20. He is tied with
Atlanta's Tom Glavine for the NL lead in wins, and his seven
complete games are tied for most in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struck out 13, walked three and hit a batter. It was the
19th time in 27 starts this season that Johnson has reached double
digits in strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Colbrunn was 3-for-4 with a one-run double in the fourth
and a two-run double in the sixth as the Diamondbacks pulled within
a half-game of first-place San Francisco in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   During Johnson's winless streak, he had left the game with a
one-run lead three times. This time, manager Buck Showalter left
him in to finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struck out the first four batters he faced and five of
the first six, but the Cubs, losers of eight of their last nine,
scored four in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them came on Sosa's two-out smash into the left-field
seats on Johnson's first pitch to him.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa homered in three consecutive games for the third time this
year and 18th time in his career. Sosa has eight hits in 41 at bats
against Johnson, but four of them have been homers. He struck out
twice and hit into a double play in his other three at bats Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Daniel Garibay pitched five strong innings but was
relieved by Steve Rain with the bases loaded and one out in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn, hitting .510 (25-for-49) in his last 12 starts,
doubled past a diving Damon Buford in center field on Rain's first
pitch to drive in two and make it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Rain (3-3) walked Damian Miller on four pitches to load the
bases again, then Danny Bautista singled in the tying and go-ahead
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Buford led off with a double, then scored on Jose Nieves'
single. With two outs, Johnson walked Ricky Gutierrez and had to
face Sosa, whose first-pitch homer made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Garibay, winless in four starts since being recalled from
Triple-A Iowa, allowed four runs on five hits. He walked three and
struck out four.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Diamondbacks placed 1B Erubiel Durazo on the DL for the
third time this season with pain in his surgically-repaired right
wrist. 1B Alex Cabrera was recalled from Triple-A Tucson. ...
Johnson threw a 100 mph fastball that Sosa fouled off on a 3-2
pitch in the first inning, then struck him out with a slider. ...
Luis Gonzalez extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single
in the seventh. ... Johnson hit Mark Grace in the back with a 95
mph fastball in the sixth inning. ... With the crowd of 43,636, the
Diamondbacks passed the 9 million mark for their three-year
history.

<HEADLINE> Tewell Outlasts Morgan at Utah  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Doug Tewell eagled the 17th hole for the
second straight day, outlasting Gil Morgan in a final-round duel
Sunday in the Novell Utah Showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Tewell, a three-time winner this year, shot a 6-under-par 66 for
a 17-under 199 total. Morgan bogeyed the 18th for a 67 to finish
two strokes back. John Jacobs was third at 14 under.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Canizares charged on the back nine before a
double-bogey on the 18th, finishing at 12 under to tie Dana Quigley
for fourth place. Tom Wargo and Ed Dougherty finished at 11 under.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was decided when Tewell, who matched Morgan shot for
shot on the back nine, made a 15-foot putt for an eagle on the
par-5, 521-yard 17th. Seconds later, Morgan's 12-foot eagle attempt
missed by an inch.
</P>
<P>
   When he placed his approach shot on the par-4 18th within 8 feet
of the flag, Tewell was on his way to collecting the $217,500
winner's share. He missed the birdie attempt, but tapped in for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tewell also won the SBC Championship and the PGA Seniors'
Championship, a tournament that carried an invitation to this
week's PGA Championship in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   But Tewell felt he had a legitimate shot at winning in Utah, and
his hunch played out. His paycheck raised his earnings this summer
to $1,234,503, sixth on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   Canizares eagled the par-5 15th and briefly shared the lead
after he tapped in for birdie on the par-5 17th. Moments later on
the 15th green, Morgan rolled in an 8-footer for a birdie and
Tewell matched it to move to 15 under.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed Canizares would challenge, he hit his third
shot over the green at the 18th. Then he chipped past the flag and
two-putted for a double-bogey to shoot 67.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer carded a 70, shooting his age for the second time
as a member of the Senior PGA Tour. The first time came on his 66th
birthday, Sept. 10, 1996, in the GTE Northwest Classic near
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Palmer was followed by a swollen gallery of adoring
fans who cheered every shot. He could have shot a 69, and fans
groaned when he missed a 6-foot par attempt on the 18th.

<HEADLINE> Buccaneers 31, Patriots 21  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Two fluke plays gave the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers two touchdowns as they warmed up for their
regular-season opener at New England with a 31-21 exhibition win
over the Patriots on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs took the lead for good at 17-14 when linebacker Jamie
Duncan recovered a fumble in the end zone with 5:52 left in the
third quarter after the ball slipped from quarterback Michael
Bishop's hand as he brought it up to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs (2-1) had scored the game's first touchdown when Shaun
King threw to tight end Dave Moore. The ball squirted out of
Moore's grasp and was caught by Jacquez Green, who ran the rest of
the way for a 55-yard touchdown at 3:07 of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The teams each have one exhibition game left and were careful
not to reveal too much that could be used against them when they
meet again in the same stadium on Sept. 3. So there were few trick
plays and most of the first-stringers played only the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes after Green's touchdown, the Patriots
(2-2) tied the score on another long play that may have given
second-year pro Kevin Faulk a leg up on Raymont Harris and rookie
J.R. Redmond in the competition for the vacant running back job.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk burst up the middle on a draw play for a 58-yard touchdown
against a defense using several of the same players who allowed the
NFL's fewest yards last season.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, New England scored again as cornerback Ty Law
returned Mike Alstott's fumble 20 yards for a touchdown. Alstott,
who missed the Bucs' first two exhibition games with a sore
hamstring, fumbled when hit by free safety Tebucky Jones. Alstott
played only the first half, finishing with 18 yards on five
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Gramatica's 36-yard field goal with 3:08 left in the
first half cut New England's halftime lead to 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   As planned, Fox television analyst Matt Millen served as an
umpire in the officiating crew in the third quarter and part of the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe was 10-of-18 for 77 yards and
left for the last offensive play of the first half. Bishop replaced
him and threw a desperation pass that was intercepted by Shelton
Quarles.
</P>
<P>
   King, a second-year pro who started Tampa Bay's last five games
last season, is a key to the Bucs improving on last year's
28th-ranked defense. He entered Sunday's game with a 79 percent
completion average and was 9-of-23 for 191 yards in the first half
then gave way to Eric Zeier after the first series of the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Zeier came through when he hit backup wide receiver Karl
Williams with a 17-yard touchdown pass as the Bucs went ahead 24-14
with 2:38 gone in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   New England drew within 24-21 on Bishop's 32-yard scoring pass
to rookie Shockmain Davis, but Aaron Stecker's 5-yard run restored
Tampa Bay's 10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Law, the Patriots' Pro Bowl cornerback, faced his former AFC
East rival, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who was traded by the
New York Jets to the Bucs after last season. Johnson, playing the
first half, caught four passes for 59 yards.

<HEADLINE> U.S. 1, Canada 1  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BRISENDINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The moment belonged to Kristine Lilly,
but the player she beat turned out to be the hero of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly put a penalty kick past Canadian goalkeeper Karina Leblanc
for a goal Sunday, breaking a 19-game scoreless streak. But Leblanc
made nine saves as Canada salvaged a 1-1 tie with the U.S. women's
soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal was a shutout, and I thought it was achievable,'' said
Leblanc, who plays for the University of Nebraska -- where
midfielder Amy Walsh, who scored the equalizer for Canada, also
played. ''So to have that ball go in, especially on a penalty shot,
that was frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first draw of the year against Canada for the United
States, which had won the three previous meetings by a combined
score of 17-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have made progress the whole season,'' Canada coach
Even Pellerud said. ''We are too young, so we need two years more
to play even against them. But this was good for the confidence of
our team. We know what direction to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday also marked the second straight match in which the U.S.
team, tuning up for a defense of its Olympic championship, managed
only one goal on a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans tied Russia 1-1 on Tuesday in a closed-door match
at College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The United States went up 1-0 in the 73rd minute after Cindy
Parlow stripped Canada's Sharolta Nonen of the ball and was then
hauled down by Marie-Claude Dion in the penalty area. Lilly, who
missed a penalty kick in a 0-0 tie with Brazil on June 27, put the
ball past Leblanc for her first goal since May 5.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 75th minute, Walsh headed Kristina Kiss' free kick
away from U.S. keeper Briana Scurry and into the goal mouth.
American defender Kate Sobrero cleared the ball, but not before it
was ruled a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I timed it pretty well, I guess,'' Walsh said. ''I wasn't
really aware of all the other players around me. I was just looking
for the ball and got my head on it right.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team went scoreless during the run of play despite
outshooting Canada 31-5. In addition to Leblanc's nine saves, the
Americans had a number of shots go just high or wide.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said Lilly, ''I think our team's pretty confident right
now. We created a lot of chances on net, and we know we're going to
get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry, making just her third appearance of 2000 after battling
injuries for much of the year, came on in the 25th minute to
replace injured starter Siri Mullinix.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't up to my normal standards,'' Scurry said. ''That ball
that they got the score on, I'd normally get to that ball. I'm a
little rusty, but it's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 21st minute, Mullinix and Canadian midfielder Charmaine
Hooper both slid for a ball in the penalty area. Hooper's cleats
appeared to catch Mullinix in the upper arm. The U.S. team said
Mullinix was taken out as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   She later appeared with her knee bandaged. The team said she had
also bruised her knee on the play, but did not say how serious the
injury was.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper, who also lay on the field for several minutes, received
a yellow card for dangerous play.

<HEADLINE> Union leaders reviewing contract, optimistic deal is near  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A two-week strike against the nation's largest
local phone company appeared to be nearing an end Sunday, as union
officials and Verizon Communications moved toward final agreements
to replace contracts for 87,000 phone workers in 12 Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative accords had been reached with the two of three
bargaining units, according to sources familiar with the talks.
Final agreements could come as early as Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of nearly round-the-clock discussions, some union
bargainers packed up their bags and left the hotel negotiation site
late Sunday afternoon satisfied the talks here were basically
finished. Officials from the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers were among those.
</P>
<P>
   The talks involved three negotiating groups, one representing
the IBEW and two from the Communications Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to characterize the status of the
talks, saying only that they were continuing and making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be over when we have a signed agreement,'' said
Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe. ''It won't be over until then.''
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives said earlier in the day they were
reviewing language in the company's proposals Sunday, but believed
that both sides largely had addressed major points of contention
such as working conditions and job security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have really narrowed the issues. We are working out the
last couple of things,'' said Jeff Miller of the CWA, the larger of
the two unions on strike. ''We've made really substantial progress
on all the major issues important to our members.''
</P>
<P>
   Myles Calvey, negotiator for the IBEW, which represents about
14,700 workers in the talks, said he believed Sunday was
''definitely the day'' for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe offered a more tempered view, noting that the parties have
been ''reviewing language for a long time.'' He said the company
resumed some formal bargaining sessions with the unions Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, company officials said they had reached agreement
with the unions on company proposals that would make it less
cumbersome to unionize workers in Verizon's growing wireless
division and had agreed to concessions over how its high-speed
Internet connection work will be performed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other concerns of union members involved the amount
of overtime workers are required to put in and issues about the
shifting of work to areas where labor costs are lower. Unions
representatives fear that Verizon - a product of the summer merger
of Bell Atlantic and GTE - will redirect calls and therefore jobs
to centers in their expanded territory where wages are less.
</P>
<P>
   The company has struggled during the two weeklong strike to fill
growing numbers of repair requests, estimating that as many as
50,000 customers had no phone service at all.
</P>
<P>
   Company managers and retirees, working in place of thousands of
striking technicians, were tackling a backlog of about 92,000
repair requests, Rabe said Sunday. The replacement workers were
clearing about 25,000 to 30,000 requests daily.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all new line and installation orders have been put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects about 25 million customers from Maine to
Virginia, slowing repairs, installations and directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Picketing CWA members also were set to begin receiving checks
from the union. Workers are eligible to receive $200 per week for
the next two weeks. If the strike, which began Aug. 6, continues
past 28 days, the benefit increases to $300, according to the
union.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects Verizon customers in Delaware, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and
the District of Columbia.

Tiger Pulls Out PGA Championship
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- In a fitting conclusion to perhaps the greatest
summer of golf, Tiger Woods birdied the last two holes in regulation and won the
PGA Championship in a playoff over Bob May, becoming the first player since Ben
Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one year. Woods now has won four of the
last five majors, his first in a playoff. By winning at Valhalla Golf Club, he
became the first player to repeat as PGA champion since Denny Shute in 1937, and
the first since it went to stroke play in 1958.

Sub Rescuers Find No Signs of Life
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Norwegian divers struggled unsuccessfuly to open the escape
hatch on a nuclear submarine that sank with 118 men aboard, but they found no
sign of life today as Russian officials said most of the vessel was flooded in
minutes when it went down. The Russian navy has all but ruled out hope that any
of the crew remains alive nine days after the Kursk sank, crippled by a massive
explosion. The divers, working 350 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea,
found signs that some of the 118 crewmen may have tried to get out but were
unable to open the escape hatch, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said on
RTR.

Campers Die in N.M. Pipeline Blast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- An explosion of a natural gas pipeline just before
dawn yesterday swept flames down the river's banks and through the tents of two
families, killing 10 people, including five children, and leaving two critically
burned. ''They were consumed by a huge ball of fire,'' said state police Lt.
Larry Rogers. Officials described the ruptured line as a massive flame-thrower
that showered burning fuel on the victims. The victims were members of two
southeastern New Mexico families who had been camping along the river in an
unmarked but popular camping site for area fishermen.

Ford: High Tire Pressure Is a Concern
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. recommended inflating Firestone tires on
Explorers to less than maximum levels to reduce the risk of rollovers during
sudden turns, newspapers reported today. The 15-inch tires used on the sport
utility vehicles have been the focus of a recall of 6.5 million tires by
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. The recall has focused scrutiny primarily on the
sometimes catastrophic failure of tires that were under-inflated. For safety
purposes, Ford has recommended since the Explorer went on sale in 1990 that the
tires be filled to the 26 psi level. Since the recall began, however,
Bridgestone/Firestone has urged consumers to fill 15-inch tires on Explorers to
30 pounds psi, and Ford recently said that a range of 26 to 30 psi was
acceptable.

Communications moved toward final agreements to replace contracts for 87,000

two of three bargaining units, according to sources familiar with the talks.
Final agreements could come as early tonight. After weeks of nearly
round-the-clock discussions, some union bargainers packed up their bags and left
the hotel negotiation site late this afternoon satisfied the talks here were

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Kevin Stocker blooped a tiebreaking single and the Anaheim
Angels, shut out on two hits for six innings by David Cone, broke loose against
New York's bullpen to beat the Yankees 5-4 today. Two days after they overcame a
five-run margin in the ninth to win, the Angels erased a late 3-0 deficit. The
comeback prompted booing from the 50,048 fans on Whitey Ford Day.

<HEADLINE> Comets 74, Sparks 69  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Being the WNBA's best team in the
regular season, including three victories over Houston, didn't get
the Los Angeles Sparks where they wanted to go.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Comets advanced to their fourth consecutive WNBA
finals Sunday with a 74-69 victory over the Sparks, whose 28-4
regular-season record led the league.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stepped it up a level and we were able to beat a very good
team on their home court,'' said Cynthia Cooper, who scored 29
points. ''It was a tough game. We were felt we were underdogs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a role the Comets have rarely played during their four
years in the WNBA. They've won three league championships and will
go for a fourth beginning Thursday against either the New York
Liberty or Cleveland Rockers, whose Eastern Conference finals
series is tied 1-1. Game 3 is Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, they'll beat up on each other,'' said Houston's
Sheryl Swoopes, who was held to eight points after being sick
before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Playing one year and one day after her teammate and close friend
Kim Perrot died of cancer, Cooper rallied the Comets to a 2-0
series victory after winning Game 1 by 21 points in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a huge win for us,'' Swoopes said. ''I don't think we
thought about what happened in the regular season. We felt we could
beat them in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes began vomiting after arriving at the Forum, then got
dizzy and had a headache.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was never a question I wasn't going to be out there,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Janeth Arcain added 18 points for the Comets, including their
final five. Her running jumper snapped a 69-all tie with 39 seconds
remaining. She then made three of four free throws to close out the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arcain is a star in Brazil and comes here and plays any role
she has to,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika led the Sparks with 19 points and Tamecka Dixon
added 17, while Lisa Leslie had 12 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved our effort,'' said Sparks coach Michael Cooper, who
was honored as WNBA coach of the year before the game. ''There were
some things that we could have done, some shots that didn't go in
that normally fall, but that's the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   In their deathly quiet locker room, several Sparks players
covered their heads with their hands. Houston coach Van Chancellor
dropped in and silently shook hands with the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel like we did a great job this year and we just really
lost to a very good team,'' Leslie said. ''We followed what we
needed to for Sheryl and Cynthia to distribute the ball to other
players and the other players played well. They took shots they
normally don't take and made shots they normally don't make.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the final seconds, neither team led by more than four
points in the second half of a game played in front of 13,884
raucous fans at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their fans showed up and tried to make a difference and almost
did,'' Chancellor said. ''This is a great win for us, especially
after they won all three games. That's the happiest I've seen them
in the locker room. I don't know if they were that happy after we
won the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by four points, the Comets scored seven straight points
to take a 67-64 lead with 3:42 remaining. Swoopes hit a 3-pointer --
only her third basket of the game -- Tammy Jackson scored inside and
Cooper scored on a fastbreak driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon hit her second straight 3-pointer to tie the game at 67.
Cooper had a behind-the-back pass stolen by Dixon, who then missed.
Cooper scored easily when the Sparks were slow getting back on
defense for a 69-67 lead. Allison Feaster tied the game once more,
but the Sparks didn't score in the final minute.

<HEADLINE> Bush Spends $9.6 Million in July  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush spent about $2 million a week
in the final month before receiving the Republican presidential
nomination even as his fund-raising total broke the $100 million
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent $9.6 million in July, bringing his total spending to
$97.2 million, according to records filed Sunday with the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who unlike Bush agreed to limit his
spending to $40.5 million in exchange for taxpayer subsidies, set
his own record in July by becoming the first presidential candidate
to receive $15 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, the federal government matches the first
$250 of each individual contribution for presidential candidates
who limit their spending. Candidates were limited this year to a
maximum of $16.9 million in such funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a very good job getting people excited about supporting
the campaign and raising small donations from individuals,'' Gore
campaign spokesman Douglas Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $673,000 in matching funds last month brought
Gore's total to $15.3 million, pulling him further away from the
old mark of $13.5 million set by 1996 Republican presidential
nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also raised $85,000 for his campaign, bringing his total to
about $37 million, excluding the federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   During the same time, Bush raised about $4.3 million in
contributions, which combined with money raised for a legal and
accounting fund pushed his total to $100.1 million. Bush's record
fund raising was possible because he declined federal matching
funds for the primaries, allowing him to spend as much as he could
raise.
</P>
<P>
   The past record for fund raising in a single presidential race
belonged to Ross Perot, who for the general election in 1992 took
in $72.8 million, nearly all of it from his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reached his figure on the strength of 350,000 different
donors to his presidential campaign in all 50 states -- three
quarters of whom gave $100 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can no longer raise money because early this month he
accepted $67.6 million in taxpayer financing for the fall election.
Gore applied for the funds Friday after the end of the Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Through Election Day, both candidates are limited to spending
that federal aid and cannot raise private funds except to cover
legal and accounting costs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had about $6.4 million left in the bank at the end of July,
which carried him through to the convention and allowed him to get
a head start on the election by hiring more staff and opening
campaign offices.
</P>
<P>
   He spent nearly $2 million in July, bringing his total spending
including legal and accounting costs to $44 million for his
campaign. Gore's expenses included $5,000 to reimburse the
government for trips on Air Force Two.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had $4.2 million on hand at the end of July. Overall, he
has spent $25.3 million on media, $17.5 million on fund raising and
$13.6 million on travel, the Bush campaign reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gore initially spent a lot of money to fight off a challenge
from former Sen. Bill Bradley. But he defeated Bradley in the early
primaries, moved his headquarters from Washington to Nashville,
reduced his staff to cut costs and found himself with plenty of
money remaining.

<HEADLINE> Report: RNC Allegations Unfounded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Only a handful of allegations leveled by
protesters regarding police abuse at the Republican National
Convention are backed by medical evidence, a newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have accused police and prison guards of 295
instances of mistreatment and abuse, according to The Philadelphia
Inquirer. But in interviews with nearly two dozen activists
alleging some of the more serious claims, the newspaper found only
two cases yielded corroborating medical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more serious allegations were found to have no
supporting evidence beyond eyewitness accounts, the newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the only
lawsuit filed so far was by people who volunteered as medics during
the protests claiming they were mistreated by police during
convention demonstrations July 31 to Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   No lawsuits alleging abusive jail treatment have been filed as a
result of the 391 arrests of protesters. Lawyers said it will take
time to collect evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested have accused the police of everything from
psychological harassment to torture. A number of protesters said
officers regularly pulled plastic handcuffs extremely tight to
inflict pain. Many said they were bound ankle to wrist, bending
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely absurd,'' said John M. Gallagher, special
adviser to Police Commissioner John F. Timoney. ''Where are all the
injuries for all these people who were tortured?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more serious accusations, such as of having been
beaten or choked, were the result of incidents that allegedly took
place while activists were, by their own admission, being
uncooperative, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the protesters have filed complaints about jail
treatment with the city Commission on Human Relations or the Police
Advisory Commission, a police review board comprised of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lt. Sean J. Doris, a supervisor in the detention unit,
said that some officers had a few complaints about the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   He said officers had complained of back strain from lifting
people who refused to move and that a few officers requested
earplugs to drown out persistent chanting and door banging by the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The noise was unreal,'' Doris said.
</P>
<P>
   Doris accused protesters of throwing back at guards the cheese
sandwiches that they were given as food. He also said some, after
drinking the iced tea that came with the sandwiches, used the empty
cartons to splash urine from cell toilets onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have denied the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the claims may go more to the conditions in prison
needing to be improved,'' said Larry Frankel, executive director of
the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The police detention unit is monitored by 16 surveillance
cameras.

<HEADLINE> Mets 9, Dodgers 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Edgardo Alfonzo, Lenny Harris and Bubba
Trammell homered and the New York Mets turned two Los Angeles
errors into three eighth-inning runs in a 9-6 victory Sunday over
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who remained 1&AMP;frac12; games behind first-place Atlanta in
the NL East, won their eighth straight series.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick and Darryl Hamilton singled to open the eighth.
Bordick was trapped off third on Harris' comebacker to Terry Adams
(5-6), but he and pinch-runner Joe McEwing scored when the throw by
third baseman Adrian Beltre sailed over catcher Todd Hundley's
head.
</P>
<P>
   Harris scored when Derek Bell's routine grounder went through
the legs of second baseman Mark Grudzielanek for the Dodgers' third
error of the game and sixth in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (6-4) pitched two innings for the victory, allowing
a run and three hits. Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for his
33rd save in 37 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros gave the Dodgers a 5-4 lead with an RBI single that
chased starter Bobby J. Jones in the fifth. But Trammell and Harris
opened the sixth with consecutive home runs against Darren
Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who overcame a 4-0 deficit, tied it 6-6 in the
seventh when Gary Sheffield scored from first on Shawn Green's
bloop single to left-center that was misplayed twice by left
fielder Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who won his previous six starts, was charged with six
runs -- five earned -- and seven hits in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers closed to 4-3 in the third when Sheffield scored on
Green's RBI double. Los Angeles got even on Hundley's 21st homer
and second of the game. It was the 12th time Hundley has homered
twice in a game and second this season.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo opened the scoring with his 16th homer after a
ground-rule double by Bell. Alfonzo had 13 hits, 10 RBIs, three
homers and a .361 average against the Dodgers this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets made it 4-0 in the second. Jay Payton led off with a
double and one out later, Jones swung at a third strike, that
Hundley couldn't handle cleanly, and reached base on the passed
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Harris followed with an RBI single that sent Jones to third.
Harris stole second and Hundley's throw went into center field,
allowing Jones to score.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley was booed loudly when he came to bat in the bottom of
the inning after a one-out single by Karros. But he silenced the
crowd of 46,122 by driving a 1-1 pitch into the right field bullpen
to close the deficit to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hundley helped the Dodgers join Atlanta as the only NL
teams this season to have four players with at least 20 homers. ...
Grudzielanek has 100 stolen bases in 131 attempts. ... The Mets
have stranded an NL-leading 949 baserunners, including seven on
Sunday. ... Hundley, who broke Roy Campanella's major league record
for homers by a catcher in 1996 with the Mets, homered twice
against Philadelphia on May 26. ... Mets C Mike Piazza made the
defensive play of the game in the second inning, racing back to the
home-plate screen and making a diving grab of Alex Cora's popup.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Near N.C. Mall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Officials evacuated a large shopping mall
Sunday after a natural gas explosion at a nearby construction site
shot flames and debris 100 feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities reported no injuries from the explosion's fire.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone working at the construction site was accounted for,
said Sherry Lee, a spokeswoman for the Concord Fire Department. She
said gas to the line had been shut off and firefighters were
putting out the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not know late Sunday what had caused the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The construction site was several hundred yards from Concord
Mills mall and several freestanding restaurants, all off Interstate
85 about 20 miles northeast of Charlotte. Mall officials said the
construction site was not part of the mall's property.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of shoppers were inside the mall, and many said they
could feel the heat and vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   George McCullough III, who was at the mall with his wife, said
he thought an aircraft had crashed. ''I could feel it under my
feet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Groups March in Hamburg  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Hundreds of neo-Nazis and anti-Nazi
activists held simultaneous demonstrations in this northern port
city Sunday under the watchful eyes of 2,200 police.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 neo-Nazis descended on a square in central Hamburg,
while 500 anti-Nazi activists held their own demonstration 1,000
feet away. No serious incidents were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The far rightists were granted permission to hold the
demonstration on Saturday, when the Constitutional Court in
Karlsruhe lifted an earlier state court ban on the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, leftists and other anti-Nazi activists said
they would stage their own counter demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, police in Erfurt in eastern Thuringia state said
they had detained 40 Nazi sympathizers for taking part in banned
gatherings Saturday to mark the 13th anniversary of the death of
Hitler's former deputy Rudolf Hess and for displaying Nazi symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Hess committed suicide in Berlin's former Spandau prison in
August 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In Dortmund, an officer investigating a complaint that a group
of men were shouting Nazi slogans on Sunday had to fire a warning
shot and call for help when one of the group threatened to beat him
with a club, police said. Seven men aged between 19 and 27 were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern town of Neumuenster, 20 miles south of Kiel,
police raided a neo-Nazi hangout called Club 88 after they were
tipped off to illegal plans to celebrate the anniversary of Hess'
death.
</P>
<P>
   Several CDs with pro-Nazi songs were confiscated, but no one was
arrested, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have asked Neumuenster's Mayor Hartmut Unterlehberg
to cancel the Club 88's concession. The repeated 88 stands for the
eighth letter in the alphabet and is a neo-Nazi synonym for ''Heil
Hitler.''

<HEADLINE> Watson, Kite Shine at PGA Seniors  </HEADLINE>
By MARK R. CHELLGREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The senior set had a few moments in the
PGA Championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There was 50-year-old Tom Watson's sliding downhill 20-footer
for a birdie on No. 9 to get to 9 under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite, another 50-year-old, blasted a one-hopper out of a
cavernous bunker on No. 6 to get to 7 under.
</P>
<P>
   Those shots and others were met with encouraging shouts to the
veteran twosome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Show these kids!''
</P>
<P>
   ''Get one for our set!''
</P>
<P>
   Even: ''You da man!''
</P>
<P>
   Watson and Kite, who spend most of their time these days on the
Senior PGA Tour, still have enough game to play with kids 20 or
even 25 years younger and they showed it Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Both started the final round at 5 under, Watson on the strength
of a 65 on Saturday that tied the then-course record. Only an
opening 76 kept Watson from a real shot at the one major title that
eludes him. Kite, for his part, put together three solid under-par
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   At one juncture Sunday, they were on the leaderboard, tied for
ninth place at 9 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm there. I'm close enough to make a run,'' Watson remembered
saying to himself. ''I was thinking hard about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither could keep his level of play high on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Six possible birdie putts lipped out for Watson, while Kite had
three bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's trophy case includes five British Open titles, two
Masters and one U.S. Open -- but no PGA crown. When he saw the
leaders backing up for a time, Watson dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could see that Wanamaker Trophy,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kite won his only major in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and was
once the all-time leading money-winner on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Kite was captain of the 1997 Ryder Cup team; Watson was captain
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to feed off each other and the encouraging galleries
along the fairways at Valhalla Golf Club. Both birdied the par-5
2nd hole to start their runs.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, his putting troubles seemingly a thing of the past,
rolled in more long putts Sunday, just as he did Saturday. There
was a 20-footer on No. 4 and a 6-footer on No. 8. On No. 13, his
putt spun around the cup and out, leaving a tap-in for par.
</P>
<P>
   Kite scrambled, mixing clean irons with occasionally wayward
ones. A soft flop from way below the green on No. 12 saved par.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was fun playing well,'' Kite said. ''We knew if we played
as well on the back as we did on the front, we had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The other seniors in the 82nd PGA did not fare so well.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, 60, playing his final PGA, nearly holed an eagle
wedge on his 36th hole that would have allowed him to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Wadkins, another former PGA champion, also left before the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Sabo, 51, got in as a club pro, but also played in four
senior tour events this year with a 15th place finish in the U.S.
Senior Open. He missed the cut here by three strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Nichols, a 64-year-old regular on the senior tour and
winner of the 1964 PGA Championship, withdrew before play began
because of ailing hips.
</P>
<P>
   Kite and Watson were special invitees to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson earned a return trip for next year's PGA, where he
will try once again to fill that space in the trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   ''At 50 years old,'' Watson said, ''I can still play with the
kids.''

Palestinians: No Compromises Over Jerusalem
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Palestinian cabinet insisted there will be no
compromise with Israel on the key issue of Jerusalem, in a tough statement
Sunday coinciding with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross's efforts to revive Mideast peace
talks. The tone of the debate became more acrimonious as Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said it was now up to the Palestinians to make the next move in peace
efforts, while a Palestinian official warned that Jewish settlers in the West
Bank and Gaza could become hostages if a crisis erupted. The Palestinian cabinet
said Israel must withdraw from east Jerusalem, which would become the
Palestinian capital.

Sub Rescuers Find No Signs of Life
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Norwegian divers struggled unsuccessfuly to open the escape
hatch on a nuclear submarine that sank with 118 men aboard, but they found no
sign of life today as Russian officials said most of the vessel was flooded in
minutes when it went down. The Russian navy has all but ruled out hope that any
of the crew remains alive nine days after the Kursk sank, crippled by a massive
explosion. The divers, working 350 feet below the surface of the Barents Sea,
found signs that some of the 118 crewmen may have tried to get out but were
unable to open the escape hatch, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said on
RTR.

Woods Wins PGA Title in Playoff
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- In a fitting conclusion to perhaps the greatest
summer of golf, Tiger Woods today birdied the last two holes in regulation and
won the PGA Championship in a playoff over Bob May, becoming the first player
since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one year. Woods now has won four
of the last five majors, his first in a playoff. By winning at Valhalla Golf
Club, he became the first player to repeat as PGA champion since Denny Shute in
1937, and the first since it went to stroke play in 1958.

Poll: Gore, Bush in Dead Heat
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush were tied in a poll of likely
voters today as aides for both candidates heated up the dialogue on the air
waves over presidential debates. Bush aides cautioned the surge Gore has gotten
in the polls after his party's national convention could be short-lived. Bush
also got a bounce after his convention that quickly evaporated. ''We said all
along that it's going to be a close election,'' Hughes said on CNN's ''Late
Edition.'' ''We expect it to be a close, hard-fought election all the way to
November.''

Report: Abuse Allegations from RNC Unfounded
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Only a handful of allegations leveled by protesters
regarding police abuse at the Republican National Convention are backed by
medical evidence, a newspaper is reporting. Protesters have accused police and
prison guards of 295 instances of mistreatment and abuse, according to The
Philadelphia Inquirer. But in interviews with nearly two dozen activists
alleging some of the more serious claims, the newspaper found only two cases
yielded corroborating medical evidence.

Bomb Kills 2 Guard Agents in Spain
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HUESCA, Spain (AP) -- A bomb ripped apart a Spanish Civil Guard car killing
the two officers inside today in an attack blamed on Basque separatists, the
latest in a wave of deadly attacks. The bomb, which was stuck to the vehicle
with a magnet, went off just after 6 a.m. in the eastern town of Sallent de
Gallego near Spain's border with France. There was no immediate claim of
responsibility for the blast, but police blamed the separatist group ETA --
whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom. The
blast brought to 11 the number of deaths blamed on ETA since it ended a 14-month
truce last December.

Unions Optimistic on Verizon Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A two-week strike against the nation's largest local phone
company appeared to be nearing an end today, as unions officials and Verizon
Communications moved toward final agreements to replace contracts for 87,000
phone workers in 12 Eastern states. Tentative accords had been reached with the
two of three bargaining units, according to sources familiar with the talks.
Final agreements could come as early tonight.

Corretja Wins Legg Mason Title
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Alex Corretja needed just 72 minutes today to outclass
top-seeded Andre Agassi 6-2, 6-3 and win the Legg Mason Tennis Classic. Agassi,
a five-time winner of the hardcourt tournament, was erratic all afternoon from
the baseline. Agassi committed 38 unforced errors and finished with four
doublefaults, including one that ended the first set. ''Of course Andre didn't
play his best tennis, but it is always the same when one guy plays well the
other is difficult to get through,'' the second-seeded Corretja said. ''If he
always played his best, he would be unbeatable.''

<HEADLINE> Padres 5, Expos 4  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jay Witasick hit two run-scoring singles -- his
first two big league hits and RBIs -- to help himself to his first
victory with San Diego as the Padres beat the Montreal Expos 5-4 on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Witasick, obtained from Kansas City on July 31 for right-hander
Brian Meadows, singled in the second and third innings, both
following intentional walks to Wiki Gonzalez. His second single
capped the four-run third, in which only one run was earned because
of first baseman Lee Stevens' error.
</P>
<P>
   Witasick, who spent his first 4&AMP;frac12; seasons in the American League,
was 0-for-16 coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   He was pulled after allowing Jose Vidro's two-run homer in the
seventh that pulled the Expos to 5-4. Vidro, who went 3-for-4,
homered for the second straight game and has 20 on the season.
</P>
<P>
   Witasick (1-1) pitched 6 1-3 innings, allowing four runs, three
earned, and 10 hits while striking out seven and walking two.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman pitched 1 1-3 innings for his 33rd save in 39th
opportunities. He came on with a runner on first and two outs in
the eighth and struck out Fernando Seguignol.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have lost nine of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal took a 1-0 lead in the second on Brian Schneider's RBI
double and the Padres tied it in the bottom of the inning when
Witasick hit an opposite-filed single to right with two outs to
score Bret Boone, aboard on a leadoff single.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres scored four runs on four hits and an error in the
third. With runners on first and second and one out, Stevens let
Boone's grounder roll under his glove for an error, allowing Ryan
Klesko to score from second. John Mabry hit an RBI double, Ruben
Rivera had an RBI groundout and after Gonzalez again was
intentionally walked, Witasick singled to center to score Mabry.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Felipe Lira (3-3) lasted just three innings,
allowing five runs, two earned, on six hits while walking three. He
was making just his second start of the year, taking Mike Johnson's
place in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vidro tied Mike Lansing's 1997 club record for most homers
by a second baseman. ... The Padres finished 5-4 against the Expos,
just the second time in 11 seasons they've won the season series.
... Lira went longer in his last appearance, four innings of relief
against San Francisco on Tuesday night, than he did in Sunday's
start. He also lost against San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Miller Pulls Out of Olympic Trials  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Two-time Olympian Shannon Miller pulled out of the
Olympic gymnastic trials Sunday after jamming her knees on her
opening vault.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said there was ''really no injury,'' but no reason to
continue either, because of the pain that overtook her legs when
they jammed into the mat after a roundoff back-flip with a half
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Her coach, Steve Nunno, decided it was better to have her drop
out and see if national team coordinator Bela Karolyi would choose
her based on what little he has seen, rather than try to compete
with her legs growing stiff and clearly not at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made an executive decision to pull out,'' Nunno said. ''In
my mind, it was the obvious thing to do when you look at it from a
strategic standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said doctors gave her clearance to continue with the
meet, but she agreed with Nunno's decision to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've seen what I can do,'' she said. ''At this point,
health is more important. I can be ready to go in two days if they
decide I'm needed.''
</P>
<P>
   If she is, it would almost certainly be for her expertise on the
uneven bars, where she scored a 9.650 at nationals and a 9.712 here
Friday in the first round of trials.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else seems like a big guess.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has won a record seven Olympic medals, pulled out of
nationals after that single bars routine to let the hairline crack
in her lower right leg continue to heal. On the first day of
trials, her bars routine was the only one that drew over a 9.30,
although Nunno felt Miller was underscored by the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Her last chance to impress came Sunday, but that ended quickly.
</P>
<P>
   After walking gingerly off the mat, she decided to attempt her
second vault. Her landing was awkward there, too, and she came off
limping, fighting back tears. Nunno had to help her down the stairs
and back down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   They went to the training room shortly after. Miller returned to
the floor and grabbed her warmup suit, then headed over to the
uneven bars, where she was supposed to compete next.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be no more for Miller, who could barely walk.
</P>
<P>
   Miller scored an 8.650 for the vaults, nowhere near what she
would need to improve her standing, even though scores aren't the
determining factor in who makes the six-person Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the second member of the 1996 team to pull out this
week. Dominique Moceanu scratched before the trials began because
of a floating bone chip in her right knee.

<HEADLINE> 7 Arrested in Venezuelan Drug Bust  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan forces seized five tons of
cocaine and arrested at least seven people in a remote jungle
region in the eastern coast during the country's largest drug bust
to date, authorities said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The raid, which took place Friday, was the result of a six-month
investigation financed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. The
National Guard recovered 173 packages of cocaine about to be
shipped to Europe, National Guard Officer Eduardo Sanchez told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are still in pursuit of at least two suspected leaders of
the Los Mellizos drug ring who fled into the Orinoco jungle during
a gun battle that preceded the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The probe, known as ''Orinoco 2000,'' used telephone bugging
equipment, more than 200 anti-drug officers, three planes, three
helicopters and eight boats, according to El Universal newspaper
which first reported the bust. Colombia, France, Britain, Italy,
Greece and Panama also collaborated with the operation, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is a key trafficking route for Colombian cocaine en
route to the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez's refusal to allow U.S. anti-narcotic
flights over Venezuelan airspace on grounds of protecting
''national sovereignty'' continues to sour relations between the
two countries. Chavez defends Venezuela's anti-narcotic record,
pointing to successful drug bust operations.
</P>
<P>
   The seven suspects captured in the Orinoco 2000 bust were due to
appear in court in Tucupita, the capital of eastern Delta Amacuro
state, El Universal said.

<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Vicki Fergon won the first Women's Senior
Golf Tour event Sunday, shooting a 2-under-par 70 for a four-stroke
victory in the ShopKo Great Lakes Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Fergon, 44, who earned $75,000, had a 10-under 206 total on the
Green Bay Country Club course. Dale Eggeling, 46, was second after
a 68, and Australia's Jane Crafter, 49, shot a 71 to finish third
at 211.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was nervous all week, but I played pretty well. I guess I
should be nervous more often,'' said Fergon, who won for the first
time since the LPGA's 1996 Michelob Light Heartland Classic
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to think about winning, think ahead about
speeches and all that stuff. It's a cliche, but you have to stay in
the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez shot a 75 for an 18-over 234 total. The Hall of
Famer is 43, the tour's qualifying age.

<P>
   OAKLAND: 1B-DH Mike Stanley was 2-for-6 in Sunday's 5-4 win over
Detroit and is batting .435 (20-for-46) with five homers and 13
RBIs against the Tigers this season. Stanley is batting .359
(14-for-39) in 13 games since joining the Athletics on Aug. 4. ...
OF-DH Ben Grieve hit two doubles Sunday, the 12th time an Oakland
hitter has done that this season. ... C Ramon Hernandez was in a
2-for-20 skid and 0-for-21 against Detroit this year before going
3-for-5 with a two-run double Sunday. ... Sunday's win was just the
A's seventh in their last 24 road games and snapped a seven-game
road losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: RHP Willie Blair allowed five doubles to the A's in 6
1-3 innings Sunday, the second time the Tigers have allowed a foe
that many in a game this year. ... SS Deivi Cruz hit his fourth
straight double in the second inning Sunday and has a career-high
36 for the season. ... OF-DH Juan Gonzalez extended his hitting
streak to 11, one shy of his season best, with a 10th-inning

with the game tied at 4.

</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: For the second time this season, the Rangers play a night

league debut Aug. 16. ... 2B Luis Alicea was scratched from
Sunday's game with tightness in his left quadriceps. Alicea is day
to day. ... The Rangers bullpen is 14-20 this season, the most

</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Veteran RHP Ken Hill has a locker and uniform No. 44 in
the White Sox clubhouse. GM Ron Schueler said he hoped to have Hill
signed by midweek and he could start as soon as Thursday. Hill, who
was released earlier this month by Anaheim and signed a minor
league contract with the White Sox, gave up two runs on six hits
and no walks over four innings for Triple-A Charlotte Saturday. He
struck out seven. Hill's fastball was clocked at 92 mph. ... Rookie

eclipsing the old mark of 34 set by Bobby Smith in 1998. Cox also
tied Oakland's Terrence Long for the walks lead among AL rookies.
... SS Ozzie Guillen will be back in Chicago for the postseason to
cheer for his former teammates. ''They're going to be in the
playoffs and I'm coming back so I can see Harold Baines,'' Guillen
said. ''I've still got Chicago blood.''
Twins-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins are 19-17 since the All-Star break. ... The
Twins won the season series against Toronto 5-4. It's only the

Angels-Yankees:
</P>
<P>

of 1999. ... Tim Salmon hit his 224th home run, moving two past
Brian Downing for the club's career homer mark.

since being acquired by the Yankees. He has five homers in his last
15 times up. ... Luis Sojo has hit safely in 10 of 11 games for the
Yankees. He was 2-for-4 and drove in two runs Sunday, but also was
thrown out at the plate trying to score on a single by Paul
O'Neill. ... Clay Bellinger played center field for the injured
Bernie Williams. He doubled, walked twice and scored two runs.
Mariners-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: During the Mariners' eight-game losing streak, Seattle
pitchers have an 8.70 ERA. ... Seattle also has 15 errors during
the skid after making just 60 errors in its first 116 games. ''It
(the defense) has inexplicably gone south,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ... RHP Kazuhiro Sasaki has 28 saves, but none against
Cleveland or Detroit. He has appeared three times in non-save
situations against the Indians. Sasaki needs four saves to break
the AL rookie record of 31 set by Toronto's Billy Koch in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: Manager Charlie Manuel said he would like to see
''more intensity'' from his veteran club. ''I'd like to see more
laughing, screaming and having fun,'' he said. ''Who knows, though,
maybe they are having fun and just don't show it.'' ... The Indians
are 19-11 against the AL West and 32-40 against the rest of the AL.

when he does not. The Indians also are 21-11 in Lofton's multihit
games. ... David Segui has not made an error in 48 games at first
base this season, handling 391 total chances. ... LHP Ricardo
Rincon began a 30-day rehab assignment at Triple-A Buffalo on

games. ... The Orioles went 20 straight innings without a run
before DeShields singled in Melvin Mora in the sixth Sunday.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:

</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Brian Giles is in a 14-for-28 spurt that includes 10
extra-base hits -- three doubles, three triples and four homers. ...
Giles' four RBIs gave him 101 for the season. He led the Pirates
with 115 last year. ... The Pirates got their first win on a Sunday
since June 11. They'd lost nine Sunday games in a row and are 4-15
overall on their worst day of the week. ... The Pirates are 2-4 on
their nine-game trip. They've had just one winning road trip out of
their previous 10 this season. ... Warren Morris is in a 3-for-25

four starts. ... Ken Griffey Jr. had a single and a double in four
at-bats, extending his hitting streak to six games and raising his
average to a season-high .255. ... Reliever Mark Wohlers pitched
the last three innings, the longest appearance of his career. His
previous longest was 2 1-3 innings against the Reds on Sept. 25,
1991.
Brewers-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: With the help of Henry Blanco throwing out 32 of 57
basestealers, the Brewers have allowed only 63 stolen bases through
123 games this season. Last year, they had allowed 132 through 123
games. ... OF Jeromy Burnitz has hit 17 of his 24 home runs on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Octavio Dotel is second in the league in number of
''tough'' saves -- situations when the reliever comes in with the
tying runs on base. Dotel has five while the Cardinals Dave Veres
has six. ... The Astros are 9-17 when Enron Field's retractable
roof is closed. With it open, they are 7-6 and they're 10-11 when
it is opened sometime during the game.
Marlins-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Luis Castillo got his 45th infield hit of the year. ...

suffering a strained quad muscle while with Triple A Calgary. ...

his career.
Phillies-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Bobby Abreu batted leadoff for the first time all
season, going 2-for-3 with two walks, two steals and two RBIs. He
was on base his first four at-bats and manager Terry Francona said
regular leadoff man Doug Glanville would move to Abreu's No. 2 slot
for the time being. ''Dougie was receptive to it,'' Francona said.
''The thing he said to me is the team is No. 1.'' Francona said
Abreu wasn't happy about the move, probably because he had asked
someone else to relay the information to Abreu. ''I think he
thought it was a demotion,'' Francona said. ... Randy Wolf, who
starts Monday at Cincinnati, is 0-1 in his last three outings. He's
allowed 17 earned runs in 18 1-3 innings in that span. ... The
Phillies won Sunday despite stranding a season-high 15 runners.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Britt Reames, who replaced the injured Andy Benes in
the rotation Sunday, was the seventh player to make his debut with
the Cardinals this season. ... Edgar Renteria has 14 home runs and
needs one to tie Solly Hemus' 1952 record for the most by a
Cardinals shortstop. ... The Cardinals' combined attendance of more
than 4.6 million leads the major leagues. ... Before Sunday's game,
the Cardinals unveiled a statue in the likeness of Rogers Hornsby
outside Busch Stadium. ... 2B Fernando Vina's error in the second
inning was his third error in 118 games dating to last season.
Cubs-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs made it official Sunday and listed Kerry Wood
as the probable starter Tuesday in Houston. Wood has been on the DL
since July 30 with a left oblique strain. ... Sammy Sosa has six
home runs and nine RBIs in the last eight games as the Cubs have
lost seven times. The rest of the Cubs have no homers and nine
RBIs. Chicago is hitting .216 during that stretch. ... The Cubs
have allowed 20 homers in their last 10 games, including two in
their 11-3 loss to Arizona on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 1B Erubiel Durazo was placed on the 15-day DL for the
third time this season with pain in his surgically-repaired right
wrist. He is to undergo an MRI on Monday. 1B Alex Cabrera was
recalled from Triple-A Tucson. ... Arizona has tied its high of the
season by being 16 games above .500. ... After struggling
offensively much of the season, especially in June and July, the

outscoring the opposition 38-12. ... OF Steve Finley, a notorious
streak hitter, has two home runs in his last two games. ... OF Luis
Gonzalez, on a 13-game hitting streak, had a 30-game streak last

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets have stranded an NL-leading 949 baserunners,
including seven on Sunday. ... C Mike Piazza has thrown out 26 of
111 potential base stealers. By comparison, the Dodgers' catchers --
Hundley, Chad Kreuter, Paul LoDuca and Jim Leyritz, are a combined
24-for-103. ... The only Mets starting pitcher to get a win in
their nine-game season series with the Dodgers was Rick Reed, who
beat Dreifort 2-1 in the first meeting on April 7 at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Todd Hundley homered twice as the Dodgers join
Atlanta as the only NL teams this season to have four players with
at least 20 homers. ... Mark Grudzielanek has 100 career stolen
bases in 131 attempts, the exact same totals he had in the minor
leagues.
Braves-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: With his RBI single in the first inning, Kent
reached 105 RBIs. That gives him 455 RBI over the past four years,
tying Roger Hornsby for fourth-highest total among second basemen.
Hornsby did it five times, but holds the record at 472 RBI from
1922-1925. ... The Giants have not swept the Braves at home since
Sept. 10-12, 1990 at Candlestick Park. Some fans brought brooms in
anticipation of a victory but were disappointed when the Giants
lost 8-5 ... SS Rick Aurilia's throwing error in the fifth snapped
a 33-game errorless streak.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: As the Braves' team bus pulled up to Pacific Bell Park
Sunday, a small but vocal faction shouted ''Go home, Rocker!'' in
reference to controversial Atlanta reliever John Rocker. He was
loudly booed when he took the field in the ninth inning. ... Walt
Weiss was 4-for-5 for the Braves. He has been 3-for-24 over his
last 11 games. The last four-hit game for Weiss came Sept. 2, 1997
at Anaheim.

aneurysm near his right armpit. ... The Padres finished 5-4 against
the Expos, just the second time in 11 seasons they've won the
season series. ... Felipe Lira went longer in his last appearance,
four innings of relief against San Francisco on Tuesday, than he

<HEADLINE> Legalities Impede Speedskater's Bid  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speedskater Chris Witty said she had ''very good reasons'' for
skipping an Olympic cycling team rideoff Sunday in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer said Witty never told an arbitrator her side in a
dispute stemming from Witty's appointment to the cycling team. The
situation has put the American lineup in disarray less than a month
before the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Thomas of Yazoo City, Miss., who challenged Witty's
appointment to the track cycling team, rode alone Sunday in a
500-meter time trial at the Superdrome track in Frisco, Texas. She
was clocked in 35.497 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, an arbitrator ruled the rideoff was needed
to help determine a spot on the Olympic squad. But Witty has filed
a counter-complaint and, citing the pending litigation, she skipped
the showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had very good reasons for not going. Unfortunately, I can't
talk about it until the hearing,'' she said from Colorado Springs,
where she traveled Sunday to train with the cycling team.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Jeff Benz of San Francisco, said the hearing is
tentatively scheduled for Saturday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris was subjected to a renegade arbitrator who chose to not
make her a party to the Thomas proceedings,'' Benz said. ''Nobody
asked Chris for her side of it before the arbitrator issued a
ruling directing the rideoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the United States, we have a right to due process. Chris
had no due process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Petty, director of athlete performance for U.S. Cycling,
said the spot on the Olympic team remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris is planning to have her day in court, and we'll have to
see how it plays out with the arbitrators,'' Petty said. ''Nothing
has been determined as of right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Witty, who won two speedskating medals in the Nagano Olympics,
was appointed to the 14-member track cycling team in July. She was
considered a potential medalist at Sydney in the 500-meter time
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Witty, who lives in Park City, Utah, is trying to become the
first American woman, and only the fourth person ever, to win
medals at the summer and winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Petty said the month-long legal tug-of-war, meanwhile, is
becoming a distraction for the track cycling team, which has been
training in Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's really frustrating is that it's affecting the team, the
morale,'' he said. ''Everybody is thinking about it, talking about
it. Today, we have a coach and support staff in Frisco, Texas, when
everyone else is in Colorado Springs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas couldn't be reached for comment; Petty said she was
returning to her training camp in Trexlertown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Witty won the silver medal in the 1,000 meters at Nagano and
bronze in the 1,500. The following summer, she placed fourth at the
1998 world cycling championships in the 500-meter time trial.
</P>
<P>
   To choose this year's Olympic team, U.S. Cycling used a
subjective selection process based on two years of international
racing results. Petty has said the goal was to take the most
experienced top-level riders to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas placed third last year at the nationals in the 500 time
trial, but she beat Witty at the Olympic trials in April at the
Frisco track. Thomas finished that race in 36.349, narrowly beating
Witty's 36.374.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Witty had returned to cycling less than a month
after her speedskating season ended. Both riders attended a World
Cup race in Mexico City in June but didn't compete against each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Petty said he doesn't know how the situation will play out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We followed the arbitrator's decision,'' he said. ''There was
no other stipulation for what winning meant or what it would mean
if a rider didn't come. We simply did as we were ordered by the
arbitrator.''

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- More than 7,000 North Carolina homes and
businesses were still without power Sunday as crews worked to
restore service knocked out Friday by severe storms.
</P>
<P>
   Two deaths were blamed on the storms that pounded the state with
heavy rain, wind, lightning and hail.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Energy reported 7,400 outages remaining late Sunday
afternoon, mostly in the Charlotte area, down from a peak of more
than 100,000 outages Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Power &AMP; Light spokesman David McNeill said his
company's outages were repaired. At the peak, CP&AMP;L had 52,000
outages Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A 78-year-old man died Saturday in a Charlotte house fire caused
by heat from a candle that had been lit because there was no
electricity. North of Charlotte, a man drowned on Lake Norman while
trying to swim to a boat that was blown away by a storm.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Since a fatal bombing in Moscow nearly two weeks
ago, police have launched an anti-terror operation that has
confiscated 136 tons of explosives, according to an Interior
Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   Police also detained 408 criminal suspects, said Lt. Gen.
Alexander Chekalin, head of the ministry's public order department,
the ORT television channel reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the detentions are apparently unrelated to the Aug. 8 attack
in which a bomb tore through a passage under Moscow's busy Pushkin
Square, killing 12 people. Police have reported no breakthrough in
that investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not give details on who had the explosives or why
the quantity seized was so large.

By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- The 10-0 victory and his pitcher's
12-strikeout performance didn't faze Japanese manager Masumi Ohmae.
</P>
<P>
   With a smile on his face, Ohmea -- speaking through interpreter
Bill Lundy -- looked to pitcher Leo Nakayama and called it, ''the
worst game I've ever seen him pitch. He had no confidence when we
started. He threw a couple of wild balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, Nakayama agreed, reflecting back on the five walks and
one hit he gave up through the first two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Nakayama, however, settled into a dominating groove, leading
Musashi Fucho Tokyo to a 10-0 victory over Sierra
Maestra-Maracaibo, Venezuela, on Sunday in the 54th Little League
World Series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing only two hits while walking six, Nakayama recorded the
game's first 11 outs by strikeout before Elvis Leon grounded out to
third base with two outs in the fourth inning. Nakayama also had
three hits, one a towering home run to left-center to lead off the
fourth, and scored four runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was his bat, Nakayama said, that bolstered his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his homer that measured an estimated 265 feet,
Nakayama said he knew the ball was gone the minute it left his bat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. South entry Bellaire, Texas, faced U.S. East's Goffstown,
N.H., in the second game of the day. All eight teams will compete
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big win for Tokyo, which is attempting to defend the
nation's title after Osaka, Japan, beat Phenix City, Ala., in last
year's championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of pressure coming into this first game,
having won last year,'' Ohmea said. ''Moving forward, it's great to
win the first game. ... It relieves some pressure now that we're in
the driver's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's victory was called after the fifth inning due to Little
League's 10-run rule when the Far East team scored twice to go up
10-0, and Maracaibo failed to score in the bottom half of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of four errors and six walks, Tokyo broke the
game open with a four-run second inning to build a 6-0 lead. Tomoya
Fujisaki scored on a walk to put Japan up 3-0. Then, Daiki Ichimura
scored on an error, Yuusaku Nakanishi singled to drive in Nakayama
and Kazuma Yamada scored on an error.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Tokyo scored its first six runs on two hits and three
Venezuelan errors.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo added two more runs in fourth and fifth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Nakanishi and Yamada each drove in two runs each for Tokyo,
which sent eight men to the plate in three of the first four
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo manager Eduvino Quevedo was disappointed but hopeful
that his team can bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that they started out bad isn't going to hurt his
confidence,'' interpreter Micah Hughes said, speaking for Quevedo.
''They're just kids, they're just 12 years old, they're going to
bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mavarez and Manuel Castellano had the lone hits -- both
singles -- for Maracaibo.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Marcel Prado struggled, giving up six runs --
two earned -- on one hit and four walks, leaving the game with one
out in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Maestra-Maracaibo squad is the first Venezuelan
representative to reach the Little League World Series since
Coquivacoa-Maracaibo won the title in 1994. All nine Venezuelan
entries at the Little League World Series have been from Maracaibo.

<HEADLINE> Woods Wins Thriller on Greens  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- It's been 42 years since the PGA
Championship abandoned match play. For one thrilling Sunday
afternoon on the greens of Valhalla Golf Club, Tiger Woods and Bob
May brought it back in glorious fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Two clutch birdie putts on the 18th hole of regulation that will
find their place in golfing lore weren't even enough to settle one
of the greatest two-man displays in championship history.
</P>
<P>
   This one was simply too good to finish. And there was still one
memorable putt left.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Woods pumping his fist and screaming in excitement
after following May's brilliant 15-footer with a 6-footer of his
own to stay alive on the final regulation hole was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   It got even better on the first playoff hole when Woods was
prancing toward the cup on No. 16, pointing in glee toward the
bottom of the hole as his ball rolled in from 25 feet to give him
the lead he would never relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   The putter that was so unsteady most of the week was masterful
when needed most, with Woods one-putting all three overtime holes
to win by a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just had to stay patient,'' Woods said. ''Once I found the
rhythm and got into the flow of the round, I knew I had a chance of
winning this championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods needed only 12 putts over the final nine holes of
regulation, then three more on the three playoff holes to win his
third straight major championship and his second straight PGA.
</P>
<P>
   It was a complete turnaround from the opening holes, when Woods
missed relatively short putts on four of the first six holes to
lose his lead and fall two shots behind his playing partner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I putted terrible starting out,'' Woods said. ''It was just a
matter of time before the putter came around and finally it did.''
</P>
<P>
   When it did, the match was on.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made a short birdie putt on No. 7 and followed it with his
best putt of the day to that point -- a 15-footer on the par-3 8th
hole that tied him with May at 13 under.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Woods hardly missed. And when he badly needed to
make a putt, he did every time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He never made another bad stroke from the eighth hole on in,''
said Butch Harmon, Woods' instructor.
</P>
<P>
   That was never more apparent than on 15, when Woods made the
putt that may have kept his chances alive.
</P>
<P>
   May was only 4 feet from the hole for birdie while Woods was
facing a 15-footer for par after missing the green with his
approach shot. If Woods missed and May made his short putt, the
lead would be three shots with three holes to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew if I made it, his putt would get a bit longer,'' Woods
said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods did just that, rolling in the right-to-left breaking putt.
And May pulled his putt, missing on the left.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was big,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Critical,'' May agreed.
</P>
<P>
   There were still more critical putts left. The first came on the
17th hole of regulation, when Woods put a sand wedge 4 feet away
and made the putt to tie.
</P>
<P>
   That only set up the dramatics on 18, when both seemed destined
to 3-putt for par and both ended up making birdies to break the PGA
Championship scoring record at 18 under.
</P>
<P>
   May putted first, from about 80 feet up a ridge on the par-5. He
judged the speed badly, and the ball rolled just off the green into
the first cut of fringe about 15 feet above the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had the advantage, but also had a difficult putt he would
have to hit up a big hill, then have it break left and stop
quickly. He managed to get that 6 feet from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   May's putt went in, but he readied himself for a playoff anyway.
He knew the putt would go in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never counted him out all day,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   And what a day it was.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one memorable battle today,'' Woods said. ''We never
backed off one another. Birdie for birdie, shot for shot. We just
never backed off.''

By The Associated PressHarry Oppenheimer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Harry Oppenheimer, the
billionaire South African businessman who led the world's largest
diamond and gold mining companies for a quarter century and spoke
out against apartheid, died Saturday. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of diamond giant De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.,
Oppenheimer was credited with marketing diamonds as the ultimate
gift of love -- an advertising campaign that culminated with the
famous ''A Diamond is Forever'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer was a vocal opponent of apartheid for decades. But
his role as the leading businessman in South Africa made his
position ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   His labor-intensive mines thrived on a migrant labor system that
forced black workers to live apart from their families, and his
companies paid black workers far less than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer was elected as an opposition member of Parliament in
1948, while he was already managing director of Anglo American
Corp., the mining company his father Ernest founded in 1917. Ernest
Oppenheimer also had taken control of De Beers in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his father's death in 1957, Oppenheimer resigned his
parliamentary seat and took command of both Anglo American and De
Beers.
</P>
<P>
   He greatly diversified Anglo American's international holdings
and turned De Beers into a cartel that still controls the vast
majority of the world's diamond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer retired in 1982 as Anglo American chairman and in
1984 from De Beers.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Verizon Communications and unions representing 50,000
workers reached a tentative agreement tonight on a new three-year-contract as a
two-week strike affecting 25 million phone users in the East neared an end. The
agreement was struck with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
and one of two bargaining units for the Communications Workers of America
covering employees in New York and New England. Negotiations with another
bargaining unit for the CWA -- covering more than 35,000 workers in the Middle
Atlantic states -- continued Sunday evening.

Venezuelans Make Largest Drug Bust
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan forces seized five tons of cocaine and
arrested at least seven people in a remote jungle region in the eastern coast
during the country's largest drug bust to date, authorities said today. The
raid, which took place Friday, was the result of a six-month investigation
financed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. The National Guard recovered 173
packages of cocaine about to be shipped to Europe, National Guard Officer
Eduardo Sanchez told The Associated Press.

'Abundant' Oil, Gas Found in Morocco
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- Moroccan King Mohammed VI said late Sunday that a
large field of oil and gas had been discovered near the kingdom's eastern
border, the official news agency said. The king said the find ''was good-quality
and abundant,'' but he did not put a figure on the amount discovered near
Talsint, about 60 miles from the border with gas-rich Algeria, the MAP agency
reported. This spring, some independent Moroccan media speculated that the
underground store could contain up to 20 billion barrels of oil. But Moroccan
Energy Minister Youssef Tahiri in July called the reports ''fantastic and
premature,'' saying only that there were encouraging signs of oil finds.

No Signs of Life Apparent on Kursk

   MOSCOW (AP) -- After struggling unsuccessfully to open the escape hatch on a
nuclear submarine that sank with 118 men aboard, Norwegian divers could find no
sign of life today. Russian officials said most of the vessel was flooded in
minutes when it went down and the country's navy has all but ruled out hope that
any of the crew remains alive nine days after the Kursk sank, crippled by a
massive explosion. The divers, working 350 feet below the surface of the Barents
Sea, found signs that some of the 118 crewmen may have tried to get out but were
unable to open the escape hatch.

Palestinians Won't Negotiate Jerusalem

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- There will be no Palestinian compromise with Israel over
the key issue of Jerusalem, according to a Palestinian cabinet statement Sunday
that coincided with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross' efforts to revive Mideast peace
talks. The tone of the debate became more acrimonious as Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said it was now up to the Palestinians to make the next move in peace
efforts, while a Palestinian official warned that Jewish settlers in the West
Bank and Gaza could become hostages if a crisis erupted. The Palestinian cabinet
said Israel must withdraw from east Jerusalem, which would become the
Palestinian capital.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- In a fitting conclusion to perhaps the greatest
summer of golf, Tiger Woods today birdied the last two holes in regulation and
won the PGA Championship in a playoff over Bob May, becoming the first player
since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one year. Woods now has won four
of the last five majors, his first in a playoff. By winning at Valhalla Golf
Club, he became the first player to repeat as PGA champion since Denny Shute in
1937, and the first since it went to stroke play in 1958.

   BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Rusty Wallace's third win of the season was almost
upstaged today by another altercation between Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart.
Wallace, riding with four fresh tires on his Penske Ford, took the lead with 15
laps to go and steadily pulled away from Ricky Rudd's Ford and Bobby Labonte's
Pontiac in the Pepsi 400. ''I had a fast car,'' said Wallace who has won five of
his 52 career NASCAR Winston Cup races at Michigan Speedway. Wallace, who beat
Rudd by 2.971 seconds, averaged 132.586 mph in a race which took 3:01.01 to
complete.

<HEADLINE> Gore Vows To Help Families  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Accompanied by the throbbing percussion of a
youth drum corps, Democrats Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman promised
more than 5,000 Illinois residents help paying their bills and
battling their insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our ability to do something about health care depends on
whether or not we're going to keep our economy in good shape,''
Gore said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care what the statistics show about these good
economic times, my focus is on families that are having trouble
making house payments and car payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending his post-convention stump speech a decidedly populist
appeal, the Democratic presidential nominee continued:
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's why I'm running. I want to make it better for your kids
and for you. I'm standing up here without any ulterior motive. I'm
standing up here because I want to fight for you and your family
and your future.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing the crowd here and encouraging new polls, the vice
president told reporters: ''It feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You've really got us rolling!'' Tipper Gore told another
couple thousand supporters on the courthouse lawn in Muscatine,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, Gore's running mate, joined back up with Gore after
his Sabbath observance. The pair, with their wives, were making Day
Three of their ''boat tour'' of Mississippi River communities by
bus -- about 150 miles of road from here to Iowa's Muscatine,
Burlington and Keokuk.
</P>
<P>
   At the riverbank in Burlington, a dozen or so Bush demonstrators
-- the largest group of protesters Gore has encountered on this
swing -- competed for attention with more than 1,000 Gore
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll of likely voters showed that Gore and Bush were tied,
another sign that Gore got a poll bounce from the Democratic
National Convention. The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll had Democrat
Gore at 47 percent, Republican Bush at 46 percent, Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader at 3 percent and Reform Party candidate Pat
Buchanan at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With an infusion of $67.56 million in general election funds
from the federal government, Gore was expected to launch the first
of his fall ads in the next week. Spokesman Chris Lehane said
Gore's TV ads, like his stump speech, would focus on working-class
issues with a populist ''people vs. the powerful'' ring.
</P>
<P>
   To the flag-waving throng gathered in a downtown Moline
intersection, Lieberman said Republican opponents George W. Bush
and Dick Cheney were trying in their campaign to sound like
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our opponents are decent, likable people. But lately, they're
trying to convince people they're just like us,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said the Texas governor has done little to help 1.4
million children in that state who have no health care, and he
noted that the state ranks next to last in the country for women
with health care.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush likes to say, 'Don't mess with Texas,' but I've
got to tell you, from I've heard from many of my friends down
there, when it comes to health care, it's a mess in Texas,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan countered that Bush's administration
''is aggressively enrolling'' children in Medicaid and the Child
Health Insurance Program. By contrast, Sullivan said, since
President Clinton and Gore took office in 1993, the national roll
of the uninsured rose by 8 million, including 2.4 million children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's self-described ''compassionate conservative'' agenda has
been making inroads on issues -- such as education and the
environment -- where Gore had counted on dominating.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, interrupted by chants of ''Go Al, go,'' said Sunday
that the GOP ticket does not support ''a real patients bill of
rights'' to help those in HMOs navigate the managed-care system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a situation where, if you go to your doctor and the
doctor says you need this treatment or that treatment ... then some
bean counter who doesn't have a license to practice medicine and
surely doesn't have a license to play God overrules the doctor,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is that all about? That's why we need a patients bill of
rights in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman were getting back aboard their rented Mark
Twain riverboat on Monday, to wrap up their four-day
post-convention swing with a folksy stop in Hannibal, Mo., Twain's
boyhood home.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lazio square off in western New York  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. (AP) - The candidates vying to be the next
U.S. Senator from New York campaigned for votes Sunday in an
upstate county likely to be critical to their success.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrat trying to claim the seat
being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio
both attended festivities at the Polish American Arts Festival in
this Buffalo suburb in Erie County.
</P>
<P>
   Come November, the friends each made out of the tens of
thousands who attended could become crucial votes, especially for
Republican Lazio, county politicians said.
</P>
<P>
   The event, billed as the biggest for Polish-American community
in upstate New York, has drawn such political heavyweights as John
F. Kennedy, Nelson Rockefeller, Pat Nixon and Betty Ford, according
to organizer Brian Rusk, president of the General Pulaski
Association of the Niagara Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheektowaga is the most important out-of-city grouping of
Democrats in Erie County,'' said Steven Pigeon, chairman of the
Erie County Democratic Party. ''Every elected official (in
Cheektowaga) is a Democrat but statewide, it's a bit more (of a)
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   A powerful showing by Clinton could lock up Erie County for the
first lady while even a good showing by Lazio would be viewed as a
victory for the Republican, Pigeon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's working class, Polish, Catholic and many senior citizens
... your Reagan Democrats,'' he said. ''If she wins big here and in
the city of Buffalo, she'll win Erie County. Lazio doesn't have to
win here, just make it close.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for Lazio was strong during a 1 p.m. parade honoring
Revolutionary War Gen. Kazimierz Pulaski. There was a smattering of
Clinton signs, especially near the start of the parade, but Lazio
signs, both the campaign's printed signs and handmade signs, were
clearly more dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent Friday and Saturday in Lake Placid with
President Clinton and daughter Chelsea, stayed in Lake Placid early
Sunday and flew in to the festival after the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the focus today should be on General Pulaski, his
contributions to freedom, to the American war effort and frankly,
to celebrate the contributions of Polish-Americans,'' Lazio said.
''And I can't speak for Mrs. Clinton, I can only say this: I was
proud to celebrate General Pulaski today and to march in the
parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio saw some Clinton supporters near the start of the parade
and he said laughingly to a parade watcher who was grousing about
their presence, ''they've got two months to convert.''
</P>
<P>
   There were already some conversions happening. Larry Colucci, a
Republican member of the Erie County Democrats and Friends for
Lazio, said the group signed up 50 new members during the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was heartened by the crowd he saw during the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this today is any indication of the level of support that
we have in a county that has a Democratic registration edge, we are
going to do very well,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an air of mistrust for the Long Island congressman
among some who worried that he'll just do the bidding for Long
Island and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always felt that these people who run out of New York
City get our money,'' said Lee Hilliker, a Democrat from Amherst.
''I think Hillary's a chance for western New York to finally get
something, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's where the candidates stand on the issues now that
suggests to me where the person may stand in the future,'' added
Leonard Williams, a 56-year-old taxi driver. ''And I certainly want
somebody who's going to protect my interests. (Republicans) may be
very nice people, but they're not looking out for the kind of
collective needs ... that the country has.''
</P>
<P>
   At an event in the town park later, Clinton supporters
outnumbered backers of Lazio although one vocal critic of the first
lady created a stir when he displayed a blue dress with a prominent
stain on it, a satire of the Monica Lewinsky scandal that continues
to dog President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The dress, held aloft by Houston trucker Cliff Gon, bore the
message: ''Mrs. Clinton, the right wing conspiracy made him do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign brought boos and jeers from the mostly white-haired
crowd. Chants of ''Take it down'' and ''Cut your hair'' rang out
from the large group of senior citizens who sat on lawn chairs and
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't risk my life in World War II for that kind of free
speech,'' said Benny Constantiano. ''She's her own woman who's been
through a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As police approached Gon, the crowd yelled ''Throw him from the
park,'' while a few onlookers called for police to respect Gon's
First Amendment rights. Gon was allowed to stay but a police
officer stood next to him during the first lady's brief speech
where she spoke of her four trips to Poland and told the crowd she
''came to see some polka and eat some kielbasa.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of Lazio supporters booed the first lady for the
duration of her brief remarks, drawing criticism of some who
applauded Clinton's polka skills after she and Chelsea danced on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''She showed a lot of respect for polish people up there, which
is more than I can say some of our Cheektowaga residents did for
her,'' said Michael Zalentic.
</P>
<P>
   After dancing, Clinton donned an apron and rubber gloves and
served polish sausages and pierogis to a few customers. When the
caterer loaded up a plate to go, Chelsea asked for just pierogi -
no sausage for the vegetarian first daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio will take his ''Mainstream Express'' campaign to Jamestown
Monday. Clinton will be in Yonkers and Purchase.

<HEADLINE> Millen: No Tackles While Officiating  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was like old times for Matt Millen -- focusing intently on the
line of scrimmage, dodging blockers, hopping around right in the
thick of things on an NFL field. He was even wearing a uniform with
''55'' on it.
</P>
<P>
   The uniform, actually No. 155, had black and white vertical
stripes, though, and his soft cap had a camera the size of a
lipstick container on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Millen, a former linebacker and now a Fox Sports commentator,
worked as the umpire for a little more than a quarter Sunday during
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 31-21 preseason victory over the New
England Patriots in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The game was televised by Fox, and the stunt was the latest in a
series of attempts by the NFL and its broadcasters to try to boost
interest and ratings. The ''UmpCam'' Millen wore is one example.
Others include ABC putting comedian Dennis Miller in the ''Monday
Night Football'' booth, CBS moving its pregame show to a
glass-walled studio in midtown Manhattan, and the league adding
more doubleheader Sundays to the TV schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The good news in Foxboro, for all concerned, was that Millen
resisted any back-of-the-brain temptation to tackle anyone or bark
out defensive signals. Millen, who can be quite critical of
officials when he is in the broadcast booth, threw his flag only
once -- a halfhearted toss on a motion penalty that other officials
also flagged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I have a better appreciation for how tough the job is, how
fast it goes, the amount of concentration needed to know what your
reads are,'' said Millen, who won four Super Bowls with the
Raiders, Redskins and 49ers before retiring in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a better understanding of why a penalty is called. A
couple of times I pulled my flag halfway out and shoved it back in.
I would see a hold, but then you have to know where the ball is. If
it's away from the play, you have to let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb for judging all officials' performances is:
They've done their job if you don't know they're there.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, Millen failed miserably, through no fault of
his own. Fox announcers John Madden and Pat Summerall spent more
time analyzing Millen's performance than anything else going on in
the game while he was on the field for the third quarter and the
first five minutes of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Madden frequently used the telestrator to draw yellow circles
around Millen -- just in case viewers couldn't find the oversized
umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looks like he's going to hit something,'' Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   Joked Summerall: ''You think there's any danger Matt will like
this so much that he won't come back?''
</P>
<P>
   Millen did look comfortable setting up in the umpire's spot,
with the linebackers about 5 yards off the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   He occasionally pushed a defender out of his way, but seemed to
be where he should be on each play. On a fumbled punt return with
7:12 left in the third quarter, Millen aggressively went through
the pile of players to try to determine who recovered the loose
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The microphone he was wearing picked up Millen saying, ''Right
there, easy boys. Right there, we got it, we got it. Piece of
cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen, still in uniform, went into the broadcast booth when he
left the game, and graded his performance an A-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he gave himself a mixed review.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mechanics of officiating weren't all there,'' he said. ''A
couple of times, I just got messed up in terms of which side the
ball comes in from. In terms of the physical part of it, that was a
piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like it was 10 years ago.''

<P>
   It didn't help that the flight encountered bad weather and

<HEADLINE> Dawes, Chow on Their Way to Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Shannon Miller's Olympic dream is over. Dominique
Dawes' and Amy Chow's are still running strong.
</P>
<P>
   While Miller withdrew from Sunday's Olympic gymnastic trials
after jamming her knees on her first event, the first and last
members of the Magnificent Seven to come back were wowing the crowd
and Bela Karolyi with a series of strong, elegant routines.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Dawes and Chow on the squad for the Sydney Olympics are
national champion Elise Ray, Kristen Maloney, Jamie Dantzscher and
Morgan White.
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa Beckerman is the alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Left out was Vanessa Atler, who, as the junior champion in 1996,
was expected to be the next American darling.
</P>
<P>
   Though designed to put the strongest team on the floor, the way
the Olympic squad is chosen has caused quite a controversy. The
weighted scores from trials (60 percent) and last month's U.S.
Gymnastics Championships (40 percent) were combined to rank the
women. A selection committee headed by Karolyi then picked the
six-woman team, but they weren't bound by the scores.
</P>
<P>
   That means someone who finished in fifth or sixth place, for
example, could be left off in favor of someone who finished 11th.
There were signs in the crowd reading, ''Now it's Bela's Choice,''
and ''Pick Talent, Not Name.''
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility was obviously weighing on Karolyi. Instead of
roaming the floor and playing head cheerleader Friday night, he and
his wife, Martha, huddled at the scorer's table, jotting down notes
and scores. His normal ebullience was replaced by seriousness as he
consulted with the other members of the selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Chow and Dawes made it easy for him.
</P>
<P>
   Chow has the tough tricks that can put the United States back on
the medals podium, but she does them so effortlessly it makes
people in the audience think, ''Hey, I could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Think again. On her first vault, her opening event, Chow nailed
a Yurchenko double twist. In plain English, that means she did a
roundoff onto the springboard, hurtling through the air, twisting
twice before landing flat on her feet.
</P>
<P>
   She had a small problem on her second vault, but still scored a
9.537, the second-highest score of the night.
</P>
<P>
   She finished with 76.205 points, just 0.534 points behind Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes has only been training seriously since April, and her
return has been nothing short of spectacular. She has almost all of
the hard tricks that everybody else has, and what she lacks in
difficulty, she makes up for in presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes brought the house down on her final event, the balance
beam. Though the two competitors before her had faltered on the
beam, Dawes did back flips and tumbled with ease.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was on its feet as she landed perfectly, and Dawes
broke into a huge grin. She waved to the crowd and exchanged a hug
with Kelli Hill, her longtime coach, before getting back on the
podium and blowing kisses to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The routine even brought Karolyi to his feet. He left his seat
for one of the first times of the night, rushing across the floor
to hug Dawes and Hill. On his way, he looked into the crowd and
pumped his fist at the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Chow and Dawes mean two members of the
Magnificent Seven are headed back to the Olympics, but the one
everyone expected will be left behind. Miller is America's most
decorated gymnast, and she came out of retirement in January in
hopes of making her third Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   But she twisted her knee when she fell on her opening vault. She
lay on the mat, grimacing in pain, as coach Steve Nunno and Karolyi
rushed to her side. Miller got up and did her second vault, but she
landed awkwardly again and left the mat limping. Nunno helped her
down the stairs, half-carrying her as Miller shook her head and
fought back tears.
</P>
<P>
   She headed for the training room and returned to the floor a few
minutes later, but her night -- and her dreams of a trip to Sydney --
were finished. She sat in the warm-up area for the uneven bars, her
next scheduled event, crying, before getting up and walking out of
the arena.
</P>
<P>
   She hoped to make it on the team through a petition, but after
withdrawing from nationals with a hairline crack in her right leg,
Karolyi didn't have enough to judge her on.
</P>
<P>
   The other big surprise was Atler. It was no secret she was one
of Karolyi's favorites, but she came into the night in sixth place
and quickly lost ground. She botched every one of her routines,
including the vault, normally her strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Her floor routine, done to Russian folk music, is the only one
that gets the crowd clapping, but she ran into trouble on that,
too, as she stumbled out of her last tumbling pass. Karolyi
clapped, but Atler walked off with disappointment etched on her
face.
</P>
<P>
   She finished sixth, but her inconsistencies made her too big a
chance for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   With Miller out and Atler struggling, that opened the door for
Dantzscher. Though she was in fourth place coming into the finals,
she was probably the most vulnerable. She faltered badly on the
balance beam, falling twice, but the grit she showed in her first
three routines probably saved her.
</P>
<P>
   When Dantzscher heard she was going to Sydney, she began
sobbing, burying her face in her coach's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   White, who had troubles at nationals, showed the consistency
during trials that Karolyi loves so much. She revved the crowd up
with her final routine, tumbling and twirling across the floor to
lively salsa music. She had a huge grin on her face as she
finished, and she exchanged a triumphant high-five with Beckerman,
her training partner.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Maloney, who have combined to win the last three
national championships, showed some uncharacteristic mistakes. Ray,
the reigning national champ who had easily won the first round of
the trials, fell off the balance beam while doing an aerial front
somersault.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney stumbled on a tumbling pass on the floor exercise and
then fell off the balance beam, her last event.
</P>
<P>
   But both were all but assured trips to Sydney weeks ago, and the
mistakes didn't cost them too badly.

<HEADLINE> PRI: Tolerated Violent Bosses  </HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's ruling party admits it has tolerated
violent political bosses among its ranks -- but swears not to do so
anymore after a post-election battle that left at least 10 dead,
local media said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Armed supporters of a longtime political boss aligned with the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, opened fire on thousands
of loyalists of Chimalhuacan's new mayor Friday in the gritty city
of 490,000 on the outskirts of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PRI takes its historic responsibility for having tolerated
leaders and groups in the party whose condemnable conduct causes
harm and destroys,'' the PRI's national leader Dulce Maria Sauri
told the Mexico City newspaper Reforma. ''But today we say enough
is enough! Never again!''
</P>
<P>
   Sauri said the party's top brass plans to expel such radical
political bosses from its ranks. The party is in the midst of
redefining itself after losing the presidency July 2 for the first
time in 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Mexico's ruling party negotiated with its potential
threats, offering them permits to run taxi businesses, bus routes
and subdivide land invaded by squatters.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the radical leaders of street vendors, trash pickers,
and poor neighborhoods promised their support and allowed the party
to rule Mexico for more than half a century with relative
stability.
</P>
<P>
   But in Chimalhuacan, Guadalupe Buendia went too far. Police now
are looking for Buendia for allegedly urging her supporters to
attack loyalists of the town's PRI Mayor Jesus Tolentino during the
inauguration ceremony Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Buendia's son had lost the party's mayoral nomination to
Tolentino.
</P>
<P>
   ''The PRI never again wants to see this type of cowardly
incidents of violence for any reason or political motive of any
group,'' Sauri said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 members of Buendia's neighborhood organization
have been jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Local media has described Buendia as a PRI political boss who
spun out of control and ran the town with an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ''She Wolf'' as a teen-ager for fighting off two girls
bothering her sister, Buendia already had embarrassed Mexico's
ruling party once for having male strippers perform on Mother's Day
to draw local support for its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a bus route and bicycle taxi service, she
subdivided and sold land invaded by squatters and ran a
neighborhood organization. Her husband served as city treasurer;
her cousin and her nephew have been mayor; other family members
served on the city council and in state and federal legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Buendia served five years in prison for extortion. She was freed
in 1999, months before the state elections, Reforma said.

<HEADLINE> Slaughterhouse escapee finds haven upstate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) - She narrowly escaped death in a New
York City slaughterhouse then roamed the streets of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   But now Queenie, an 8-month-old, 500-pound calf faces a far
brighter future on the grounds of an upstate New York animal
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Queenie's odyssey began Wednesday when she escaped from Astoria
Live Poultry to be recaptured some time later.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, workers at the Farm Sanctuary, a 175-acre plot of
land in Schuyler County about 80 miles southwest of Syracuse,
picked up Queenie at the animal holding area at JFK International
Airport and took her home.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter is home to a little more than 500 farm animals,
including goats, sheep, turkeys, rabbits, cattle, ducks, geese and
pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter doesn't buy animals so Aladdin El-Sayed, the owner
of Astoria Live Poultry, donated the calf to the city, telling
Newsday: ''God was willing to give it a new life, so why wouldn't
I?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his generosity, he faces $3,000 in fines because of the
escape, Newsday reported.

<HEADLINE> Divers Unable To Enter Russian Sub  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Norwegian divers struggled to open the escape
hatch on a nuclear submarine that sank with 118 men aboard, but
they found no sign of life Sunday as Russian officials said most of
the vessel was flooded in minutes when it went down.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy has all but ruled out hope that any of the crew
remains alive nine days after the Kursk sank, crippled by a massive
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin, widely criticized for his slow and
low-key public response to the crisis, pledged Sunday that ''until
the last minute, we will do everything to save everyone who could
be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not appear optimistic. ''Regrettably, sometimes it's
not us but circumstances which determine how the situation
develops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The divers, working for most of the day and well into the night,
tried several times to wrest the hatch open with a crane but
failed, Russia's RTR television network reported.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, a British rescue mini-submarine was being brought
by ship into position above the sub in preparation for a dive,
probably in the morning though no time was specified, Britain's
Defense Ministry said in London.
</P>
<P>
   The divers found signs that some of the 118 crewmen may have
tried to get out but were unable to open the escape hatch, Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said on RTR. In a grim indication of
what rescuers are likely to find when they get into the Kursk,
Klebanov said there might be a body in the escape chamber.
</P>
<P>
   In video footage shown on RTR, the divers could be seen moving
slowly in the ghostly light around the hatch, 350 feet below the
surface of the Barents Sea. At one point a diver measured a valve.
Another grabbed a shattered fragment of the hull, about the size of
a loaf of bread, and showed it to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, some of the divers were taken to a naval base in
Severomorsk to work out rescue attempt details on a training
submarine and were expected to resume their efforts on the Kursk on
Monday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. There have been
questions whether the divers' bulky suits could safely pass through
the escape hatch if it is opened.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officals played down the chances that the British LR5
submersible would be able to link to the Kursk's escape hatch and
open it. Klebanov said it was unlikely since the LR5 uses equipment
similar to Russian capsules that had failed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting signals emerged from the three-nation rescue
operation over the state of the hatch. Russian officials have said
for days that it is severely mangled. But a spokesman for the
Norwegian military said Sunday it was in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ''We confirm that the hatch is intact,'' Captain Erland Raanes
told The Associated Press by telephone. The hatch is ''so good that
there are possibilities there.'' But he said an unspecified
pressure problem was making it difficult to open the hatch.
</P>
<P>
   New details emerged Sunday of how severely the Kursk was
shattered in the first few minutes. For days, the Russian navy had
insisted the submarine was in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Water almost instantly flooded the submarine's hull up to the
fifth or sixth compartments. The crew in those sections died almost
instantaneously and the submarine became uncontrollable,'' Klebanov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the crew might have survived for a time in the three aft
compartments. Norwegian military spokesman Raanes said the divers
found indications that some air pockets may remain in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian operation appeared to be the first time divers had
descended to the Kursk since rescue efforts began a week ago.
Russian escape capsules tried to reach the Kursk repeatedly, but
the Russian navy reportedly had no skilled divers.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have said the Kursk's nuclear reactors
apparently switched off in the accident, but the new evidence of
how the submarine was torn apart raised concerns that they could
have been damaged in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   With hope for survivors all but gone, officials indicated the
emphasis was shifting to what caused the tragedy on the Kursk, one
of the navy's newest and most powerful submarines.
</P>
<P>
   A probable scenario was that a torpedo in the Kursk's forward
compartment blew up, setting off a much bigger explosion. U.S. and
Norwegian authorities detected two explosions in the area last
Saturday at the time the Kursk was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said Sunday that a World War II mine or a collision
with a foreign submarine were possible causes. The U.S. and British
navies, which often have submarines in the area, denied their
vessels were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Klebanov said there were up to three foreign submarines in the
area when the Kursk was lost and that requests for information from
foreign countries had not been answered. He did not specify which
countries he meant.

<HEADLINE> Woods, May Make Tradition  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The knock on Valhalla Golf Club was that
it had no history.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most thrilling head-to-head matches this side of
the Ryder Cup, Tiger Woods won his second consecutive PGA
Championship in a playoff with Bob May on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tradition has to start somewhere,'' May said. ''Maybe this is
the starting point here.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other major championship held at the 14-year-old course
was Mark Brooks' victory over Kenny Perry, also in a playoff, in
the 1996 PGA. But the most memorable aspect of that tournament was
that the pros tore up the course with low numbers and two
relatively anonymous players ended up playing for one of golf's
biggest prizes.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed what happened Friday, when Jack Nicklaus nearly
pitched in for an eagle at No. 18 to make the cut and then
symbolically passed the torch to Woods with a nod and a thumbs up,
would become Valhalla's memorable moments.
</P>
<P>
   But the 82nd PGA Championship will be remembered because it
featured the game's most dominant player against someone who
wouldn't back down. Both played their share of bad shots, but
always seemed to recover. And when they needed a birdie, there was
always a little bit of magic in those big, leather golf bags.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's got to go down as one of the best duels in the
game in major championships,'' Woods said. ''Granted, there have
been some great ones. But I think it goes up there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both of us shot 31 on the back nine on Sunday afternoon with
no bogeys. And I played the last 12 holes in 7 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods and May dominated Sunday, but the supporting role went to
Valhalla, a course created by Jack Nicklaus specifically to serve
as a host for major championships.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA of America now owns the course. It will be the site of
the 2007 Ryder Cup and, rest assured, many more PGA Championships
since it has already had two played there in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Something dramatic seemed to happen on every hole down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Woods played the last nine holes of regulation in 5 under and
also had a dramatic par save in that stretch. May, who grew up in
Southern California not far from Woods, birdied the first three
holes on the back nine and four of the first five, posted a
white-knuckle par on another and had birdie putts skim the lip on
two other holes.
</P>
<P>
   Both made a birdie on the closing hole of regulation in what may
end up being one of the best remembered moments of this year in
golf.
</P>
<P>
   May had to hit an 18-footer from the back fringe -- TV analyst
Ken Venturi said, ''It's not going to be!'' just as the putter made
contact -- for his birdie. Then Woods made a nerve-jangling 6-footer
for his, setting off a sonic boom from the massive crowd encircling
the green.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had finally pulled even with the stubborn May on a birdie
putt a hole earlier. The dramatic closing putts by each extended
the day into a three-hole playoff, a new format for the PGA. The
lowest cumulative score for the last three holes would decide
whether Woods joined Ben Hogan as the only player to ever win three
majors in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   On the first extra hole, Woods drilled a 20-foot putt while May
went from deep rough to deep rough on his first two shots, then hit
a pitch-and-run that dribbled within 6 inches of the cup for an
incredible par.
</P>
<P>
   Both saw some real estate on the next hole, with Woods bouncing
one shot off a cart path, all the way across the green and down a
steep slope in back. May hit into two bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet under mind-numbing pressure, both made pars.
</P>
<P>
   The final hole was another adventure with both hitting their
drives into deep trouble to the left. Woods advanced his second
shot into deep rough, then knocked his third into the gaping bunker
in front.
</P>
<P>
   But from there he blasted within 2 feet -- close enough to lock
up his par and prevent May from pulling off a startling upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''When par's a good score, I play pretty tough,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   That also goes for Woods and the best championship courses.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis Rested After Injury  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   When Terrell Davis reported tightness in his left
hamstring,
Denver coach Mike Shanahan was quick to take the star running back
out of Saturday night's exhibition game with Dallas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''He said he wanted to stay in,'' Shanahan said of Davis, who
blew out his right knee in the fourth game last season. ''I thought
he looked good running the ball, but we didn't want to take any
chances with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, continuing his steady progress from reconstructive knee
surgery, ran for 31 yards on six carries, including a 5-yard
scoring run and an 11-yard gain on his final carry, in the Broncos'
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Of his injury, Davis said, ''It's nothing major. I couldn't
afford to go back out there and actually pull it.''
Rams:
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Martz said offensive tackle Orlando Pace, who
strained his right patella tendon in the first half of Saturday's
game against Buffalo, wasn't seriously hurt. However, Pace will be
held out of the Rams' preseason finale Thursday against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Devin Bush's strained groin also is not serious and he
could practice Monday. Cornerback Dre' Bly has a pulled hamstring
and is questionable for the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams reduced their roster to 69 players, waiving quarterback
Corte McGuffey, defensive end Barry Mitchell, tight end Alex Hass,
linebacker Bert Berry, running back D'Andre Hardeman and cornerback
Darwin Brown.
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lewis, the free-agent cornerback who fumbled away a
preseason victory after being tackled in the end zone by a teammate
against Jacksonville, was among 12 players cut by New York.
</P>
<P>
   Also waived were halfback Omar Bacon, quarterback Bill Burke,
defensive ends Lavell Ellis and Cedric Pittman, defensive lineman
Carl Hansen, defensive tackle Faiva Talaeai, guard John Kuzora,
tight end Mark Thomas, wide receivers Anthony Tucker and Jeremy
Watkins and safety B.J. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie linebacker Dhani Jones was placed on the injured reserve
list with a knee injury, and free-agent linebacker Vernon
Strickland, who tore injured a knee in the on Aug. 11 game against
Jacksonville, was waived-injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Brody Heffner-Liddiard, a free agent from Colorado who
was cut by Minnesota last week, was signed Sunday because of his
long-snapping ability.
Panthers:
</P>
<P>
   Veteran linebacker Donta Jones was among seven players waived by
Carolina. Also cut were offensive linemen Rob Bohlinger and Allen
Mogridge, wide receiver Michael Dean, running back Derek O'Neal,
linebacker Jason Parmer and defensive back Kevin Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   Coach George Seifert also said kicker Brian Gowins and wide
receiver Octavus Barnes were let go, but the waivers wouldn't be
made official with the league until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Jim Turner, defensive back Tony Booth, defensive
lineman Robert Daniel and safety Deon Grant -- all four out for the
season -- were placed on injured reserve.
Seahawks:
</P>
<P>
   Seattle released eight players, including six-year veteran wide
receiver Justin Armour and rookie quarterback Kevin Feterik.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, general manager-coach Mike Holmgren released wide
receivers Ben Clampitt and Ricky Garrett, offensive tackle Tim
Conley, guard Donta Kendrick, linebacker Carlos Timmons and
cornerback Omar Evans, all rookies.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks placed cornerback Fred Vinson (knee) and center
Robbie Tobeck (knee) on the physically unable to perform list, and
tight end Rufus French (knee) on injured reserve.
Jets:
</P>
<P>
   Otis Smith was one of eight players cut by New York as the Jets
got the roster down to 62. Smith had a poor game Friday night
against the New York Giants and generally struggled throughout the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Other veterans waived were linebacker Casey Dailey,
predominantly a special teams player; tackle Ian Rafferty; and wide
receiver Fred Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Four rookies were cut: defensive tackle Richard Seals,
linebackers Brent Naccara and Kelvin Moses and fullback Mike
Stack.
Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona cut nine rookie free agents from their roster, leaving
the team with 71 players. The Cardinals must make six more roster
moves to reach the 65-player limit Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Those cut were running back Keith Brown, cornerback Renard Cox,
punter Greg Debolt, defensive end Terrell Jurineack, quarterback
Sean Keenan, fullback Matt Keller, wide receiver John Shoemaker,
tackle Robert Skapura and guard David Walden.
Vikings:
</P>
<P>
   Left guard Corbin Lacina will be sidelined for at least two
weeks and possibly a month because of a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   Lacina sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee
on the Vikings' first offensive play in Friday night's victory over
Arizona. He returned for the second series but then left to undergo
an MRI exam.
</P>
<P>
   The test revealed no tear, but his availability for the Vikings'
regular-season opener against Chicago is in doubt.

<HEADLINE> 2 Burkina Faso Bodyguards Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) -- Two bodyguards of Burkina
Faso's president have been sentenced to 20 years in prison for
torturing to death the driver of the president's brother.
</P>
<P>
   A third bodyguard was sentenced to 10 years without parole, and
two more were acquitted. A military tribunal handed down the
verdicts Saturday night in this semi-desert West African nation.
</P>
<P>
   The men were tried in the death of David Ouedraogo, the
chauffeur for President Blaise Compaore's younger brother,
Francois.
</P>
<P>
   Ouedraogo was suspected of having stolen $31,000 belonging to
Francois Compaore. The bodyguards were accused of torturing him to
death in an attempt to find out where the money was hidden.
Ouedraogo died of his injuries in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, two of Ouedraogo's friends, who were also
tortured, said the guards sometimes ''parachuted'' their victims --
dragging them naked down a rocky hill. The guards also tied them
upside down from trees and then burned them with torches to get
them to talk, the two said.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, one of the guards described the tortures as
''military maneuvers'' to get to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has been closely watched in Burkina Faso. Ouedraogo's
death sparked a newspaper investigation by local journalist Robert
Zongo -- who was subsequently burned to death in his car along with
two of his cousins and his driver in December.
</P>
<P>
   Zongo's death touched off violent strikes and street
demonstrations against Compaore's government. The five bodyguards
were named as ''serious suspects'' by an investigative commission,
but the investigation has stalled and no progress has been
announced in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this sentence will help ease the tension in the
country,'' public prosecutor Abdoulaye Barry said after the
Saturday night announcement of the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Compaore, who has won two presidential elections since taking
power following a violent coup in 1987, had been accused of using
his influence to prevent the judiciary from prosecuting the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''This trial has allowed us to know the quality of the persons
who govern us,'' said Ouedraogo's brother, Arthur, after the
verdict was announced.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Golfs, Hillary Campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton closed a short family
vacation with a brisk round of golf Sunday, while his wife, a
Senate candidate, cleared out early to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton family holed up in upstate New York's Adirondack
Mountains to celebrate Clinton's 54th birthday and to stay mostly
out of sight as Vice President Gore began his post-convention
campaign swing.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for the Senate seat being
vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, bookended the holiday with
political appearances. Friday night she and the president both
spoke to a local Democrat Party picnic, and on Sunday she left
their woodsy retreat for campaign appearances in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   When she left, the president was playing 18 holes on a
picturesque golf course skirted by the mountains. Afterwards,
during a stop back at his weekend residence, Clinton caught a
little of the PGA Championship on television, including a dramatic
moment when it was tied after 72 holes. Then he left in his
motorcade to drop by a friend's home.
</P>
<P>
   During a stop to shake hands, a man asked the president why he'd
quit watching the golf tournament before its conclusion with Tiger
Woods' history-making victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''A golfer like you and you're leaving before it's over?'' the
man shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a crew-rest issue on my airplane,'' Clinton told him.
''Unfortunately, I don't have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended his visit to Lake Placid late Sunday and flew to the
Clintons' New York home in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a bizarre bit of street theater in which a woman
asked Clinton to sign her T-shirt, then peeled the T-shirt over her
head, the family's short getaway was uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton set the tone for the weekend when he told local
Democrats that he is now neither his family's candidate nor his
party's leader.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Clinton said, he is going to be a ''citizen
activist.''
</P>
<P>
   That lower profile did not stop Clinton from shaking hands along
the route of his motorcade, and the family drew an enthusiastic
crowd when they stopped for ice cream after a birthday dinner in
town Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The woman with the T-shirt was among well-wishers along Main
Street in Lake Placid. Her apparently impromptu stunt was more
shocking for its audacity than for the degree of skin exposed. She
had mostly turned her back on Clinton by the time she removed her
shirt and exposed her brassiere.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, the family hiked the rugged pine woods of the
estate of Arthur Lussi, a local real estate developer who, although
a Republican, offered his home to the family for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Lussi and his father, Serge Lussi, were in the President's
eight-player party Sunday at the Lake Placid Resort. The Lussi
family owns that as well.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the group was a longtime New York Democratic backer,
Barry Wigmore, whose golf technique was less than polished. Wigmore
showed up early to practice, but still needed two shots to get his
ball only about 60 yards down the first fairway.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Clinton drove a long, straight shot toward the
hole, then stepped back from the tee with evident satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Word filtered through the club house later that Wigmore was
riding in a golf cart with the party but was no longer playing.

<HEADLINE> Woods Wins PGA Title in Playoff  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tiger Woods finally got a fight to the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   All summer long, he had been winning major championships with
frightening ease. Fifteen strokes in the U.S. Open. Eight strokes
in the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   He was no less spectacular Sunday in the PGA Championship, when
he had to reach down and battle back against a player few people
even knew until their thrilling drama unfolded on the back nine of
Valhalla Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the legend grew.
</P>
<P>
   In a fitting conclusion to perhaps the greatest summer of golf,
Woods birdied the last two holes in regulation and won the PGA
Championship in a playoff over Bob May to become the first player
since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was probably the most exciting one,'' Woods said.
''Usually, you can just kind of cruise in with pars and win. That
wasn't going to be the case today.''
</P>
<P>
   Both made five birdies, two sensational par saves and had a 31
on the back nine. Woods outlasted May by taking only three putts in
the three-hole playoff, the last one a 2-foot par putt for his
third consecutive major.
</P>
<P>
   It was the easiest shot he had all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a memorable battle today, and I enjoyed it,'' Woods
said. ''We never backed off from one another. Birdie for birdie,
shot for shot, we were going right at each other. That's as good as
it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   It brought out a passion rarely seen from Woods. The steely
determination in his eyes. The sweat pouring down the side of his
face. The way he charged after putts as they fell into the cup, and
pumped his fists like never before.
</P>
<P>
   Woods now has won four of the last five majors, his first in a
playoff. By winning at Valhalla Golf Club, he became the first
player to repeat as PGA champion since Denny Shute in 1937, and the
first since it went to stroke play in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Woods not only won the PGA. He now holds the scoring record in
relation to par in all four major championships, an 18-under 270
that allowed him to get into the playoff which he won by one
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Last month at St. Andrews, the 24-year-old Woods became the
youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam, with an
eight-stroke victory. In June, he won the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach
by 15 shots.
</P>
<P>
   This was no less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fireworks started on the back nine,'' Woods said. ''This
is probably one of the greatest duels I've ever had in my life.
Hats off to Bob. He played his heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   May tested Woods like no one else in the last two majors, taking
the lead with a two-shot swing on the second hole and never giving
it up until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I have a big heart,'' said May, who closed with his
third straight 6-under 66. ''People weren't expecting me to do what
I did. I think I proved to them that I can play golf.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I would have won, it would have been a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Tied with Woods going to the 72nd hole, May holed an 18-foot
birdie putt from the fringe that put Woods in a perilous situation
-- a 6-foot birdie putt to get into the playoff. It curled in on the
left side, Woods punching his fist and letting out a roar.
</P>
<P>
   Woods took a one-stroke lead on the first playoff hole, No. 16,
but not until after May showed he wasn't going away, hitting a
70-yard chip from the rough that stopped inches from the cup. Woods
tracked his 25-foot birdie putt, trotting after it and pointing at
the ball as it dropped for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Both players made impressive par saves on the 17th, setting the
stage for even more drama on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Woods hit his drive well to the left and into a sycamore tree.
It dropped onto a cart path, bouncing so high it hit the tree again
before rolling down the path onto some trampled dirt. He hit his
approach into the left rough, and his third shot into a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   But May failed to capitalize. He hit across the fairway into
more rough, and his approach caught the ridge on the
horseshoe-shaped 18th green, some 40 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods hit out of the bunker to 2 feet, May's only hope was
to make a putt that was as long as his chances.
</P>
<P>
   It almost went in.
</P>
<P>
   But this year -- this game -- belongs to Woods. He closed with a
67, his 15th consecutive round at par or better in the majors. He
has had at least a share of the lead in 11 of the last 12 rounds in
the majors, unprecedented domination.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan won the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open in 1953. He
could not play in the PGA because his legs were too battered from a
car accident, and the PGA was held during the same week as British
Open qualifying that year.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan never won another major. Woods is still getting warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won $900,000 to push his earnings to $6.69 million for the
year, already breaking the PGA Tour record he set last year. And he
still has two more months to play.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Bjorn of Denmark had a 68 and finished third, five
strokes back at 13-under 275. He was among five other players who
looked like they might have a chance to claim the Wanamaker Trophy
when Woods stumbled early.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal (69) and
Australians Stuart Appleby (69) and Greg Chalmers (70) were another
stroke back.
</P>
<P>
   May and Woods came from the same junior golf section in Southern
California, although the 31-year-old May was a star as Woods was
just getting started. Few could have guessed their paths would
someday cross at Valhalla, with a major championship at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won 26 times around the world, 22 of those on the PGA
Tour. May's only victory came last year in the British Masters on
the European tour, although he showed his mettle by holding back
Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood, Europe's best two players.
</P>
<P>
   At Valhalla, the back nine turned into match play, a format the
PGA Championship ditched in 1958. It more than held its own against
some of the greatest duels ever.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best player in the game against a player few had even
heard of until this week. While Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson and Davis
Love III failed to mount a challenge, May seemed to relish it.
</P>
<P>
   He outplayed Woods for the first half of an incredible back-nine
duel and looked as if he had a chance to finish him off on the 15th
with a possible three-stroke lead with three holes left.
</P>
<P>
   What followed, however, was a scene played out so many times
before.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was in trouble, facing a 12-foot putt to save par. May had
4 feet for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stepped up there and just buried it,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   May pulled his putt to the left, and Woods' caddie summed up the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ball game's on, now,'' Steve Williams told him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first sign all day that May was starting to feel the
Sunday strain of trying to win a major. May badly missed the next
two fairways, but managed to gut it out and save par both times.
</P>
<P>
   Woods hammered his drive 335 yards on No. 17. He pumped his fist
when he saw the flight of the ball aiming for the center of the
fairway, where it settled 94 yards short of the pin. His sand wedge
spun back 4 feet for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the 11th hole, he was tied with May.
</P>
<P>
   Both players reached the green on the par-5 18th in two, but
May's long eagle putt raced by the hole some 18 feet on the fringe.
Down to his last chance, the putt broke two directions and fell
into the cup on its last revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' turn.
</P>
<P>
   His 6-foot birdie putt caught the left side and gently fell into
the cup, and Woods let out a shout before slapping hands with his
caddie. It was on to the playoff, where Woods delivered once again.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy, but the results were just the same.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Pipeline Explosion Kills 10  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- On one side of the Pecos River are three
charred pickup trucks, among the few remnants remaining of a
weekend camping trip that ended in tragedy. Beyond the other bank
are clusters of blackened trees.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion of a natural gas pipeline just before dawn Saturday
swept flames down the river's banks and through the tents where two
families had been camping, killing 10 people, five of them
children.
</P>
<P>
   The only survivors, a man and his daughter-in-law, were in
critical condition Sunday at a Lubbock, Texas, hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials described the ruptured pipeline as a massive
flame-thrower that showered burning fuel on the victims. The
explosion generated heat so intense that sand melted into glass and
concrete turned to powder, a federal investigator said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board Investigator John
Hammerschmidt said it likely will take several months to determine
what caused the rupture in the 30-inch-diameter pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be looking for any areas of human error that might have
occurred or even organizational error,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigators found at least three sections of the pipe
that had been blown from the ground. The force of the explosion, at
a point 5-6 feet underground, had carved out a crater 86 feet long,
46 feet wide and 20 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no indication it was third party damage or foul
play,'' said John Somerhalder, president of the pipeline group for
El Paso Energy Co. ''This was a very major tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The victims were members of two extended families from Carlsbad,
Artesia and Loving, all in southeastern New Mexico, who had been
camping along the river in an unmarked but popular camping site for
area fishermen, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Some had been fishing along the river's banks, their lanterns
set up to light their way, officials said. Others had been asleep.
Official said they would have had no chance to escape the flash of
fire that caught them between the river and the ruptured gas line.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor recalled being awakened by shouts to find herself
and everything around her on fire, said state police Capt. John
Balderston. She jumped in the river, then found she couldn't get
back to the children because of the intensity of the flames. Twin
girls, 6 months old, were among the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The fire burned 40 minutes to an hour and was visible from
Carlsbad, 20 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Near the river's edge, investigators found sleeping bags and the
melted geometric shapes that once were tents. The trucks looked as
though they had taken a direct hit from a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a tragedy that words don't described,'' Gov. Gary
Johnson said as he toured the blast site Sunday. ''This is grief
unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ''concerns with pipeline safety, obviously,'' Johnson
said, and there may be a regulatory role for the state, but it's
too soon to say what action might be taken. He said investigators
first must determine what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt said Sunday that the NTSB already has a proposal
on pipeline safety before Congress. ''We think improvements can be
made in pipeline safety in general,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline where the explosion occurred was installed in 1950.
The line was last checked Aug. 2, company spokeswoman Norma Dunn
said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians: No Deal With Israel  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Palestinian cabinet insisted there will be
no compromise with Israel on the key issue of Jerusalem, in a tough
statement Sunday coinciding with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross' efforts to
revive Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the debate became more acrimonious as Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said it was now up to the Palestinians to make
the next move in peace efforts, while a Palestinian official warned
that Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza could become
hostages if a crisis erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian cabinet said Israel must withdraw from east
Jerusalem, which would become the Palestinian capital. ''The
Jerusalem issue is not negotiable and cannot be so today, tomorrow
or in the future,'' the cabinet said in a communique distributed by
WAFA, the Palestinian news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian Authority's
secretary-general warned that if Israel were to annex parts of the
West Bank in retaliation for a unilateral Palestinian declaration
of independence, the Jewish settlers would become hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel has a presence in the Palestinian lands which would be
on the level of hostages in the hands of Palestinians,'' he told
the Voice of Palestine radio. ''These ... settlements that are in
the Palestinian lands will become isolated and will face a real
danger if Israel closed off all territories from all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has hinted that if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
declares a state unilaterally, he might annex areas of the West
Bank or seal off the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Barak told his Cabinet that the ball was in the
Palestinians' court. ''We are in a waiting period since we have yet
to hear from them about an openness and willingness to discuss the
ideas that were raised at Camp David,'' Barak said, according to a
Cabinet statement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. envoy Ross was in the region in an effort to prod the sides
along, following the collapse of the Camp David summit last month
over competing claims to Jerusalem. Sunday evening he met
Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan at an
undisclosed location in Jerusalem, said a Palestinian official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have set a Sept. 13 deadline for a final peace
accord. Arafat has said in the past that he has the right to
declare an independent state unilaterally, if no accord is reached
by then. However, he and other Palestinian leaders have strongly
indicated that date will be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in the region
following Camp David's collapse, Syria's Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa visited Saudi Arabia and Egypt to discuss the status of
Jerusalem. Syrian President Bashar Assad is to visit the two
countries this week in his first trip abroad since he took over as
president after his father's death in June.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, a Palestinian boy was killed in the southern
West Bank when he stepped on unexploded ammunition -- apparently a
grenade -- close to a former Israeli army firing range.
</P>
<P>
   Moeen Talakhme, 13, was walking from his home in the village of
Kafr al-Burj to pick figs when he stepped on the explosive, his
father Mohammed Talakhme said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, 34 Palestinians have been killed and more than 90
injured by unexploded Israeli ammunition in the West Bank, said
Tomer Feffer, spokesman the Israeli human rights group Betselem.

<HEADLINE> May Shows How He Kept the Faith  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- He was playing for the Roy McAvoys of the
world, for all those ''Tin Cup'' golf pros, real or imagined, with
more longing than sense.
</P>
<P>
   And so the first question to Bob May after one of the more
spectacular afternoons golf has ever seen should not have been,
''How did you almost beat Tiger Woods?'' but ''What kept you
believing you'd ever get the chance?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of the promising junior golfer who runs out of
results long before he runs out of desire. About the golfer who
knows a date with destiny awaits him somewhere down the road, only
he can't convince anybody to give him the car keys.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those turns that sports love to take, May, who at 31
is seven years older, was Woods before Woods came along. He burned
up the same Southern California junior circuit. He set down the
standard of excellence that Woods trampled before Woods set his
sights on Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but in some newspaper
articles, when he was a little, Tiger would say, 'I'm going to beat
all of Bob May's records.'
</P>
<P>
   ''He kept saying it and doing it, saying and doing it, saying
and doing it. And today,'' May said, pausing, ''I thought maybe
this was my chance to get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time he said that to himself, May had no idea how long
it would take to get that chance. He was a college star at Oklahoma
State, played on the 1991 Walker Cup team alongside Phil Mickelson
and turned pro soon afterward, bankrolled by actor Joe Pesci, DJ
Rick Dees and a few other high-rollers from Bel-Aire Country Club
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Barely three years later, his return on the investment had
dwindled to a joke. He earned $31,079 for the season, enough to
rank him No. 209 and too little to keep his PGA playing card. Even
tougher, May knew deep down, he'd lost his game.
</P>
<P>
   That's when May swallowed his pride and went into exile, willing
to scrap for his second chance. He spent more time in Europe over
the next five years than Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. On
that tour, playing in harsher weather, over scruffier courses,
against golfers just as hungry, May regained the toughness that
made so feared as a kid. With it, came some badly needed momentum.
</P>
<P>
   First, May beat European stars Colin Montgomerie and Lee
Westwood at the British Masters. That gave him an exemption into
this PGA Championship. Next up was a 13th-place finish at the PGA
Tour qualifying school to regain his full-time playing privileges.
He played in 17 tournaments, made the cut in 13 and finished second
in June at the FedEx St. Jude Classic. Few people still knew him,
but May knew his game had returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you could come over here and not be ready to
play,'' he said, ''because you've got Tiger Woods, David Duval,
Ernie Els, you've got the best players in the world over here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just May's luck to draw the best of the best in the
season's last major. It seemed like such an epic mismatch at first
that more than a few people no doubt turned on the TV set Sunday
and wondered whether they had stumbled into a remake of ''Tin
Cup.'' But nobody who saw May play a few shots was tempted to
change the channel.
</P>
<P>
   May punched and Woods counterpunched. They traded iron shots at
the flag, buried putts on top of one another and time and again,
salvaged par from near-certain disaster. Soon enough, the roars
that broke out from every corner of the course subsided and began
gathering on every hole where May and Woods took their fight. It
was like somebody turned up the volume and then yanked off the
knob.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was tough out there,'' May said. ''At one point I turned to
Tiger and said, 'Is this what you get every week?' And he said,
'You got it.'
</P>
<P>
   May believed as a kid he would arrive at this place some day,
just not by such a circuitous route.
</P>
<P>
   His rise through the game -- the first time, anyway -- came with
breathtaking speed. May didn't come from a golfing family; his
father owned a filling station and never played the game. He
cobbled together a set from the single clubs his aunt gave him each
year from Christmas. But the first time he stepped on a practice
tee at age 8&AMP;frac12;, May was a natural. Shot after shot disappeared into
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   The search for that swing, for that sense of control once more,
took May more than 20 years, on a detour to Europe and back. It
seems amazing that he found it in the rollicking hillside outside
Louisville, playing alongside the very kid he knew all those years
ago would be tough to shake.
</P>
<P>
   More amazing still, though, is that he never gave up.

<HEADLINE> Polls: Salazar Leads Fox in Chiapas  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Supporters of a candidate allied
to Mexico's president-elect celebrated in the streets after they
said a series of exit polls showed their favorite ahead in Sunday's
gubernatorial election.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Salazar is seeking to end the long domination of Mexico's
impoverished Chiapas state by the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, pledging to step up efforts to end the six-year-old
Zapatista rebellion there.
</P>
<P>
   The election is seen as a major test of the PRI's ability to
rebound after Vicente Fox won Mexico's presidency on July 2 and
ended the PRI's 71-year reign in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Television station TV Azteca reported its poll showed Salazar --
a member of the eight-party coalition led by Fox -- with a 53-46
percent lead over the PRI's Sami David.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the National Actional Party or PAN, a coalition
member, said that exit polls by four independent organizations show
Salazar ahead by 7 to 17 percentage points. ''All of the polls
agree in saying that the indisputable winner'' is Salazar, PAN
leader Luis Felipe Bravo Mena told journalists in Tuxtla Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   But PRI officials immediately questioned the polls' validity and
said their surveys showed David ahead in the vote for governor of
Chiapas. ''We have different information,'' David told state
television.
</P>
<P>
   First official results were not expected until after 11 p.m.,
but the TV Azteca report sent Salazar supporters into the streets
of Tuxtla Gutierrez, honking car horns, waving flags and screaming
in joy.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a decade ago, Chiapas' was the PRI's
stronghold, producing votes of more than 90 percent for the party.
</P>
<P>
   But the still-unresolved Zapatista revolt looms over Chiapas
politics. The past six years have seen four governors, three of
them emergency replacements for men driven from office by crises
linked to the Zapatista revolt.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Fox had said a Salazar victory would help him
reach agreement with the Zapatistas by showing that the path to
change was through the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar, who had been shown leading in pre-election polls, has
vowed to focus on negotiations with the rebels while cracking down
on paramilitary groups he says have been encouraged by the current
state and federal governments.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatista National Revolutionary Army rebelled on Jan. 1,
1994, demanding justice and democracy for Chiapas' Indians. Though
open warfare lasted only two weeks, the guerrilla presence in the
state's jungle canyons has led to repeated clashes between
emboldened dissident groups and pro-government forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's voting, electoral officials and observers had
reported only scattered problems.
</P>
<P>
   For some, however, voting was an act of courage.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of a 1997 massacre of 45 people in the village of
Acteal marched for four hours through the mountains to vote in Los
Chorros, the town that had expelled them and home to many of their
paramilitary attackers. There were no polling places for absentee
voters in the towns where the refugees are sheltered.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest fear the people have in coming to the polls is
suffering an attack by the paramilitaries along the way,'' said
Agustin Vasquez Ruiz, spokesman for the Las Abejas group of
refugees from the Los Chorros area.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 polling places were scattered throughout Mexico's
poorest and most rural state, one where disputes over land,
religion and Indian rights have often erupted into violence. It is
a tough place to govern.
</P>
<P>
   In 176 years, the state has had more than 160 governors --
despite Mexico's practice of six-year terms over the past six
decades.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before the vote in the Zapatista village of San Jose
del Rio in the Lacandon jungle, residents expressed wariness of any
politician.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose del Rio is only 105 miles from this state capital, but
a hard six-hour's drive, some on tracks unpassable to most cars.
</P>
<P>
   The region's impoverished coffee farmers describe themselves as
rebel ''sympathizers,'' but they show the discipline of Zapatista
stalwarts. While friendly, few will talk politics. None will give
his name, saying they are forbidden to do so. All say they are
''neutral'' in the election, echoing Zapatista communiques.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar is a former PRI senator who quit the party last year. As
senator, he was a member of a commission that negotiated a partial
peace deal with the Zapatistas rejected by the federal government.
He says his election would be a key element in bringing peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not friends'' with the Zapatistas, he said in a recent
interview. ''I know them from the negotiations. I am not a
Zapatista. But they have a great advantage with me: I am not
anti-Zapatista.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to give the Zapatistas ''the dignified out they
have been fighting for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Shannon Miller Does Not Make Team  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The most decorated female gymnast in U.S. history
had her knee buckle and her Olympic hopes cave in Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Olympian Shannon Miller pulled out of the Olympic
gymnastic trials after jamming her knee on her opening vault.
</P>
<P>
   She said there was ''really no injury,'' and vowed that she was
still in the running for a spot on the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   But Bela Karolyi had the final say on that, and his conclusion
was that Miller -- injury prone since her latest return -- could not
be depended upon at the Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish she had decided to start back earlier and pick up more
physical fitness,'' Karolyi said. ''But considering her physical
status, it's hard to consider her ready for the full speed and full
pressure of the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the last gamble by coach Steve Nunno came up empty.
Doctors had cleared Miller to return to the meet, but Nunno felt
pulling her out and putting no more strain on her hurting legs
would be the best chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made an executive decision to pull out,'' Nunno said. ''In
my mind, it was the obvious thing to do when you look at it from a
strategic standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't work. And Miller got left behind, while fellow
1996 Olympians Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the disappointment cannot overshadow the most successful
career in U.S. women's gymnastics history.
</P>
<P>
   Miller won seven medals over two Olympics and had gone happily
into retirement and married life after the most recent success at
the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like four other members of that '96 team, she got the itch
again.
</P>
<P>
   She came back in January, a slow, steady progression that seemed
to be taking hold once the big-time competitions began six months
later.
</P>
<P>
   However, a hairline crack in her right leg slowed the progress
last month. She competed in one event at U.S. nationals, scoring a
9.650 in the uneven bars, just enough to keep her career alive for
a shot at trials.
</P>
<P>
   She came back with a 9.712 on the bars Friday night, but no
other routines stood out.
</P>
<P>
   During the first rotation Sunday, her career ended.
</P>
<P>
   Her knee buckled on the vault landing of a roundoff, back-flip
with a half turn. She crumpled to the mat. Nunno and Karolyi rushed
to her side.
</P>
<P>
   After walking gingerly off the mat, she decided to do her second
vault. Her landing was awkward there, too, and she came off
limping, fighting back tears. Nunno had to help her down the stairs
and back down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   They went to the training room shortly after. Miller returned to
the floor and grabbed her warmup suit, then headed over to the
uneven bars, where she was supposed to compete next.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be no more for the champion. She could barely
walk. A few hours later, she spent the tense 12 minutes after the
competition in the waiting room with the rest of her teammates,
anticipating Karolyi's decision.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, her name wasn't called. Before the decision came
down, Nunno said he wouldn't petition any further. His only option
now would be to file a grievance with USA Gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most disappointing event in our career,'' Nunno
said.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan King Announces Oil Find  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- King Mohammed VI said Sunday that a large
field of oil and gas had been discovered near Morocco's eastern
border.
</P>
<P>
   The king said the find ''was good-quality and abundant,'' but he
did not specify the amount discovered near Talsint, about 60 miles
from the border with gas-rich Algeria, the official MAP news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco has had no important oil or natural gas reserves,
importing virtually all its fuel.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, some independent Moroccan media speculated that the
underground store could contain up to 20 billion barrels of oil.
But Moroccan Energy Minister Youssef Tahiri in July called the
reports ''fantastic and premature,'' saying only that there were
encouraging signs of oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a festival for young people, the king said the
natural resources should be ''used rationally, to ensure the
relaunching of the national economy and social development.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the throne after the death last summer of his
father, Hassan II, the 37-year-old ruler has made efforts to
modernize the North African kingdom with measures to promote
literacy and fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Lone Star Technologies Inc. has been searching for
oil on land and in the waters off Morocco's long Atlantic Coast.

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- About 1,800 North Carolina homes and
businesses were still without power Sunday night as crews worked to
restore service knocked out Friday by severe storms.
</P>
<P>
   Two deaths were blamed on the storms that pounded the state with
heavy rain, wind, lightning and hail.

   Duke Energy said more than 17,000 outages remained Sunday

<HEADLINE> Begay, Cink Make Presidents Cup  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS DUNCAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Notah Begay and Stewart Cink won the
tournament within the tournament -- qualifying for the Presidents
Cup -- in the PGA Championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Begay and Cink moved into the top 10 in the points standings,
based on PGA Tour earnings from the start of the 1999 season, to
gain automatic berths on the 12-member U.S. team. Captain Ken
Venturi will make two wild-card picks Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The matches against the International team will be played Oct.
19-22 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainsville, Va. The
International team is made up of foreign, non-European players.
</P>
<P>
   Begay shot a 70 on Sunday to finish eighth in the PGA. He earned
$145,000 to vault from 11th to eighth in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no Olympics for golfers, so it's the closest thing.
I'll be proud to wear the red, white and blue,'' Begay said.
</P>
<P>
   Cink, who entered the tournament 10th in the standings, tied for
14th in the PGA to hold the No. 10 position.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a major and that was more important than the
Presidents Cup team. I didn't want to just play this as a
Presidents Cup qualifier, but it's hard not to,'' Cink said. ''This
is a goal I've had all year and this is the final event for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods topped the points race with 20,002,228, followed by
Phil Mickelson, Hal Sutton, David Duval, Davis Love III, Tom
Lehman, Jim Furyk.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Roberts, who dropped from ninth to 11th, wasn't optimistic
about being selected as a captain's pick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wanted to make the team this year,'' Roberts said.
''I've been playing really consistent all year. But it's been a
long summer and unfortunately, I ran out of gas one week too
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry remained 12th in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was an ice hockey player growing up and was captain of my
team. I'm a fighter and a grinder,'' said Perry, who was 27th on
the PGA Tour money list entering the week. ''I scratch and claw for
as much as I can get out of a round.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said a berth would be especially satisfying because Ben
Crenshaw left him off the Ryder Cup team in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made it known since then that my next goal was to win
tournaments or to make the Presidents Cup,'' Perry said.
''(Venturi) has got a tough job and I don't know if he's going to
go off the board and pick somebody. I just would really would like
to be part of a team atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett, who finished ninth in the points standings after
a final-round 72, said Venturi would be smart to select players who
have never been on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be good for the other guys on the team to have guys who
are enthusiastic about playing,'' Triplett said. ''We'd all be
relative rookies whereas everybody above us has played in a number
of these things. They look at it more as a duty, probably, than
something they're really excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said that's what would make him a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if a lot of other players have stressed that
point, but I really want to play on the team,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in the hunt a lot and yeah, I haven't come through a
lot. But get me in an atmosphere like that and I'm going to be like
a Payne Stewart or Hal Sutton. If they just want me sitting on the
sidelines, that's fine. I'll be out there cheering with my pom-pons
ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The International team is based on the world rankings, with
South Africa's Retief Goosen locking up the 10th spot after missing
the cut in the PGA. Australia's Robert Allenby finished 11th
despite tying for fourth in the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's Ernie Els, No. 2 in the world behind Woods,
topped the team, followed by Fiji's Vijay Singh, Zimbabwe's Nick
Price, Paraguay's Carlos Franco, Australia's Stuart Appleby, New
Zealand's Michael Campbell, Canada's Mike Weir, Japan's Shigeki
Maruyama, and Australia's Greg Norman. Weir is the first Canadian
to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   International team captain Peter Thomson also will announce two
wild-card picks Monday.

<HEADLINE> Hill Chosen To Head U.S. Gymnastics  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Officials at USA Gymnastics surprised some experts
by choosing outspoken Kelli Hill as head coach of the U.S. Olympic
team Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, the personal coach of Olympians Dominique Dawes and Elise
Ray, was as shocked as anyone after being chosen over favorite Mary
Lee Tracy, who coaches Olympian Morgan White and alternate Alyssa
Beckerman.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has been an outspoken opponent of the Olympic selection
procedure, a stance she was sure doomed her chances to be head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't expect this at all, to be honest,'' she said. ''It's
because of my outspokenness on all kinds of issues, and how I felt
about the procedure. I thought I gave this dream up when I spoke
out. It's definitely a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy will serve as assistant coach, the same position she held
in 1996. She handled the decision with class and said she was happy
to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, it was Dawes who benefited most from the selection
procedure her coach disliked.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes finished seventh in the weighted scoring from nationals
and trials. She wouldn't have made it had it not been for the
system, in which a committee led by Bela Karolyi chose six athletes
without being beholden to the scores.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hill's ability to get Dawes ready for her third Olympics
in the three months since she announced her comeback that may have
spoken loudest about her coaching credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very ironic,'' Hill said. ''But I just have to pray it
was the best thing for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi said Hill's outspokenness
didn't bother him or Karolyi.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has two athletes on the team, she has proven international
experience and a lot of Olympic medals in her pocket, so I think
she'll do a great job for us,'' Colarossi said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill also coached the U.S. team at the 1999 world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi is the national team coordinator and will be at the
Olympics, but he's not the coach. One of the biggest questions
surrounding the U.S. team is how much contact he'll have with the
gymnasts during competition in Sydney.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Verizon Communications and unions representing 50,000
workers reached a tentative agreement tonight on a new three-year-contract as a
two-week strike affecting 25 million phone users in the East neared an end. The
agreement was struck with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
and one of two bargaining units for the Communications Workers of America
covering employees in New York and New England. Negotiations with another
bargaining unit for the CWA -- covering more than 35,000 workers in the Middle

Polls: Salazar Leads in Chiapas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) -- Supporters of a candidate allied to Mexico's
president-elect Vicente Fox celebrated in the streets after they said a series
of exit polls showed their favorite ahead in Sunday's gubernatorial election.
Pablo Salazar is seeking to end the long domination of Mexico's impoverished
Chiapas state by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, pledging to step
up efforts to end the six-year-old Zapatista rebellion there. The election is
seen as a major test of the PRI's ability to rebound after Fox won Mexico's
presidency on July 2 and ended the PRI's 71-year reign in Mexico.

Mexico's PRI Admits To Violent History
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's ruling party admits it has tolerated violent
political bosses among its ranks -- but swears not to do so anymore after a
post-election battle that left at least 10 dead, local media said Sunday. Armed
supporters of a longtime political boss aligned with the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, opened fire on thousands of loyalists of
Chimalhuacan's new mayor Friday in the gritty city of 490,000 on the outskirts
of Mexico City. ''The PRI takes its historic responsibility for having tolerated
leaders and groups in the party whose condemnable conduct causes harm and
destroys,'' the PRI's national leader Dulce Maria Sauri told the Mexico City
newspaper Reforma. ''But today we say enough is enough! Never again!''

Rescuers Cannot Get In Russian Sub
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- After struggling unsuccessfully to open the escape hatch on a
nuclear submarine that sank with 118 men aboard, Norwegian divers could find no
sign of life Sunday. Russian officials said most of the vessel was flooded in
minutes when it went down and the country's navy has all but ruled out hope that
any of the crew remains alive nine days after the Kursk sank, crippled by a
massive explosion. The divers, working 350 feet below the surface of the Barents
Sea, found signs that some of the 118 crewmen may have tried to get out but were
unable to open the escape hatch.

N.M. Pipeline Explosion Kills 10
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- An explosion of a natural gas pipeline just before
dawn today swept flames down the river's banks and through the tents where two
families had been camping, killing 10 people, five of them children. The only
survivors, a man and his daughter-in-law, were in critical condition today at a
Lubbock, Texas, hospital. Officials described the ruptured pipeline as a massive
flame-thrower that showered burning fuel on the victims. The explosion generated
heat so intense that sand melted into glass and concrete turned to powder, a
federal investigator said Sunday. Investigators say it likely will take several
months to determine what caused the rupture in the 30-inch-diameter pipe.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tiger Woods today birdied the last two holes in
regulation and won the PGA Championship in a playoff over Bob May, becoming the
first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in one year. Both made
five birdies, two sensational par saves and had a 31 on the back nine. Woods
outlasted May by taking only three putts in the three-hole playoff, the last one
a 2-foot par putt for his third consecutive major.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 6, Red Sox 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Doug Davis pitched a nine-hitter and Frank
Catalanotto drove in three runs as the Texas Rangers beat the
Boston Red Sox 6-2 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto, who was 0-for-9 in the first three games of the
series, gave the Rangers a 2-1 lead with a double in the fifth
inning, and helped Texas avoid a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Boston dropped one game behind the Oakland Athletics in the AL
Wild Card race. The Rangers won for only the third time in 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   Davis (5-4), who got his first career complete game, walked four
and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled early, allowing the first three hitters to reach
base. Jose Offerman opened with a single, Bernard Gilkey was hit by
a pitch, and Carl Everett singled to extend his hitting streak to
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   After Davis struck out Nomar Garciaparra, Troy O'Leary grounded
into a force at second and was almost doubled up, but first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro couldn't handle the relay throw. Lou Merloni
grounded out to end the scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fassero (8-7) held the Rangers hitless until Palmeiro
singled to lead off the fifth. Ricky Ledee and Royce Clayton
followed with singles to load the bases, and Catalanotto hit a
two-run double. Scott Sheldon's sacrifice fly gave the Rangers a
3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Texas scored three more runs in the sixth. Rusty Greer led off
with a triple, extending his hitting streak to six games. Gabe
Kapler walked and Palmeiro followed with an RBI single, chasing
Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck relieved and surrendered a single to Bill Hasselman to
load the bases. Royce Clayton walked home a run and Catalanotto's
ground out scored Palmeiro to give Texas a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was Fassero's first against the Rangers after five
victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox added a run in the eighth when Garciaparra scored on
a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Rangers have not dropped a four-game series to the Red
Sox since July 10-13, 1975. ... Hasselman has started 22 of 25
games behind the plate since Ivan Rodriguez was sidelined for the
season on July 24. ... Palmeiro entered the game on a 1-for 13
string, but went 2-for-4 with an RBI and two runs scored. ...
Gilkey extended his hitting streak to six games with a double in
the third inning. ... The victory was the Rangers first against a
left-handed starter since July 5.

<HEADLINE> Atler Falters at Gymnastics Trials  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The smile that usually lights up Vanessa Atler's
face was nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   This was the biggest meet of her life, and she couldn't get it
together no matter how hard she tried. While everyone around her
was nailing routines at the Olympic gymnastics trials, she
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   When she sprang forward on the landing after her balance beam
routine, she looked up to the roof as if to say, ''What's going
on?'' But the worst part was, she knew.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in the back of my mind, I wanted to go home,'' Atler
said Sunday night after being left off the Olympic team. ''It just
wasn't there and I think God knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler was in fourth place after last month's U.S. Gymnastics
Championships. But she struggled throughout the trials and finished
sixth overall when the weighted scores were combined.
</P>
<P>
   Her inconsistencies made her too big of a risk for Sydney, and a
selection committee headed by Bela Karolyi chose Dominique Dawes
over Atler. Dawes, a member of the Magnificent Seven, finished
seventh overall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say Vanessa is the closest to my heart. She has a
unique talent, but talent alone is not enough,'' Karolyi said.
''Unfortunately, in two back-to-back competitions, Vanessa couldn't
prove capable of representing the country with the expectations we
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa Beckerman, who finished eighth, was chosen as the
alternate over Atler. Karolyi said the United States might still
choose another alternate, but Atler sounded like she wouldn't want
to take the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's fair to everybody else,'' she said. ''I
don't think I was as prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, her exclusion was stunning. As the 1996 junior champion
and with a bubbly personality, she was expected to be the next
American darling. Fans flocked to her web page, and she did a
commercial for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.
</P>
<P>
   When the big meets rolled around, she had trouble living up to
the hype. A fall off the uneven bars forced her to share the
national title in 1997, and falls the next two years put her second
to Kristen Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   Though Karolyi made no secret she was one of his favorites, she
couldn't hold it together when it counted most. She began Sunday
night by botching a handstand on the uneven bars, forcing her to
improvise.
</P>
<P>
   Her vaults, normally her strongest events, weren't strong. She
lurched forward on her beam landing, and then stepped out of her
last tumbling pass on the floor exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Her highest score Sunday was a 9.437, dropping her to 10th place
for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't having fun,'' she said. ''When my name wasn't called,
I almost had a sense of relief because deep down, I knew I
shouldn't be going. I knew I wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just not my day. Not my time.''

	   SCHAGHTICOKE, N.Y. (AP) - Police suspended the search for a
19-year-old Schaghticoke man who fell into the Hoosick River Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Larry Chuba was walking along a log when he slipped
and fell five feet into the river's fast moving waters.
</P>
<P>
   Chuba's friend jumped in to save him but could not reach him.
Several attempts to reach Chuba with wood branches failed and his
friend ran a half-mile to a nearby gas station and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen divers searched the river for four hours and a
helicopter used heat seeking devices to search for Chuba's body.
The search was called off when darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
   One of Chuba's boots was found and officials believe he removed
it to make himself lighter.
</P>
<P>
   The search will continue beginning at eight Monday morning.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Debby Forms  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby formed Sunday in the western
Atlantic, gathering strength gradually as it moved toward the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The storm could become a hurricane by Tuesday afternoon, said
Krissy Williams, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not intensifying as rapidly as expected,'' Williams said.
''But once it starts getting into warmer waters, it should start to
intensify more.''
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane watch was issued Sunday for St. Maarten, Saba and
St. Eustatius and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A tropical storm watch
was issued for Antigua, Barbuda and Anguilla and could be upgraded
to a hurricane watch by Monday morning, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Debby likely will move over Antigua, Guadeloupe and the rest of
the Leeward Islands early Tuesday and the British Virgin Islands
later Tuesday, if the storm remains on its current west-northwest
track, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT, Debby's top sustained winds were near 50 mph --
the threshold for tropical storms is 39 mph. It was located about
550 miles east of the Leeward Islands and was moving west northwest
at 18 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Its track had it heading toward Puerto Rico and the northern
U.S. Virgin Islands after it passes the Leeward Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they haven't already, people in the lesser Antilles and
Puerto Rico need to go out now and get all the essentials they
need,'' said Stacy Stewart, a hurricane specialist. ''This system
needs to be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In Antigua, authorities urged farmers to reap any crops they
could before Debby arrived in the area. The British territory of
Anguilla, where Hurricanes Jose and Lenny caused widespread
flooding last year, activated its disaster preparedness agency and
warned small boats to stay in port.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, long-lived Hurricane Alberto was still spiraling in
the open Atlantic and former Tropical Storm Chris had all but
fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto, the longest-lived August tropical storm on record, kept
going strong Sunday with top sustained wind of about 100 mph. It
was located 1,070 miles west of the Azores and was moving north at
about 6 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto formed Aug. 4 and hasn't threatened land.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of Chris had deteriorated into a weak tropical wave
several hundred miles east of the Bahamas with no immediate
strengthening expected.
