<HEADLINE> Moynihan To Endorse Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan plans to endorse  
Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley on Thursday, giving 
a boost to Bradley's underdog campaign against Vice President Al 
Gore, party officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-rumored endorsement is expected to be delivered in  
Moynihan's home state of New York, said three Democratic officials 
familiar with the plans. They spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore holds a wide lead over Bradley in national polls of  
Democratic voters and has secured endorsement of 109 members of 
Congress, with more expected to be announced this week. Bradley, a 
former New Jersey senator, has been publicly backed by just two 
senators and a congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska  
endorsed Bradley earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of the Moynihan endorsement, Gore's campaign on  
Tuesday announced the endorsements of 10 members of the New York 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore's commitment to working families and the things they  
care about will make a difference in New York,'' said Rep. Charles 
Rangel, D-N.Y., in the Gore statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to have the support of these effective leaders and  
to have them as a critical part of our team,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bradley trails in national polls, he has pulled into a  
dead heat with Gore in New Hampshire and New York -- two early 
primary states. Independents and moderate Democrats are siding 
early with Bradley, though some of his positions are more liberal 
than Gore, polls show. 
</P>
<P>
	He has nearly kept pace with Gore's fund-raising efforts.  
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan's endorsement is scheduled to take place as Democrats  
from across the country gather in Washington to hear from Gore and 
Bradley at the Democratic National Committee meeting.

<HEADLINE> Helms Objects to Cuban Appointee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms expressed dismay on Tuesday  
over reports that an alleged Cuban ``spymaster,'' who he said was 
known for his support for ``terrorism and espionage,'' is being 
approved by the State Department to be posted at Cuba's diplomatic 
mission here. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the  
American people ``will be outraged'' if and when they learn of the 
appointment of Fernando Garcia Bielsa, who was once assigned to the 
Cuban mission to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. official, asking not to be identified, confirmed that  
Garcia has been approved for the assignment but added that no visa 
has been issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the FBI initially registered objections to the  
appointment but later withdrew them. He declined to specify the 
nature of the objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., outlined his complaints in a letter to Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright. He asked Albright whether the Justice 
Department or the FBI had ever expressed concerns about Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department had no immediate comment on the letter. The  
spokesman at Cuba's diplomatic office was not available for 
comment.

<HEADLINE> Woods Eager for Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Tiger Woods has one more score to  
settle. 
</P>
<P>
	Any questions about whether he was in a slump were put to rest  
in a frightening display of golf the past four months. Woods has 
won five of his last eight tournaments, including the PGA 
Championship at Medinah and the NEC Invitational against the most 
elite field this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He is No. 1 in the world rankings and in the mind of everyone at  
The Country Club gathered for the Ryder Cup. About the only thing 
Woods has yet to do is put his hands on the gold chalice that 
Europe has made off with the past two matches. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Woods is ready to do his part.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger at the moment is playing some of the best golf in his  
career,'' U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw said Tuesday. ``He's gaining 
confidence with every season, and it's showing in a lot of 
departments of his game. He's a very, very smooth engine right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case two years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods may have been the Masters champion, the master of match  
play and the hottest property in golf, but he had not won in nearly 
three months going into 1997 Ryder Cup. His swing was in the middle 
of reconstruction and his confidence was on life support. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know when you're not playing well,'' Woods said. ``You  
always hope you can find it on the range, but I didn't. I wasn't 
playing very well, and unfortunately it carried over into the Ryder 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning his inaugural match with Mark O'Meara, Woods  
didn't win again at Valderrama. The crushing blow was a singles 
loss to former factory worker Costantino Rocca, which took the 
steam out of an American rally and resulted in another European 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	He still remembers the cover on the magazine after the Ryder  
Cup. ``Pain in Spain,'' said the headline, accompanied by a photo 
of Woods in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't Europe winning,'' he said. ``It was my fault, just  
like it was Curtis Strange's fault at Oak Hill. That's not right. 
We both played our hearts out. I just wasn't able to play as well 
as I would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year is a different story,'' he said, a confident smile  
returning to his face. ``I'm playing well coming into the event. 
I've had a pretty good summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty good?  
</P>
<P>
	He beat a field in Germany that had six of the top 10 players in  
the world. He won the Memorial with finesse and the Western Open 
with power, the PGA Championship with nerve and the NEC 
Invitational with savvy. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne Stewart may be the emotional leader, Davis Love III has  
played in more Ryder Cups, but Woods could hold the key for the 
Americans to win back the Ryder Cup for the first time since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger could definitely lead through his play,'' Jim Furyk  
said. ``If he goes out there and plays the way he's capable, then 
that's going to be a big advantage for us. That in itself could 
probably bring the rest of us up to a better level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No, he cannot win this cup by himself. As Colin Montgomerie  
noted, ``All one player can do is win five points, and it takes 14 1/2 
points to win.'' That's asking a lot, even of Woods. The last 
player to go 5-0 in the Ryder Cup was Larry Nelson in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	If Woods senses any pressure to carry the load, it also falls to  
the entire team. On paper, the U.S. strength is undeniable -- more 
experience in the Ryder Cup, more experience winning major 
championships, all 12 players ranked no worse than 28th. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe has the experience that counts, however -- winning the  
cup. It has seven Ryder Cup rookies on this team, which could be a 
factor until one considers that five rookies on the '97 team 
accounted for eight points in a European victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Maggert caused a small stir by declaring the U.S. team  
``the best 12 players in the world,'' followed by a caveat the 
Americans know all too well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had great teams in '95 and '97,'' Maggert said. ``We all  
know what the results were there. I feel like we have a really 
strong team, but golf is a funny game at times. And if all 12 of us 
don't come out and perform well, then anything could happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody on the team is in a good frame of mind,'' he  
said. ``I think they're confident about their games. But I don't 
think anyone is taking this thing for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods knows what can happen in match play, especially over 18  
holes. Throughout junior golf and even in his few years as a pro, 
he beat players who were better than him at the time and lost to 
players whom he should have beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also knows what to expect out of himself this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty positive coming into this event,'' he said.  
``And it suits my game because it is match play. I absolutely love 
it. And hopefully, I'll be able to execute the shots this time.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Agent May Head NJ State Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A veteran FBI agent has been picked to head  
the New Jersey State Police, an embattled 2,700-member force 
accused of targeting minority drivers for traffic stops and 
discriminating against its own officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Christie Whitman announced her choice of Carson Dunbar Jr.  
on Monday. His nomination will be considered by state lawmakers 
next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar, 47, who is black, would be the first minority to head  
the agency. The former New Jersey state trooper who now heads the 
FBI's New York field office acknowledged he faces a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I feel a little pressure?'' he said. ``Yeah. I feel a lot  
of pressure ... I have enough confidence that the State Police will 
change itself. The only thing that I can provide is direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar also said he understands the worries of minority  
motorists who fear being pulled over because of their race, adding 
that he believes that has happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general's office has issued a report documenting  
racial profiling among units patrolling the New Jersey Turnpike. 
Attorney General John Farmer has called for new procedures and 
training for traffic stops and searches, as well as offices to 
receive civilian complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunbar would replace Col. Carl Williams, who was fired in  
February when published remarks appeared in which he linked 
minorities to the major volume of drug traffic.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Make Final Arguments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the weeks before the start of the Microsoft  
Corp. antitrust trial, the company's lawyer elicited a surprisingly 
candid admission from the government's top economics expert. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara challenged economist Franklin  
Fisher last September over claims that the company held monopoly 
power because its Windows software was effectively the only viable 
operating system for computers. Weren't there others? 
</P>
<P>
	``Apple, Unix,'' Fisher answered. ``There are a couple of other  
minor ones. Is Linux an operating system? I can't remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange was remarkable as one illustration of how quickly  
the fast-paced technology industry has changed since the Justice 
Department and 19 states filed the lawsuit against Microsoft. It 
has left some experts wondering how to apply U.S. antitrust laws 
fairly -- in cases where trials can take years -- to an industry 
frequently described as moving in compressed ``Internet time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linux, which barely drew recognition from Fisher in September,  
is now the darling of technology pundits and a product offered by a 
few of the nation's largest computer makers alongside Windows. And 
Microsoft points to the extraordinary financial success of Red Hat 
Inc., a leading Linux vendor whose stock soared from $14 on its 
first day trading last month to close Monday at $110.47. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is moving along at a breakneck speed in antitrust  
terms,'' said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George 
Washington University. ``Yet the end result may come well after 
intervening events have rendered the case less important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and the government returned today for closing  
arguments in the trial, the final time lawyers will meet in the 
courtroom prior to U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's 
first of a two-phase verdict. That decision could come as early as 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Houck of the New York attorney general's office told the  
judge that Microsoft wields an ``unshakable stranglehold'' on the 
high-tech industry because of the dominance of its Windows 
operating system. ``No company has been able to make a dent in that 
market in a decade,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies used the company's own  
words against it in the second part of the government's closing 
arguments, continually referring to dozens of internal E-mail 
messages from Microsoft executives and the videotaped deposition of 
its billionaire chairman, Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Houck described this as ``done-in by your own exhibit'' of  
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyers were making their final arguments later in the  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the sides planned to summarize the arguments each  
has tried to construct through 76 days of testimony, since the 
case's opening salvo last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Much has changed since then: America Online Inc. bought Netscape  
Communications Corp. for $10 billion, aligning two of Microsoft's 
biggest rivals on the Internet. High-speed Internet connections are 
much more common, making it easier to download software and even 
run so-called ``server-based'' computer programs across the 
Internet that don't require any particular operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said those changes undermine the case against it,  
though government lawyers point to today's market reality as proof 
Microsoft wields monopoly power: It's still nearly impossible to 
buy a computer these days without the company's software already 
loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the trial's players have changed. John Rose, a senior  
executive at Compaq Computer Corp. who testified for Microsoft, was 
unceremoniously fired in a management shakeup. Microsoft's Paul 
Maritz, who testified as the executive in charge of Windows, now 
spends his time working with outside software developers at the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	And although the government's case focused partly on Microsoft's  
decision to include its Internet software in Windows 98, the next 
version of its software is likely to ship before any final verdict 
and the anticipated appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look out over the horizon ... I don't see a final  
decision by the Supreme Court until the middle of 2002,'' Kovacic 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it planned in closing arguments to reject  
allegations that it illegally wields monopoly power over the 
software that runs most of the world's personal computers, 
according to a company lawyer, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also indicated it will deny that it ever misused its  
influence to crush rivals that it believed posed a threat to its 
lucrative Windows software, such as the Internet browser developed 
by the former Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most recent court papers, Microsoft argued that the  
government improperly considered only operating system software for 
IBM-type computers when it defined the company's large share of 
that market. But the government more widely considered other 
technologies, such as Internet software, when it sought to portray 
Microsoft as a bully toward rivals, the lawyer said.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Ship in Safer Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A cruise ship carrying 1,700 people headed  
slowly home today after an engine fire left it adrift in rough seas 
in the Gulf of Mexico and Tropical Storm Harvey forced a long 
detour. 
</P>
<P>
	The 660-foot Tropicale was disabled by a fire in the engine room  
Sunday evening. The fire was extinguished quickly, but the ship was 
left without power, delaying its return to the Port of Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of the Carnival Cruise Lines ship was further delayed  
when the port closed because of Harvey, which threatened 3- to 
8-foot storm surges in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm turned south late Monday, sparing much of the area,  
and the port reopened this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tropicale completed ``a big, wide loop'' in the Gulf today  
and was heading back to Tampa at about 9 mph, Carnival spokesman 
Tim Gallagher said. The line's ships usually travel 16 mph to 20 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship, using one engine, was expected to reach Tampa by  
Wednesday. It was experiencing about nine-foot seas, no problem for 
a ship longer than two football fields, Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	A tug boat, the Beverly Anderson, was following the ship.  
</P>
<P>
	At midday, Harvey's poorly defined center was roughly 70 miles  
southwest of Fort Myers. Tropical storm force winds of at least 39 
mph extended 115 miles, mainly to the east of the center and away 
from the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, winds whipped up to 50 mph and seas swelled to 12  
feet as the vessel drifted. Ship engineers restarted the starboard 
engine just before 4 p.m. Monday, and the Tropicale began its slow 
move out of stormy waters. 
</P>
<P>
	As a precaution, a 40-year-old man with a heart condition was  
airlifted from the ship early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship still had air conditioning, working toilets and  
electricity for guest rooms. Throughout Monday, Gallagher said 
passengers were playing indoor games and getting plenty to eat. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship departed Tampa Thursday for a four-day cruise. It made  
stops in Key West and Cozumel, Mexico, and was to return to Tampa 
on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	All the passengers will get a full refund and a free ticket for  
a future cruise, Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Tropicale reaches port, the Coast Guard will begin an  
investigation to determine the case of the fire.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Plays Vs. Mets Despite Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Brian Jordan, bothered by a sore right hand, did  
not start Tuesday for the Atlanta Braves but did play in the opener 
of a key three-game series against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan entered the game in the eighth inning as a pinch hitter.  
He walked and stole second, then remained on the field in the ninth 
to play right. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won 2-1 on a pair of solo homers by Chipper Jones,  
extending their NL East lead over the second-place Mets to two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination earlier Tuesday shed no new light on Jordan's  
injury, which apparently involves a bone chip. He plans to play as 
much as possible and hold off on surgery until after the season. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan starting out on the bench, Atlanta shifted Gerald  
Williams to right field, putting Ryan Klesko in left and Randall 
Simon at first. Klesko filled Jordan's cleanup spot in the order 
and went 1-for-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who leads the Braves with 106 RBIs, was initially hit on  
the right hand by Montreal's Mike Thurman on June 22. The pain has 
worsened in recent weeks, sending Jordan into a prolonged slump. 
</P>
<P>
	He is hitting only .135 (7-for-52) since Sept. 3 and has gone  
104 at-bats since his last homer on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	After sitting out Sunday's game against Montreal, Jordan took  
batting practice Tuesday and hoped to play. Instead, manager Bobby 
Cox decided to keep his right-handed outfielder on the bench with 
the Mets starting right-hander Rick Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was up to me, I'd try to play and go for it,'' Jordan  
said before the game. ``But it's up to Bobby now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves and Mets will meet five more times over the final 11  
games of the regular season.

<HEADLINE> Safety Panel Seeks New Bus Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board today  
decided against recommending seat belts in school buses after 
reviewing a report showing they can sometimes increase injuries to 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the board recommended that the National Highway Traffic  
Safety Administration expand standards aimed at keeping children 
contained in the seating area. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board wants the currents standards, which say  
children should be protected in a cocoon of padded seats and high 
seat backs, expanded so that children will be kept inside the bus 
in the event of a side collision or a roll-over. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the safety board urged NHTSA to develop standards  
for the construction of windows in motor coaches and to implement 
those standards within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The board found in many accidents the ever-larger windows in  
tour buses pop out and passengers are hurt when they are ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations follow a three year investigation into bus  
safety and follow a look that the board did on the subject back in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	They are also designed to improve the safety record of school  
buses and motor coaches, considered by safety advocates to be the 
two safest forms of highway transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	On average, nine people are killed each year in school buses and  
four in motor coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares to roughly 42,000 occupants killed in car and  
truck accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	While some safety experts believe that seat belts could make  
school buses even safer, a safety board engineer produced video 
simulations showing that students in some recent crashes might have 
actually been more severely injured if the were wearing lap belts 
or shoulder harnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineer, Kris Bolte, said lap belts ``are not the simple  
solution'' because restrained passengers whip back and forth in 
their seats, concentrating energy in their necks and heads. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board study focused on six accidents that occurred in  
Flagstaff, Ariz., in August 1996; Easton, Md., in October 1997; 
Buffalo, Mont., in March 1998; Monticello, Minn., in April 1997, 
Holyoke, Colo., in September 1998, and Holmdel, N.J, also in 
September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Transportation Safety Board is a federal  
agency charged with investigating transportation accidents. It can 
only make recommendations; it does not have the power to make law. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the federal 
agency charged with developing regulations for motor vehicle 
safety.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Tokyo Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar plunged against the yen today after the  
Bank of Japan unexpectedly announced that it would not ease 
monetary policy. Tokyo stocks closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.42 yen at 5:00 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT), down  
2.50 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and below its late New York 
level of 106.38 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 357.53  
points, or 2.04 percent, to close the day's trading at 17,932.79. 
On Monday, the average closed up 232.99 points, or 1.34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the greenback nose-dived after the central  
bank decided in a key meeting to leave its monetary policy 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	This took financial markets by surprise, as many had predicted  
the bank would opt for an easing in a bid to halt the yen's against 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a statement, the bank said that funds are already  
adequate in the financial markets and that the central bank mustn't 
take policy action just because markets expect such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback had also been under selling pressure earlier in  
the day amid speculation that Japan and the United States failed to 
reach an agreement on foreign exchange policy during talks last 
week in Washington.

the Ministry of Finance, denied the rumors today.

<P>
	Kuroda, who met with U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury for  
International Affairs Timothy Geithner and other officials, has not 
disclosed what was discussed.

<P>
	Experts believe Japan requested U.S. aid in combating the yen's  
appreciation against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices closed higher as traders awaited the  
BOJ's decision on monetary policy. The market closed before the 
announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had said a decision to ease monetary policy could curb  
upward pressure on the yen a boon for Japan's exporters if it 
helped lower long term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower rates would make yen-denominated assets, such as bonds,  
less attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker yen, in turn, is seen as beneficial for big exporting  
companies because it makes their products more cost competitive 
abroad and raises the value of their repatriated earnings.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Weak Dollar / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices retreated again Tuesday as the  
dollar sank for a second session, falling back toward last week's 
3 1/2-year low against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/16  
point, or $3.12 1/2 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.09 percent from 6.07 percent 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to 1/16 point lower, while intermediate maturities 
fell 1/8 to 5/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds struggled as the dollar fell broadly against other  
currencies, pressured by a report showing another huge U.S. trade 
and news that the Bank of Japan wouldn't change its money-supply 
policy to halt the yen's rise. 
</P>
<P>
	A falling dollar makes the return on U.S. investments such as  
Treasury bonds less appealing to foreign investors who convert 
their gains to other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
fell to 4.77 percent, down from 4.79 percent in Monday's auction. 
The discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.65 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields fell to 5.05 percent with a discount of 4.85  
percent, down 0.01 percentage point. One-year yields slipped to 
5.23 percent as the discount fell to 4.96 percent, both down 0.01 
percentage point from Monday's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.06 percent from late Monday's 5.19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/2 point to 112 13/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.89 percent, up from 5.86 percent late Monday.

<HEADLINE> BBC World Television Cuts Staffing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British Broadcasting Corp. is trimming staff  
and shaking up the schedule of its money-losing BBC World 
television news channel in hopes of winning more viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	BBC World, which is available in 200 countries but not inside  
Britain, was conceived as a profit-making venture. It reported a 
loss of $25 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation announced Monday that it would cut 33  
journalists and 17 resource staffers, but said most would be 
shifted to other jobs in the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning in April, the channel will put a stronger emphasis on  
hourly newscasts and drop some of its political analysis 
programming. It will have a half-hour news bulletin every hour on 
weekdays and news bulletins and summaries on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our research shows viewers are using the channel to dip in for  
about 30 minutes to catch up on headlines and reports,'' said 
Rupert Gavin, chief executive of commercial division BBC Worldwide. 
``These changes will maximize viewership and also ensure that we 
are going to maximize advertising revenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two hour-long analysis programs -- ``The World Today'' and  
``Europe Direct'' -- will be dropped in April, the BBC said. It will 
add a daily ``World Business'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	John Simpson, the BBC's world affairs editor, said there would  
be ``a huge public outcry'' over any cuts in the service. 
</P>
<P>
	``BBC World is the best international channel bar none, and that  
is not just my view,'' Simpson said. ``People as varied as the 
emperor of Japan, the president of France and Col. (Moammar) 
Ghadafi (of Libya) have said that to me, and told me they watch 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-based Cable News Network, BBC's rival for the  
international audience, announced in July that it was expanding its 
financial coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Cramer, president of CNN International, said Tuesday that  
the Atlanta-based cable network isn't particularly concerned about 
the BBC changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, we're shrugging it off,'' Cramer said. ``BBC World is  
one of a number of competitors we have around the world.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Cold Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices advanced in  
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after an 
overnight freeze in Iowa raised concerns about harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean gains were minimal after little damage was reported from  
the freeze that sent temperatures plummeting as low as 24 degrees 
in northwestern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The state of the soybean crop remains unclear after the U.S.  
Department of Agriculture reported Monday that 44 percent was in 
good to excellent condition -- extending a two-month decline in 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices also moved higher after a similar dip in the weekly  
conditions for that crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat inched higher on technical indications the market is  
oversold. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3/4 cent to $2.73 a bushel;  
December corn rose 3/4 cents to $2.11 a bushel; December oats rose 1/2 
cent to $1.12 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 2 1/2 cents to $4.89 1/2 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork bellies soared on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where  
hog and cattle futures also were higher in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .28 cent to 66.85 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .50 cent to 79.62 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose .65 cent to 45.30 cents a pound; February frozen 
pork bellies rose 3 cents to 56.77 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Hyde Floats Compromise Gun Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee  
is circulating a proposal designed to break a months-long deadlock 
over the sale of weapons at gun shows, congressional officials said 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Rep.  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is proposing a two-step system of background 
checks. Most gun show sales could be cleared within 24 hours but 
others could be delayed for up to three additional business days 
for additional investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican and Democratic aides said Hyde's proposal includes a  
ban on importing certain large capacity ammunition clips as well as 
a requirement for the sale of safety devices with handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a lifetime ban on the purchase of a handgun by  
anyone convicted of a gun-related felony as a juvenile. And minors 
would be prohibited from possessing assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, GOP aides said any compromise juvenile crime bill  
would likely include a House-passed provision allowing the posting 
of the Ten Commandments in schools. Supporters claim that would 
help promote morality; critics say it is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Any compromise is also expected to toughen prosecution of  
juvenile gun-related crimes, and provide additional federal funding 
for anti-crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde has outlined his gun proposal to Rep. John Conyers of  
Michigan, the senior Democrat on his committee, as well as to Sen. 
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It 
was not clear if any senior GOP leaders had yet turned their 
attention to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun control issue has been percolating in Congress since  
last spring, when two students invaded their high school in 
Colorado and killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before taking 
their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a series of gun control provisions a few weeks  
later, but a slightly different set of proposals died in a House 
crossfire when Republicans complained the measures were too strong 
and some Democrats griped they were too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts at a compromise have moved fitfully since, and Hyde's  
proposal marked an attempt to find middle ground before lawmakers 
go home for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The gun show issue is widely regarded as the hardest to resolve,  
given close votes in the House and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Hyde's proposal, all gun show purchasers would be subject  
to a 24-hour check under the proposal. Those that hadn't been 
cleared by then would be subject to a wait of up to three 
additional business days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's proposal defines a gun show as any gathering of five or  
more sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate-passed measure would give the government three days  
to complete the required background check. The House measure that 
was defeated called for one day, but extended that to other sales 
outside gun shows that now are covered by the three-day rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Current law regarding gun shows requires background checks only  
for sales by licensed dealers.

<HEADLINE> Killer's Parents Plead With Jurors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- The parents of a white supremacist convicted  
in the dragging death of a black man tearfully pleaded with a jury 
Tuesday to spare their son's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what you have found him guilty of. It's terrible,''  
Lawrence Brewer Sr. sobbed. But he added: ``To take his life is 
more than this family is going to bear. This family has been torn 
apart, as I'm sure the Byrd family has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Brewer, 32, was convicted Monday of murder in the  
slaying last year of James Byrd Jr., 49. Byrd was chained to the 
back of a pickup truck by his ankles and dragged to pieces in the 
town of Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors were to hear closing arguments and begin deliberating  
Brewer's fate Wednesday. They can choose life in prison or death by 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's former prison buddy John William King, 24, was  
convicted in February and condemned to die. A third man, Shawn 
Allen Berry, also 24, will be tried next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer's mother pleaded for his life, saying her son had been  
tossed out of the house at 14 because her husband wouldn't tolerate 
his drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a good person, he's a loving person,'' Helen Brewer  
said. ``But the drugs ... influenced him to go the other way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her son was a follower, not a leader, on the night of  
the crime, and added: ``I don't believe it was in his heart to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Byrd's sister, Stella Brumley, said: ``He may  
have been a model child, but he didn't turn out to be a model 
person when he made a choice on June 7 to do something so 
hideous.'' Asked if Brewer should receive mercy, Ms. Brumley 
replied, ``He didn't give any mercy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution called  
Brewer a violent psychopath who never reformed despite his time in 
prison for burglary and violating parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike those of us who wonder what our own potential for  
violence might be, Mr. Brewer answered that question,'' Dr. Edward 
Gripon testified. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday, the fathers of Brewer and Byrd met outside the  
courtroom, shook hands and embraced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish we'd met under different circumstances,'' the older  
Brewer said. ``I want you to know I'm awful embarrassed by this.''

<HEADLINE> Floyd Forecast Called Accurate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The massive evacuations and storm preparations  
for Hurricane Floyd are prompting stinging criticism -- but not of 
the weather forecasters. They called the storm correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the man in charge of storm warnings for the nation says  
he was ``flabbergasted'' by how accurately his forecasters 
predicted Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	People trying to flee coastal communities in Florida and South  
Carolina were angry, not because the evacuation proved unnecessary, 
but because they sat for hours in traffic jams. For that, they 
blamed politicians and emergency planners. 
</P>
<P>
	And folks returning unneeded plywood and bottled water admitted  
they got caught up in the excitement and ignored weather reports 
that the storm was turning away from the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Hurricane Floyd was perpetrated by Home Depot and  
Publix (supermarkets),'' joked Paul Elias of West Palm Beach, Fla. 
``If I'd listened to the meteorologists -- they were 100 percent 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that has me excited as a meteorologist is ... that  
we went from threat assessment to daily forecast discussions day 
after day after day and we were just nailing this storm,'' said 
Louis W. Uccellini, director of the National Centers for 
Environmental Prediction, which includes the hurricane forecast 
center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	NCEP, based in the Washington suburb of Camp Springs, Md.,  
issues weekly national threat assessments for expected weather. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 7, the assessment called for storms and heavy rain  
along the East Coast from South Carolina to New York from Sept. 14 
to 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Tropical Storm Floyd obediently formed in the  
Atlantic and began increasing in strength and moving toward the 
United States -- eventually crashing into North Carolina and 
inundating the coast right on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Tropical Storm Harvey is churning in the Gulf of Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
	``What's interesting with Harvey is that the numerical  
(computer) models at the end of last week were predicting something 
would develop down there. Last week, the hurricane center was 
planning flights into Harvey based on those models,'' Uccellini 
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Herring, vice president for meteorology operations at The  
Weather Channel, agreed that the Weather Service did a good job on 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with how they did. It was a very complex  
situation. You had a very powerful hurricane moving toward a 
heavily populated area,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Tobin, a meteorologist at the private firm AccuWeather in  
State College, Pa., said, ``Overall, on the effects of the rain and 
such, the National Weather Service did a very good job,'' but his 
own company came closer to predicting the storm's path. 
</P>
<P>
	The crucial element in hurricane forecasting is figuring out  
where a storm will go far enough in advance for people to board up 
their homes and businesses and evacuate if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service hurricane center issued 25  
forecasts during Floyd's life and the average error in its track 
was 104 miles, Uccellini said. For previous storms, the average 
error has been 240 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``More importantly, they actually predicted the turn to the  
north as the storm approached Florida,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm edged past the Sunshine State, but with a 104-mile  
margin of error it could have struck coastal communities, so 
warnings were given and some areas evacuated as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The envelope of uncertainly covered the east coast of Florida,  
and with a category 4 storm and the tremendous extent, they had to 
put the warning out,'' Uccellini said. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing that helped in forecasting Floyd is that it developed  
near Cape Verde off the coast of Africa, giving forecasters more 
time to study it as it moved across the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	With that time, Uccellini explained, meteorologists were able to  
collect data from satellites and send hurricane-hunting airplanes 
into the storm to collect information to feed into computer models 
that analyzed the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer models are complex programs that use mathematical  
formulas to describe how the atmosphere works. They use millions of 
readings of wind direction and speed, temperature, pressure, 
humidity, light, cloud cover and other variables at different 
altitudes to calculate the weather at a particular moment, assess 
how it is changing and forecast that change into the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters compare results from several models and use them as  
guidance in issuing forecasts.

	Members of the United Nations General Assembly, good morning. I  
hope you will forgive me for being a little hoarse today. I will do 
the best I can to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Today we look ahead to the new millennium. And at this last  
General Assembly of the 20th century, we look back on a century 
that taught us much of what we need to know about the promise of 
tomorrow. We have learned a great deal over the last 100 years: how 
to produce enough food for a growing world population; how human 
activity affects the environment; the mysteries of the human gene; 
an information revolution that now holds the promise of universal 
access to knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	We have learned that open markets create more wealth, that open  
societies are more just. We have learned how to come together 
through the U.N. and other institutions to advance common interests 
and values. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet for all our intellectual and material advances, the 20th  
century has been deeply scarred by enduring human failures; by 
greed and lust for power; by hot-blooded hatreds and stone-cold 
hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	At century's end, modern developments magnify greatly the  
dangers of these timeless flaws. Powerful forces still resist 
reasonable efforts to put a human face on the global economy, to 
lift the poor, to heal the earth's environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Primitive claims of racial, ethnic or religious superiority when  
married to advanced weaponry and terrorism threaten to destroy the 
greatest potential for human development in history, even as they 
make a wasteland of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore we look to the future with hope, but with unanswered  
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new millennium, will nations be divided by ethnic and  
religious conflicts? Will the nation-state itself be imperiled by 
them or by terrorism? 
</P>
<P>
	Will we keep coming closer together instead, while enjoying the  
normal differences that make life more interesting? 
</P>
<P>
	In the new century how will patriotism be defined? As faith in a  
dream worth living or fear and loathing -- fear and loathing of 
other people's dreams? Will we be free of the fear of weapons of 
mass destruction or forced to teach our grandchildren how to 
survive a nuclear, chemical or biological attack? 
</P>
<P>
	Will globalism bring shared prosperity or make the desperate of  
the world even more desperate? Will we use science and technology 
to grow the economy and protect the environment or put it to risk -- 
put it all at risk in a world dominated by a struggle over natural 
resources? 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is that the 20th century's amazing progress has not  
resolved these questions. But it has given us the tools to make the 
answers come out right: the knowledge, the resources, the 
institutions. Now we must use them. If we do, we can make the 
millennium not just a changing of the digits but a true changing of 
the times, a gateway to greater peace and prosperity and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, I offer three resolutions for the new  
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	First, let us resolve to wage an unrelenting battle against  
poverty and for shared prosperity so that no part of humanity is 
left behind in the global economy. Globalism is not inherently 
divisive. While infant mortality in developing countries has been 
cut nearly in half since 1970, life expectancy has increased by 10 
years. According to the U.N.'s Human Development Index, measuring a 
decent standard of living, a good education, a long and healthy 
life, the gap between rich and poor countries on this measure has 
actually declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Open trade and new technologies have been engines of this  
progress. 
</P>
<P>
	They've helped hundreds of millions to see their prospects rise  
by marketing the fruits of their labor and creativity abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	With proper investment in education, developing countries should  
be able to keep their best and brightest talented at home and to 
gain access to global markets for goods and services and capital. 
</P>
<P>
	But this promising future is far from inevitable. We are still  
squandering the potential of far too many; 1.3 billion people still 
live on less than a $1 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half the population of many countries have no access  
to safe water. A person in south Asia is 700 times less likely to 
use the Internet as someone in the United States. And 40 million 
people a year still die of hunger, almost as many as the total 
number killed in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	We must refuse to accept a future in which one part of humanity  
lives on the cutting edge of a new economy, while the other lives 
at the knife edge of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	What must we do? Well, we can start by remembering that open  
markets advanced the blessings and breakthroughs we want to spread. 
That's why we in the United States have worked to keep our markets 
open during the recent global financial crisis, though it has 
brought us record trade-deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	It is why we want to launch a new global trade round when the  
WTO meets in Seattle this fall; why we are working to build a 
trading system that strengthens the well-being of workers and 
consumers, protects the environment and makes competition a race to 
the top, not the bottom; why I'm proud we have come together at the 
ILO to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	We do not face a choice between trade and aid, but, instead, the  
challenge to make both work for people who need them. Aid should 
focus on what is known to work: credit for poor people starting 
businesses, keeping girls in school, meeting the needs of mothers 
and children. 
</P>
<P>
	Development aid should be used for development, not to buy  
influence or finance donors' exports. It should go where 
governments invest in their people and answer their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	We should also come to the aid of countries struggling to rise  
but held down by the burden of debt. The G-7 nations adopted a plan 
to reduce, by up to 70 percent, the outstanding debt of the world's 
poorest countries, freeing resources for education, health and 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	All of us, developed and developing countries alike, should take  
action now to halt global climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, what has that to do with fighting poverty? A great deal.  
The most vulnerable members of the human family will be first hurt 
and hurt most if rising temperatures devastate agriculture, 
accelerate the spread of disease in tropical countries and flood 
island nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Does this mean developing countries then must sacrifice growth  
to protect the environment? Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout history a key to human progress has been the  
willingness to abandon big ideas that are no longer true. One big 
idea that is no longer true is that the only way to build a modern 
economy is to use energy as we did in the Industrial Age. 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge and opportunity for developing countries is to  
skip the cost of the industrial age by using technologies that 
improve the economy and the environment at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, to win the fight against poverty, we must improve  
health care for all people. Over the next 10 years in Africa, AIDS 
is expected to kill more people and orphan more children than all 
the wars of the 20th century combined. Each year diseases like 
malaria, tuberculosis, pneumonia leave millions of children without 
parents, millions of parents without children. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet for all these diseases, vaccine research is advancing too  
slowly, in part because the potential customers in need are too 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 2 percent of all global biomedical research is devoted to  
the major killers in the developing world. No country can break 
poverty's bonds if its people are disabled by disease and its 
government overwhelmed by the needs of the ill. 
</P>
<P>
	With U.N. leadership we've come close to eradicating polio, once  
the scourge of children everywhere. We're down to 5,000 reported 
cases worldwide. I've asked our Congress to fund a major increase 
to finish the job. I ask other nations to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	We've begun a comprehensive battle against the global AIDS  
epidemic. This year I'm seeking another $100 million for 
prevention, counseling and care in Africa. I want to do more to get 
new drugs that prevent transmission from mothers to newborns, to 
those who need them most. 
</P>
<P>
	And today I commit the United States to a concerted effort to  
accelerate the development and delivery of vaccines for malaria, 
TB, AIDS and other diseases disproportionately affecting the 
developing world. 
</P>
<P>
	Many approaches have been proposed, from tax credits to special  
funds for the purchase of these vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	To tackle these issues, I will ask public health experts, the  
chief executive officers of our pharmaceutical companies, 
foundation representatives and members of Congress to join me at a 
special White House meeting to strengthen incentives for research 
and development, to work with, not against the private sector to 
meet our common goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The second resolution I hope we will make today is to strengthen  
the capacity of the international community to prevent, and 
whenever possible to stop, outbreaks of mass killing and 
displacement. 
</P>
<P>
	This requires, as we all know, shared responsibility, like the  
one West African nations accepted when they acted to restore peace 
in Sierra Leone; the one 19 democracies in NATO embraced to stop 
ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, in Kosovo; the one Asian and Pacific 
nations have now assumed in East Timor, with the strong support 
from the entire United Nations, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary-General Annan spoke for all of us during the Kosovo  
conflict and more recently in regard to East Timor when he said 
that ethnic cleansers and mass murderers can find no refuge in the 
United Nations, no source of comfort or justification in its 
charter. 
</P>
<P>
	We must do more to make these words real. Of course, we must  
approach this challenge with some considerable degree of humility. 
It is easy to say never again, but much harder to make it so. 
Promising too much can be as cruel as caring too little. 
</P>
<P>
	But difficulties, dangers and costs are not an argument for  
doing nothing. When we are faced with the deliberate organized 
campaigns to murder whole peoples or expel them from their land, 
the care of victims is important, but not enough. We should work to 
end the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Our response in every case cannot or should not be the same.  
Sometimes collective military force is both appropriate and 
feasible. Sometimes concerted economic and political pressure 
combined with diplomacy is a better answer, as it was in making 
possible the introduction of forces to East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course the way the international community responds will  
depend upon the capacity of countries to act and on their 
perception of their national interests. NATO acted in Kosovo, for 
example, to stop a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing in a place 
where we had important interests at stake and the ability to act 
collectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The same considerations brought Nigerian troops and their  
partners to Sierra Leone and Australians and others to East Timor. 
That is proper so long as we work together, support each other and 
do not abdicate our collective responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	I know that some are troubled that the United States and others  
cannot respond to every humanitarian catastrophe in the world. We 
cannot do everything everywhere. But simply because we have 
different interests in different parts of the world does not mean 
we can be indifferent to the destruction of innocents in any part 
of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	That is why we have supported the efforts of Africans to resolve  
the deadly conflicts that have raged through parts of their 
continent; why we are working with friends in Africa to build the 
Africa Crisis Response Initiative, which has now trained more than 
4,000 peacekeepers from six countries; why we are helping to 
establish an international coalition against genocide, to bring 
nations together to stop the flow of money and arms to those who 
commit crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also critical need for countries emerging from  
conflicts to build police institutions accountable to people and 
the law, often with the help of civilian police from other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	We need international forces with the training to fill the gap  
between local police and military peacekeepers, as French, 
Argentine, Italian and other military police have done in Haiti and 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	We will work with our partners in the U.N. to continue to ensure  
such forces can deploy when they're needed. 
</P>
<P>
	What is the role of the U.N. in preventing mass slaughter and  
dislocation? Very large. Even in Kosovo, NATO's actions followed a 
clear consensus expressed in several Security Council resolutions: 
that the atrocities committed by Serb forces were unacceptable, 
that the international community had a compelling interest in 
seeing them end. Had we chosen to do nothing in the face of this 
brutality, I do not believe we would have strengthened the United 
Nations. Instead, we would have risked discrediting everything it 
stands for. 
</P>
<P>
	By acting as we did, we helped to vindicate the principles and  
purposes of the U.N. Charter, to give the U.N. the opportunity it 
now has to play the central role in shaping Kosovo's future. In the 
real world, principles often collide and tough choices must be 
made. The outcome in Kosovo is hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, as we enter this new era, let our third resolution be  
to protect our children against the possibility that nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons will never be used again. The last 
millennium has seen constant advances in the destructive power of 
weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	In the coming millennium, this trend can continue. Or if we  
choose, we can reverse it with global standards universally 
respected. 
</P>
<P>
	We've made more progress than many realize. After the collapse  
of the Soviet Union, Belarus, Kazakstan and Ukraine courageously 
chose to give up their nuclear weapons. America and Russia have 
moved forward with substantial arms reduction. President Yeltsin 
and I meet in June, even as we await Russian ratification of START 
II to begin talks on a START III treaty that will cut our Cold War 
arsenals by 80 percent from their height. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has joined the nonproliferation treat, capping a process  
that has almost totally eliminated the threat of nuclear 
proliferation in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	We banned chemical weapons from the earth, though we must  
implement the commitment fully and gain universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	One hundred fifty-two nations have signed the Comprehensive Test  
Ban Treaty. And while India and Pakistan did test nuclear weapons 
last year, the international reaction proved that the global 
consensus against proliferation is very strong. 
</P>
<P>
	We need to bolster the standards to reinforce that consensus. We  
must reaffirm our commitment to the NPT, strengthen the biological 
weapons convention, make fast progress on a treaty to ban 
production of fissile materials. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep existing stocks from the wrong hands, we should  
strengthen the convention on physical protection of nuclear 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
	And today, again I ask our Congress to approve the Comprehensive  
Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	We must stop the spread of nuclear weapons materials and  
expertise at the source. Since 1992, we have worked with Russia and 
the other nations of the former Soviet Union to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	We are expanding that effort because challenges remain. But thus  
far we can say that the nightmare scenario of deadly weapons 
flowing unchecked across borders, of scientists selling their 
services en masse to the highest bidder has been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	Now we must work to deny weapons of mass destruction to those  
who would use them. 
</P>
<P>
	For almost a decade, nations have stood together to keep the  
Iraqi regime from threatening its people and the world with such 
weapons. Despite all the obstacles Saddam Hussein has placed in our 
path, we must continue to ease the suffering of the people of Iraq. 
At the same time, we cannot allow the government of Iraq to flout 
40 -- and I say 40 -- successive U.N. Security Council resolutions 
and to rebuild his arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as important is the challenge of keeping deadly weapons  
away from terrorist groups. They may have weaker capabilities than 
states, but they have fewer compunctions about using such weapons. 
The possibility that terrorists will threaten us with weapons of 
mass destruction can be met with neither panic nor complacency. It 
requires serious, deliberate, disciplined concern and effective 
cooperation from all of us. 
</P>
<P>
	There are many other challenges. Today I have just spoken about  
three: the need to do something about the world's poor and to put a 
human face on the global economy; the need to do more to prevent 
killing and dislocation of innocents; the need to do more to assure 
that weapons of mass destruction will never be used on our 
children. I believe they are the most important. 
</P>
<P>
	In meeting them, the United Nations is indispensable. It is  
precisely because we are committed to the U.N. that we have worked 
hard to support the management -- effective management of this body. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United States also has the responsibility to equip the  
U.N. with the resources it needs to be effective. As I think most 
of you know, I have strongly supported the United States meeting 
all its financial obligations to the United Nations, and I will 
continue to do so. We will do our very best to succeed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cold War ended, the United States could have chosen to  
turn away from the opportunities and dangers of the world. Instead 
we have tried to be engaged, involved and active. 
</P>
<P>
	We know this moment of unique prosperity and power for the  
United States is a source of concern to many. 
</P>
<P>
	I can only answer by saying this. In the seven years that I have  
been privileged to come here to speak to this body, America has 
tried to be a force for peace. We believe we are better off when 
nations resolve their differences by force of argument rather than 
force of arms. We have sought to help former adversaries like 
Russia and China become prosperous, stable members of the world 
community because we feel far more threatened by the potential 
weakness of the world's leading nations than by their strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of imposing our values on others, we have sought to  
promote a system of government -- democracy -- that empowers people 
to choose their own destinies according to their own values and 
aspirations. We have sought to keep our markets open, because we 
believe a strong world economy benefits our own workers and 
businesses as well as the people of the world who are selling to 
us. 
</P>
<P>
	I hope that we have been and will continue to be good partners  
with the rest of you in the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long ago I went to a refugee camp in Macedonia. The people I  
met there, children and adults alike, had suffered horrible, 
horrible abuses. But they had never given up hope because they 
believed that there is an international community that stood for 
their dignity and their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	I want to make sure that 20 or 50 or 100 years from now, people  
everywhere will still believe that about our United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	So let us resolve in the bright dawn of this new millennium to  
bring an era in which our desire to create will overwhelm our 
capacity to destroy. If we do that, then through the United Nations 
and farsighted leaders, humanity finally can live up to its name. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Backs Continued Russia Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing new  
rules to fight money laundering, including requirements that 
storefront check cashers, brokerage firms and casinos notify 
authorities of suspicious activities the way banks do. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal surfaced in testimony Tuesday as the House Banking  
Committee began an inquiry into allegations of a huge 
money-laundering scheme involving the Russian mob and the Bank of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged, and U.S. investigators have not  
commented publicly on the case in which as much as $10 billion was 
alleged to have been funneled through the Bank of New York, the 
nation's 15th-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the leadoff witness for two  
days of hearings by the banking panel, defended the administration 
policy of continuing to provide aid to Russia. Republican leaders 
have denounced the policy in recent weeks as allegations of the 
money-laundering scheme grew. And some critics are blaming the 
episode on Vice President Al Gore, who maintains close ties with 
several Russian leaders and plays a major role in U.S.-Russian 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the United States must keep supporting Russia or  
risk being branded as a scapegoat for Russia's failures. He told 
the lawmakers the Clinton administration, while demanding reform by 
the Russians, must keep in mind the importance of continued 
engagement because of that country's huge arsenal of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``To quarantine, contain or write off Russia as too corrupt  
would ill serve our national interest,'' Summers testified. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the International Monetary Fund, at U.S. urging,  
already has acted to ensure that billions of dollars in loans from 
the West are used for legitimate purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary also previewed the administration's proposal, to  
be formally released Thursday, for strengthening laws to make it 
more difficult for criminals to clean illicit earnings through 
banks and other financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of billions of dollars in drug-trafficking proceeds and  
other illegal gains are put into the nation's financial system each 
year. With the advent of tighter anti-money-laundering laws for 
banks, such as a requirement that they report to authorities cash 
transactions of $10,000 or more, many launderers have started using 
other channels such as money transmitters like Western Union and 
storefront businesses that cash checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus the administration's proposal to extend to money service  
businesses, brokerage firms and casinos the banks' requirement to 
file so-called suspicious activity reports. Summers said 
legislation also would be proposed to apply U.S. money-laundering 
laws to a wider range of international criminals, including corrupt 
foreign officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are part of the administration's first national  
money-laundering strategy, which Congress directed the Treasury and 
Justice departments to submit early this year, before the Bank of 
New York case broke. The package seeks to bolster international 
cooperation in investigating money laundering and strengthen U.S. 
enforcement through tighter regulation of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the Banking Committee's chairman, said  
he also will introduce legislation to tighten laws and ``pierce the 
veil of secrecy that for too long has made it possible'' for 
offshore financial institutions to skirt U.S. laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money laundering may seem like a relatively modest crime, but  
it is a window into greater crimes'' that create the illegal funds, 
Leach said. He cited Russian government estimates that criminal 
groups control 40 percent of the country's economy and half its 
banking assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., was critical of the government's  
current policy. She challenged Summers to explain why no banks have 
been shut down for laundering money. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development Tuesday, Switzerland's government  
announced that Swiss banks have frozen $16.8 million in accounts 
suspected to be linked to the Russian money-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, World Bank President James Wolfensohn said the  
bank found no misuse of its funds in Russia in investigations of 
its 34 projects there.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Sent to Amtrak Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUMBERLAND, Md. (AP) -- Federal investigators were sent to look  
into a slow-speed collision between an Amtrak train and a CSX 
freight train in a rail yard. Forty people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amtrak train, traveling from Chicago to Washington, collided  
just before noon Monday with the freight train, which was backing 
into the yard, CSX spokeswoman Kathy Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	``First there was screeching, shaking and then a solid impact,  
which threw me to the floor and into the seat in front of me,'' 
said passenger James Reed of Olathe, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact buckled the lead Amtrak locomotive and the rear  
freight car. All cars remained upright, though some derailed. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board sent two investigators  
to the scene in western Maryland. They will examine recorders to 
see how fast the trains were moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Both trains were receiving instructions from CSX's national  
control center in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Hare said 141 people were on board the  
Capitol Limited train, including 16 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the injured were treated for minor scrapes and bruises,  
according to Western Maryland Health System officials. Five were 
hospitalized overnight and all were in good condition today, 
spokeswoman Kathy Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured on the 83-car CSX train, which was carrying  
new cars.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Inflation Rises To 1.2 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The average annual inflation rate in  
the 11 countries that have adopted the euro as their common 
currency rose to 1.2 percent in August from 1.1 percent the 
previous month, the European Union's statistical office reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second consecutive monthly rise in average annual  
inflation for the ``euro zone'' which posted a rate of 0.9 percent 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the whole 15-nation European Union also rose to 1.2  
percent in August from 1.1 percent in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said rising oil prices, special taxes, summer sales and  
wage agreements were behind the slight increase. EU inflation 
remains largely stable. In August 1998, EU inflation was 1.3 
percent, and the average across the euro zone was 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest August rate was registered in the Netherlands with  
2.5 percent. Denmark and Ireland followed, both on 2.4 percent. 
Lowest rates were in France and Austria with 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Two Big Dairy Cos. Consolidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Suiza Foods Corp., the nation's leading milk  
processor, is acquiring Southern Foods Group, a company with such 
well-known regional dairy brands as Borden, Elsie and Meadow Gold. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would be a national dairy powerhouse, with  
milk distribution in 46 states and combined annual sales of $6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Southern takes us into geography that we weren't in, and but  
for Southern, we wouldn't be able to get into,'' said Suiza 
chairman Gregg Engles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were one of the few big independent producers that we had  
an opportunity to do something with,'' he said. ``It really makes 
us a national dairy company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to dairy products, Suiza produces packaged food and  
ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This clearly establishes Suiza as the leader of the fluid-milk  
market, with about a 20 percent market share,'' said analyst 
Romitha Mally of Goldman Sachs. She said the acquisition makes 
Suiza a national player and therefore more attractive to large 
supermarket chains that want to buy goods from suppliers with broad 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a terrific deal. Suiza is breaking away from the  
pack,'' said John O'Neil of PaineWebber. He said Suiza now has a 
stable of strong regional milk labels and will try to increase 
sales of nationally known brands such as Borden. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza was founded in 1993 as a holding company for acquiring  
food and dairy processors and has grown rapidly through 
acquisitions, especially in the Southeast and Southern California, 
to 56 processing plants and 12,400 employees. It has made more than 
30 acquisitions in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza's main rival, Dean Foods Co. of Franklin Park, Ill., with  
fiscal 1999 sales of nearly $3.8 billion, has also been acquiring 
smaller operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza and Southern, both based in Dallas, will form a joint  
venture to include all domestic milk processing activities of both 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza will own 66.2 percent of the venture, to be called the  
Suiza Fluid Dairy Group, with Southern's partner, Dairy Farmers of 
America Inc., owning the other 33.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	No cash will change hands in the deal, said Engles, but each  
company will contribute its assets to the joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Suiza had revenue of $3.3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Southern, with revenue of nearly $1.2 billion in 1998, has 25  
plants and 5,100 employees. It is concentrated in Texas and 
Oklahoma but serves other markets, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting the full-year revenues of operations that Suiza has  
acquired during the past year, the revenue of the combined company 
for the 12 months ended June 30 would be about $6 billion, said 
Suiza's chief financial officer, Barry Fromberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza said the combination would generate $10 million in cost  
savings in the first year. But Engles said no layoffs of plant 
closings are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Foods chief executive, Pete Schenkel, will become  
president of domestic milk operations and board vice chairman of 
the new joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza also announced that its president and chief operating  
officer, G. Irwin Gordon, is leaving the company to pursue other, 
unspecified interests. His duties will be divided among several 
executives at different divisions, said Bill Brick, chief operating 
officer for U.S. fluid dairy operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza plans to obtain up to $2 billion of new financing to  
refinance the debt of both companies, for future acquisitions and 
other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the  
transaction, which faces a federal antitrust review. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Suiza rose 6 1/4  
cents to $33.31 1/4 a share.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Backs Continued Russia Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing new  
rules to fight money laundering, including requirements that 
storefront check cashers, brokerage firms and casinos notify 
authorities of suspicious activities the way banks do. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal surfaced in testimony Tuesday as the House Banking  
Committee began an inquiry into allegations of a huge 
money-laundering scheme involving the Russian mob and the Bank of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged, and U.S. investigators have not  
commented publicly on the case in which as much as $10 billion was 
alleged to have been funneled through the Bank of New York, the 
nation's 15th-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the leadoff witness for two  
days of hearings by the banking panel, defended the administration 
policy of continuing to provide aid to Russia. Republican leaders 
have denounced the policy in recent weeks as allegations of the 
money-laundering scheme grew. And some critics are blaming the 
episode on Vice President Al Gore, who maintains close ties with 
several Russian leaders and plays a major role in U.S.-Russian 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the United States must keep supporting Russia or  
risk being branded as a scapegoat for Russia's failures. He told 
the lawmakers the Clinton administration, while demanding reform by 
the Russians, must keep in mind the importance of continued 
engagement because of that country's huge arsenal of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``To quarantine, contain or write off Russia as too corrupt  
would ill serve our national interest,'' Summers testified. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the International Monetary Fund, at U.S. urging,  
already has acted to ensure that billions of dollars in loans from 
the West are used for legitimate purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary also previewed the administration's proposal, to  
be formally released Thursday, for strengthening laws to make it 
more difficult for criminals to clean illicit earnings through 
banks and other financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of billions of dollars in drug-trafficking proceeds and  
other illegal gains are put into the nation's financial system each 
year. With the advent of tighter anti-money-laundering laws for 
banks, such as a requirement that they report to authorities cash 
transactions of $10,000 or more, many launderers have started using 
other channels such as money transmitters like Western Union and 
storefront businesses that cash checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus the administration's proposal to extend to money service  
businesses, brokerage firms and casinos the banks' requirement to 
file so-called suspicious activity reports. Summers said 
legislation also would be proposed to apply U.S. money-laundering 
laws to a wider range of international criminals, including corrupt 
foreign officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are part of the administration's first national  
money-laundering strategy, which Congress directed the Treasury and 
Justice departments to submit early this year, before the Bank of 
New York case broke. The package seeks to bolster international 
cooperation in investigating money laundering and strengthen U.S. 
enforcement through tighter regulation of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the Banking Committee's chairman, said  
he also will introduce legislation to tighten laws and ``pierce the 
veil of secrecy that for too long has made it possible'' for 
offshore financial institutions to skirt U.S. laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money laundering may seem like a relatively modest crime, but  
it is a window into greater crimes'' that create the illegal funds, 
Leach said. He cited Russian government estimates that criminal 
groups control 40 percent of the country's economy and half its 
banking assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., was critical of the government's  
current policy. She challenged Summers to explain why no banks have 
been shut down for laundering money. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development Tuesday, Switzerland's government  
announced that Swiss banks have frozen $16.8 million in accounts 
suspected to be linked to the Russian money-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, World Bank President James Wolfensohn said the  
bank found no misuse of its funds in Russia in investigations of 
its 34 projects there.

<HEADLINE> Caddie Recalls 1927 Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass.(AP) -- Fred ``Jada'' Hill was a top golfer in  
Massachusetts for decades. But only now, at 89, is he enjoying his 
moment of wide celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill is one of the last connections to the first Ryder Cup -- the  
caddie for the great Gene Sarazen at Worcester Country Club in 
1927. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, he was back at the Ryder Cup. This time at The  
Country Club, just outside Boston, where the tournament begins 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nothing like this back then,'' Hill said as about  
35,000 spectators watched the players practice -- 15 times as many 
people as had been at Worcester for the actual competition in '27. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryder Cup began mainly to establish goodwill between  
American and British golfers. The Americans played hard when they 
had to, winning 9 1/2 to 2 1/2 in what was then a two-day competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill recalls Sarazen getting trounced by Charles Whitcombe in  
the singles match. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came back strong on the second nine. He was very  
competitive,'' Hill said. ``But when he heard the Americans had won 
most of the matches that day, he three-putted on purpose on the 
18th hole to give the British guy a half a point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its gentlemanly roots, the tournament has grown into  
golf's most fiercely contested event. 
</P>
<P>
	At Worcester, the toughest competition might have been among the  
local caddies, with 200 of them trying to make some money off the 
Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill said he got a job because he was a top caddie. And it  
didn't hurt that he always bought some of the candy the caddie 
master sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was paid $80 for carrying Sarazen's bags during a week of  
practice and play. The going rate for an 18-hole loop at the time 
was 75 cents, which is what Hill earned a couple of years earlier 
when he caddied for British professional Jim Barnes in the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a very large amount back then. Of course, Sarazen had  
been a caddie, so he treated us well,'' said Hill, noting that the 
captain of that first American Ryder Cup team, Walter Hagen, also 
had been a caddie. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American pros were just regular guys. They were fun to be  
around,'' Hill said. ``But the British people were different. They 
were very stiff, smoked pipes. It was funny, the difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``Jada'' in grammar school because he was always  
singing a popular song that started with that word, Hill started 
caddying and playing golf at age 10. He won a city title, some club 
titles and four New England Public Linx titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He also held the course record of 64 at the Green Hill municipal  
course in Worcester. He thought about turning pro, but the money 
during the Depression was too uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a guy named Cyril Walker who was the U.S. Open  
winner (1924) and two years later he went back to caddying,'' Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill went on to work in the packing room of the Norton Co.,  
which made grinding wheels. He made a name in golf by winning more 
than a few tournaments, but he never came close to the kind of life 
that would have enabled him to afford the Worcester Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	At The Country Club, he was reminded of those days long ago at  
Worcester. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spectators were all wealthy people,'' Hill said. ``It was  
their game back then; they were the only ones who knew what was 
going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was accompanied to The Country Club by three men who had  
been spectators at Worcester -- Tom and Bill Kelleher and Al 
McIntyre. As they sat in a tent surrounded by a buffet and 12 
big-screen televisions, they marveled at the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Worcester, I was 12 years old and I always remember that my  
brother bought me a ham sandwich and an orangeade. It was quite a 
treat. I think it cost about 49 cents,'' Tom Kelleher said. 
</P>
<P>
	A cheeseburger in the member-guest tent this week was $6.  
</P>
<P>
	In all, the PGA of America is expected to earn about $63 million  
from the 33rd Ryder Cup, with the fans spending millions on 
clothing and souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I don't have anything from that first Ryder Cup,'' Hill  
said. ``It didn't seem like that big of a deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he does. He was given a cap this week by Worcester Country  
Club commemorating the inaugural competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hill remains a bit behind on the history he was a part of.  
Last year he sold eight gutta-percha golf balls in good shape to an 
antiques dealer for about $100. Those balls, replaced by 
rubber-core balls in the early 1900s, are worth from $200 to $1,000 
or more each, depending on condition, said Jere Pelletier, a 
collector who runs a Web page called The Golf Guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I should have kept them, but so much time had gone  
by,'' said Hill, who quit playing golf two years ago under the 
stress of age and two artificial knee joints. ``I guess I still 
didn't think about making money off golf.''

<HEADLINE>  Police Arrest Malaysian Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Three key opposition activists  
were arrested today in what appears to be a fresh crackdown on 
dissent following a wave of demonstrations in support of 
hospitalized opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested leaders of the opposition National Justice  
Party, a party led by Anwar's wife, after they surrendered this 
morning at police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. Four other 
activists were arrested Monday after a demonstration where 
protesters demanded Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation 
</P>
<P>
	Officers dragged Tian Chua, the National Justice Party's vice  
president, and youth leader Mohamed Ezam Mohamed Nor inside the 
building. The two were accompanied by their lawyers, while 50 
supporters chanted slogans outside the police compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the National Justice Party said that Badrol Amin,  
another senior party member, was also picked up by the police 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government can arrest us but more leaders will rise up,''  
Tian said in a statement. ``The threats by Mahathir cannot oppress 
the people anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Assistant Commissioner Mat Zain Ibrahim warned, ``We will  
be making more arrests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the four political parties that form the Alternative  
Front opposition coalition named Anwar -- who has been jailed on 
corruption charges -- as their candidate for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition said in a statement that if it won elections  
widely expected by the end of the year, it would try to overturn 
his corruption conviction through a judicial inquiry into the 
``political conspiracy which has led to Anwar's imprisonment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An interim prime minister chosen by Parliament would lead  
Malaysia until Anwar was released from jail. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15,000 people gathered Monday night to mark the  
anniversary of the arrest of the former deputy prime minister. They 
demanded an independent investigation into claims that Anwar had 
been poisoned in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar remained in the hospital today, where he has been for 12  
days, after his family and attorneys told a judge that medical 
tests showed dangerously high levels of arsenic in his urine. 
</P>
<P>
	The government hospital was still waiting for the results of  
tests conducted by independent laboratories, Anwar's lawyer 
Pawancheek Merican told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``We met him yesterday, and he looks pale,'' Panwancheek said.  
``When he sits down or lies down, his blood pressure goes up. And 
when he stands, his pressure drops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Anwar had been expected back in court for his sodomy trial  
Monday, but the judge said he had been told by doctors that he was 
unfit for court. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar was fired a year ago by Mahathir, who claimed his deputy  
was corrupt and had committed sodomy, a crime in this predominantly 
Muslim nation. Anwar, who was convicted of abuse of power and 
sentenced to six years in prison, says all the charges against him 
were trumped up to end his challenge to Mahathir.

<HEADLINE> Unilever NV To Narrow Brand List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Unilever NV, the Anglo-Dutch  
consumer products giant whose 1,600 brands include Lipton tea, 
Breyer's ice cream and other household names, plans to slash its 
product line to 400 in a bid to cut $1.4 billion in costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unilever, the world's largest maker of household goods, said it  
would keep brands that are No. 1 or 2 in their respective markets. 
While the company wouldn't elaborate, analysts expected it to hold 
onto top U.S. and European brands and shed less popular ones in 
peripheral markets in Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would detail its plans by next spring and  
cut costs within three years as it improves efficiency and 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	In addtion to Lipton and Breyer's, Unilever brands include Flora  
margarine, Wisk laundry detergent, Calvin Klein perfume, Dove soap, 
Pepsodent and Close-Up toothpaste, Vaseline skin care products and 
the Bird's Eye and Gorton's frozen foods lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to maintain focus when you have so many  
brands,'' said Darrell Duthrie, an analyst at MeesPierson in 
Amsterdam. He said Unilever almost certainly would discontinue the 
brands outside its new core group of 400 rather than sell them off 
``and give their competitors a step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Unilever posted an 11 percent jump in net profit to  
$727 million last month for the second quarter of 1999, sales 
increased by only 3 percent over the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Unilever said it expects the narrowed focus to improve operating  
margins over the next 5 years in a push to become what co-chairmen 
Niall FitzGerald and Antony Burgmans called a ``leaner, fitter and 
faster'' company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company aims to increase sales of its largest brands by  
between 6 percent and 8 percent a year, or more, they said.

<HEADLINE> China Promises Aid to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Even while offering sympathy and aid to Taiwan's  
earthquake victims, China subtly pressed its claim to the island 
Tuesday, appealing for unity and thanking other countries for their 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of the quake, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said  
the disaster ``hurt the hearts of people on the mainland as the 
Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are as closely 
linked as flesh and blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are willing to offer any possible assistance to alleviate  
the quake-caused losses,'' Jiang said in remarks carried by the 
official Xinhua News Agency and read on state radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	China's Red Cross announced it would provide the equivalent of  
$100,000 in disaster aid and more than $60,000 worth of relief 
supplies. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said Beijing 
would provide ``all assistance within our capability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pledges of help contrasted with recent tensions between  
Beijing and the island it regards as a rebel province. Beijing has 
repeated threats to retake Taiwan by force and has held war games 
opposite the island since Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui 
suggested in July that the two sides were equal states. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan reacted cautiously to the Chinese overtures, expressing  
thanks while not outright accepting the assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would be a good beginning to improving ties,'' Su Chi,  
chairman of Taiwan's top body on mainland relations, told 
reporters. ``I hope we can work on this basis and make efforts 
together to build up stable and peaceful relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chances were slim, however, that both sides would use the deadly  
quake to better relations. China and Taiwan are heirs to opposing 
sides in a seven-decade civil war, and even simple matters take on 
political overtones. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, expressed  
thanks to other countries for offering help to Taiwan, subtly 
assuming the prerogative of the sovereign government. China has 
tried to isolate Taiwan diplomatically, insisting that its 
diplomatic partners sever formal ties with the island. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked by reporters if the quake could cause China to change  
its Taiwan policy, Zhang said Lee's comments and the earthquake 
were ``a completely different matter.'' Speaking at a routine 
briefing, she reiterated Beijing's condemnation of Lee's comments 
as ``a very dangerous step to split the country.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures were mixed Tuesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade, with no significant developments to 
give the market direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were pulled down by a drop in soybean oil prices after  
having risen early in the session on news of an overnight freeze in 
Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota that raised concerns 
about the effect on harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Some crop loss was experienced but it was not thought to be  
major. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices dipped lower due to continued lack of export  
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn edged higher on technical buying.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 2 cents to $2.70 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1/2 cent to $2.10 3/4 a bushel; December oats rose 3/4 
cent to $1.12 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 2 cents to $4.85 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork belly futures soared on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while hog and cattle futures also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .18 cent to 66.75 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .25 cent to 79.37 cents a pound; October 
lean hogs rose .17 cent to 44.82 cents a pound; February frozen 
pork bellies rose 3 cents to 56.77 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Bears Add Players to Practice Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Fullback Jim Finn, the last player  
taken in the 1999 NFL draft, and defensive back Jermaine Jones were 
added to the Chicago Bears practice squad Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room, the Bears released fullback Brian Goolsby and  
defensive back Carlos Jones. The team still has one vacancy on the 
five-man unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Finn, a Penn product who caught three passes for 43 yards in  
exhibition play for the Bears, was let go in the final cut before 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, a fifth-round pick from Northwestern State of Louisiana,  
was released by the New York Jets last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears also said that tackle Blake Brockermeyer was  
questionable for Sunday's game at Oakland because of dizziness and 
headaches that forced him from the Seattle game. Tests this week 
showed he has a sinus condition.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Fears Career in the Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- It's been seven years since Dr. Philip  
Jajosky saw the medical red flags, signs to him that the Navy may 
have exposed hundreds of its sailors to potentially deadly dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Key in his research was a decision by the U.S. Department of  
Veterans Affairs to change the diagnosis of a sailor who helped 
scrape adhesive off the decks of aircraft carriers during the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The old diagnosis was sarcoidosis, a rare lung disorder with no  
known cause. The new diagnosis identified silicosis, a chronic 
respiratory disease caused by inhaling dangerous dust. 
</P>
<P>
	That revision has altered more than the prognosis for one former  
sailor. 
</P>
<P>
	It has led to a recommendation by the VA that its 172 medical  
centers perform detailed medical histories on affected sailors -- 
and there are no known estimates of how many could be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Jajosky contends that his research into the issue may also cost  
him his job as a medical investigator with the National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been nothing if not outspoken.  
</P>
<P>
	If the disease had been correctly identified as silicosis years  
ago, Jajosky said Monday, hundreds of sailors could have had more 
effective treatment and perhaps avoided progressive lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Studying the former sailors also could help the hundreds of  
civilians who contract dust-related or sarcoid-like diseases every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinions, if validated, could have enormous financial  
ramifications for the Navy. Compensation and disability payments to 
those who have suffered or died of lung disease could become 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Jajosky, 52, believes that is among the reasons a federal Public  
Health Service panel in Rockville, Md., is debating his 
professional fate behind closed doors this week as he awaits the 
verdict some 200 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters describe Jajosky as a doctor who selflessly pushed  
for his findings to be made public against bureaucratic resistance. 
His superiors criticize him for poor job performance and repeated 
insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Jajosky's fight began in 1992 with a call from ex-sailor Jerry  
Cochran, a minister from Albany, Ga., who had been discharged in 
1975 and diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Silicosis was re-diagnosed in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he began investigating, Jajosky found that sailors who  
served on aircraft carriers had a greater occurrence of the 
symptoms than sailors on other ships. Black sailors were 
disproportionately affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Jajosky now believes many of the more than 1,200 cases of  
sarcoidosis diagnosed by the Navy between 1965 and 1993 were 
actually silicosis, contracted by sailors who chiseled the 
anti-skid adhesive off the decks of carriers and breathed in silica 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
	He admits he defied the chain of command at NIOSH by going to  
the Navy with his findings on sarcoidosis before clearing them with 
his supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jajosky is also troubled by the ``tremendous research  
opportunity for an ongoing public health problem'' that he says the 
Navy, the Veterans Administration and NIOSH are ignoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very rarely do you have a group with the highest rate of  
disease, where African-Americans are disproportionately affected, 
where you have their medical records, and they're all about the 
same age,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jajosky said it is the government's obligation to help those it  
can help, and he draws comparisons to the Tuskegee syphilis 
experiments of the 1930s in which penicillin was denied to black 
men infected with syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
	Jajosky charges that neither NIOSH nor the Veterans  
Administration have developed an aggressive outreach program to 
seek out and test at-risk veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a passive plan; they said, if people come forward of  
their own volition and ask for help, we'll see them,'' Jajosky 
said. ``By God, there is a responsibility to make sure the rest of 
these people are OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jajosky's case has divided colleagues. Some say more studies are  
unnecessary because the underlying data are incomplete. There is no 
way to tell, for example, how much dust the sailors might have 
inhaled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advocacy, if it's not science-driven, is where we get into  
trouble,'' said Dr. Linda Rosenstock, NIOSH director in Morgantown. 
</P>
<P>
	In his written plea to the panel deciding his fate, Jajosky  
argued that a physician's conduct should be governed by medical 
judgment and the Hippocratic oath, not a quasi-military chain of 
command. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some things called common sense and ethics and  
morals and a medical oath that supersede everything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute's acting deputy director, Bryan Hardin, has called  
Jajosky's frustration ``understandable and justified.'' But he said 
delays in turning Jajosky's research over to the Navy were out of a 
scientific concern and not meant to suppress the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years into his battle, Jajosky remains convinced he has  
done the right thing and wonders about those who are now judging 
him. He is not allowed to face the panel and does not know its 
composition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope it's physicians,'' he said. ``If anyone can  
understand what I did, it's them.''

<HEADLINE> Vodafone, Bell Atlantic To Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local  
telephone company, reached agreement to acquire the U.S. mobile 
phone network of Vodafone AirTouch PLC in a deal that will create a 
wireless communications company that will be able to serve 90 
percent of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Vodafone's $15 billion wireless network, Bell  
Atlantic will give Vodafone a 45 percent stake in the new company, 
under the deal announced today. Bell Atlantic will manage the New 
York-based venture with assets of $28 billion, and control a 
majority of seats on the new board. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal unites Bell Atlantic's East Coast network with  
Vodafone's West Coast network, so their customers will be able to 
use their wireless phones almost anywhere in the country without 
having to pay extra ``roaming'' charges for out-of-area calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which is in the process of acquiring GTE Corp.,  
would become a more potent competitor against rivals like AT&AMP;T 
Corp. and Sprint Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through this combination, we are creating the leading wireless  
business in the United States. This is a logical fit, naturally 
uniting our U.S. properties and strong management teams, and 
enhancing the benefits of Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE,'' Ivan 
Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic, 
said in a statement announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	As their customers travel more for business and pleasure, phone  
companies around the world have struggled to expand their networks 
and mesh their technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, AT&AMP;T Corp. and British Telecom formed a global  
alliance to link their wireless telephone operations with roaming 
agreements and other unified services. Combined, those two 
companies will provide wireless services in 17 countries with a 
combined customer base of 41 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Gent, the chief executive of Vodaphone AirTouch, said the  
new venture with Bell Atlantic is being launched in time to 
capitalize on the adoption of mobile phones into the mainstream of 
American life. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement represents a major step forward in our U.S.  
strategy. In a market where penetration levels are relatively low 
but growth looks set to take off, gaining a nationwide footprint 
with common technology is of paramount importance in order to 
remain competitive,'' Gent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone AirTouch was formed in January when Britain's Vodafone  
bought San Francisco-based AirTouch Communications Inc. Vodaphone 
paid $56 billion, outbidding Bell Atlantic in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vodafone-Bell Atlantic partnership makes good strategic  
sense, industry analysts previously said, when the companies first 
disclosed their negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's transaction awaits antitrust and regulatory review and  
must be approved by shareholders of Vodaphone AirTouch. It already 
has been approved by the boards of Bell Atlantic and Vodafone 
AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined mobile phone business will be managed by Bell  
Atlantic and its board will have four members from Bell Atlantic 
and three from Vodaphone AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic's shares were up $1 at $64.62 1/2 a share in morning  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Vodafone's U.S. 
shares were up $1.93. 3/4 at $213.93 3/4.

<HEADLINE> More Rain Falls on North Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- More rain fell on North Carolina today, a  
dismal and unwelcome sight to Isabelle Baker and other owners of 
more than 30,000 homes damaged by the flooding caused by Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker did find comfort in the words of President Clinton, who  
said during a visit to Tarboro on Monday that the government would 
help people displaced by the deluge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a blessing for him to come here,'' said Baker, whose  
home is submerged in nearby Princeville. ``I really believe he will 
get all he can to help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 1 1/2 inches of rain fell this morning. But it wasn't the  
deluge some had feared in a region soaked by 20 inches of rain last 
week by Hurricane Floyd. And Tropical Storm Harvey, which had been 
expected to bring more moisture, turned south across Florida on a 
track that would take it out in the Atlantic, away from the 
Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 people were killed from the Bahamas into New  
England when Floyd charged up the East Coast. In hardest hit North 
Carolina, at least 37 people have died and two people are missing 
and presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's office said at least 1,600 homes are damaged  
beyond repair. An estimated 1,500 people were still stranded, but 
most were not in life-threatening situations. Some 10,000 are 
already in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary damage figures estimate the price tag for damage at  
$1.3 billion, but it may exceed the $6 billion total for Hurricane 
Fran in 1996, the state's costliest natural disaster in which 24 
people died. In addition, coastal areas were hit hard recently by 
Hurricane Dennis 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become painfully clear that Hurricane Floyd, combined  
with Hurricane Dennis, is shaping up to be the worst disaster North 
Carolina has ever seen, and I hope we'll ever see again,'' state 
public safety secretary Richard Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people remain unable to return home because of  
flooding that has virtually shut down the coastal plain east of 
Raleigh, an area spanning 18,000 square miles and containing 2.1 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews today began erecting two temporary housing villages near  
Rocky Mount and Greenville for people displaced by the flooding. 
The two communities, consisting of travel trailers for people whose 
houses can be repaired and mobile homes for long-term evacuees, 
eventually will house 500 families each, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	As water drains down rivers across eastern North Carolina,  
flooding will afflict areas that may have escaped the initial high 
water, Tom Hegele of the State Emergency Response Team warned 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Neuse River at Kinston was expected to crest  
Wednesday and could remain 10 or 11 feet above flood stage through 
the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton toured Tarboro, one of the hardest hit towns in an area  
drenched by more than 2 feet of rain from two hurricanes in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge you to keep your spirits up and know we're going to be  
with you every step of the way,'' Clinton told several hundred 
people. He announced emergency food stamps and unemployment 
payments for families in need, the hiring of temporary workers for 
the cleanup and low-interest loans for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things like this happen to some of us,'' the president  
said, ``we know they could happen to all of us. ... We know we have 
a responsibility as members of the American family to help you get 
back on your feet again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hunt made a nationwide appeal for donations to a relief  
fund for the state, saying ``we have been hit by a terrible blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials are also grappling with the health menace caused  
by rotting farm animals and sewage washed into the floodwaters. The 
state is seeking incinerators to deal with an estimated 100,000 
hogs, 2.4 million chickens and 500,000 turkeys killed in the 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 95 reopened Monday in North Carolina for the first  
time since Thursday, but about 300 other roads remained closed. 
</P>
<P>
	In northeastern South Carolina, scores of people have fled  
low-lying areas around Conway in anticipation of the worst flooding 
in more than 70 years along the Waccamaw River. The highest water 
is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surely enough to make you age a couple of years,'' Mary  
Roberts said Monday as she waited for some friends with a boat to 
take her back into the flooded Savannah Bluffs area just east of 
Conway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived down here for 40 years and I have never seen the  
water this high,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, workers piled up sandbags to protect sewage pump  
stations, yellow graders shored up a main highway and Gov. Jim 
Hodges asked the president to declare South Carolina a major 
disaster area.

<HEADLINE> Kings Skate Into Forum History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- This time, Los Angeles fans weren't  
rushing for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the crowd of 12,559 stood cheering as 32 years of Kings'  
history flashed on the overhead scoreboard in a final salute to 
hockey at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings closed out their residency in the circular building on  
Manchester Avenue with an 8-1 victory over the rival Anaheim Mighty 
Ducks in an exhibition game Monday night. Neither team left without 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to end it, end it with a bang,'' Kings left  
wing Luc Robitaille said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were six separate fights in the third period when referees  
assessed 149 penalty minutes and coaches Andy Murray of Los Angeles 
and Craig Hartsburg of Anaheim got into an argument between their 
benches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a case of our team being emotionally charged with the  
last game at the Forum,'' said Murray, in his first year with the 
Kings. ``I thought the people were into the mood of the last game 
here and I think that inspired our team. We got off to a good start 
and everything seemed to click.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings and the Lakers, the Forum's more successful tenant,  
are moving to the new Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, about 
25 miles from their old digs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings' first game there is against Boston on Oct. 20. The  
Lakers will play two exhibition games at the Forum next month 
before the building becomes predominantly a concert venue. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're never glad to leave,'' Kings defenseman Rob Blake said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hockey brought unique sights and smells to the venerable arena  
that Jack Kent Cooke built in 1967. Before each game, sparks flew 
from skates being sharpened in the hallway outside the visitors' 
dressing room and the pungent scent of cream used to soothe sore 
muscles wafted up the narrow stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Such nostalgia was on the minds of many who paid $15 and $10 for  
a chance to watch hockey from the orange and gold seats one last 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Carvo, 28, of Lake Elsinore, wore a black-and-white jersey  
covered with autographs of current and former Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's kind of what I always liked about it. It's in the  
middle of a workingman's town,'' he said of the Forum's blue-collar 
neighborhood. ``It's always been kind of a grinding team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No more so than on April 10, 1982, when the Kings played the  
famed ``Miracle on Manchester'' playoff game. Trailing 5-0 in the 
third period against Edmonton, the Kings went on the attack and 
tied the game with five seconds remaining. Rookie Daryl Evans 
scored in overtime to complete an improbable comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years later, the Kings pulled off a blockbuster trade,  
acquiring Wayne Gretzky from Edmonton. Hockey became the toughest 
ticket in town and soared to new levels of popularity in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Gretzky led the Kings to their only Stanley Cup finals  
appearance, where they lost to Montreal 4-1, including three 
straight overtime defeats -- two in front of roaring Forum crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was exciting. The building was really alive,'' said general  
manager Dave Taylor, whose No. 18 is one of three retired jerseys 
in Kings' history. ``The Forum is a great building for the fans. 
The sight lines are good, it's a very loud building when it's 
full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blake has played his entire 10-year NHL career with the Kings in  
the Forum. He and Robitaille are the only players remaining from 
the '93 Stanley Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to the finals and the excitement created around there, I  
think that'll live in this building for a long time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forum's last big hockey moment occurred March 23, 1994, when  
Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's record for most career goals with his 
802nd against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky was traded to St. Louis two years later, former owner  
Bruce McNall went to jail for a scheme to bilk banks and the team 
out of millions, and the Kings were eventually sold. They've made 
the playoffs just once in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	But those troubled times were distant memories Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell and Olympic figure skater Michelle  
Kwan joined the rest of the cheering crowd on its feet late in the 
third period as announcer David Courtney said, ``One minute 
remaining in the fabulous Great Western Forum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a jersey autographed by Robitaille, Laura Niznik of  
Torrance soaked up the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of sad, because the Forum has so much history to it,''  
she said. ``Everybody knows the Forum. I remember when it was the 
Fabulous Forum years ago. It's a great place to watch a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Niznik's favorite moment was watching Robitaille score his 500th  
goal last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd just went wild. There was so much energy here from  
all the fans,'' she said. ``It was just a great moment, especially 
when the Kings don't always do as well as they should.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Loan Delinquency Rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans did a better job of paying their  
bills in a timely manner and the delinquency rate on consumer loans 
and credit cards dipped in the second quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted percentage of credit card accounts 30 or  
more days past due fell to 3.33 percent in the April-June quarter, 
from 3.58 percent in the first three months of the year, the 
American Bankers Association said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A composite rate for other types of consumer loans, including  
auto loans and closed-end home equity loans, also edged down to 
2.09 percent in the second quarter, the lowest delinquency rate 
since 2.12 percent at the end of 1995, the association said. In the 
first quarter, the delinquency rate for such consumer loans was 
2.32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong economy and the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years  
are among the factors helping consumers make timely payments, 
economists said. In addition, ``Savvy consumers reduced their debt 
burden by refinancing their mortgages and are using the additional 
money to pay their bills,'' said Keith Leggett, the association's 
senior economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Leggett also attributed the decline in the delinquency rates to  
banks tightening their underwriting standards for consumer credit 
in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said banks are using technology to help them identify  
customers who are having trouble paying their loans. ``They are 
contacting customers sooner -- before they get deeper in debt -- to 
work out payment plans,'' Leggett said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks Freeze Russian Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Today, the Swiss government announced that Swiss banks have  
frozen $16.8 million in accounts suspected to be linked to the 
Russian case. A 1998 law requires banks to take such action and 
report to the government when they have well-founded suspicions of 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Folco Galli, spokesman for the Federal Office for Police  
Affairs, told The Associated Press a number of reports have been 
received in connection with the Bank of New York case. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia now owes some $16 billion of the $22 billion that the  
182-nation IMF has lent it since 1992. The IMF board is expected 
soon to consider approving a second, $640 million installment under 
a $4.5 billion loan package for Russia that was previously 
authorized. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin received Nikolai Patrushev, head  
of the Federal Security Service, today at his country residence for 
talks on the money-laundeirng investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has not commented publicly on the expanding scandal,  
though the Kremlin has issued statements denying any wrongdoing by 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian delegation traveled to Washington last week, and both  
countries agreed to investigate the matter and compare notes, 
Patrushev told Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Ivanov, deputy head of the Federal Security Service,  
Russia's main intelligence agency, said Monday that U.S. 
investigators have presented no evidence that money from the IMF or 
other international agencies was involved in money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor was there any evidence that high-level Russian officials  
were involved, said Ivanov. He headed a team of Russian 
investigators who met in Washington last week with FBI Director 
Louis Freeh and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ivanov's statement Monday that U.S. investigators have  
material suggesting Russian businesses laundered money through the 
Bank of New York appeared to contradict Russian Prime Minister 
Vladimir Putin, who said earlier Monday that the visit produced no 
evidence of Russian money being misdirected. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov's remarks also contradicted his own comments last week in  
Washington. Russian officials have been saying the case has been 
overblown by Western media and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of New York spokesman Cary Giacalone declined to comment on  
the latest statements from Ivanov. He repeated the bank's previous 
position that it has not been accused of any wrongdoing and 
declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into 
money-laundering allegations.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sign Special Teamer Mason </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins, looking to bolster  
their inconsistent special teams units, signed fifth-year 
linebacker Eddie Mason and released receiver Chris Thomas on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason was signed late last year by Jacksonville and played in  
four regular season games and two playoff games, primarily on 
special teams. A sixth-round draft pick out of North Carolina by 
the New York Jets in 1995, Mason was named the Jets' special teams 
MVP as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas made the Redskins' roster in 1997 solely because of his  
standout play on special teams, but he was the culprit when the 
Dallas Cowboys pulled off a successful onside kick in the season 
opener. Instead of holding his spot, Thomas started retreating 
before the ball was kicked, allowing the Cowboys to recover the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was also part of a kickoff coverage unit that allowed two  
returns of 40-plus yards against the New York Giants on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> North Carolina Families in Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- After years of traveling from crop to crop,  
season after season, 16-year-old Maria Cerapio thought she had 
finally found a home. 
</P>
<P>
	She was thinking of going out for soccer at Martin Middle  
School. She even dreamed she might stay long enough to graduate 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hurricane Floyd may force her family back on the road.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to force my dad to stay here, even though all these  
things are going on,'' the girl with a waist-length ponytail said 
as she sat in the Tarboro High School parking lot in front of a row 
of portable toilets. ``But he said for our protection, he wants us 
to go back to Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cerapios were among more than 2,000 eastern North Carolina  
residents taking shelter Tuesday in the high school from the waters 
of the swollen Tar River. Their trailer across the bridge in the 
predominantly black town of Princeville now sits under brown, oily 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of migrant farm workers from Mexico arrived in  
Princeville in June, planning to continue a cycle that has taken 
them from the orange groves of Florida, the strawberry fields of 
California and the blueberry patches of Oregon. They often came to 
North Carolina so Venacio Cerapio, 38, could work the flue-cured 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	This time things promised to be different.  
</P>
<P>
	Cerapio and his wife, Aurelia, 34, found jobs making holiday  
dolls in a factory. The work was steady and not as backbreaking as 
the fields, and they liked the climate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel more comfortable here,'' he said as his daughter  
translated. ``It's not too hot or too cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children had already started to establish themselves.  
</P>
<P>
	Umberto, 14, a skinny boy with a bright smile, was in seventh  
grade at Martin Middle and was playing forward for the basketball 
team, the Killer Bees. Maria, who was born in Oaxaca, Mexico, was 
catching up to her peers in school, working part of the time in 
eighth grade and part in ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like how they teach,'' she said. ``It is more challenging,  
and when they challenge you, you try harder. In Florida, it's easy, 
and when it's easy you don't really try hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But life here was not easy by any means.  
</P>
<P>
	The family's used single-wide trailer had just two bedrooms and  
one bathroom. Maria had to sleep in the living room with her 
brother and 10-year-old sister Janira so her parents and 
grandfather, Jacinto, 63, who also works at the doll factory, could 
have some privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Things got even more crowded recently when a family of five came  
to stay. But Maria liked the fact that four other branches of her 
family had settled in nearby Leggett. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, all of them are sharing cots on a basketball court.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides her clothes, the only things Maria got out of the  
trailer were her math and science books. She said she would need 
them to study for a test her teacher promised they would have when 
schools reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	``She will,'' Maria said, pulling a lollipop from her mouth to  
reveal two rows of perfect teeth. ``I know this teacher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family had a chance to move to a shelter with hot showers  
and private rooms in Wilson, but they were afraid to leave Tarboro 
for fear of missing out on aid information for their area. While 
the grown-ups sat on cots and looked at 2-day-old newspapers, the 
children played tag in the parking lots -- when it wasn't raining. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelter life was already taking its toll. Maria's cousin,  
Beatrice Rojas, 11, buried her head in a cot and sobbed 
uncontrollably Tuesday after a fight with Umberto. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's depressed because she lost everything,'' Maria said as  
she comforted the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Umberto cursed the storm. ``It's spoiled everything,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials said it could be a week before the Cerapios and others  
are allowed back into Princeville to look at their homes. With 
barely a half-hour to flee, the family left with little else but 
their Bible and the clothes they were wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things we lost, we could get back, but our lives are more  
important,'' the father said as he leaned against his gray van with 
nearly 100,000 miles on it. ``I don't really feel that bad, because 
God wants it like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maria, too, knows that the trailer is gone. She just doesn't  
want to admit it. ``I really got attached to it here,'' she said, 
her smile fading in the darkened shelter hallway. ``This was going 
to be our home.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Professor Bitten by Rattlesnake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- An ecologist who has spent decades studying  
snakes was bitten by one of his subjects Tuesday and found slumped 
at the bottom of a stairwell, unconscious and foaming at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Reinert, a biology professor at The College of New  
Jersey, was in critical condition Tuesday night. Authorities 
believe Reinert was working in his rooftop laboratory when he was 
bitten on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The cries of Reinert's 4-year-old daughter alerted people in the  
building that her father was hurt. The girl was ``hysterical'' and 
could provide no information to police about what happened, campus 
policeman Richard Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police evacuated the three-story building for about an hour  
while they accounted for all the snakes. The alleged culprit -- a 
type of rattlesnake called a Crotalus horridus -- was found in 
Reinert's lab. The reptile, about 2 feet long, was in a burlap bag 
in a white bucket in a sink. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinert's research revolves around native and nonnative species  
of rattlesnakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Professor Marcia O'Connell said she did not think  
Reinert's infliction would be life-threatening because he was most 
likely given an anti-venom right away.

<HEADLINE> Temporary Homes Coming to N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Emergency officials began erecting villages  
of trailer homes and campers Tuesday for 1,000 families whose homes 
were still under the floodwaters of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	The temporary homes could open within a few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Many weary evacuees welcomed the chance to get out of shelters.  
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a home. I can call that a home because there's nobody  
but me and my family in one camper,'' said Angela Davis, who has 
been staying with her son, daughter and hundreds of others at 
Tarboro High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The campers and mobile home villages are being set up outside  
Rocky Mount and Greenville and will have electricity, running water 
and air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North  
Carolina last Thursday with catastrophic effect: 39 confirmed 
deaths, 30,000 flooded homes, 10,000 people in shelters. About 
47,000 people remained without power, and nearly 300 roads remained 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogther, the storm was responsible for more than 60 deaths  
from the Bahamas to New England. In New Jersey, more than a million 
still did not have safe water to drink. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tarboro High, home to an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 evacuees,  
people were sleeping on cots in classrooms and in the gymnasium. 
The school had no running water. People bathed in shower tents 
hooked up to water tankers. Portable toilets were overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have right now is like a small city,'' said Dave Stone  
of the American Red Cross, the shelter's manager. ``It would be 
nice to have flushable toilets, but that's not in the foreseeable 
future. Thank God we've got power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials continued to assess the agricultural damage. At  
least 2.9 million poultry and 100,000 hogs drowned. Sewage plants 
and hog waste lagoons were swamped by the fast, brown waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffins, bloated animal carcasses and household goods could be  
seen bobbing in the polluted floodwaters across an 
18,000-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
	More rain fell Tuesday, delaying efforts to fire up incinerators  
to begin destroying the carcasses of hundreds of thousands of 
drowned hogs, chickens and turkeys to prevent the spread of 
disease. About an inch fell in the flooded areas, with forecasters 
warning of thunderstorms later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The early damage estimate of $1.3 billion is expected to soar  
and may well exceed the $6 billion for Hurricane Fran in 1996, the 
state's costliest natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots delivering food and bottled water to shelters continued  
to look for stranded people from the air. The state has said about 
1,500 people are still believed stranded.

<HEADLINE> Amusement Park Injuries Said Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission says  
that emergency room injuries from amusement park rides rose 87 
percent over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries at amusement parks that were serious enough to warrant  
emergency treatment rose from an estimated 2,400 in 1994 to 4,500 
in 1998, Ann Brown, the commission's chairwoman, wrote in a recent 
letter to Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was responding to a request for information from Markey,  
who is the ranking Democrat on the House Commerce subcommittee on 
telecommunications, trade and consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	After the spate of fatal roller coaster accidents this summer,  
Markey said he would introduce legislation giving the commission 
power to set standards for amusement park rides, perform 
inspections and investigations, recall unsafe equipment and impose 
civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	In August there were four deaths from separate incidents in  
amusement park rides. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission regulates so-called ``mobile'' rides that are  
hauled from carnival to carnival, but not rides at amusement parks 
and other permanent sites. To regulate rides at permanent sides, 
the commission would need at least a $5 million increase in its 
budget and additional staff, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulation of amusement parks is now left to state and local  
authorities. Brown said 14 states plus the District of Columbia do 
not have inspection programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions  
has said that some states with no regulations also have no -- or 
very few -- parks. A call to the association Monday was not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Total estimated injuries from rides at all sites -- permanent,  
mobile and unknown -- rose, from 7,400 to 9,200 over the five-year 
period, said Brown. Injuries on rides at mobile sites increase just 
slightly, from 2,000 to 2,100 over the period. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission monitors amusement-ride related injuries through  
the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, which covers a 
sample of hospital emergency rooms. Fatality data are obtained 
through incident reports, newspaper clippings and death 
certificates.

<HEADLINE> Fire Danger in Emergency Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Emergency shelters used to protect workers  
battling forest fires from intense heat can turn into firetraps 
when touched by flames, the U.S. Forest Service says. 
</P>
<P>
	Contact with flames causes the shelters to fill with highly  
flammable toxic smoke, which can ignite into a fireball, 
researchers found. The Forest Service and other federal agencies 
sent warnings to fire crews last week after tests in Canada caught 
the fireballs on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always said it's important to keep the shelter out of  
flames, and now we know why,'' said Leslie Anderson, who led the 
Montana-based team that discovered the danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Steele was one of 73 firefighters who became surrounded by  
200-foot flames and used their shelters for more than an hour 
during a 1985 Idaho forest fire. He said the fire's strong winds 
blew smoke, soot and ashes into his shelter, but the shelter itself 
did not start to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got pretty hot -- hot enough that you sweat,'' said Steele,  
now a wildfire training specialist with the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs in Montana. ``... It's like what I would envision a baked 
potato feels like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although firefighters have died or suffered burns inside  
shelters, there have been no documented injuries or deaths due to 
this flash fire problem, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may be because we didn't know what to look for,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said researchers have recommended redesigning the  
shelters to try to lessen or eliminate the problem. Some new 
designs are being tested, but it is unclear whether they would 
stand up to flames better, said Mike Apicello, a spokesman at the 
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	The tent-like shelters are 5 feet by 7 feet of fiberglass fabric  
with an outer aluminum coating designed to reflect heat. The 
thousands of firefighters who battle forest or brush fires each 
year carry folded shelters in a pouch on their belts for use in 
emergencies when they are surrounded by fire or about to be overrun 
by the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	The shelters are made to government specifications by Anchor  
Industries Inc. of Evansville, Ind. More than 1 million have been 
made since they became standard wildfire equipment in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters have used shelters more than 1,000 times since  
then, with more than 250 lives saved, Apicello said. Firefighters 
are trained to try to use the shelters only over rock, bare soil or 
pavement to lessen the risk of fires inside the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, 28 firefighters were killed while using or trying to use  
fire shelters from 1977 to 1997, government reports say. Some were 
overrun by flames so quickly they could not fully use the shelters, 
or had trouble opening them while wearing thick firefighting 
gloves. Others used them on top of flammable material like grass or 
were completely engulfed by the wildfire.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Churns Closer to Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tropical Storm Harvey changed course and bore down  
on southern Florida today with 50 mph wind and heavy rain, closing 
schools and prompting an emergency declaration from the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 10 inches of rain had caused some street flooding  
today in parts of Collier County, on the Gulf Coast west of the 
Miami area, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm's outer bands dropped lesser amounts of rain  
elsewhere, including about an inch in Miami-Dade and Broward 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of the storm was expected to come ashore tonight near  
Naples, in Collier County. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather service reported two possible tornadoes in western  
Miami-Dade County. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey weakened slightly and veered to the southeast early  
today, bringing out tropical storm warnings for southern Florida, 
including the Keys island chain. 
</P>
<P>
	After crossing Florida, the storm was expected to turn onto a  
more easterly course and head northeast into the Atlantic. A 
tropical storm warning also was posted for the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier predictions had the storm making landfall near Tampa, on  
Florida's western coast, then moving along the coast with a threat 
of more heavy rain for flood-stricken North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, said Todd Kimberlain, a meteorologist at the National  
Hurricane Center, ``in the end it may not have much impact at all'' 
on the Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m., the storm was centered about 30 miles south of  
Naples, and was moving to the east-southeast at 12 mph. Tropical 
storm-force wind of at least 39 mph extended out some 115 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The center is not really well defined. It's just kind of a  
raggedy system,'' said Stephen Baig, oceanographer at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday declared a state of emergency for 56 of  
67 counties in anticipation of the storm. Harvey could produce 
storm surge flooding of up to 6 feet above normal in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools closed for the day in the Florida Keys, in Collier  
County and in the Lee County-Fort Myers area, mostly out of concern 
for street flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	But most voluntary evacuations called for in the Tampa area --  
advising people living in mobile homes, recreational vehicles, 
coastal and low-lying areas to move -- were lifted today. 
</P>
<P>
	Out in the Atlantic, a hurricane warning was in effect for  
Bermuda as Gert moved to within 135 miles of the island this 
morning with top wind of 110 mph. It was moving toward the north at 
about 13 mph.

<HEADLINE> Sales of 'Trench-Coat' Doll Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (AP) -- Sears has halted sales of a  
trenchcoat-wearing, gun-toting action figure over complaints the 
doll resembles the gunmen at a Colorado high school, company 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-inch doll comes with a ski mask, black trench coat, body  
armor, shotgun and rifle. The doll, in the Sept. 1 holiday catalog, 
is part of a series of collectible figures called ``Heroes and 
Villains'' that include dolls representing World War II and Vietnam 
War soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Drummond, a spokeswoman at the company's suburban Chicago  
headquarters, said Sears officials decided to stop selling the doll 
last week after three people complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their concerns were very sincere and heartfelt,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Drummond said it was never Sears' intent to pattern the dolls  
after students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, members of the 
so-called Trench Coat Mafia, who killed 12 classmates and a teacher 
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. before taking their 
own lives April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``But taking a look at it, we decided it was inappropriate,''  
Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dolls sold for $29.99 and were recommended for children ages  
5 and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Carpenter of Longmont, Colo., said she complained after her  
8- and 10-year-old sons saw the action figure in the catalog and 
told her it looked like a ``Trench Coat Mafia doll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold used two sawed-off shotguns, a semiautomatic  
pistol and a black semiautomatic rifle in their rampage. The 
figure's clothes are similar to those they wore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not believe that anybody with a pulse and a conscience  
could make a decision to put this in a catalog that's marketed to 
children,'' Carpenter told The Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond said the dolls were selected for the catalog long  
before the shootings. She said 15 of the action figures were sold 
before the item was pulled. Customers who now call for the doll 
will be told it is unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some people who collect these things or want it will  
be disappointed,'' Drummond said. ``But we just didn't think it was 
appropriate this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The toy, called The Villain, is made by 21st Century Toys Inc.,  
based in Alameda, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Allen, vice president of the company, said he anticipated  
the comparisons after the Columbine shooting but could do nothing 
to stop production of the Sears catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	``The simple premise of the toy line was cops and robbers. It  
had nothing to do with promoting violence or hatred,'' Allen said 
today. ``It was just an unfortunate coincidence for us that those 
idiots at Columbine were wearing trench coats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said the doll is being redesigned, including removing the  
trench coat.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Antibiotic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a doctor's nightmare: The 60-year-old is  
recovering fine from a heart bypass when suddenly his surgical 
wound becomes inflamed and a fever spikes. 
</P>
<P>
	He has picked up an infection -- maybe germs from a previous  
patient lingered on his bedrail, or a health care worker checked 
his bandages with dirty hands. Worse, his drug-resistant infection 
is not responding to the antibiotic of last resort, vancomycin. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who until now would have had to watch such a patient die  
won a new weapon Tuesday against the growing threat of 
drug-resistant bacteria: An antibiotic called Synercid becomes the 
first backup in 30 years to that longtime ``silver bullet,'' 
vancomycin. 
</P>
<P>
	``For those of us who treat the most sick patients, in hospitals  
where they do a lot of major surgery ... having another option is 
very important,'' said Dr. George Eliopoulos of Beth Israel 
Deaconness Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	But Synercid is not an all-purpose magic bullet. The Food and  
Drug Administration approved its use only in certain infections -- 
albeit ones that strike hundreds of thousands of patients -- because 
it works well against some germs but not others. 
</P>
<P>
	And doctors should not use Synercid when other antibiotics will  
do, because overuse will simply hasten bacteria's inevitable 
development of resistance against this new drug, the FDA warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drug should be used judiciously,'' stressed FDA  
antibiotics chief Dr. Sandra Kweder. ``For many patients it will be 
a drug of last resort, and we'd like to protect it for as long as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some infectious disease experts predicted Synercid's cost -- at  
$85 per intravenous vial, over four times more expensive than 
vancomycin -- will persuade doctors to save it for the sickest 
patients. It will be available on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	In studies of more than 2,000 patients, intravenous Synercid  
effectively quelled 52 percent of infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Synercid is most important in fighting a fearsome germ spread to  
thousands of hospitalized patients called ``vancomycin-resistant 
Enterococcus faecium.'' It can live for days on doorknobs, 
bedrails, even stethoscopes, and is infamous for causing lethal 
infections in the abdomen, urinary tract, post-surgical wounds and 
heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
	In one study of 330 patients infected with that supergerm, 90  
percent had their infection clear up within 72 hours of starting 
treatment with Synercid, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	But hospitals must do special tests to be sure patients have an  
E. faecium infection, because Synercid does not work against 
another, more common but less deadly, type of enterococcal 
infection, the FDA stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA also approved Synercid to treat complicated skin  
infections caused by staph or strep bacteria, opening its use 
potentially to hundreds of thousands more patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those infections are still treatable with older  
antibiotics. But drug-resistant staph strains were thought to be 
confined to hospitals until the government last month discovered 
that four previously healthy children had died from 
antibiotic-resistant staph. So it is a growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Synercid's most frequently reported side effects were muscle and  
joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and rash. 
</P>
<P>
	Synercid is a combination of two drugs -- quinupristin and  
dalfopristin -- that essentially deal bacteria a one-two punch, 
inhibiting two different methods of bacterial protein synthesis so 
the bugs cannot survive. It is the first in new class of 
antibiotics called streptogramins.

<HEADLINE>  Bad Start for Denver Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- While looking for answers, the Denver Broncos are  
not expecting any sympathy for their abysmal start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are probably happy,'' cornerback Tyrone Braxton  
said Monday as the Broncos tried to regroup from an 0-2 start -- 
their worst in five seasons. ``I'm stunned, but it's a long 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After losses to Miami and Kansas City, the Broncos' road doesn't  
get any easier this week as they travel to Tampa Bay. The 
Buccaneers' defense has not allowed a touchdown in two games and 
had nine sacks Sunday against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was on another team and the two-time world champions came  
to my stadium, I'd want to embarrass them,'' Denver linebacker 
Glenn Cadrez said. ``I'd want to make a highlight tape of them. 
That should be motivation enough for us because we're not going to 
get any breaks. No one's going to feel sorry for the Super Bowl 
champs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do is put our rings away, put them in the safe  
and just go out and play. What we did in the past is what we did in 
the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The future is not encouraging.  
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos learned Monday that linebacker John Mobley will be  
out for the season after tearing a ligament in his right knee 
during Sunday's 26-10 loss at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Though hardly Elway-esque, Mobley was Denver's leading tackler  
the past two years, and his injury is the latest setback for a team 
that has looked passive on offense, brittle on defense and sloppy 
on both sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to improve in all areas -- all areas,'' coach Mike  
Shanahan said. ``You look at it any other way, then all you're 
doing is giving yourself excuses. We haven't got it done. Now it's 
time to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos opened the season amid talk of winning an  
unprecedented third straight Super Bowl, but history is not on 
Denver's side. 
</P>
<P>
	The only team to win the title after losing its first two games  
was Dallas in 1993. The New England Patriots started 0-2 in 1996 
and advanced to the Super Bowl, losing to Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadrez is preaching patience.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the third week of the season,'' he said. ``We're down two  
games. If you come to me in Week 10 and we're 2-8, then I'm going 
to have a completely different answer for you. Right now, let us 
find ourselves first because I don't think we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos had reason to be lost Sunday as they played without  
wide receiver Rod Smith (strained groin), defensive end Alfred 
Williams (back spasms) and Mobley, who left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The game also marked Brian Griese's second career start. Though  
he was 11-of-16, Griese had only one pass longer than 10 yards. He 
was replaced in the fourth quarter by Bubby Brister, but will start 
Sunday at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian played a very good football game,'' Shanahan said. ``I  
brought Bubby in because things weren't going well, not necessarily 
because he was playing poorly. I felt like the team needed a 
jolt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, tabbed as the starter in training camp, didn't fare  
much better than Griese. He threw an interception -- Denver's fourth 
of the game -- and could not rally the Broncos from a 16-point 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the question was asked before, `Do you lose a little  
confidence when you are 0-2?''' Shanahan said. ``When you don't 
lose a little confidence is when something is wrong with you. 
There's nothing like winning football games to help our confidence. 
Hopefully, we'll be able to do that.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Broadly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell broadly against other currencies  
Tuesday, weighed down by a surprise move by the Bank of Japan, a 
huge U.S. trade deficit in July and improved business sentiment in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell against the yen in early trading after the Bank  
of Japan, defying pressure from Japanese politicians, refused to 
alter its money supply policy as a way of influencing exchange 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors had expected Japan's central bank to make some policy  
gesture as a way to pull back the yen, which has soared against the 
dollar this summer. When the bank stood its ground, the dollar 
plunged even further against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon in New York, the dollar was quoted at 104.87  
yen, down sharply from 106.38 yen late Monday. The dollar was 
quoted at 105.42 yen in late Tokyo trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar took another blow when the Commerce Department  
reported a record trade deficit of $25.2 billion in July, 
reflecting a continued trend of Americans buying more goods from 
overseas than they sell. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trade imbalance results in foreign companies holding  
more and more dollars in their accounts. That trend weakens the 
dollar as investors fear that those companies may be tempted to 
redeem their dollars for their own currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the euro gained against the dollar following a  
report showing that German business sentiment improved in August at 
a rate that was faster than economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0485, up from $1.0383 late Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5287 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5476, and 1.4750 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4775. The British 
pound rose to $1.6311 from $1.6207. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8653 German 
marks, down from 1.8835; 6.2558 French francs, down from 6.3170; 
and 1,846.53 Italian lire, down from 1,864.67.

<HEADLINE> Dean Taylor Hired As Brewers' GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Dean Taylor says he has plans to create the  
same winning dynasty in Milwaukee that was started nine years ago 
in Atlanta when he became the assistant to Braves GM John 
Schuerholz. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was hired as Brewers GM in Tuesday, succeeding Sal Bando,  
who was reassigned last month following the firing of manager Phil 
Garner. 
</P>
<P>
	Reshaping the Brewers into a winning team is something that drew  
Taylor to the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a year to get this organization moving to  
wherever we want it to be,'' said Taylor, who signed a four-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's first duties include hiring a manager, which he hopes  
to do during the playoffs. He said major league experience isn't 
the only factor in his choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for someone who has the ability to motivate and  
create a winning atmosphere,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig, whose family controls the  
Brewers through a trust, instructed owners earlier this year to 
consider minorities for high-ranking team positions and required 
teams to give him a list of candidates . 
</P>
<P>
	Former NL Manager of the Year Don Baylor, now the hitting coach  
for Atlanta after being fired by the Colorado Rockies last season, 
is among the names mentioned as a candidate for the Brewers' 
managerial position. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who is black, was the hitting coach in Milwaukee from  
1990-91 and was considered for the managerial job with the Brewers 
when Garner was hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the stability of the Brewers' ownership and the  
targeted opening of the Brewers' new stadium, Miller Park, in 2001 
were among the reasons he was interested in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently staggering toward their seventh straight losing  
season, the Brewers are in fifth place in the NL Central and have 
not been in the playoffs since 1982. Taylor comes from a team that 
has won seven straight division titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dean Taylor is someone who will leave no stone unturned in  
strengthening this organization,'' said team president Wendy 
Selig-Prieb, the commissioner's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers need to take a new direction in their player  
development, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be creative and resourceful,'' he said. ``Small  
clubs have a smaller margin of error when it comes to player 
development. The key is to make proper evaluations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's 24-year baseball career includes serving as an  
assistant to John Schuerholz at Kansas City. Taylor also was 
manager of baseball operations for the commissioner's office in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor also stressed developing the team's farm system, bringing  
up younger players to the professional level and negotiating 
prudent contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most important thing is making players, officials and  
team employees believe in the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they come through the door every day to work for the  
Milwaukee Brewers, they need to walk through the door with the 
expectation that they will win,'' he said. ``The biggest hurdle is 
creating that winning mindset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers also interviewed Indians assistant general manager  
Dan O'Dowd, hired Monday as general manager of the Colorado 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Others interviewed were Toronto Blue Jays assistant general  
manager Dave Stewart, New York Mets assistant general manager and 
international scouting director Omar Minaya and Chicago White Sox 
assistant general manager Dan Evans.

<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Rescuers scrambled through the night  
Tuesday to unearth thousands of people trapped under debris from 
Taiwan's second-deadliest earthquake, which killed at least 1,712 
people and injured over 4,000. Almost 3,000 people were believed to 
remain underneath rubble. More than 100,000 Taiwanese were 
homeless. The 7.6-magnitude quake toppled houses and high-rise 
apartment complexes across central Taiwan. Roads buckled, chunks of 
land rose up to create new hills and a bridge was left dangling in 
the air.

industrial average ended down 225.43 points at 10,598.47 after 
falling as much as 272.03 during the session. The Dow's decline, 
which amounted to 2 percent, was its biggest point drop since it

strengthen their ability to stop mass killings like those in Kosovo 
and East Timor. Clinton suggested the United Nations play an

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told Congress he granted  
clemency to 14 Puerto Rican nationalists on the belief ``that a 
punishment should fit the crime.'' No politics was involved, he 
said. Clinton outlined his position in a five-page letter to Rep. 
Henry Waxman of California, who read it at the start of a House 
Government Reform Committee hearing on the clemency. Waxman is the 
senior Democrat on the committee. Clinton said he based his 
decision on the ``extremely lengthy sentences'' the prisoners were

the company in closing arguments of acting as a vigilant monopolist 
intent on squelching upstart rivals at the expense of consumers. 
Citing dozens of internal e-mails and sworn testimony, government 
lawyers portrayed Microsoft as ruthless in its efforts to protect 
the dominance of its lucrative Windows software. Microsoft, which 
was also to make its closing arguments today, said the government 
``truly has blinders on when it looks at what is going on in the

years, America's population growth will come almost entirely from 
minority groups, according to the study. America's population will 
grow by 50 percent, from 268.2 million people to 393.9 million, it 
estimates. Almost 90 percent of the growth will come from 
minorities, a group that includes Asians, American Indians, blacks

<P>
	``It's the third week of the season,'' he said. ``We're down two  
games. If you come to me in Week 10 and we're 2-8, then I'm going 
to have a completely different answer for you. Right now, let us 
find ourselves first because I don't think we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos had reason to be lost Sunday as they played without  
wide receiver Rod Smith (strained groin), defensive end Alfred 
Williams (back spasms) and Mobley, who left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The game also marked Brian Griese's second career start. Though  
he was 11-of-16, Griese had only one pass longer than 10 yards. He 
was replaced in the fourth quarter by Bubby Brister, but will start 
Sunday at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian played a very good football game,'' Shanahan said. ``I  
brought Bubby in because things weren't going well, not necessarily 
because he was playing poorly. I felt like the team needed a 
jolt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, tabbed as the starter in training camp, didn't fare  
much better than Griese. He threw an interception -- Denver's fourth 
of the game -- and could not rally the Broncos from a 16-point 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the question was asked before, `Do you lose a little  
confidence when you are 0-2?''' Shanahan said. ``When you don't 
lose a little confidence is when something is wrong with you. 
There's nothing like winning football games to help our confidence. 
Hopefully, we'll be able to do that.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Examines Laundering Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is examining what may be the biggest  
money-laundering scheme ever in this country, allegedly involving 
Russian gangsters illegally channeling billions of dollars through 
the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of speculation, a top Russian intelligence official  
said Monday that U.S. investigators have material suggesting 
Russian businesses laundered money through the big American bank. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the alleged scheme, which became  
public in news reports on Aug. 19. U.S. investigators have not 
commented publicly on the case, in which as much as $10 billion 
allegedly was funneled through the Bank of New York, the 
15th-largest U.S. bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-level executives of the bank's Eastern European  
division, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky and Lucy Edwards, were 
suspended, and Ms. Edwards was subsequently fired for alleged 
falsification of bank records and failure to cooperate with 
internal investigators. The two have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has become a political flashpoint between Washington  
and Moscow and prompted Republican leaders to denounce the Clinton 
administration's policy of supporting aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Swiss government announced that Swiss banks have  
frozen $16.8 million in Russian accounts suspected to be linked to 
the case. A 1998 law requires banks to take such action and report 
to the government when they have well-founded suspicions of money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Folco Galli, spokesman for the Federal Office for Police  
Affairs, told The Associated Press a number of reports have been 
received in connection with the Bank of New York case. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Assistant Attorney General  
James Robinson, former CIA Director James Woolsey and even a former 
Russian KGB agent have been asked to testify before the House 
Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers was appearing today as the first witness in two days of  
hearings by the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has been put on the defensive by  
suspicions, fueled by the money-laundering allegations, that 
International Monetary Fund loans to Russia may have been illegally 
diverted through U.S. banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said earlier this month that the United States, as the  
IMF's biggest member, has delayed deciding whether it should 
approve new loans to Russia from the lending agency until a full 
accounting is made of the money already lent. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia now owes some $16 billion of the $22 billion that the  
182-nation IMF has lent it since 1992. The IMF board is expected 
soon to consider approving a second, $640 million installment under 
a $4.5 billion loan package for Russia that was previously 
authorized. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Ivanov, deputy head of the Federal Security Service,  
Russia's main intelligence agency, said Monday that U.S. 
investigators have presented no evidence that money from the IMF or 
other international agencies was involved in the alleged money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor was there any evidence that high-level Russian officials  
were involved, said Ivanov. He headed a team of Russian 
investigators who met in Washington last week with FBI Director 
Louis Freeh and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ivanov's statement Monday that U.S. investigators have  
material suggesting Russian businesses laundered money through the 
Bank of New York appeared to contradict Russian Prime Minister 
Vladimir Putin, who said earlier Monday that the visit produced no 
evidence of Russian money being misdirected. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov's remarks also contradicted his own comments last week in  
Washington. Russian officials have been saying the case has been 
overblown by Western media and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of New York spokesman Cary Giacalone declined to comment on  
the latest statements from Ivanov. He repeated the bank's previous 
position that it has not been accused of any wrongdoing and 
declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into 
money-laundering allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in a recent meeting with Putin at an economic  
summit in New Zealand, warned that corruption and money laundering 
``could eat the heart out of Russian society'' unless the 
government forcefully combats the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In money laundering, illicit profits from drug trafficking and  
other criminal activities often are moved through a series of bank 
accounts to make them appear to be legitimate business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time the money-laundering allegations have surfaced,  
a more compelling scandal for most Russians has unfolded involving 
bribes that President Boris Yeltsin and his family allegedly 
received from a Swiss company for lucrative Kremlin construction 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has insisted that his finances were above board and that  
no member of his family had a foreign bank account.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Gooding Jr. Marriage Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The irrepressible Cuba Gooding Jr. says  
Hollywood appears tolerant of his interracial marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, Hollywood is like `What are you doing married? I  
don't care what color she is man, come on! The clubs on Sunset 
Strip are open!''' said the black actor, who won an Oscar for his 
supporting role as a football star in ``Jerry McGuire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooding, 31, and wife Sara, 29, have two children -- 5-year-old  
Spencer and 2-year-old Mason. They met at a party when Gooding was 
in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was the strongest girl I'd ever met, so I said, `Oh my  
God, your arms are so strong.' So I hit her, and she hit me back,'' 
he said in the October Cosmopolitan. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't start dating right away. ``But every time I saw  
her,'' he said, ``I'd punch her in the arm, and she would punch me. 
When I finally met Sara's mom, she said, `So this is the kid who 
gave you those bruises?'''

<HEADLINE> Gold Prices Up After Brit. Auction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gold futures took their biggest one-day leap in more than a year  
Tuesday, rising $6 an ounce after a British auction brought a more 
glittering price for the metal than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, prices of natural gas futures fell and frozen  
pork bellies advanced sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold, once the commodity of choice, lost its luster years ago  
and remains at less than a third of its all-time high of $875 per 
troy ounce in 1980. Back then, Soviet troops were moving into 
Afghanistan, the United States had double-digit inflation and oil 
prices were soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, however, central banks have been dumping their  
gold reserves in favor of better-performing investments such as 
U.S. Treasury bonds. Prices dipped to a 20-year low of $255 an 
ounce this summer and have remained stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Treasury joined the get-out-of-gold rush this year  
and went ahead with its second sale on Tuesday despite continuing 
criticism that selling when the price has plummeted so far amounts 
to a government giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
	A falling U.S. dollar helped bring slightly above-market prices,  
with the Bank of England sale fetching $255.75 an ounce for its 25 
metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	That's still nearly $27 less than what the metal was selling for  
when the government announced the sale in May. But experts were 
encouraged by the strong interest by South Africa's Gold Fields, 
the world's No. 2 gold producer, which bought 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overall tone is far superior to the last auction and  
better than the market anticipated,'' said Bill O'Neill, senior 
futures strategist for Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold finished at $261.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	A gold trader for Fimat USA Inc. in New York said expectations  
are that the price will now settle in somewhere between $255 and 
$275. But ``all bets are off depending on what the stock market is 
doing,'' said the trader, who declined to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseasonably cool temperatures sent natural gas futures  
spiraling lower for the seventh time in the last eight trading days 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The autumn chill has brought a sudden halt to demand for gas to  
generate electricity for air conditioning, and the high-demand 
season for heating gas remains weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for delivery in October fell 9.2 cents to $2.427 per  
million British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil, meanwhile, rose again on the eve of the meeting of  
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna, 
Austria. OPEC is widely expected to extend current production 
levels, which would keep supplies tight. 
</P>
<P>
	October crude rose 17 cents to $24.46 a barrel; October heating  
oil fell .47 cent to 59.78 cents a gallon; October unleaded regular 
gasoline fell .32 cent to 68.13 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude for November delivery rose 2  
cents to $22.68 on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, pork belly futures advanced  
more than 5 percent, a day after a report showed much less in cold 
storage -- 435.9 million pounds -- than had been estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Roose, an analyst for U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des  
Moines, Iowa, said the reaction to the report turned into a 
stampede. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a record cold storage number, and still much larger  
than last year,'' he said. ``It's just not as big as last year. The 
market probably overreacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	February frozen pork bellies rose 3 cents to 56.77 cents a  
pound.

<HEADLINE> Bus Bomb Kills 4 in S. Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines (AP) -- A bomb exploded inside a  
passenger bus taking a rest stop in the southern Philippines today, 
killing at least four people -- including two small children -- and 
injuring dozens of others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at least the fourth blast to hit buses on the island of  
Mindanao since last month. The earlier attacks injured several 
passengers. Military and police have linked those attacks to 
members of the extremist Abu Sayyaf secessionist group or a Muslim 
separatist group. 
</P>
<P>
	No one immediately claimed responsibility for today's blast.  
</P>
<P>
	The latest bombing prompted the military to set up checkpoints  
along the two national highways in the western half of Mindanao to 
inspect all buses. The military also instructed police to take 
security measures at the region's 300 bus terminals, Lt. Gen. 
Edgardo Espinosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was parked outside rows of eateries in Dipolog City,  
about 16 miles east of Zamboanga, for a rest stop, when the bomb 
exploded in the middle of the vehicle, police officer Virgilo 
Fuentevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 30-year-old mother was found dead on the bus, while her  
husband, 36, and their 6-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son died 
at a hospital, Fuentevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 29 passengers who had been resting inside the bus,  
along with three street vendors, were treated at hospitals. Some 
were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the approximately 60 passengers had left the bus  
before the explosion, Fuentevilla said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lunchtime blast also injured several passengers on another  
bus parked beside the first. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating the type of explosives used. They  
suspected that a timing device was used, similar to those employed 
in the other recent bombings.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Allows Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The Colombian government granted  
Occidental Petroleum a license to explore for oil next to Indian 
lands Tuesday -- a step a tribe says could spell death for its 
people and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the cultural threat and the environmental impact  
minimal, the government said it granted the license to promote 
Colombia's economic development. 
</P>
<P>
	Environment Minister Juan Mayr announced the decision to allow  
the Los Angeles-based company to conduct exploratory drilling just 
outside a 543,000-acre reserve inhabited by the tiny U'wa Indian 
nation of 8,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the government expanded the tribe's reservation  
nearly four-fold. The semi-nomadic U'wa fish and farm in the hilly 
forested territory near Colombia's border with Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayr denied the U'wa were given the land to make them favorably  
disposed toward the oil exploration permit. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way. They are totally different issues,'' the minister told  
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian group, which in 1997 threatened mass suicide to  
prevent oil drilling on its lands, isn't ready to back down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U'wa people are rejecting and condemning this decision,''  
spokesman Ebaristo Tegria told The Associated Press by telephone 
from tribal offices in Cubara, just outside the reserve. ``This 
spells cultural and environmental genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major oil project so close to U'wa lands would attract the  
same kind of violence and environmental destruction that plagues 
oil-producing regions throughout Colombia, Tegria said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels hiding in the jungle have kidnapped oil executives and  
have carried out 55 dynamite attacks on pipelines this year, 
sending oil gushing into the jungles. Thousands of soldiers have 
been detailed to guard the installations. 
</P>
<P>
	Occidental Petroleum has tried for several years to obtain  
permission to drill for oil in the so-called Samore bloc, believing 
it could contain as many as 2.5 billion barrels of crude. 
</P>
<P>
	After first applying to explore directly on U'wa lands, the  
company backed down last year amid heavy international criticism by 
activists riveted by the U'wa suicide threats. The group considers 
oil the sacred ``blood of mother earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the company resubmitted its application, this time  
to drill two to three miles outside the U'wa territory. The permit 
skirts constitutional requirements that grant Indians to power to 
manage their resources. 
</P>
<P>
	If sizable petroleum deposits are found in the area, the company  
will have to reapply for a license to take the oil out of the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil is Colombia's top source of foreign exchange, but government  
officials say a drop-off in business investment could make the 
country a net oil importer by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayr claimed the government could ensure the U'wa are shielded  
from any violence associated with the oil industry's coming. 
</P>
<P>
	That's almost impossible to guarantee, said David Rothschild,  
director of the Amazon Coalition, a Washington D.C.-based 
environmental group that has backed the U'wa cause. ``The Colombian 
government has shown no ability to keep violence out of these 
areas. So the promises are hollow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three American activists working with the U'wa were kidnapped  
near the reserve and killed in March by a unit of the rebel 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

<HEADLINE> Officials: Russia To Make Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will make all its October debt payments,  
both foreign and domestic, even if the newest installment of an 
International Monetary Fund loan is delayed, Russian finance 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF approved a $4.5 billion loan to Russia in late July and  
released $640 million of it shortly thereafter. The Russian 
government is waiting for the next $640 million, but the IMF has 
said that portion will be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	First Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said Tuesday that  
even if the credit comes late, Russia will meet its obligations 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have enough hard currency resources to pay the debt,''  
Kudrin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF is considering whether it should impose additional  
controls on the use of IMF funds in Russia. It is also 
investigating allegations of financial corruption involving the 
Russian government. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told reporters  
that Russia is prepared to negotiate for a substantial reduction in 
its foreign debt to the London Club of commercial creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not specify how much of a break Russia requested. The two  
sides talked last week and will take up the discussion again when 
the next round of London Club talks resumes in Frankfurt on 
Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia owes the commercial creditors of its Soviet-era debt  
around $30 billion. It has missed $1.3 billion in payments since 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is looking for an agreement that will let it  
reduce its debt burden enough to cover domestic spending needs 
while still servicing its foreign and domestic debt, Kasyanov said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that Russia's current debt burden would require it to  
use up to 70 percent of its budget revenues to finance debt service 
payments. The 2000 draft budget earmarks 27 percent of revenues for 
debt payments, he said.

<HEADLINE> Study Eyes Blacks on Television </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A new study suggests that prime-time TV's  
reflection of cultural diversity may not be a whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the top six networks will have a higher percentage of  
blacks as regular characters in comedies and dramas this fall than 
there is in the general population, said a report by TN Media, 
which advises companies on TV advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, all networks do a poor job in representing Hispanics and  
other minorities, according to the study issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP is considering a boycott of network television because  
of a lack of minority representation on TV. The organization began 
investigating the issue when it discovered the new shows on 
networks this fall were overwhelmingly white. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanic groups have similar complaints, and are in the midst of  
a two-week ``brownout'' urging their followers not to watch TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study said 18 percent of CBS's characters this fall are  
black; the figure is 14 percent at ABC. Blacks now represent about 
13 percent of the nation's population. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight percent of NBC's characters are and Fox was at 7 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	The two developing networks, which both air shows that  
specifically appeal to a black audience, do much better. On UPN, 45 
percent of the characters are black and 23 percent are black on the 
WB. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-network average is 16 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The networks seem to be fairly representative,'' said TN  
Media's Steve Sternberg. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear how much the percentages changed after the NAACP  
made diversity a public issue. With the situation pointed out to 
the networks, several shows in production began adding minority 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the National Association for the Advancement of  
Colored People said the organization is equally concerned about the 
lack of minority executives, writers and production people at the 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly we're glad that there are a number of minority  
characters on camera,'' said the NAACP's John White, ``but we're 
still saying this is more than a matter of who's on screen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 3 percent of the prime-time characters on the networks are  
minorities other than blacks, the report said. Hispanics alone make 
up 9 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Sternberg argued that the idea that blacks were much better  
represented onscreen during the 1970s and 1980s is not true. And he 
disagreed with the notion that networks don't cater to blacks 
because advertisers are only interested in young, upscale whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone appealing to the same audience hurts us all, viewers  
and advertisers alike,'' he said. ``It limits our choices, further 
polarizes the audience and contributes to network ratings 
erosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TN Media's study of viewing habits indicated that CBS is the  
most popular network among black viewers, as it is now with all 
viewers. Blacks watch nearly 72 hours of television, on average, 
each week, while whites watch 50 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost half of all Hispanic television viewing is to Spanish  
language television, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Aussies Plan Pre-Olympic Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Out-of-competition drug tests on  
athletes preparing for next year's Olympics will be held outside 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC coordination commission head Jacques Rogge said Tuesday that  
in addition to some 2,000 tests at various sports events there will 
be another 200 to 400 out-of-competition tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would be conducted on accredited athletes who enter  
Australian territory,'' Rogge said during a visit to check on 
Sydney organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic  
Games completed the sale of its plans on how to prepare for an 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee has agreed to pay SOCOG $3.5  
million for the rights to those plans, which will be passed on to 
future host cities such as Athens, Greece; Salt Lake City; and 
Turin, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will definitely allow them in many fields to win a year or  
two because you don't have to reinvent the wheel,'' Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The information covers a range of subjects -- from organizational  
structure to the amount of milk athletes drink to the number of 
buses needed for an Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games showed  
SOCOG a lot of goodwill, one thing we have learned to our cost in 
undertaking this enormous task is the lack of useful management 
knowledge passed on from one city to the next,'' IOC chief 
executive Sandy Hollway said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arlington Racecourse To Reopen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) -- Arlington International  
Racecourse received approval Tuesday from the Illinois Racing Board 
to reopen next year with a summer thoroughbred meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington, the state's top track before it closed in 1997 in a  
dispute over competition from casino gambling, was awarded the 
dates May 14 through Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're excited to be back under way. We'll be opening on  
Mother's Day,'' spokesman Thom Serafin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arlington Million will be held in August. The track also has  
been bidding for the Breeders Cup, but that prestigious event 
wouldn't be moved to Arlington for at least a few years, Serafin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Track president Richard L. Duchossois closed the racecourse two  
years ago when he was unable to get state legislation passed to 
help the ailing horse racing industry better compete with the 
state's 10 gambling boats and others casinos in nearby Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he was able to work out a deal with state lawmakers  
that gave the racing industry a big cut of casino profits. One 
recent estimate puts the track's cut at $11 million from a new 
casino proposed for the nearby Chicago suburb of Rosemont. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long road, and we are proud of the consensus that  
our industry has achieved,'' Duchossois said. ``We are investing 
millions of dollars and working diligently to present a special 
on-track experience for our 2000 re-opening, and we look forward to 
helping lead Illinois racing back to national prominence.''

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Profits Beat Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Driven by a strong overseas presence, Goldman  
Sachs Group Inc. beat Wall Street's predictions with profits that 
soared 94 percent in its third fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment bank on Tuesday posted net income of $638  
million, or $1.31 a share, for the quarter ended Aug. 27, easily 
beating analysts' estimates of $1.09. Goldman earned pro forma 
profits of $329 million, or 69 cents a share in the third quarter 
last year, when the company was still privately held. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest three-month period marked Goldman's first full  
quarter as a publicly-held company. 
</P>
<P>
	Total third-quarter revenues were $6.44 billion, up from $5.74  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``All in all, we're pretty impressed with the quarter,'' said  
Lauren Smith, an investment banking analyst with Putnam, Lovell &AMP; 
Thornton. She cited Goldman's active role in international mergers 
and acquisitions, and stock and bond underwriting for the company's 
strong third quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Goldman Sachs fell $1.62 1/2 to $59.12 1/2 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman chief financial officer David Viniar said in a  
conference call with reporters that Goldman was involved in seven 
of the 10 largest international mergers and acquistions during the 
bank's fiscal third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman also benefited from investors' continued interest in  
initial public stock offerings from technology firms, especially 
anything Internet-related. The company reported $1.2 billion in 
third-quarter revenues from its investment banking arm, a 25 
percent increase from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Goldman's successful third-quarter IPOs was Red Hat Inc.,  
a vendor for the popular Linux software line. Red Hat's stock has 
risen almost 700 percent to over $110 a share from $14 since its 
IPO last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very strong quarter across the board in investment  
banking,'' Viniar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Viniar added that Goldman was ``cautiously optimistic'' for the  
bank's fourth-quarter results, when charges related to Goldman's 
$531 million purchase of the Hull Group are expected to be factored 
into the company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman's purchase of Chicago-based Hull Group is another effort  
by Goldman to move into electronic trading. Hull Group matches buy 
and sell orders on several electronic trading networks. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Goldman posted earnings of  
$1.8 billion, or $3.73 a share, compared with $1.3 billion or $2.64 
a share during the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues climbed to $18.7 billion from $18.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Restoration of F-22 Funds Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are moving toward reviving one of  
the Air Force's top priorities, its new F-22 stealth fighter, as 
GOP congressional leaders seek to clear obstacles to must-pass 
spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	House-Senate bargainers will try to decide how much money for  
the F-22 they will provide in hopes of completing a compromise $267 
billion defense bill for the coming fiscal year that lawmakers 
could vote on soon. Fiscal 2000 begins on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on condition of anonymity, congressional aides said  
Monday that Republican leaders have ordered negotiators from the 
House and Senate to restore at least some of the $1.8 billion for 
the F-22 that the House killed in July. 
</P>
<P>
	That money is enough to buy the first six of the warplanes,  
which the Air Force envisions as the chief guarantor of U.S. air 
supremacy in coming years. The F-22 is supported by the Senate and 
the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	According to aides, House bargainers offered over the weekend to  
provide enough money for two of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,  
discussed the dispute Monday with Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., 
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee subcommittee that 
oversees the Pentagon's budget. Stevens told a reporter that he had 
offered ``some savings'' from the F-22 program but said it was 
``rejected out of hand'' by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., was  
quoted by the St. Petersburg Times on Sunday as saying GOP leaders 
agreed to purchase an unspecified number of F-22s next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Restoration of the money would mark a major victory for the Air  
Force and Lockheed Martin Corp., the aircraft's prime contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force already has spent $25 billion to develop the F-22  
and plans to spend an additional $40 billion to build 339 of them. 
That would be a price tag of nearly $200 million per plane, the 
most expensive jet fighter ever built. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its ability to evade radar, the F-22 would carry  
computers letting pilots destroy targets well before they are 
visible and would be able to cruise at supersonic speeds without 
using afterburners. The Air Force hopes the first F-22s will be 
part of its fleet of warplanes in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics, led by Lewis, say the aircraft is too expensive and  
would divert funds from other Air Force priorities, such as 
designing a new bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis spokesman Jim Specht declined to comment on the  
bargaining, saying only that the lawmaker considers the F-22 
question ``an unsettled situation at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the House bill, the $1.8 billion sought for the F-22 was  
used for other programs, including buying more F-15 and F-16 
fighters and KC-130J air tanker planes not requested by President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Congress has completed just four of the 13 spending  
bills for the coming year. Already, six face potential vetoes over 
such disagreements as a proposal to eliminate the AmeriCorps 
national service program to language forbidding the District of 
Columbia from distributing free hypodermic needles to drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, Republicans have been moving toward Clinton  
administration and Democratic positions on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has reduced or eliminated cuts the House has made in  
NASA and housing. And the two chambers' leaders have agreed to 
provide $7.6 billion in emergency aid for farmers because of low 
commodity prices, something congressional Democrats had been 
demanding.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves' Smith Out With Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves forward Joe Smith will  
miss up to seven weeks after surgery on his left foot Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith fractured the foot in a pickup basketball game at UCLA  
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Team orthopedic surgeon David Fischer placed a screw in the  
broken bone in an operation at the Minneapolis Sports Medicine 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a 6-foot-10 forward who signed a one-year deal to return  
to Minnesota this summer, is expected to be in a cast for a week 
and then begin rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	He's expected to miss all of training camp, which begins Oct. 1,  
but the team hopes he'll be ready for the season opener Nov. 5 
against the Sacramento Kings in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed that this happened to Joe after he worked  
so hard this summer,'' said Flip Saunders, the Wolves' coach and 
general manager. ``We are encouraged that he will be back around 
the time we start the regular season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the No. 1 overall choice in the 1995 draft when he was  
selected by the Golden State Warriors, re-signed with the Wolves 
for one year and $2.2 million this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded from the 76ers to the Wolves on Feb. 17, 1998, and  
signed with the Wolves as a free agent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith played 43 games for the Timberwolves last season,  
averaging 13.7 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks. He was ninth in 
the league in offensive rebounds with 3.6 per game.

<HEADLINE> Japan Won't Ease Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Bank of Japan refused today to ease monetary  
policy to curb a rapid rise in the value of the yen against the 
dollar, surprising the financial markets which had expected a 
relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that sent the yen soaring, the BOJ said that monetary  
policy should not be used to control the exchange rate, and the 
bank cannot act just because markets expect a move. 
</P>
<P>
	Government leaders, who have warned that gains by the yen could  
derail Japan's nascent economic recovery, were not happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BOJ is not doing something that is obviously needed, and  
is becoming obstinate.'' said Ichizo Ohara, a member of the lower 
house of parliament and policy adviser to Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BOJ executives are thinking only about themselves,'' he  
added, referring to speculation that the BOJ defied the Finance 
Ministry's push to further ease monetary policy in order to assert 
its independence. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen is considered damaging to Japanese companies  
because it makes their exports more expensive abroad, and thus less 
competitive, while reducing the value of foreign profits in yen 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had said that a decision to ease monetary policy could  
curb upward pressure on the yen if it helped lower long-term 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists saw the situation differently than politicians.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the BOJ announcement, Japan's chief economic planner said  
the currency's upward trend is not necessarily bad news for the 
fragile economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the appreciation of the yen hurts the export sector, it  
also helps to considerably reduce the cost of imports for other 
firms,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes of the BOJ announcement, the dollar plunged more  
than 2 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.42 yen by late afternoon, down 2.50 yen  
from late Monday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 
106.38 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare move, the BOJ issued a statement explaining its  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effect of such steps, even if there is one, is one-time  
only and wouldn't be long-lasting, so as a central bank, we can't 
take policy steps for which we can't explain the purpose or the 
effect,'' the BOJ said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the announcement, BOJ governor Masaru Hayami said that the  
bank will continue using intervention to smooth currency market 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
	Many government officials have argued that the government should  
intervene to stabilize the foreign exchange market, and that it 
should coordinate with the United States to that end. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has been widespread in the media that Japan has  
already requested U.S. aid in combating the yen's appreciation 
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today that he and  
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers will probably discuss 
exchange rates when they meet later this week in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, economists said Japan need not worry so much about a  
strong yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Naldrett, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in  
Tokyo, said a strong yen wouldn't hurt the economy since forces are 
already in place for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are comparing this appreciation to the '90s, when it  
killed the economy,'' Naldrett said. At that time, monetary policy 
was tight and interest rates were high, smothering domestic demand. 
``The two episodes are entirely different.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Tycoon May Want LA NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Marvin Davis, who has shown interest in  
building a stadium and bringing an NFL team to Hollywood Park in 
Inglewood, reportedly is considering whether to pay more than $1 
billion for a team and facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported today that Davis met with NFL  
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue in San Francisco on Monday night. The 
league is trying to decide where to place a new expansion 
franchise, which would be its 32nd team. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's deadline for dealing exclusively with groups in Los  
Angeles passed last Wednesday, but the league was continuing to 
speak with representatives here beyond that self-imposed deadline. 
However, Houston -- which has a stadium proposal and financing plan 
set to go -- is considered the likely favorite to get the new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 74, and his sons, Gregg and John, met last week with  
retired Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway, the newspaper said. 
There had been preliminary talks with Elway's representatives about 
the possibility of giving Elway a 10 percent stake in the team in 
exchange for becoming team president, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Finnigan, a Davis representative at Hollywood Park, did  
not immediately return a phone call from The Associated Press 
placed before business hours today. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, an oil tycoon, faces a decision later this week. The  
option he holds on approximately 100 acres of land at Hollywood 
Park expires Friday unless he puts down a $250,000 payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's expansion committee plans to discuss possibilities for  
the new franchise at its Oct. 5 meeting in Atlanta. The league's 
full membership begins meetings on Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday that the league is  
continuing to talk with Los Angeles representatives. One group 
backing the Los Angeles Coliseum has maintained contact with the 
league. Tagliabue met with Coliseum partners Eli Broad and Ed Roski 
over the weekend, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis told the league that he has the money to bring a team to  
Los Angeles and would not ask the league to contribute $150 million 
toward the construction of the stadium, the Times said. He also 
said his sons would take ownership of the new team. 
</P>
<P>
	He has expressed interest in professional teams before, among  
them the Broncos, the Dallas Cowboys and the Oakland A's. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Davis has refused to publicly comment on his  
reported interest in securing a team for Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Britain Ready To Lift Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British government is ready to lift a ban on  
selling beef on the bone after concluding there is no further 
danger of spreading ``mad cow'' disease. But it has hit resistance 
from regional medical officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could just lift the ban in England, but it makes more sense  
to proceed in an orderly way to lift the ban across the whole of 
the United Kingdom,'' Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer in England,  
reportedly has recommended that the ban could be safely lifted. 
Chief medical officers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, 
however, think the ban should continue for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The government banned the sale of beef on the bone -- including  
rib roasts and T-bone steaks -- in December 1997 based on scientific 
advice that a slight chance existed bone marrow could transmit the 
lethal brain disease to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee said at the  
time that there was a low risk of infection from beef on the bone. 
It estimated a 5 percent chance of a single case arising in one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	A new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been linked to the  
British outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow 
disease. The spongiform diseases eat holes in the brains of 
victims, and no cure has been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-three people have died of the new variant in Britain since  
1995, including four this year, according to the Department of 
Health. Other forms of CJD not related to mad cow disease have 
claimed 22 victims this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the European Union lifted a ban on British beef  
exports that had been imposed in 1996 because of fears of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Welsh National Assembly has called for the ban to be  
lifted as soon as possible, but Alun Michael, the head of the Welsh 
regional government, says it should not be done until new 
scientific reports are received. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay in lifting the ban is one of the first practical  
problems to arise from the government's decision to return some 
powers to new regional governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern 
Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Allows Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The Colombian government granted  
Occidental Petroleum a license to explore for oil next to Indian 
lands Tuesday -- a step a tribe says could spell death for its 
people and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the cultural threat and the environmental impact  
minimal, the government said it granted the license to promote 
Colombia's economic development. 
</P>
<P>
	Environment Minister Juan Mayr announced the decision to allow  
the Los Angeles-based company to conduct exploratory drilling just 
outside a 543,000-acre reserve inhabited by the tiny U'wa Indian 
nation of 8,000 members. The semi-nomadic U'wa fish and farm in the 
hilly forested territory near Colombia's border with Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the government expanded the tribe's reservation  
nearly four-fold. Mayr denied the U'wa were given the land to make 
them favorably disposed toward the oil exploration permit. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way. They are totally different issues,'' the minister told  
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian group, which in 1997 threatened mass suicide to  
prevent oil drilling on its lands, isn't ready to back down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U'wa people are rejecting and condemning this decision,''  
spokesman Ebaristo Tegria told The Associated Press by telephone 
from tribal offices in Cubara, just outside the reserve. ``This 
spells cultural and environmental genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major oil project so close to U'wa lands would attract the  
same kind of violence and environmental destruction that plagues 
oil-producing regions throughout Colombia, Tegria said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels hiding in the jungle have kidnapped oil executives and  
have carried out 55 dynamite attacks on pipelines this year, 
sending oil gushing into the jungles. Thousands of soldiers have 
been detailed to guard the installations. 
</P>
<P>
	An Occidental executive said Tuesday his industry was being  
unfairly blamed for strife endemic to a country where guerrillas 
have a nationwide presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say that oil is a magnet for violence is to ignore the  
reality of Colombia, where in many areas you have violence and no 
oil development, '' said the company official, speaking to The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the company was not prepared to announce when  
the exploratory drilling will begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Occidental Petroleum has tried since 1992 to obtain permission  
to drill for oil in the so-called Samore bloc, believing it could 
contain as many as 2.5 billion barrels of crude. 
</P>
<P>
	After first applying to explore directly on U'wa lands, the  
company backed down last year amid heavy international criticism by 
activists riveted by the U'wa suicide threats. The group considers 
oil the sacred ``blood of mother earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the company resubmitted its application, this time  
to drill two to three miles outside the U'wa territory. The permit 
skirts constitutional requirements that grant Indians to power to 
manage their resources. 
</P>
<P>
	If sizable petroleum deposits are found in the area, the company  
will have to reapply for a license to take the oil out of the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil is Colombia's top source of foreign exchange, but government  
officials say a drop-off in business investment could make the 
country a net oil importer by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayr claimed the government could ensure the U'wa are shielded  
from any violence associated with the oil industry's coming. 
</P>
<P>
	That's almost impossible to guarantee, said David Rothschild,  
director of the Amazon Coalition, a Washington D.C.-based 
environmental group that has backed the U'wa cause. ``The Colombian 
government has shown no ability to keep violence out of these 
areas. So the promises are hollow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three American activists working with the U'wa were kidnapped  
near the reserve and killed in March by a unit of the rebel 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.

<HEADLINE> Bening Says Return to Stage Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Annette Bening says her return to the stage  
was hard work after a decade away from the theater. 
</P>
<P>
	She starred last spring in Henrik Ibsen's ``Hedda Gabler'' in  
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in the middle of rehearsals and I was in probably the  
third act, and I thought, `Oh my gosh, I've been acting for I don't 
know, an hour and a half,''' Ms. Bening said. ```I can't stand up 
anymore, I can't concentrate.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On movie sets, the work comes in fits and starts, Ms. Bening  
said during a recent media tour to promote her new movie, 
``American Beauty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before going full time into film work with such movies as ``The  
Grifters,'' for which she earned an Oscar nomination, Ms. Bening 
had mostly done plays. She said she still gets nervous starting a 
new movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be this foreign thing to me,'' she said. ``Now it  
seems more natural.''

<HEADLINE> Study Probes Newborn Hospital Stays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A study in Ohio found that ``drive-through  
deliveries'' did not increase the likelihood that infants would 
have to be hospitalized again, as some doctors had feared. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the researchers and an expert not involved with the  
study said the results should not be interpreted to mean that 
newborns and their mothers are well-served by hospital stays of 
less than 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the babies' rates of rehospitalization actually  
declined during the four-year study period, their rate of 
outpatient treatment increased 117 percent, and they were also 
slightly more likely to have a home care visit or go to the 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study, I think, could be sorely misused by managed care  
to indicate that early discharge is in fact safe, and that's not 
what this study says,'' said Dr. James A. Lemons, chairman of the 
Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	If babies are discharged too early, doctors may fail to detect  
heart and lung problems, intestinal obstructions and other major 
complications that can be fatal, Lemons said Tuesday from 
Indianapolis, where he heads neonatology at Indiana University 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studies have supported that belief. A 1997 study of  
310,000 births in Washington state found that healthy newborns who 
remained hospitalized for more than a day generally fared better 
than those who went home a few hours after birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Association, covered 1991 to 1995, before a federal law 
began mandating that insurance companies cover at least 48 hours of 
hospitalization for newborns and their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors, led by Dr. Uma R. Kotagal of Children's Hospital  
Medical Center in Cincinnati, reviewed the records of more than 
102,000 healthy, full-term newborns of Ohio mothers receiving 
Medicaid. Their average length of stay decreased from 2.2 days in 
1991 to 1.6 days in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The share of newborns who were sent home less than a day after a  
vaginal delivery or two days after a Caesarean birth increased from 
21 percent to 59.8 percent during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rates of rehospitalization within two weeks of discharge  
went down 23 percent, the researchers said. They speculated that a 
campaign by some Ohio hospitals to better coordinate care for 
newborns after discharge may have been part of the reason.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Wants Lift on All Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea welcomed the partial  
lifting of U.S. economic sanctions and asked Tuesday for the 
remaining sanctions to be removed as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good development, though it is not comprehensive and  
came belatedly,'' said the Korean Central News Agency, North 
Korea's official overseas news outlet. ``The United States should 
show good faith by lifting the remaining sanctions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The response came four days after Washington partially lifted a  
half-century of restrictions against the North as part of a new 
policy of engaging the impoverished communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	Restrictions were eased on U.S. imports of raw materials and  
most goods made in North Korea, sales of most U.S. consumer goods 
and financial services to the North and U.S. investment in the 
North's agriculture and transportation system, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	But sanctions remain against sales of U.S. weapons and  
missile-related technology, unlicensed exports of ``dual-use'' 
goods or technology -- items that could have military uses -- 
regulated by the Commerce Department, and unauthorized financial 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was the most significant gesture toward the North since  
the 1950-53 Korean War, including a modest trade opening in 1995. 
The sanctions have been in place since 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States acted a week after talks with North Korea in  
Berlin, where the North agreed not to test-fire a long-range 
missile as long as dialogue continues. 
</P>
<P>
	The North's rival, South Korea, also welcomed the development  
while Japan said it might follow suit if North Korea proves it is 
serious about halting missile tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry will discuss North  
Korea policy with South Korean leaders this week, officials here 
said Tuesday. Perry, President Clinton's policy coordinator on 
North Korea, will arrive Wednesday in Seoul and meet with President 
Kim Dae-jung, Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Hong Soon-young 
and Unification Minister Lim Dong-won. 
</P>
<P>
	The North repeated demands Tuesday that have been rejected by  
the United States and South Korea, including the complete 
withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fought on South Korea's side during the Korean  
War, and about 37,000 U.S. troops remain in the South under a 
defense treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	With its economy in tatters, North Korea has been relying on  
outside aid to feed its 22 million people since 1995. Its farm 
industry has been ruined by decades of mismanagement aggravated by 
years of bad weather.

<HEADLINE> Twins 4, Athletics 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Ryan took a shutout into the  
seventh inning to earn his first major league victory and the 
Oakland Athletics' playoff hopes faded some more Monday night with 
a 4-0 loss to the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Before just 6,512, Oakland's second-smallest home crowd this  
season, the A's dropped five games behind idle Boston in the AL 
wild-card race. Oakland has 13 games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Appier (15-13) allowed three runs and eight hits in 6 2-3  
innings, dropping to 6-4 since the A's acquired him from Kansas 
City on July 31. He struck out a season-high eight but matched his 
career high for losses in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan (1-2), a 23-year-old right-hander making his seventh career  
start, allowed five hits in six-plus innings, struck out one and 
walked three. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Coomer drove in three runs for the Twins, who have won  
consecutive games for the first time since Sept. 5-6 against Tampa 
Bay. Minnesota is 5-14 in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan allowed just one runner past second base. John Jaha doubled  
leading off the second and was thrown out at the plate by Matt 
Lawton when he tried to score on Ben Grieve's single to right. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ryan walked Jason Giambi starting the seventh, Kevin  
Miller got Matt Stairs to ground into a double play. Rich Becker 
hit a drive to the warning track in center with two on and two 
outs, but Torii Hunter ran it down with a fine over-the-shoulder 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Coomer's sacrifice fly drove in Brent Gates in the first, and he  
hit RBI singles in the seventh and ninth innings. Hunter singled 
home a run in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The A's smallest home crowd was 5,377 against Anaheim on  
April 13. ... Ryan has never started a day game and had not started 
a game on grass until Monday night. ... The Twins have won 19 of 
the last 24 games in which they score first. ... Grieve has not 
driven in a run in 26 at-bats against Minnesota this season despite 
a .370 career batting average against the Twins, his best against 
any team. ... Stairs needs one homer for career No. 100. ... 
Giambi's .381 batting average since the All-Star break is the best 
in the American League and his 64 RBIs tie Texas' Rafael Palmiero 
for the lead.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Bio Mixes Fiction, History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David McCullough, Pulitzer Prize winner for his  
book on Harry Truman, was intrigued that a fellow writer had 
imagined himself a lifelong acquaintance of Ronald Reagan in his 
biography of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a beautiful afternoon here on Martha's Vineyard that  
I thought I'd go help John Adams mow hay,'' McCullough, author of 
``Truman'' and a Massachusetts resident, said with a laugh Monday. 
``I've been working on a book about Adams for five or six years and 
the prospect of spending some time with him is quite appealing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Dutch,'' an authorized biography, Edmund Morris uses a  
technique more in the spirit of ``Forrest Gump'' than historical 
scholarship. Morris, himself a Pulitzer winner for his biography of 
Theodore Roosevelt, invents a narrator for his current book. And 
not just any narrator, but ``Edmund Morris,'' a contemporary of 
Reagan's. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dutch'' was commissioned back in the mid-1980s, when Reagan  
was president, and Morris was given extensive access. Although the 
author was born nearly 30 years after his subject, he places 
himself with Reagan on the football field, the college campus and 
at the Army Air Force's motion picture unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Few have seen advanced copies of ``Dutch,'' which will go on  
sale next week, but it has already been criticized by historians 
and Reagan associates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as he levels with the reader, I don't think it's a  
problem,'' McCullough said. ``I have great respect for Edmund 
Morris. He's a first-rate biographer and a first-rate author. He's 
chosen to try something unusual, but the author is free to do what 
an author wishes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris' approach is highly unusual for biography, but it's  
common for fiction. In Gore Vidal's ``Creation,'' set during the 
fifth century B.C., the author invents a traveling diplomat who 
meets Confucius and Plato among others. Real and fictional 
characters encounter each other throughout such E.L. Doctorow 
novels as ``Ragtime'' and ``Billy Bathgate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest U.S. presidential biographies employed more than  
just fictional techniques -- they gave us myths. The first 
presidential ``biographer'' of any real fame was the 19th-century 
writer Parson Weems, whose concoctions included such tall tales as 
George Washington's cutting down the cherry tree. Carl Sandburg 
later had great success with his massive, romanticized biography of 
Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent biographies have been more scholarly, but still  
controversial. In the 1960s, William Manchester was authorized by 
the Kennedys to write a book on the recently assassinated 
president, only to have the family threaten to block publication 
because he wouldn't make proposed changes. Robert Caro has been 
strongly criticized by supporters of Lyndon Johnson for his 
unflattering books about the late president's early years in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even novels about presidents have been attacked. Several critics  
and academics were enraged by Vidal's ``Lincoln,'' which was 
published in 1984 and offered a much earthier, more skeptical 
portrait than what been written before. 
</P>
<P>
	The tension between historians and writers of fiction is  
longstanding. From Herodotus in ancient Greece to Morris today, 
writers of ``non-fiction'' have been accused of treating literary 
style as a higher truth than historical fact. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, McCullough noted, historians have called for  
their peers to raise their works beyond the simple assembly of 
information. He cited a passage by the 19th-century historian 
Francis Parkman, from the introduction to ``France and England in 
North America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Faithfulness to the truth of history involves far more than  
the research, however patient and scrupulous, into special facts,'' 
Parkman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The narrator must seek to imbue himself with the life and  
spirit of the time. ... He must himself be, as it were, a sharer or 
a spectator of the action he describes.''

<HEADLINE> Harvey Threatens Fla.'s West Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Harvey headed for  
Florida's west coast Monday with 60 mph winds and heavy rain, 
threatening to swamp low-lying areas and beachfront hotels and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm is expected to bring high winds and flooding to  
Florida's west coast as it hits land Tuesday. But many residents 
and visitors were strolling and playing on the beach, unconcerned 
about forecasts that the winds could approach hurricane strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one isn't really half so bad, is it?'' asked David Ray,  
whose vacation from England included a stay in Orlando last week 
during Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	That storm grazed the state's east coast as it swept from the  
Bahamas to New England -- causing dozens of deaths and massive 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m. EDT Tuesday, Harvey was centered about 120 miles  
west-southwest of St. Petersburg, moving east-northeast near 9 mph. 
It took a slight turn to the south early Tuesday, but was still 
moving toward Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Maximum sustained winds increased to near 60 mph, with higher  
gusts. Tropical storm force winds of at least 39 mph extended as 
much as 205 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected Harvey would spin across the Florida  
peninsula and stay offshore as it heads north along the U.S. East 
Coast, sparing places like North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency throughout Florida,  
except for the extreme northwest, in the Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, a flood watch was posted for much of central,  
southwest and northeast Florida through Tuesday, including areas 
soaked last week by Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect for much of the western  
Florida coast, while a Hurricane watch remained in effect from just 
south of Fort Meyers to the mouth of the Suwannee River north of 
Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Voluntary evacuations were called Monday afternoon in counties  
in the storm's path. Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches were likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey could produce storm surge flooding of 3 to 6 feet above  
normal, up to 8 feet above normal at the heads of bays, said 
hurricane center forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bermuda's government issued a hurricane warning for  
the island Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 a.m., Gert was 200 miles south-southeast of Bermuda and  
moving to the north-northwest at about 12 mph. Top sustained winds 
were at 110 mph, with some weakening expected in the next 24 hours.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LUXEMBOURG (AP) -- Weary from three straight weeks of tennis and  
unwilling to make a trans-Atlantic flight, U.S. Open champion 
Serena Williams withdrew from the Seat Open on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the fourth tournament from which she has withdrawn this  
year. The WTA Tour said she could lose $16,900 in year-end bonus 
money for the no-shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was top-seeded for this $180,000 tournament and was to  
begin play Thursday after receiving a first-round bye.

	``I feel I cannot make the journey this week, as I am mentally  
and physically exhausted after three consecutive weeks of tennis,'' 
she said in a statement released by the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The organizers of the Seat Open called Williams' decision  
``incomprehensible'' and said it showed ``lack of respect'' for 
tennis fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such behavior will cause great damage to the international  
women's tennis,'' said Charles Koster, chairman of International 
Women's Tennis Promotion Luxembourg.

	Players lose one-thirteenth of their bonus money each time they  
pull out of a tournament to which they have committed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams pulled out of a tournament in Hilton Head Island, S.C.,  
because of knee trouble and a tournament in Toronto because of 
shoulder tendinitis. The 17-year-old also missed Wimbledon because 
of flu but that is not considered a WTA Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	Tour spokesman John Dolan said Williams could still recoup some  
or all of the $16,900 if she commits to more events this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are just following the rules,'' he said. ``It is not a  
punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players who withdraw because of injury need a medical  
certificate, but that procedure does not apply when they cite 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is up to the player,'' said Clare Wood, the WTA Tour  
representative in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the U.S. Open two weeks ago, Williams joined the  
U.S. team that won the Fed Cup final against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is to play tournaments in Munich and Filderstadt,  
Germany, in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very much looking to forward to beginning my fall season  
at Luxembourg,'' Williams said. ``I am very sorry for the fans and 
the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was replaced in the field by Belgian Els Callens. Callens  
will play Barbara Schwartz in the second round. The Austrian 
defeated Spain's Magui Serna 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mixed Tuesday, with  
prices surging in Tokyo and Malaysia, but slipping in Hong Kong and 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained  
357.53 points, or 2.04 percent, to close at 17,932.79. On Monday, 
the average closed up 232.99 points, or 1.34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks rose as traders awaited the Bank of Japan's  
decision on monetary policy. The market closed before the 
announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had said a decision to ease monetary policy could curb  
upward pressure on the Japanese yen -- a boon for Japan's exporters 
-- if it helped lower long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell after the Japanese  
central bank decided to leave its monetary policy unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	This took financial markets by surprise, as many had predicted  
the bank would opt for an easing in a bid to halt the yen's rise 
against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 105.42 yen, down 2.50 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo and below its late New York level of 106.38 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kuala Lumpur, the key index surged 4.1 percent as Malaysia  
further eased its controversial capital controls on Tuesday by 
simplifying an exit tax for foreigners who take their profits out 
of the local stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, announced that the  
10-percent flat tax on profits would be implemented immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	This meant that all profits from funds brought into the country  
on or after Feb. 15 are now subject to a levy of 10 percent, 
regardless of when the profits are repatriated, Bank Negara said. 
</P>
<P>
	This system replaces a more stringent and complicated two-tier  
exit levy put in place in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 29.27  
points to close at 739.30. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares also closed sharply higher as a powerful  
earthquake in Taiwan spurred investors to buy stocks of 
semiconductor and petrochemical companies as many of these local 
firms compete directly with many of their Taiwanese counterparts, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 23.54 points, or 2.5  
percent, to 957.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed slightly lower on profit-taking.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 51.91 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 
13,420.46. On Monday, the index had slipped 12.47 points, or 0.09 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said investors took profits on renewed worries over a  
possible rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also concerned about the Hong Kong government's  
plans to launch mutual funds next month to sell some of the massive 
shareholdings it acquired when it intervened in the market last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Singapore fell in listless trading. The  
benchmark Straits Times Index fell 13.89 points, or 0.6 percent, to 
2,109.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The NZSE-40  
Capital Index fell 25.86 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,084.94. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, boosted by  
bargain-hunting. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index 
rose 20.79 points, or 1 percent, to 2,126.54. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed lower, dragged down  
by weak resource-related stock prices. The All Ordinaries Index 
fell 8.5 points, or 3 percent, to 2,898.8. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed higher following a late  
rally. The Composite Index rose 3.931 points, or 0.7 percent, to 
547.264. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower following the release on  
Monday of lower-than-expected second-quarter gross domestic product 
data. The Stock Exchange of Thailand, or SET, index fell 8.67 
points, or 1.99 percent, to 425.54.

<HEADLINE> UC Davis Player's Leg Amputated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIS, Calif. (AP) -- A running back for UC Davis had to have his  
lower right leg amputated 10 days after he dislocated his knee in a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Paneno played one of the best games of his college career  
before hurting his knee in overtime in UC Davis' victory Sept. 11 
against Western Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	The dislocation cut off the blood flow to his lower leg and  
foot. Despite surgery to repair the injury the lack of blood and 
oxygen caused irreversible damage, team physician Dr. David Cosca 
said. The 22-year-old Paneno had the surgery Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Paneno, a sophomore, transferred to the Division II school from  
Hawaii last season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the game against Western Oregon, Paneno's first start this  
season, he rushed for 114 yards on 26 carries and scored two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Biggs said it was the worst injury he'd seen in more  
than 20 years at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about college football being such a great game --  
about people being fortunate to play this game -- and then something 
like this happens,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Abilities Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin cannot perform his duties  
because of health problems and should consider stepping down before 
his term expires next year, Moscow's mayor said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Yuri Luzhkov used to be allied with Yeltsin, but the two  
have become openly antagonistic over the past year. Luzhkov spoke 
in Vienna, Austria, where he was meeting with businessmen and 
politicians, and his remarks were reported by the Interfax news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin ``cannot effectively fulfill his duties, primarily due  
to the state of his health,'' Luzhkov was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian media have speculated that Yeltsin may resign, but  
the president has insisted that he will serve until his term ends 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Luzhkov said he had no presidential ambitions and would try to  
convince his ally, former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, to run 
for the job. Luzhkov and Primakov recently formed a political 
alliance, and both are considered strong potential candidates in 
Russia's presidential election. However, neither has declared his 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many political analysts believe that one -- but not both -- will  
enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very close to (Primakov) and am sure that I will be able  
to persuade him,'' Luzhkov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Luzhkov said he was happy serving as Moscow's mayor. He remains  
extremely popular in the Russian capital and is expected to easily 
win re-election in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like my job and my greatest ambition is to win the people's  
respect, which is possible in any post,'' Luzhkov was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Luzhkov added that he might join the presidential race  
if he sees no worthy candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin is barred from running for a third term. Other leading  
presidential candidates include Communist Party leader Gennady 
Zyuganov, Siberian governor Alexander Lebed and liberal politician 
Grigory Yavlinsky.

<HEADLINE> Court Disallows Compaq Tax Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An $888 million stock transaction executed in  
an hour in 1992 by Compaq Computer Corp. was put together solely to 
avoid U.S. income taxes, the U.S. Tax Court ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Tax Court said a $3.4 million tax credit  
claimed by Compaq will be disallowed, and the Houston-based 
computer maker will be assessed an unspecified accuracy-related 
penalty because of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by Chief Judge Mary Ann Cohen, which upheld the  
Internal Revenue Service's position, concluded that the complex 
arrangement to buy 10 million shares of Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. 
stock was ``motivated by the expected tax benefits, ... and no 
other business purpose existed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tax law generally prohibits transactions with no economic  
purpose other than the avoidance of taxes. The Clinton 
administration has been trying to crack down on corporate tax 
shelters, and Tuesday's ruling follows two recent Tax Court 
decisions involving The Limited retail company and United Parcel 
Service that invalidated tax-avoidance schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Compaq case, the Tax Court concluded that the company  
arranged for the purchase and immediate resale of the Royal Dutch 
shares in 23 transactions back-to-back on Sept. 16, 1992, to 
``capture'' a foreign tax credit and help offset the tax sting of a 
capital gain caused by a previous stock transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, Cohen said in her ruling, ``had no reasonable  
possibility of a profit ... without the anticipated federal tax 
consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq spokesman Alan Hodel said the company was disappointed in  
the ruling and was considering an appeal. He said the court ruled 
in Compaq's favor in July on another aspect of the three-part case, 
on the transfer of pricing, and that Tuesday's ruling ``involved a 
relatively small issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision says that Compaq will be forced to pay an  
accuracy-related negligence penalty equal to 20 percent of the 
underpayment of tax, but the amount was not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Swells in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' appetite for foreign cars,  
machinery and consumer goods propelled the trade deficit in July to 
a monthly record of $25.2 billion -- a sore spot in an otherwise 
vibrant U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deficit surpassed the June imbalance of $24.6 billion,  
as imports hit an all-time high and the country's deficit with 
Japan, China and Western Europe all set records, the Commerce 
Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing deficit and other bad news, including the dollar's  
weakness against the Japanese yen, upset investors. The Dow Jones 
average of blue-chip stocks was down about 200 points in afternoon 
trading. Interest rates on the inflation-sensitive 30-year Treasury 
bonds rose to 6.10 percent from 6.07 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors wondered whether a weaker dollar, by pushing up the  
price of imports, would make the Federal Reserve raise interest 
rates again to combat inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the deficit is running at an annual rate of  
$247 billion, far above last year's record deficit of $164.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. consumers, buoyed by the lowest unemployment level in three  
decades and enjoying the longest economic expansion in peacetime 
history, have been snapping up foreign products. In July, imports 
surged by 1 percent to an all-time high of $104.2 billion as U.S. 
demand for foreign autos, capital goods and consumer goods all set 
monthly records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vociferous demand for imports persists, reflecting a U.S.  
economy that is very strong,'' said Lynn Reaser, an economist with 
Bank of America Private Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But foreign demand for U.S. products, while showing signs of  
picking up, continues to lag behind imports. Exports of U.S. goods 
and services rose 0.5 percent in July to $79 billion, their highest 
level since last November. American manufacturers and farmers are 
slowly recovering from the Asian financial crisis, which dampened 
demand for their products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the world's greatest buyer of goods and services  
globally right now and that's not going to change for the rest of 
the year,'' said Tim O'Neill, chief economist for the Bank of 
Montreal and Harris Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economy could face problems if the trade trends  
continue, economist said, possibly leading to a sharp drop in the 
dollar's value, driving down American stock and bond prices as 
foreign investors dump their dollar-denominated holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deficit has created political headaches for the  
Clinton administration and Congress, with pressure growing for new 
trade barriers to help domestic industries such as steel combat a 
flood of cheaper-priced imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The politically sensitive deficits with Japan climbed 8 percent  
in July to a record high of $6.8 billion, while the gap with China 
rose an even larger 11.4 percent to a record $6.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton met last week with Chinese President Jiang  
Zemin as both countries agreed to restart negotiations over China's 
entry into the World Trade Organization. The United States says 
China must remove high barriers to sales of American manufactured 
goods in China as a condition of entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Commerce Secretary William Daley expressed optimism that  
a U.S.-China agreement on WTO entry could be worked out before a 
December trade meeting in Seattle. It's ``absolutely doable,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit with Western Europe also set a record high, soaring  
by 38.2 percent in July to $6.8 billion. America also set a record 
deficit with its largest trading partner, Canada, of $3.3 billion, 
a 27.9 percent increase over the June level. 
</P>
<P>
	America's foreign oil bill rose 6 percent to $5.8 billion in  
July as the volume of shipments fell but the price skyrocketed to 
$16.01 per barrel of crude oil, the highest level since December 
1997. Crude oil had been selling at $14.52 a barrel in June and 
began the year at $9.19 a barrel as a glut of oil on world markets 
pushed down the price. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.5 percent rise in U.S. exports reflected a 4 percent jump  
in exports of U.S. capital goods, led by semiconductors and medical 
equipment, pushing this category up to $25.9 billion, the highest 
level since last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports of consumer goods, including household goods, medicine  
and records and tapes, also posted an increase of 2.7 percent, to 
$6.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But farm sales fell by 1.9 percent to $3.8 billion with  
shipments of wheat, corn, soybeans, fruit and vegetables all 
falling. Exports of U.S.-made autos also fell in July, dropping 6 
percent to $6.1 billion.

<HEADLINE> Minister Beaten, Burned to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- A real estate lawyer for three  
decades, William B. Petty Jr. yearned to follow his higher calling. 
Three years ago, he left the legal world for the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty proudly became an ordained pastor in June 1998 and was  
assigned to five small, struggling congregations in the Meigs 
County area north of Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old minister was still wearing his class ring from  
Emory University's Candler School of Theology when his body was 
found Saturday. He had been beaten to death with a chunk of wood 
and his body set afire. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty had been so badly burned that authorities needed his ring  
to help make the identification. His car was found Monday in 
Andrews, N.C., about 30 miles from the remote area where his 
smoldering remains were found. 
</P>
<P>
	No motive for the crime has been determined.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of anyone who knew my uncle who would want to do  
him harm,'' said Petty's niece, Rose Taylor Womac. ``He was one of 
the kindest men who had ever lived. This had to have been someone 
who didn't know him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of the University of Tennessee-Knoxville School of  
Law, Petty opened a Chattanooga office and ran a real estate title 
practice. But he yearned for a different profession, Womac said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout his practice of law he still had this vision of  
being a minister and being involved in church,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney John Cavett, Petty's former partner, was just a few  
months out of law school when Petty took a chance and invited him 
to join his practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the kind of guy who, if you were moving, he would want  
to show up and help you move,'' Cavett said. ``He was just such a 
good and compassionate man that it did not surprise me that he 
decided to go into the ministry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Petty decided to pursue his dream of joining the  
clergy, enrolling at Emory and earning his master's degree. On a 
profile he submitted to the school, he explained his decision: 
</P>
<P>
	``I love preaching. I love being with the people,'' he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	Petty became an ordained pastor in June 1998 and was responsible  
for five small, struggling congregations in the Meigs County area 
north of Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so loving and caring. He was always trying to help  
people,'' said the Rev. Mary Virginia Taylor, who oversees the 
district where Petty preached. ``He might have picked somebody up 
out there to work. He might have come across somebody. He was not 
afraid of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About three months ago, Petty purchased the property where he  
and his wife, an avid hiker and outdoorswoman, planned to build a 
home for their retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The site sits at the foot of Star Mountain, about 60 miles  
northeast of Chattanooga. ``It was a kind of utopia for him and my 
aunt as well,'' Womac said. ``They were trying to keep it as 
undisturbed as possible.''

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Churns Closer to Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- An unsettled Tropical Storm Harvey bore  
down on southern Florida today with 50 mph winds and heavy rain, 
prompting school closures and an emergency declaration from the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Five to 10 inches of rain were expected from the storm forecast  
to come ashore near Naples, 150 miles south of Clearwater, by 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey weakened slightly and turned to the southeast early today  
as tropical storm warnings were posted for southern Florida, 
including the Keys island chain. Earlier predictions had the storm 
making landfall near Tampa, on Florida's western coast. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m., Harvey was centered about 100 miles southwest of Fort  
Myers and moving to the southeast at 10 mph. Tropical storm force 
winds of at least 39 mph extended out some 115 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm was expected to cross Florida and stay offshore as it  
heads north along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The center is not really well defined. It's just kind of a  
raggedy system,'' said Stephen Baig, oceanographer at the National 
Hurricane Center in Miami. ``Essentially, the southern peninsula of 
Florida is going to get lots of rain and gusts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday declared a state of emergency for 56 of  
67 counties in anticipation of the storm. Harvey could produce 
storm surge flooding of up to 6 feet above normal in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	But most voluntary evacuations called for in the Tampa area --  
advising people living in mobile homes, recreational vehicles, 
coastal and low-lying areas to move -- were lifted today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been pretty quiet up here,'' said John Brill, spokesman  
for the Hillsborough County Emergency Management Center. ``It 
turned toward the south and we haven't had a whole lot of action up 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bermuda's government issued a hurricane warning  
Monday as Gert moved within 170 miles of the island with top winds 
of 110 mph.

<HEADLINE> SEC Studies Mutual Fund Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Competition among the thousands of mutual funds  
available to investors has led some fund managers to use less than 
scrupulous methods to gain attention. 
</P>
<P>
	One tried and true practice -- that of inflating a new fund's  
performance record by salting it with hot initial public offering 
stocks -- has recently come under fire from the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an old game that mutual fund companies have been playing  
for years,'' said Jim Melcher, president of Balestra Capital 
Management, a New York money management firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the SEC fined Van Kampen Funds $100,000 for  
failing to tell investors that the extraordinary first-year 
performance of Van Kampen's Growth Fund was due primarily to Van 
Kampen's liberal allocation of hot IPO stocks into the fund. A 
former Van Kampen employee, Alan Sachtleben, who served as the 
chief adviser to the fund, was also fined $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Kampen and Sachtleben agreed to settle the case, the first  
of its kind brought by the SEC against a mutual fund family, 
without admitting wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has said it will continue to crack down on fund  
companies that mislead investors as to how a fund generated 
significant profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In another method for ``juicing performance,'' managers actively  
trade shares within a given fund as they try to take advantage of 
short-term movements in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Both methods are used to puff up the gains of small, startup  
funds, known in the business as incubator funds, which companies 
create to generate a performance track record that is later used to 
market the fund to a wide array of investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The methods themselves are legal, experts note. But the returns  
they generate tend to be temporary and thus misleading to 
unsuspecting investors 
</P>
<P>
	David Masters, a senior analyst at Standard &AMP; Poors in New York,  
said the fine levied against Van Kampen sends a message to the 
industry that potential investors need to know whether a fund's 
advertised returns were achieved while the fund was incubating or 
after it was opened to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors who are drawn to a new fund by claims of huge early  
returns should be extremely wary, fund experts say, because it's 
highly unlikely the fund can achieve similar returns over the 
long-term. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case against Van Kampen, the Oakbrook, Ill.,-based  
company was accused of seeding its new Growth Fund with IPO shares 
while the fund held less than $380,000, tiny by mutual fund 
standards. Because the fund was so small, its overall performance 
was easily affected by the performance of a small handful of 
high-flying stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	When Van Kampen marketed its Growth Fund to the public, the  
company claimed the fund grew 62 percent in 1996, its first year. 
But the company failed to mention that the gains were achieved by 
using highly volatile IPO shares, according to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on marketing that touted the 62 percent gain, the fund's  
assets quickly grew to $110 million after it was opened for wide 
public investing in early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Melcher said large mutual fund companies frequently get shares  
of hot IPOs from the investment banks that underwrite new offerings 
because the fund companies are big customers of the banks' trading 
arms. ``It's a gift,'' he said. ``It's a guaranteed profit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fund managers can either spread the IPO shares across several  
funds, or place most of the shares into one small fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Unscrupulous managers tend to choose the latter, Melcher  
explained, because small funds are more susceptible to IPO 
increases, a dynamic that essentially guarantees that the fund will 
far outpace most indexes used to gauge mutual fund performance. 
</P>
<P>
	And mutual funds are all about performance, Melcher added.  
``Overwhelmingly, people who buy mutual funds look at their 
performance records. What else do they have?'' he said.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- When police on motorcycles clear a path  
for your limousine, you don't have the traffic worries that most

<HEADLINE> Dean Taylor Hired As Brewers' GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Dean Taylor says he has plans to create the  
same winning dynasty in Milwaukee that was started nine years ago 
in Atlanta when he became the assistant to Braves GM John 
Schuerholz. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was hired as Brewers GM on Tuesday, succeeding Sal Bando,  
who was reassigned last month following the firing of manager Phil 
Garner. 
</P>
<P>
	Reshaping the Brewers into a winning team is something that drew  
Taylor to the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a year to get this organization moving to  
wherever we want it to be,'' said Taylor, who signed a four-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's first duties include hiring a manager, which he hopes  
to do during the playoffs. He said major league experience isn't 
the only factor in his choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for someone who has the ability to motivate and  
create a winning atmosphere,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Taylor, who is white, followed a directive by  
baseball commissioner and former Brewers owner Bud Selig to 
baseball owners to consider minorities for high-ranking team 
positions. He required teams to submit a list of candidates for 
such jobs to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Former NL Manager of the Year Don Baylor, now the hitting coach  
for Atlanta after being fired by the Colorado Rockies last season, 
is among the names mentioned as a candidate for the Brewers' 
managerial position. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who is black, was the hitting coach in Milwaukee from  
1990-91 and was considered for the managerial job with the Brewers 
when Garner was hired. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said the stability of the Brewers' ownership and the  
targeted opening of the Brewers' new stadium in 2001 were among the 
reasons he was interested in the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently staggering toward their seventh straight losing  
record, the Brewers are in fifth place in the NL Central and have 
not been in the playoffs since 1982. Taylor comes from a team that 
has won seven straight division titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dean Taylor is someone who will leave no stone unturned in  
strengthening this organization,'' said team president Wendy 
Selig-Prieb, the commissioner's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers need to take a new direction in their player  
development, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be creative and resourceful,'' he said. ``Small  
clubs have a smaller margin of error when it comes to player 
development. The key is to make proper evaluations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's 24-year baseball career includes being an assistant to  
Schuerholz at Kansas City. Taylor also was manager of baseball 
operations for the commissioner's office in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll do a wonderful job for the Brewers,'' Schuerholz  
told WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. ``The Brewers organization has done 
themselves well. He's the most deserving and capable guy in 
baseball today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz has worked with Taylor for about 18 years.  
</P>
<P>
	Taylor also stressed developing the team's farm system, bringing  
up younger players to the professional level and negotiating 
prudent contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most important thing is making players, officials and  
team employees believe in the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they come through the door every day to work for the  
Milwaukee Brewers, they need to walk through the door with the 
expectation that they will win,'' he said. ``The biggest hurdle is 
creating that winning mindset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers also interviewed Indians assistant general manager  
Dan O'Dowd, who was hired Monday as general manager of the Colorado 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Others interviewed were Toronto Blue Jays assistant GM Dave  
Stewart, New York Mets assistant GM and international scouting 
director Omar Minaya and Chicago White Sox assistant GM Dan Evans.

<HEADLINE> More Jail Terms for Caged Girl's Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHILTON, Wis. (AP) -- A woman jailed for child abuse that  
included putting her daughter in a dog cage received more prison 
terms, though no more actual time to serve. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Steven W. Winke ordered Monday that Angeline  
Rogers serve three 10-year terms on top of her current 10 years but 
that the time be concurrent, despite her escape while on work 
release earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Ken Kratz criticized the decision, noting that  
Rogers could have been given another 30 years in prison if Winke 
had ordered the terms to be served consecutively. 
</P>
<P>
	``She got nothing today. Not one additional day,'' Kratz said.  
``It is not even a slap on the wrist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rogers and her husband, Michael, were each sentenced last  
September to a year in jail on one of four counts of child abuse. 
At the time, Winke stayed their 10-year sentences and sentencing on 
three other counts of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Rogers disappeared March 30 with a former cellmate and  
received an additional 10 years after she was found April 9 in San 
Antonio, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	She could receive more time Wednesday, when she is sentenced for  
the escape. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple was convicted of abusing four of their five children,  
including locking their 7-year-old daughter in a dog cage in 1997 
because of behavior and psychological problems, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Mrs. Rogers wasn't a threat to the public and was  
``self-destructive,'' Kratz said. Michael Rogers is scheduled for 
release this month.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Won't Interrupt Oil Deliveries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela, the world's third largest  
oil exporter and one of the main suppliers of oil to the United 
States, insists supplies won't be interrupted by the Year 2000 
computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials say isolated problems with some sectors such as  
electricity are likely to crop up, and some fear that could spill 
over to the South American nation's massive oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the U.S. State Department said it was concerned about  
the so-called Y2K problem in numerous countries including 
Venezuela, which provides about 17 percent of U.S. oil imports and 
competes with Saudi Arabia and Mexico as the No. 1 exporter of oil 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug stems from computers that will not function properly  
starting New Year's Day because they won't be able to distinguish 
2000 from 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustavo Mendez, head of a presidential commission handling the  
Y2K problem, acknowledged Venezuela had a late start addressing the 
issue because of a change in administrations in February. But he 
said it has caught up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venezuela guarantees the permanent delivery of oil,  
absolutely,'' Mendez told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department report, he added, was probably based on  
outdated information. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez named the presidential  
commission in April, and 15 full-time experts were immediately 
assigned to a nationwide team. Previously, the team was made up of 
people who were not dedicated to the problem full-time since they 
had other duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela has also rushed in experts from the United States to  
help out. As a whole the country of 23 million people has spent 
between $600 and $800 million to fix the Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Mendez said critical systems at Venezuela's state oil monopoly,  
Petroleos de Venezuela, the world's third largest oil company, are 
100 percent surveyed, corrected and tested. That means the industry 
should have no problems come Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil industry analyst Alan Viergutz largely agreed, saying he  
expects no major disruption of supplies. However, he added that 
there could be some minor problems because of failures of outside 
companies and services that Petroleos de Venezuela depends on. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though most Venezuelan electricity companies say they are  
ready to go, some may have trouble, Mendez said. They are located 
on the popular tourist island of Margarita and in eastern Bolivar 
state, home to rain forests, Indian tribes, rich gold deposits and 
the massive Guri hydroelectric dam, which supplies 70 percent of 
Venezuela's electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Glitches may also occur in central Carabobo and Aragua states,  
the heart of the industrial belt of Latin America's fourth largest 
economy.

<HEADLINE> Brit Farmers Said barely Holding On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British farmers are ``holding onto survival by  
their fingertips'' as they weather the worst agricultural 
depression since the 1930s, according to a survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Farmers' Union audit found 64 percent of British  
farmers surveyed had recently borrowed money to stay afloat and 
that one-third had been forced to lay off staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that we need to buy is going up and everything that we  
sell is going down in price,'' said one of the 5,000 farmers who 
responded to the NFU's Audit for Action. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-quarters of the respondents said they had no confidence in  
the future of farming and 57 percent have ``seriously considered'' 
getting out of the business altogether in the past two years, the 
audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 percent said they could survive only one more year  
without improvements, and two-thirds said their children had no 
intention of taking over the farm even if things did improve. 
</P>
<P>
	NFU president Bill Gill described the industry as ``shattered to  
the core.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is no way for an important sector of the U.K. economy to  
be forced to exist at the close of the 20th century,'' Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings come one day after the British government promised  
a $245 million rescue package for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill said the aid package would relieve some of the symptoms,  
but maintained the government hadn't addressed the causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``A reduction in the overvalued pound and the stripping away of  
the overregulation and bureaucracy choking the industry would have 
a huge impact,'' he said. ``For many farmers, this will be the 
government's last chance to act.''

	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Rescuers scrambled through the night  
Tuesday to unearth thousands of people trapped under debris from 
Taiwan's second-deadliest earthquake, which killed at least 1,712 
people and injured over 4,000. Almost 3,000 people were believed to 
remain underneath rubble. More than 100,000 Taiwanese were 
homeless. The 7.6-magnitude quake toppled houses and high-rise 
apartment complexes across central Taiwan. Roads buckled, chunks of 
land rose up to create new hills and a bridge was left dangling in

was about 30 miles south of Naples, with sustained winds of about 
50 mph. The storm is expected to head out into the Atlantic and 
toward the Bahamas by the end of the day. Forecasters had predicted 
the storm would come ashore near Tampa, but it veered to the

industrial average ended down 225.43 points at 10,598.47 after 
falling as much as 272.03 during the session. The Dow's decline, 
which amounted to 2 percent, was its biggest point drop since it

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board today

buses. After a three-year study, the board concluded seat belts can 
sometimes increase injuries to children. The safety board wants 
current standards, which require that children be protected by 
padded seats and high seat backs, expanded within the next two 
years so children will have a better chance of remaining inside a 
bus during a side collision or rollover. Engineers said that could 
be accomplished in a variety of ways, including the installation of 
arm rests or replacement of the bus bench seat with sculpted, 
bucket-type seats.

rather than for the class estimated at half a million Floridians. 
Investors rejoiced then at the prospect of multimillion-dollar 
individual awards rather than a multibillion-dollar lump sum for 
the class. But in a ruling issued quietly on Friday, the court

<HEADLINE> Barak Makes Symbolic Trip to Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- In a visit rich in symbolism, Israeli Prime  
Minister Ehud Barak was welcomed in Berlin on Tuesday as the first 
foreign leader to visit the German capital since the government 
returned to the former seat of Nazi power. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit -- just weeks after Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder left  
Bonn and started work in Berlin -- was intended to demonstrate 
Germany's sensitivity to the discomfort some might feel at seeing 
the nation governed once more from Hitler's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Berlin evokes deep emotions in our consciousness,'' Barak told  
reporters at Schroeder's provisional office in central Berlin. ``It 
is not far from here that the Final Solution was devised in 1942.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak spoke about dramatic changes in the last two generations --  
changes that have led to ``close ties between a new, vibrant, 
democratic Germany and the state of Israel that arose out of the 
ashes of the Holocaust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, for his part, said Germany's place in the  
international community ``can only be preserved if the past is not 
forgotten and not distorted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the emotional highlight of the trip, Schroeder was to join  
Barak in the commemoration of Holocaust victims Wednesday at the 
former Sachsenhausen concentration camp north of Berlin. The 
leaders were to lay a wreath at the site, where the Nazis once 
cremated camp victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Traveling with Barak were several Sachsenhausen survivors who  
now live in Israel. One, 82-year-old Eli Carmel, spent a year in 
the camp. 
</P>
<P>
	His visit, he said, was like ``a circle closing -- having been a  
homeless, stateless Jew and coming back with the prime minister of 
our Jewish state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the visit should send a clear message: ``Never forget  
what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nazis held more than 200,000 people at Sachsenhausen between  
1933 and 1945. About half died, including an estimated 10,000 Jews 
and 18,000 Soviet soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	As always when the Israeli premier travels, the Middle East  
peace process was at the top of the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's visit comes just a week after Israel and the  
Palestinians launched final status peace talks. This last phase 
aims to resolve the most contentious issues: borders, the return of 
Palestinian refugees, and the status of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans have been buoyed by the resumption of talks and by  
Barak's impressive -- if somewhat hopeful -- deadlines: a framework 
for a deal by February, and a final deal by September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said he'd briefed Schroeder on the progress of the talks.  
He said he hoped, ``with the peace process gaining more momentum, 
that Germany will expand its role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much more active in the peace process than the Germans, however,  
are the French, who aim to carve out a bigger role for themselves 
as a counterweight to American influence. Barak heads to Paris 
later this week for talks with President Jacques Chirac and Prime 
Minister Lionel Jospin. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, Chirac held an unexpected meeting with Syrian  
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa. France and Syria have good 
relations, and al-Sharaa apparently wanted Chirac to assess 
Israel's willingness to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which it 
captured in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace talks between Israel and Syria have been stalled since  
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about peace with Syria, Barak said, ``It is time.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there is a golden opportunity right now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Targets Canada Drug Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The director of the Montreal-based antidoping lab  
where cocaine was discovered in the system of high jumper Javier 
Sotomayor said Cuban sports officials are trying to discredit the 
work of her lab in a bid to get the country's biggest sport hero 
off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotomayor, the world record-holder in the high jump and the only  
man to have cleared the 8-foot barrier, was stripped of a gold 
medal at the Pan American Games last month based on results of a 
urine test done at Dr. Christiane Ayotte's Olympic-approved 
National Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cuban sports officials have refused to suspend Sotomayor,  
instead attacking the credibility of the lab whose services they 
once used eagerly at bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm especially sad about this,'' Ayotte said Tuesday. ``In  
past years we helped the Cubans a lot with their testing. We 
offered to do tests for a really low cost because they had no 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a close relationship with Cuban sport authorities. It's  
a shame for us, that we're being rewarded this way after we helped 
them for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accusations of sabotage against Sotomayor have been led by  
President Fidel Castro. In a speech, he said Cuba would set out to 
create its own lab to ``safeguard our athletes' and our homeland's 
honor'' and to ``help defend our country from any traps, dirty 
tricks or underhanded stunts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's defense of Sotomayor's case is more political rhetoric  
than science, Ayotte said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they have evidence, but to now I've seen nothing,''  
Ayotte said. ``There were also three Cuban weightlifters caught 
positive for the banned substance Nandrolone in the Pan Ams. ... 
They collected urine samples from the lifters once they returned to 
the island and sent them off to an accredited European lab and the 
result came back negative. They're saying since these results from 
the lifters were negative, it casts doubt overall on the work we 
did during the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayotte said one Cuban doctor alleged the level of cocaine  
reported in Sotomayor's system was so high he would have been 
unable to jump, ``that he'd have been falling asleep. That's not 
compatible with cocaine. It's a stimulant. Nothing is supported by 
scientific evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Cuban officials witnessed the testing of a secured B  
sample of Sotomayor's urine to confirm the cocaine finding. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they don't trust the result of the lab and, frankly,  
I don't know what to answer,'' Ayotte said. ``I believe the consul 
general of Cuba was present and two Cuban medical authorities and a 
representative of the Pan American medical commission. Everyone was 
there. Everyone witnessed all the process. The chain of custody was 
checked. The sample showed no sign of tampering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said Cuban investigators have not visited the Montreal lab  
since the tests to seek any evidence or information.

<HEADLINE> Feds Set To Probe Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contending there was a ``culture of  
corruption'' surrounding Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Summer 
Olympics, a congressman said Tuesday he will hold hearings next 
month and ask the president of the International Olympic Committee 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said a report on the Atlanta bid,  
submitted to Congress last week by former Attorney General Griffin 
Bell, shows that IOC members in many cases demanded gifts and 
favors and that Atlanta bid committee officials were more than 
willing to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly votes were for sale, and it's got to stop because it  
muddies the whole name of the Olympics,'' he said. ``That's why 
we've got to get to the bottom of this and we've got to do whatever 
we can to restore the faith and confidence of everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said if IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch doesn't  
appear voluntarily at hearings held by the House commerce 
subcommittee on oversight and investigation, a subpoena is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said his panel will consider ending the IOC's exemption  
from the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as a possible way to stop 
the long-standing practice of gift-giving to IOC members to 
influence the selection of host cities for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	And he suggested the U.S. businesses that provide much of the  
financial support for the Olympics through advertising might be 
willing to pressure the IOC to clean up the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta officials welcomed the hearings. Bell, who has acted as  
attorney for Atlanta organizers, said he hopes the hearings will 
``encourage new discussion about what is good about the games and 
how to keep it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Upton's panel began looking into the Atlanta bid last summer  
following the Salt Lake City bidding scandal that resulted in two 
federal indictments and the resignations or forced expulsions of 10 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta officials submitted an initial report on their bid to  
the subcommittee in June, then agreed to revise it after questions 
were raised. Upton said he's convinced that the Bell report is 
``thorough and final.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report revealed that the gifts and perks the Atlanta  
committee lavished on IOC members and their families included 
offers of college scholarships and jobs; medical care; a bus; 
training for athletes from other countries; golf clubs; pewter 
dishes; meals; and first-class airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said the Atlanta officials also violated U.S. laws on  
several occasions, by providing a firearm to a foreign national and 
by bringing more than $10,000 in cash into the country. But he said 
the statute of limitations has expired on those violations. 
</P>
<P>
	While agreeing with Bell's assessment that Atlanta was operating  
within an IOC bidding culture that condoned such practices, Upton 
said Atlanta officials should have ``blown the whistle'' on it, 
rather than join it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't have to give some of these sweet gifts, which  
under any normal layman's definition one would view as bad,'' he 
said. ``Would they have gotten the games if they hadn't done so? I 
don't know. Maybe that's something we'll ask Samaranch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members have criticized the Bell report for suggesting  
that Atlanta was drawn into a corrupt climate that already existed. 
Italian IOC member Mario Pescante, who led Rome's losing campaign 
for the 2004 Games, accused the Americans of ducking 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't the Americans take the responsibility for the people  
who organized this strategy of bribery and corruption? Who started 
this? They did,'' Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said Congress and the IOC should ensure that in future  
bids, ``cities will be chosen based on the merits of the games they 
can provide and not on the quality of the gifts that instead are 
offered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee, meanwhile, said it plans no further  
investigation of Atlanta's bid. The USOC forwarded a copy of Bell's 
revised report to the IOC last week and said in a cover letter that 
no further USOC action is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've learned all the lessons to be learned in this,'' said  
Scott Blackmon, deputy executive director and lead counsel of the 
USOC. ``Based on what we've seen in the report, it looks like more 
of the same culture. There's nothing different between what 
happened in Atlanta and Salt Lake City.''

<HEADLINE> Dili Residents Return From Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- With East Timor's capital secured by an  
international peacekeeping force, Dili residents returned from 
makeshift refugee camps Tuesday to find a looted, burned city. 
</P>
<P>
	There was almost no water and no electricity. All the windows  
were smashed, most buildings had been burned down and the only 
signs of life were the throngs of homeless at the city's dockside. 
Even the hunched vendors who used to sell soft drinks from rickety 
carts outside the port were gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indonesia will have to pay reparations for the loss of our  
hometown,'' said 34-year-old Filomena Bianco. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, the feisty East Timorese  
independence leader, said he never expected his foes were prepared 
to destroy East Timor before finally abandoning it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't suspect the violence would take such dimensions,''  
he said Tuesday while visiting refugees evacuated to the northern 
Australian town of Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanks, trucks and armored personnel carriers rumbled off  
warships Tuesday in East Timor, and troops from 10 countries poured 
in for the second day without resistance from pro-Indonesia 
militias. About 3,000 multinational troops will be on the ground by 
Wednesday, nearly half the total contingent of 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	But force commander Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove cautioned that the  
rest of East Timor will not be under full control for some weeks 
and will remain dangerous until then, particularly with villages 
still burning. He said his troops were to begin moving outside the 
capital on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is too early for us to assert that the security situation  
overall is anything approaching benign,'' Cosgrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	The multinational force is attempting to restore order to a  
province where militias -- aided by some elements in the Indonesian 
army -- engaged in a campaign of arson, terror and murder, driving 
tens of thousands of people from their homes. Human rights workers 
and refugees say hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The militias had hoped to nullify an Aug. 30 vote, in which  
nearly 80 percent of the East Timorese people opted for 
independence from Indonesia. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 
after Portugal abandoned its former colony. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers' task of securing the entire province is  
daunting in a jungle climate filled with rugged hills and 
mountains. In many villages, troops may have to conduct 
house-by-house searches to flush out the militias. Soldiers already 
have detained half a dozen people found with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Other militia members are scattering, going to nearby islands.  
There even have been reports that the militias have been 
intimidating pro-independence refugees on the island of Bali, where 
idyllic resorts lure vacationers from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, people in Dili cheered and danced for the foreign  
troops. In Dare, six miles south of the capital and the site of a 
large refugee camp, people burst into tears of joy as international 
soldiers in full battle gear and a group of U.N. officials drove up 
in a convoy of U.N. vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Some refugees who returned to Dili on Tuesday tried camping out  
in the rubble of their former homes. But escape was the only goal 
of the homeless at the dockside. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 190,000 and 300,000 people fled into the mountains and  
other areas during the violence, in addition to 141,000 who fled to 
Indonesian-controlled West Timor, according to a UNICEF report. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations and aid agencies are clamoring to bring food  
to people in the hills, but have been hampered by Indonesia's 
bureaucratic red tape and a lack of transport planes. Relief 
workers hoped to start air-dropping food again on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dili was the area most affected by the militias' rampage. But  
the devastation shows the challenges ahead in rebuilding much of 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank and International Monetary Fund have shown  
interest in lending to an independent East Timor, though no one is 
talking about specific figures. Gusmao is sending a delegation to 
the World Bank in Washington at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Only then will the East Timorese know the long-term costs of  
breaking from Indonesia, which has poured hundreds millions of 
dollars into the province since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, President B.J. Habibie  
urged lawmakers Tuesday to accept East Timorese independence as a 
way of restoring Indonesia's battered image. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest legislative body still must approve the  
independence vote in a session expected by November. Opponents have 
said the presence of peacekeepers violates national sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have done the best I could,'' Habibie said. ``I have been  
able to prevent Balkanization,'' he added, referring to fears that 
Indonesia could follow Yugoslavia on the path to violent 
disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, unidentified gunmen shot out the windows on two  
offices of the Australian Embassy on Monday in apparent retaliation 
for that country's role in the East Timor peacekeeping force, 
police said. There were no injuries.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Coach: Offense Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- After seven weeks of coaching and cramming,  
teaching and learning, practicing and practicing some more, the 
Pittsburgh Steelers finally seem comfortable with Kevin Gilbride's 
new offense. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, coach Bill Cowher said Tuesday, the offensive  
coordinator seems to be getting comfortable with his new players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin is getting a sense of the players, what to do best with  
Kordell Stewart, our receivers, the running game,'' Cowher said. 
``It's not just players getting comfortable with the system, it's 
also Kevin with the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Cowher is entirely satisfied, even with a 2-0 start on  
the road that has kept the Steelers on pace with AFC Central 
favorite Jacksonville. The Steelers play their home opener Sunday 
against Seattle (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're adapting, no question. We're getting more  
comfortable, no doubt about it,'' Cowher said. ``Obviously, the 
consistency level we're performing at, we need to get better. I 
like where we're going with it. We just need more consistency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher liked how the Steelers moved the ball at the beginning  
and end of Sunday's 23-20 victory in Baltimore. But the offense 
bogged down in the third quarter and, while not turning over the 
ball, totaled a relatively low 270 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	There is another nagging concern: injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	Running back Jerome Bettis, held to 46 yards by Baltimore, has a  
hamstring injury only a week after recovering from knee and calf 
problems. Bettis, who said Monday he was extremely sore after 
Sunday's game, is listed as questionable. He won't practice 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Left guard Alan Faneca (ankle, probable) and right tackle Chris  
Conrad (knee, questionable) also left Sunday's game with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The offense has made some mistakes as it adjusts to Gilbride's  
schemes, which require the quarterback, receivers and blockers to 
read formations identically. The receivers adjust their pass routes 
to the coverage, and the quarterback must make the same reads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to take the players you have, put them in a  
position where they can make plays, but at the same time not 
deviate too much from a philosophy,'' Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers also are constantly switching their third-down  
alignments. Tight end Mark Bruener sometimes comes out of the game, 
sometimes stays in. At times, there are five receivers; other 
times, there are four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're spreading people out, doing things differently, and  
we're not as predictable, I think, as we've been,'' Cowher said. 
``Maybe we kept doing the same things over and over again; now, 
we're doing some things that maybe create indecision with the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some creativity taking place that, hopefully, is  
making the defense wonder what we're doing next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, for the first time in his career, Stewart can check off  
plays at the line of scrimmage. Stewart changed about 15 plays in 
Cleveland and about six on Sunday, according to Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're changing things at the line, getting us out of bad  
plays, getting us into good plays,'' Cowher said. ``Some we didn't 
execute, but I still like the decision-making that took place.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Won't Interrupt Oil Deliveries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela, the world's third largest  
oil exporter and one of the main suppliers of oil to the United 
States, insists supplies won't be interrupted by the Year 2000 
computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials say isolated problems with some sectors such as  
electricity are likely to crop up, and some fear that could spill 
over to the South American nation's massive oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the U.S. State Department said it was concerned about  
the so-called Y2K problem in numerous countries including 
Venezuela, which provides about 17 percent of U.S. oil imports and 
competes with Saudi Arabia and Mexico as the No. 1 exporter of oil 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug stems from computers that will not function properly  
starting New Year's Day because they won't be able to distinguish 
2000 from 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustavo Mendez, head of a presidential commission handling the  
Y2K problem, acknowledged Venezuela had a late start addressing the 
issue because of a change in administrations in February. But he 
said it has caught up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venezuela guarantees the permanent delivery of oil,  
absolutely,'' Mendez told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department report, he added, was probably based on  
outdated information. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez named the presidential  
commission in April, and 15 full-time experts were immediately 
assigned to a nationwide team. Previously, the team was made up of 
people who were not dedicated to the problem full-time since they 
had other duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela has also rushed in experts from the United States to  
help out. As a whole the country of 23 million people has spent 
between $600 and $800 million to fix the Y2K problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Mendez said critical systems at Venezuela's state oil monopoly,  
Petroleos de Venezuela, the world's third largest oil company, are 
100 percent surveyed, corrected and tested. That means the industry 
should have no problems come Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil industry analyst Alan Viergutz largely agreed, saying he  
expects no major disruption of supplies. However, he added that 
there could be some minor problems because of failures of outside 
companies and services that Petroleos de Venezuela depends on. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though most Venezuelan electricity companies say they are  
ready to go, some may have trouble, Mendez said. They are located 
on the popular tourist island of Margarita and in eastern Bolivar 
state, home to rain forests, Indian tribes, rich gold deposits and 
the massive Guri hydroelectric dam, which supplies 70 percent of 
Venezuela's electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Glitches may also occur in central Carabobo and Aragua states,  
the heart of the industrial belt of Latin America's fourth largest 
economy.

<HEADLINE> Maine Potato Farmers Begin Harvest / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The 1990s have been bleak for Maine's potato farmers. Neighbors  
watched nervously as the potato prices plummeted because of a 
nationwide glut. Banks began auctioning off generations-old farms. 
</P>
<P>
	But now there's hope.  
</P>
<P>
	Farmers and their helpers poured into the fields this week to  
begin harvesting a crop described as ``tremendous.'' Also, the 
state's total acreage for potatoes climbed instead of decreasing 
for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real optimism here,'' said Don Flannery, associate  
executive director of the Maine Potato Board. ``That being said, we 
are realists, too. We know our competition in Canada and 
nationwide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in northern Maine managed to avoid the effects of the  
East Coast drought this summer. They are banking on a bumper year 
after near-perfect weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maine has been very fortunate in Aroostook County in that  
they've had timely showers and it's made for an excellent crop,'' 
said Maine Agriculture Commissioner Bob Spear. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in land devoted to potatoes from 65,000 acres last  
year to 68,000 acres this year was partly because of demand from 
McCain Foods USA, the world's largest french fry producer, Flannery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, based in Oakbrook, Ill., is completing a $70 million  
expansion of its french fry processing plant in Easton this fall. 
It has four other processing plants in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Yaeger, sales manager at H. Smith Packing in Blaine,  
called McCain's expansion a ``vote of confidence in the Maine 
potato grower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it is more than a just morale boost.  
</P>
<P>
	Because of the reliability in the french fry and potato chip  
market, more and more farmers are shifting their crops from the 
types of potatoes sold in grocery stores to potatoes that are more 
suited to processing. 
</P>
<P>
	Processing potatoes are considered to be less susceptible to  
market conditions than ``tablestock'' because farmers enter into 
contracts with processors like McCain, Frito Lay and Humpty Dumpty 
Potato Chip Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 54 percent of the crop was dedicated to french fries  
and potato chips, 19 percent went to tablestock and the remaining 
27 percent was harvested for seed, according to the Maine Potato 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	That's good news for Aroostook County and a state where potatoes  
are the No. 1 agricultural commodity, with annual sales of nearly 
$105 million. Maine ranked eighth in the nation in potato 
production last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all farmers are confident, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark Nightingale, whose grandfather started his farm in New  
Limerick, says it's a slow road to economic recovery in Aroostook 
County and not everyone is out of the red. 
</P>
<P>
	``People here are still struggling and there isn't much help,''  
said Nightingale, who reduced his potato crop to 380 acres this 
year and increased his wheat production, planting 400 acres of 
grain. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged that because of the weather in northern Maine  
this summer, this crop should be particularly good in terms of 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had just enough water and we've had an unusually warm  
year,'' said Jim Cook, director of Crown of Maine Organic 
Cooperative, in Madawaska.

<HEADLINE> GOP Proposes Abortion Alternatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government would spend $85 million  
a year to help pay for facilities that provide alternatives to 
abortion -- maternity homes, adoption services and crisis pregnancy 
centers -- under legislation proposed Tuesday by two conservative 
members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Joseph Pitts and Sen. Rick Santorum, both Pennsylvania  
Republicans, said the grants would not be available to family 
planning centers or other agencies that refer women to abortion 
providers, provide abortion counseling or perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The centers would use the money to help women dealing with an  
unplanned pregnancy, including pregnancy testing, adoption 
information, prenatal and postpartum health care, diapers, baby 
food and clothes, abstinence counseling and referrals for other 
services -- help with problems with mental health, food, clothing, 
housing, education and job training. 
</P>
<P>
	Poorer women would be given first priority. Federal money would  
be allocated to each state based on the number of abortions and 
out-of-wedlock births there. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitts and Santorum said the legislation is needed to provide  
alternatives to government family planning programs that seem to 
focus on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``No women should ever feel that abortion is her only option,''  
Santorum said. ``Not everyone who walks into a family planning 
clinic wants to have an abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Abortion Federation immediately attacked the bill,  
saying it ``poses a significant public health danger because it 
would support organizations that withhold information about safe, 
legal options to unintended pregnancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Group Executive Director Vicki Saporta said abortion providers  
are skilled medical professionals who discuss abortion alternatives 
with their patients. ``Under this bill someone with a political or 
religious agenda who erroneously informs a woman that she has only 
one option would receive funding, while a skilled health care 
professional who informs her of all her options would not.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 119.05 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Concerns about third-quarter earnings and the  
weakening dollar sent stocks sharply lower in early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 119.05 at 10,704.85. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also down, with the Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index off 13.46 at 1,322.03, and the Nasdaq composite 
falling 24.82 to 2,861.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer's announcement late Monday that its third-quarter  
earnings would be hurt by a shortage of chips shook Wall Street, 
which had been quite optimistic in general about corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's continuing slide against the Japanese yen also took  
a toll on stocks. The U.S. currency was quoted at about 104 yen 
today, down from 106 yen. A weaker dollar can be inflationary, and 
in turn lead to higher interest rates in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advacncers by an 8-to-3 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 97.94 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was off 3.78 at 429.42.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.03 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.64 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.04 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 1.45 percent.

<HEADLINE> DeLorean Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Former automaker John Z. DeLorean was able  
to prevent the U.S. marshal's auction of his sprawling Bedminster 
estate by filing for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLorean, known for the stainless steel, gull-wing sports cars  
that bore his name, issued a statement that his Chapter 11 
reorganization filing would allow him to develop his 434-acre 
Lamington Farm into two 18-hole golf courses and an equestrian 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	He could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	One of his chief creditors, his onetime lawyer Mayer Morganroth,  
told The Star-Ledger of Newark on Tuesday that the filing was an 
``inappropriate'' ploy to buy time and would be challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left for Morganroth at his Michigan office was not  
immediately returned. He is trying to enforce a $7.5 million 
judgment against DeLorean for unpaid legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLorean, 74, also owes about $11 million to Merrill Lynch  
Credit Corp.

<HEADLINE> World-Herald Buying Newspaper Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- The Omaha World-Herald Co. announced Tuesday  
it is buying Partnership Press Inc., a newspaper company co-founded 
by former NBC News President Michael Gartner. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase is expected to close Sept. 30. Terms were not  
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition includes The Tribune, a Pulitzer Prize-winning  
newspaper in Ames, Iowa, that has a circulation of 10,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Partnership Press also owns several weekly papers in central  
Iowa, including The Algona Upper Des Moines, Nevada Journal, Boone 
Today, Dallas County News and Tri-County Times. Its other holdings 
include shopping guides and direct mail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gartner, chairman of Partnership Press, won the 1997 Pulitzer  
Prize for editorial writing at The Tribune. He is a former editor 
of The Des Moines Register. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded Partnership Press in 1986 with Gary Gerlach and David  
Belin, a Des Moines lawyer who died in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning Gary and I emphasized good journalism,''  
Gartner said. ``World-Herald executives are committed to good 
journalism, and they are particularly devoted to the Midwest as a 
region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Gottschalk, chairman and president of the employee-owned  
Omaha World-Herald Co., said central Iowa is ``a wonderful 
marketplace with a good mix of higher education, agriculture, 
manufacturing, technology businesses and government institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gottschalk said he did not expect many changes at The Tribune or  
the other publications, calling them ``solid operations'' that 
should continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Omaha World-Herald Co. owns the World-Herald, which has a  
daily circulation of 220,000, and three other dailies: The Record 
in Stockton, Calif., the Kearney (Neb.) Hub and the Carlsbad (N.M.) 
Current-Argus. The company also owns four weeklies in Nebraska: the 
Papillion Times, the Ralston Recorder, the Bellevue Leader and the 
Air Pulse, which serves Offutt Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also owns direct marketing operations in Dallas,  
Chicago, Atlanta and Omaha and two exposition management companies, 
and has interests in election services, investment banking and 
Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hawley was named president of Partnership Press and  
publisher of the Ames paper, replacing Gerlach. Hawley, 41, is a 
native Iowan who was publisher of the Huron (S.D.) Plainsman from 
1996 until earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus Falls in Aug. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world fell in August  
from the same month last year, the government said Wednesday. But 
the politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States 
continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported  
by Japan minus those imported, declined 22.6 percent to $6.57 
billion (689.4 billion yen), the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors, slightly exceeded  
the average forecast of $6.55 billion by Tokyo-based economists 
surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Again bucking the overall trend, however was the trade surplus  
with the United States, which jumped 24.3 percent in August to 
$5.09 billion, the ministry said. In July, the surplus rose 8.0 
percent from the same month a year earlier, while in June it was up 
18.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, fighting to emerge from its worst downturn in 50 years,  
has been under heavy pressure from the United States and other 
trading partners to rein in the surplus by bolstering its weak 
economy to spark demand for imports. 
</P>
<P>
	August marked the fifth straight month of year-on-year decline  
in the overall surplus. In July it fell 4.6 percent, which followed 
declines of 2.9 percent in June, 31.5 percent in May and 12.6 
percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In fiscal 1998, Japan's overall trade surplus rose 23 percent  
from the previous year to reach the second highest total ever 
recorded.

<HEADLINE> GOP Proposes Abortion Alternatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers say the  
federal government gives financial help to abortion-rights groups, 
so why not to groups that advocate alternatives to abortion? 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Joseph Pitts and Sen. Rick Santorum are introducing  
legislation that would set aside $85 million each year to help fund 
private groups that run maternity homes, adoption services and 
``crisis pregnancy'' centers . 
</P>
<P>
	The grants would not be available to family planning centers or  
other agencies that refer women to abortion providers, provide 
abortion counseling or perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The centers would use the money to help women dealing with an  
unplanned pregnancy, including pregnancy testing, adoption 
information, prenatal and postpartum health care, diapers, baby 
food and clothes, abstinence counseling and referrals for other 
services, such and housing, education and job training.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bengal Told To Pay Child Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Former Cincinnati Bengals running back James  
Brooks was ordered jailed by a judge on Tuesday in an attempt to 
force the retired player to pay $107,705 in child support payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, 40, arrested on Sept. 2 in Georgia and returned to  
Cincinnati, was brought into Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in 
handcuffs for an arraignment. He pleaded innocent to three counts 
of felony non-support. Judge Steven Martin then ordered Brooks 
returned to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton County prosecutors said that Brooks, whose annual  
salary was $1 million at the height of his pro football career, 
owes $78,535.55 for a 6-year-old son and $29,169.88 for a 
4-year-old daughter. He owes the money to two women who gave birth 
to three of his children, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless he pays his unpaid child support, Brooks will remain  
behind bars until his case is resolved or his sentence -- if he is 
convicted -- is completed, the judge said. If convicted, Brooks 
could get six to 12 months in jail for each case. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks returns to court Oct. 5 for a pretrial hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested at Hartsfield-Atlanta International Airport as  
he arrived from England where he had been living. He waived 
extradition and was returned to Ohio on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks had gone to England to work for an English football team  
that folded. He later worked as a security guard in that country, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	He starred at Auburn before playing 11 seasons in the NFL. He  
played three seasons for the San Diego Chargers, then eight with 
the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	He holds Cincinnati's career rushing record with 6,447 yards.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Calls Microsoft a Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government wrapped up its historic  
antitrust trial Tuesday against the Microsoft Corp., its lawyers 
accusing the company in closing arguments of acting as a vigilant 
monopolist intent on squelching upstart rivals at the expense of 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which was also to make its closing arguments Tuesday,  
said in a midday statement that the government ``truly has blinders 
on when it looks at what is going on in the high-tech industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday was the last time lawyers were meeting in the courtroom  
prior to U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's first of a 
two-phase verdict. That decision could come as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing dozens of internal e-mails and sworn testimony,  
government lawyers portrayed Microsoft as ruthless in its efforts 
to protect the dominance of its lucrative Windows software. 
Microsoft's flagship product runs most personal computers and is 
largely responsible for the vast wealth of the world's richest man, 
billionaire company Chairman Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no other lawful situations in which a company has  
done what Microsoft has done,'' Justice Department lawyer David 
Boies said, adding that the company ``used its power to squelch 
potential competitors, to keep them from emerging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Houck, the lead lawyer for 19 states suing Microsoft  
with the federal government, told the judge that the company's 
``unshakable stranglehold'' over such software ``has cost consumers 
untold millions -- probably hundreds of millions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft is like the emperor without clothes,'' said Houck,  
who gave part of the government's tag-team closing arguments. 
``Everyone knows, including Microsoft, that it's a monopoly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge was unusually quiet Tuesday, offering no insights into  
how he is formulating his decision. He sat through two hours of 
arguments early in the day, asking only one minor question to 
clarify the date of a particular e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies listed an array of budding technologies from some top  
companies in the high-tech industry that he said had failed to 
achieve full promise because of pressure from Microsoft, including 
Internet software from the former Netscape Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft has gone out to smash them down,'' Boies said.  
``This is a monopolist that is very vigilant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Challenging a key defense by Microsoft lawyers, Boies said  
upstart technologies and products don't mean the company faces any 
viable competition for the software that runs computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever happens in the future cannot vindicate what Microsoft  
has done over the years,'' Boies said, urging the judge to 
remember: ``This case is about the real world.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Charged With Larceny in Hoax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A woman claiming to have ovarian cancer raised  
thousands of dollars for cancer research, then used the money to 
buy herself a car and have liposuction, prosecutors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Clougherty, 24, raised as much as $50,000 in the past  
year from friends, family and other donors, said Suffolk County 
District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II. 
</P>
<P>
	She even organized the ``First Annual Kristen Clougherty 5K  
Run/Walk'' to benefit her cancer fund-raising efforts -- even though 
investigators were unable to find any evidence she has cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clougherty faces a charge of larceny over $250. No one answered  
a phone call placed to her home on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Executive Director Jamie Boris said  
he was ``deeply upset'' about Clougherty's alleged activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very distressing that our good name would be used for an  
alleged illegal fund-raising activity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> California Wildfires Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A Benedictine monastery known for its tasty  
fruitcakes and stunning views of the Pacific Ocean was evacuated as 
wildfires raced up a mountain and threatened as many as 250 monks 
and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The mandatory evacuation order at the New Camaldoli Hermitage on  
Monday was the first caused by several active, lightning-caused 
fires that have burned through more than 72,000 acres of Northern 
California's forests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have temporarily evacuated,'' said a message left on the  
monks' answering machine Monday night. ``We're in no immediate 
danger but they tell us it's better to keep moving. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the nonessential personnel are leaving; a few monks are  
remaining behind,'' the message said. ``God bless you. Pray for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The monastery, perched 1,300 feet above the Pacific Ocean about  
140 miles south of San Francisco, is popular with visitors seeking 
solitary contemplation. They can rent rooms by the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Reachable only by a narrow, twisting road from the coastal  
highway, it also houses between 30 and 40 monks who maintain vows 
of silence and support their contemplative life by selling 
fruitcakes over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The monks and visitors were told to gather at Grange Hall in the  
town of Big Sur, a dozen miles up the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Monday, the fires had not threatened people so seriously.  
</P>
<P>
	In Big Sur's Los Padres National Forest, at least 28,000 acres  
of oak trees, sage, chaparral and other brush had burned by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 47,500 acres had burned in the Trinity Alps Wilderness  
Area about 210 miles north of San Francisco, making the wildfire 
the largest burning in the nation, fire spokeswoman Rosemary Hardin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these mountains go straight up and down,'' said Joe  
Pasinato, a Forest Service spokesman with the firefighters in Big 
Sur. ``I don't see how you could possibly build a hand line on 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Big Sur, a fire came within a mile of another  
religious center, Tassajara Hot Springs, which is populated by Zen 
Buddhists. Residents there were advised to either evacuate, or be 
ready to leave in a hurry. It is the off-season for tourists, so 
only a few people remained Monday.

<HEADLINE> Countess Assures Business as Usual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Countering claims that her mother-in-law, Queen  
Elizabeth II, wants her to pare back her public relations work, the 
new Countess of Wessex has written to clients assuring them it's 
``business as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said the queen was angry that the former Sophie  
Rhys-Jones, who married the queen's youngest son, Edward, in June, 
had used her royal connections to secure lucrative contracts for 
her public relations firm, including the car maker Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	But in her letter, released Tuesday, the countess wrote that  
Buckingham Palace is ``supportive of my role'' at R-JH Public 
Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this letter is to reassure you that I am  
totally committed to R-JH and, as I said at the time of my 
engagement, it is and continues to be `business as usual,''' she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Many newspapers were critical of the newest royal when she was  
pictured with a new Rover model at the Frankfurt Motor Show last 
week.

<HEADLINE> Unilever To Cut Brand Portfolio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Anglo-Dutch consumer products  
conglomerate Unilever NV plans to cut its brand portfolio to a core 
of 400 products from its current lineup of 1,600 brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Unilever, the world's largest maker of household goods, said  
today the move will simplify its supply chain and help it cut costs 
by $1.4 billion within three years. 
</P>
<P>
	It did not elaborate on which brands would be eliminated, but  
said the new lineup would include brands which are No. 1 or 2 in 
their respective markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Unilever's brands include Lipton tea, Breyer's ice cream, Flora  
margarine, Wisk washing detergents, Calvin Klein perfumes and the 
Bird's Eye and Gorton's frozen foods lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the new portfolio, there will be several ``power brands''  
which will have worldwide reach, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next three to five years, we will redirect resources  
in the areas of marketing, innovation and personnel behind this 
focused portfolio, which will lead to increased rates of growth,'' 
Unilever said in a statement. ``Within that time frame, the aim 
will be to grow the power brands at between 6 percent and 8 percent 
per year -- in some cases even faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Duthrie, an analyst at MeesPierson in Amsterdam said  
Unilever almost certainly would discontinue the brands outside its 
new core group of 400 rather than sell them off ``and give their 
competitors a step up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably don't know completely yet'' which brands will be  
retained and which will be dumped, Duthrie added. He said labels to 
be discontinued most likely would be national or regional brands, 
and that the selection process likely would take several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to maintain focus when you have so many  
brands,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unilever said it expects to improve operating margins by 0.5  
percent a year over the next 5 years in a push to become what 
co-chairmen Niall FitzGerald and Antony Burgmans called ``leaner, 
fitter and faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the company posted an 11 percent jump in net profit  
for the second quarter to $727 million, citing strong sales in 
Asia, North America, Africa and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Apple Expects Lower Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. stock plunged this  
morning after the company disclosed that a shortage of chips used 
in its Power Mac G4 would result in an unexpected shortfall in 
fourth quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Monday that Motorola has not been able to  
supply enough chips to fill all the more than 150,000 orders Apple 
has received since announcing the product three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the company expects to report earnings of between  
$75 million and $85 million on Oct. 13, down from $106 million 
during the same quarter in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple stock tumbled as much as 10 percent in early trading today  
as investors responded to the announcement, made after the close of 
markets Monday. The stock price was down $7 a share, or $72.06 1/4, by 
mid-morning on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning showed profit would equal about 43 cents to 49 cents  
per share, down from the 76 cents estimated by analysts polled by 
First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret that we will not be able to ship them all this  
quarter,'' said Apple's interim CEO Steve Jobs. ``This is a 
temporary issue, and we hope to catch up early in the coming 
quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The profit shortfall should not darken the longer-term outlook  
at Apple, said Dan Lavin, who follows technology companies as 
research director with IV Associates, in Burlingame, Calif. 
Analysts have simply expected too much, too quickly from Apple, 
whose core products are doing well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've more than doubled their market share. They're finally  
making money,'' Lavin said. ``This is just a case of the analysts 
continuing to push and push and push and then they got savaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news is the first financial blow since Apple's announced  
recovery last October, when Jobs proudly reported the company's 
first profitable fiscal year since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's chief financial officer Fred Anderson said Monday that  
despite the fourth quarter glitch, the company's fiscal year will 
end with ``significant year-over-year growth in units and revenue 
in the December quarter.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Breaks $50 Million Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, continuing to smash  
all campaign fund-raising records, has raised more than $52 
million, becoming the first presidential candidate to break the $50 
million barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the total is $550,000 from tickets sold to  
fund-raisers this week, including one scheduled for Saturday in 
Boston featuring the governor's father, former President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush advisers indicated earlier this month that they expected  
the governor to beat the $50 million mark by the end of September, 
the close of the next reporting period for campaign finance 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush already has reached that mark, campaign spokeswoman Mindy  
Tucker said Tuesday, confirming that Bush had raised $3 million 
from events over the past month, bringing his total to more than 
$52 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of June, Bush had raised $37 million and had $30  
million in the bank. His next report is due to the Federal Election 
Commission on Oct. 15 and covers the period July 1 through Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's $52 million is more money than any other presidential  
candidate ever has had to spend on a campaign, even including 
federal matching funds. Including the federal funds, 1996 
Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole had $45 million to spend 
and President Clinton had $43 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With money coming in at such a prolific clip, Bush has said that  
he would not accept federal funding, which would require his 
campaign to limit its spending to around $40 million in the 
primaries. By refusing the federal assistance, Bush can spend as 
much as he can raise, allowing him to financially compete with 
publisher Steve Forbes, who also is not accepting federal funds for 
his largely self-financed campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Bush became the first presidential candidate to post  
daily lists of his campaign contributors on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Republican presidential candidates, campaign of Sen.  
John McCain, R-Ariz., expects to report raising more than $10 
million by Sept. 30, including $2 million transferred earlier from 
his Senate campaign account, and activist Gary Bauer reported that 
he had raised more than $5 million to date. Other Republicans have 
declined to disclose their fund-raising totals in advance of Sept. 
30, the end of the third quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPORARY WORKERS: In the mid-1990s, many companies that had  
eliminated thousands of jobs in the early part of the decade turned 
to temporary or contingency help when staff positions opened up. 
That trend has continued, according to the employment consulting 
firm Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc. The company, noting that the 
number of so-called alternative workers grew from 12.1 million to 
12.5 million between 1995 and 1997, said employers are finding that 
these workers are better suited for the demands posed by global 
expansion and high technology. Alternative workers include 
independent contractors, on-call workers, temporary agency 
employees and workers provided by contract firms. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	MUTUAL FUND COSTS: The cost of owning a stock mutual fund  
continues to drop, according to the Investment Company Institute, a 
trade group for the mutual fund industry. A study by ICI economists 
found that the cost of fund investing fell 5.6 percent in 1998, and 
is down a cumulative 40 percent since 1980. The study looked at 
major fees, expenses and sales charges that investors pay in buying 
and owning fund shares. ICI president Matthew Fink says competition 
among mutual funds has helped bring costs down -- fund companies 
vying for investors have worked to get their own expenses down so 
they can charge their customers less and give them higher returns. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	HOW TO HIRE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYEES: If you're looking  
for people to run your company's information technology, you might 
want to try a different approach to hiring. Dan Tully, executive 
vice president of Conduit Systems, a consulting firm based in 
Lincoln, R.I., makes several suggestions in an article in Inc. 
Technology magazine. First: Place more importance on job 
candidates' experience rather than their education. Look for people 
who are relaxed rather than tightly wound. If you have a short-term 
plan for developing your information technology, pick a seasoned 
veteran who can give you immediate results. For a more long-term 
approach, go with a younger prospect who will have room to grow. 
Once you've made your choice, be sure you pay your employees well, 
and make vacation time mandatory to avoid burnout. Be flexible 
about work schedules, and provide workers with ongoing educational 
opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Arab-Americans Urge Disney Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A coalition of Arab-American groups is  
calling on ``peoples of conscience'' to give up their Walt Disney 
World theme park tickets, pass on buying that Tarzan doll and avoid 
Disney-made movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the groups on Tuesday called for the boycott because  
of a planned exhibit at Epcot that they say depicts east Jerusalem 
as part of Israel, designates Jerusalem as the nation's capital and 
marginalizes the roles of Muslims and Christians in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't expect a cultural icon like Disney to embroil itself  
in Israeli propaganda by propagating the Israeli myth that 
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,'' said Khalid Turaani, 
executive director of Washington-based American Muslims for 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Council on American-Islamic Relations and the American  
Muslim Foundation joined the call at a Washington press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast  
War, annexed it and claimed the entire city as its capital. 
Palestinians want the eastern part of the city to be the capital of 
their future state. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is so thorny that most countries, including the United  
States, have their embassies in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial exhibit is part of the theme park's millennium  
celebration featuring more than 35 nations, the United Nations and 
the World Bank. Two Arab countries are to be represented -- Morocco 
and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney spokesman Bill Warren has said the exhibit will not  
designate Jerusalem as the capital. He said Disney planned to go 
ahead with the exhibit, scheduled to open Oct. 1 in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``We place high value on all our guests, and we have never  
intended to offend anyone,'' Warren said. ``This kind of action is 
certainly disappointing to our company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arab-American officials said Disney's statement was not enough  
because the exhibit will imply that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The boycott, planned to last the 15 months the exhibit is  
scheduled to be at Epcot, could be avoided if Disney makes changes 
to the exhibit, the Arab-American officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Arab-American groups, however, said they were not ready to  
participate and believed there was room for negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we don't feel we have reached a dead end,''  
said Dr. Hala Maksoud, president of the Washington-based 
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Arab foreign ministers also will meet this week in New York to  
discuss the possibility of boycotting Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Bannister, a Disney analyst for the Edward Jones brokerage  
firm in St. Louis, said boycotts of Disney traditionally have had 
little impact on the enormous company. The 2-year-old boycott of 
Disney by Southern Baptists over the company's gay-friendly 
policies, for instance, has fallen flat, she said.

<HEADLINE> Braves, Mets in Pennant Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Mets doled out nearly $164 million  
to close the gap on the Atlanta Braves. In the next 10 days, 
they'll find out if it was money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets are just one game behind the Braves in the NL East with  
a dozen games left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding more drama to an already tense race, the teams meet  
head-to-head six times, beginning tonight with the start of a 
three-game series at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what you want when you've played for this long -- a  
chance to win the division,'' Mets first baseman John Olerud said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta has won seven straight division titles, the last four by  
an average margin of 14 games. A year ago, the Braves blew away the 
second-place Mets by 18 games, knocking New York out of a wild-card 
spot by sweeping a three-game series to end the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have a comfortable lead, but this is still fun,''  
Braves pitcher Tom Glavine said. ``It's exciting for everybody. It 
will continue to be as long as we come out on the right end of the 
stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves haven't been in a serious pennant race, when they  
beat San Francisco by one game to win the NL West. The following 
year, Atlanta moved to the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to catch up with the Braves, New York committed to  
$163.9 million in contracts after last season, keeping Mike Piazza 
and Al Leiter while adding Robin Ventura, Rickey Henderson and Orel 
Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the beginning of spring training, we thought making the  
playoffs or winning the division might come down to something like 
this,'' Leiter said. ``We're definitely thinking about the 
division, and I think we're a better team than we were the last 
time we played them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won four of six games -- including a 16-0 rout at Shea  
-- when the teams met in home-and-home series in late June and early 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta (92-57) and New York (91-58) are the best teams in the  
National League, so there's a strong possibility the loser in the 
division race will live to fight another day as the wild-card 
entrant. 
</P>
<P>
	That occurred two years ago, when the Braves won the East by  
nine game over Florida but were beaten in the NL championship 
series by the wild-card Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Braves are protective of their unprecedented streak of  
division titles, they would gladly trade places with the Mets if it 
meant winning a World Series title, a la the '97 Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a choice between winning the East Division or  
winning a world championship, we'll take the world championship,'' 
third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``These games may not mean 
anything in the big picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the wild card is not a guaranteed consolation prize.  
The Cincinnati Reds are 3 1/2 games behind the Mets and could still 
make a run at both New York and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``If either team should slip up and get swept,'' Jones said,  
``all of a sudden they're in a dogfight with the Reds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with all the money spent by the Mets, Atlanta might have  
built another comfortable lead if not for an epidemic of illness 
(Andres Galarraga hasn't played because of cancer) and injuries 
(Kerry Ligtenberg, Javy Lopez, Rudy Seanez and Odalis Perez are out 
for the season). 
</P>
<P>
	Going into this critical series, the Braves could be without  
another of their top players. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Jordan, who leads the team with 106 RBIs, didn't play  
Sunday because of lingering pain in his right hand, which was 
injured when he was hit by a pitch June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had enough guys go down,'' said Jordan, who hasn't  
homered in more than a month and doesn't know when he will play 
again. ``I almost feel like I have to be in the lineup. It's 
killing me mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Mets won't have to face Atlanta's most reliable  
pitcher, Kevin Millwood, but they still get three Cy Young winners: 
John Smoltz (9-8) tonight, Glavine (11-11) on Wednesday and Greg 
Maddux (18-8) on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York counters with Rick Reed (10-4), Hershiser (13-10) and  
Leiter (11-12). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to pitch against them, but it just didn't work out  
that way,'' said Millwood (18-7, 2.78 ERA). ``We have three pretty 
good guys going against them. I like our chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones sounded a bit more pessimistic if the Braves don't have  
Jordan in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, we're not going to mail it in. We're going to fight  
to the bitter end,'' Jones said. ``If it falls in for us, great. If 
not, we'll know every guy tried as hard as he could, and we just 
had too many injuries to overcome.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Wireless Drops Cell Phone Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Want whoever calls your cellular phone to pay  
the bill? It's not likely to happen in this country unless billing 
rules change dramatically, industy experts and executives say. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Wireless tested the idea in Minneapolis over the summer,  
but got so few takers that it quietly dropped plans for a national 
rollout. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe and Asia, the caller generally pays, and cell phones  
are almost extensions of home and office phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, people who don't have pricey ``big bucket'' plans that  
include hundreds or thousands of minutes often keep the phones off 
to avoid paying for calls they don't want. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, the calling party pays everywhere else in the  
world. I don't know if that means there's something wrong here or 
something right here,'' Sprint PCS vice president Jon Chambers told 
about 100 people at a Personal Communications Showcase panel 
discussion on caller-pays issues Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Brandon of AT&AMP;T Wireless, which had announced in  
February that it planned to have a caller-pays system nationwide by 
the end of the year, was in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the group that when AT&AMP;T Wireless started the test in  
Minneapolis, it charged callers 39 cents a minute, then cut it down 
to 25 cents a minute to try to attract more customers. 
</P>
<P>
	It did, but not enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have not rolled it out anywhere else. You can draw your own  
conclusions from that about how profitable we think it would be,'' 
he said in an interview after the session. 
</P>
<P>
	A few companies do have limited caller pays options, such as  
billing long-distance fees to people who call from outside the 
receiver's local area. But the systems have gaps and sometimes they 
can't identify the caller. 
</P>
<P>
	The intense competition in the business is both the reason many  
companies want caller-pays and part of the reason it won't be easy 
to get. 
</P>
<P>
	Most other countries either have telephone monopolies or a  
limited number of companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, there are too many to count, said Alfred Boschulte, part  
owner and CEO of a management consulting and engineering firm based 
in Reston, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Solving the billing problems this presents is ``not impossible,  
but an extraordinary challenge,'' said Boschulte, whose Detecon 
Inc. is a subsidiary of a German consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers won't use caller pays if it means they'll get a  
blizzard of bills, and companies cannot afford that kind of 
billing, he said. It costs $1.25 to $3 just to create, send out and 
process a bill, he said. ``You cannot render a bill for a 15-cent, 
20-cent, 25-cent call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding a line to an existing bill is much less expensive, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In every country he's looked at, he said, local exchange  
companies work with cellular companies on the billing. That isn't 
the case here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a large bottleneck,'' said J.G. Harrington, a partner  
in the New York law firm Dow, Lohnes &AMP; Albertson. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwestern Bell, with tens of millions of customers in some of  
the nation's biggest cities, will not bill for other companies, and 
other companies seem likely to follow suit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	They can do this because the Federal Communications Commission  
ruled 15 years ago, when the long-distance business was 
splintering, that it was not supposed to regulate billing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Harrington said the question was very different then because  
consumers had alternatives. He said the FCC found that people who 
couldn't get a call billed to their home number could always use 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would be impractical to require people to give their  
credit card number every time they called a cell phone number -- 
especially since people often don't know they're calling cell 
phones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you're trying to collect on a 20- or 35-cent call, it  
doesn't make sense to pay the 15 to 20 cents per line charged by 
telephone bill clearing houses, Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC just began collecting phone companies' suggestions for  
caller-pays rules, said James Schlichting, deputy chief of the 
FCC's wireless bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Wireless companies are equally divided about whether local phone  
companies should be involved in billing, he said. Companies 
offering only wireless want local exchanges to bill for 
caller-pays; companies offering both wireless and standard service 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichting said other key issues for the FCC to consider are  
establishing a standard recording to notify callers that they will 
be charged and how much; what wireless contracts should say about 
billing of such calls; and whether rates on receiving calls should 
be standardized.

<HEADLINE> Kodak Sells Its Image Bank to Getty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. is selling its Image  
Bank collection of 30 million photographs and 15,000 hours of film 
footage to Getty Images Inc. for $183 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Tuesday will create the world's largest,  
privately owned archive of more than 60 million still images and 
more than 30,000 hours of film. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale was expected to be completed in December, financed  
through a combination of debt and a sale of 5 million Getty Images 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Getty Images, a photo archive company based in Seattle, owns the  
Hulton Getty collection, one of the most comprehensive historical 
photo archives in Europe. The Image Bank, founded in 1974 and 
bought by Kodak in 1991, has the largest photo archive collection 
in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're photographs of pretty much every famous person or  
event of the 20th century,'' said Jonathan Klein, co-founder and 
chief executive of Getty Images. 
</P>
<P>
	Getty Images, which provides images online, employs about 1,600  
people and had revenue of $185 million last year. The Image Bank, 
based in Dallas, has 500 employees and sales of $70 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Image Bank's archive photo collection contains still imagery  
from the collections of United Press International, The New York 
Times, Reuters, the Chicago Historical Collection and the George 
Eastman House Collection in Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday, Kodak dipped 12 1/2 cents to close at $74.81 1/4 a  
share on the New York Stock Exchange and Getty Images rose 25 cents 
to $23.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Ease on Cuban Sanctions Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With pressure from the farm lobby, a coalition  
of liberals and conservative lawmakers hopes to open a hole in the 
40-year-old trade embargo against Cuba that would allow the sale of 
U.S. food and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate overwhelmingly approved an amendment last month to a  
must-pass agricultural spending bill that would allow licensing of 
such exports. The provision is likely to be a major issue as House 
and Senate negotiators try to work out the final version of the 
appropriations measure this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have freedom to market products from our  
agricultural sectors with any and all customers,'' said Rep. George 
Nethercutt, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration decided this summer to allow sales of  
food and medicine to three other countries listed as terrorist 
states -- Iran, Libya and Sudan -- but was barred by law from 
including Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate provision, whose co-sponsors include conservative  
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., and liberal Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., 
would allow the government to issue licenses for up to one year for 
food and medicine sales to public institutions in Cuba but would 
bar the Agriculture Department from subsidizing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would prohibit the president from including  
food and medicine in future embargoes of other countries without 
congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that has absolutely been pushed onto the  
radar screen by the ag lobby groups,'' said Jose Cardenas, 
Washington director for the Cuban American National Foundation. 
``They've been playing this for all it's worth, that Mr. and Mrs. 
Family Farmer are being pushed off their farms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on the spending bill were scheduled to start this  
evening. In addition to the trade measure, lawmakers also have to 
work out a multibillion-dollar bailout for the farm economy. The 
Senate approved a $7.4 billion package of farm assistance in 
August, but farm organizations are seeking more. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups and agribusinesses are clamoring to move a glut of  
grain that has depressed commodity prices for the second year in a 
row, and they've been pressuring Congress and the Clinton 
administration to remove all barriers to food exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States expects to export $49 billion worth of  
commodities this year, down from a peak $59.8 billion three years 
ago, and the Agriculture Department is forecasting only slight 
improvement in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration hasn't taken a formal position on the  
Cuba issue. A leading House negotiator, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, 
said recently that Cuba should have to offer some internal reforms 
in return for permission to buy U.S. products. Kaptur is the 
ranking Democrat on the House agricultural appropriations 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-Castro lawmakers hope to strip the Cuba provision from the  
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A stream of farmers and members of Congress, including Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., have trekked to Cuba in recent 
weeks to meet with the Cuban leader and discuss potential 
agricultural trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups claim agricultural trade with Cuba could hit $2  
billion within five years, encompassing wheat, soybeans, rice, 
corn, meat and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	But to do that, Cuba would have to double its current food  
purchases from all sources, and Castro's critics say that's a 
laughable prospect given the country's poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba imported $692 million in agricultural commodities in 1997  
and had $935 million worth of such exports, mostly sugar, according 
to the latest data available from the United Nations' Food and 
Agriculture Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm organizations say Cuba is bound to buy from U.S. sources,  
if it has a chance to, to take advantage of lower shipping costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba currently buys about 700,000 metric tons of wheat, mostly  
from Europe and Canada. ``We're thinking we could sell them all 
their 700,000 tons,'' said Dawn Forsythe, spokeswoman for U.S. 
Wheat Associates, the export promotion arm of the wheat industry. 
``We have the wheat available, and I think that Cuba would like to 
get it.''

<HEADLINE> VW Marks its 100 Millionth Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Volkswagen celebrated its 100 millionth car  
Tuesday -- a silver ``New Beetle'' made in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Board member Klaus Kocks said the jubilee car was a symbol of  
how far Europe's biggest automaker has come since the company's 
beginnings with the 1938 introduction of the original Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
	VW marked the event with a street party at the famed Brandenburg  
Gate in the heart of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Beetle, launched last year, has been a hit in the United  
States but has yet to take off in Europe. With its bug-eyed 
headlights and rounded roof, it's meant to meld the original's 
shapes with up-do-date technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Born under Adolf Hitler's guidance, the Volkswagen -- German for  
``people's car'' -- was meant to offer affordable transportation for 
the nation, modeled on what Henry Ford had done for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The VW plant in Wolfsburg was rebuilt after being destroyed by  
Allied bombs in World War II, and the hardy car went on to become a 
worldwide success.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Police Form Inquiry Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Allegations that rogue cops shot unarmed  
suspects, planted evidence and lied about it will be scrutinized by 
a special board of inquiry, Police Chief Bernard Parks said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe also led a judge to suspend an injunction against the  
18th Street gang that barred the gang from gathering. The 
injunction was based on declarations by some of the same officers 
now caught up in the corruption case. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy District Attorney David Demerjian said 15 people have  
been arrested for violating the injunction. He claimed the quality 
of life in the community will deteriorate as soon as gangs hear it 
was stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The upending of the injunction -- part of a strategy for  
controlling gangs' street activities -- was the latest repercussion 
of the investigation focusing on officers working in the Rampart 
neighborhood west of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Parks later appeared before City Council members, who sought  
assurances that the Police Commission's inspector general will have 
access to the department's internal investigation and asked that 
the probe not limit itself to the Rampart station. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of the investigation is Rafael Perez, a former  
Rampart station narcotics officer convicted of stealing $1 million 
worth of cocaine from a police evidence room. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to obtain a lesser sentence, Perez has talked to  
investigators, telling them of suspects being framed for crimes 
they didn't commit, of officers lying in court to win convictions 
and, in some cases, of officers shooting unarmed suspects, then 
accusing them of assault.

<HEADLINE> Barak Aims for Peace With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Speaking at a memorial for Israeli soldiers  
killed in the 1973 Mideast war, Prime Minister Ehud Barak today 
appealed to Syria to negotiate a ``peace of the brave'' and prevent 
further bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, who until  
recently was upbeat about the prospects of peace with Syria, said 
the Syrian position was hardening. ``Syria is becoming more 
intransigent,'' Levy told Israel radio. ``It is raising the level 
of its demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both leaders spoke before leaving for trips in which restarting  
Israeli-Syrian negotiations will play an important role. Barak flew 
to Germany today and then will go to France. Both nations are 
involved in U.S.-led efforts to revive the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy left for New York, where he was to address the U.N. General  
Assembly. Levy said he was given to understand that the United 
States would try to arrange a meeting in New York between him and 
his Syrian counterpart, Farouk Sharaa. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I am concerned it is possible -- any time, any  
place,'' Levy said, 
</P>
<P>
	In his election campaign, Barak said his aim was to achieve  
peace with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians during his four year 
term of office. Israeli-Syrian negotiations have been suspended 
since February 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our Syrian neighbors, who also suffered many losses in the  
Yom Kippur War, we say: this is the time for the peace of the 
brave,'' Barak said today at a memorial for Israeli soldiers killed 
in the 1973 war. ``Enough of wars! Enough of bloodshed!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has made similar appeals in the past, including in his  
first speech as prime minister to Israel's parliament in July when 
he urged the region's leader to negotiate peace treaties with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel and Syria disagree on the terms for resuming  
negotiations. Syria maintains that the late Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin promised to withdraw from the entire the Golan 
Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war. Syria's 
president, Hafez Assad, insists that the negotiations must resume 
from the point where they were broken off. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel says Rabin made no such promise, but merely asked what  
kind of peace Assad was prepared to give if Israel did give back 
the Golan. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy said the negotiations should be resumed without  
preconditions. ``Negotiating with Israel is not in itself a 
sacrifice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak wishes to retain certain areas on the lower slopes of the  
Golan, where some of Israel's water sources lie. Levy expressed 
disappointment with recent Syrian statements saying Damascus 
insists on recovering all the land right down to the shores of the 
Sea of Galilee.

<HEADLINE> Six Boys Suspected in Gang Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Six boys, ages 5 to 13, are suspected in  
an attack on an 8-year-old girl who police say was forced into an 
abandoned house and gang-raped. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack occurred on Sept. 7 or 8 but wasn't reported to  
police until last week by the victim's mother, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl was playing outside her home when she was attacked.  
Four of the six suspects raped her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her brother heard her cries for help and tried to come to her  
aid, but at least two of the suspects stopped him. He then left to 
get an older brother, who was able to rescue her, said police 
spokesman Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made, but three suspects were questioned at  
an elementary school Monday morning and the others were being 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl apparently knew her attackers. ``They may not have been  
friends, but they weren't absolute strangers,'' Jordan said. ``It 
doesn't appear that it was random.''

<HEADLINE> Internet To Reach Poor India Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Video e-mail will open up India's  
Internet revolution next month to thousands of poor, illiterate -- 
and awestruck -- villagers who have never seen a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 2, the birthday of Indian independence leader Mohandas  
Gandhi, video e-mail booths will be inaugurated in eight towns in 
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- two of India's poorest and most populous 
states. A conglomerate of Indian computer software makers announced 
the program Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The booths, complete with video cameras, will be wired up with  
20 similar booths hundreds of miles away in Bombay, India's 
financial hub, said Dewang Mehta, who heads the National 
Association of Software and Service Companies. 
</P>
<P>
	It will cost 15 rupees -- or 35 cents -- to send or receive a  
three-minute message, including a video image and voice, through an 
e-mail account. 
</P>
<P>
	For villagers, it may take half a day to earn 15 rupees. But  
Mehta feels many would pay it for the chance to hear and see a 
loved one once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the initial users in Bombay are expected to be taxi  
drivers who left their small towns and villages to make a living in 
the faraway metropolis. They are able to visit their families only 
once a year, and regular old-fashioned mail takes weeks to reach 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Most villages in India still do not have access to a telephone,  
and only about half of the country's population has a phone 
connection. The software makers' association hopes the Internet 
project will eventually enable millions of poor, illiterate people 
to communicate cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet connectivity is growing in India, but the global  
information revolution has so far touched only a fraction of the 
country's nearly 1 billion people. India has only 3.2 million 
personal computers, and only 400,000 Indians have access to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The central government surrendered its Internet monopoly last  
November, offering foreign companies up to a 49 percent share in 
local joint ventures. The Communications Ministry has said it would 
provide all district hubs across the country with Internet 
connectivity, but progress has been slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the 300,000 privately-owned telephone booths in the  
country are likely to provide video E-mail facilities, officials 
say.

<HEADLINE> Hamilton Sundstrand To Cut Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (AP) -- Hamilton Sundstrand, the aerospace  
unit of United Technologies Corp., announced plans Tuesday to cut 
1,500 jobs, a move the company called the ``natural result'' of the 
merger between Hamilton Standard and Sundstrand Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, the current aerospace and industrial sales  
declines as well as ongoing industry consolidation are continuing, 
and we are aggressively reducing our costs to meet these 
challenges,'' Hamilton Sundstrand President Ron McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Tuesday it would close and sell the electronics  
operation at its plant in suburban Windsor Locks, and complete the 
shutdown of a plant in Colorado Springs, Colo. Other operations 
will be consolidated at Windsor Locks. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts, to be carried out between now and the end of 2000,  
amount to 8.3 percent of the company's work force. Hamilton 
Sundstrand was created earlier this year by the merger of Hamilton 
Standard and Rockford, Ill.-based Sundstrand Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Parent, the business director for Machinists District 91,  
said the union would begin negotiating with the company Wednesday 
on early retirement and severance packages. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also has six months to try and convince the United  
Technologies Corp. subsidiary to keep the jobs in Connecticut, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are jobs that when they leave, they will never come  
back,'' Parent told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutbacks will reduce the number of electronics facilities  
from six to four. The company is also closing its customer support 
facility in East Windsor, Conn., and relocating its operations to 
Windsor Locks, a move which gets the company out of a leased 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Propeller systems overhaul and repair work now done in East  
Windsor will move to Long Beach, Calif., and Maastricht, the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Military spares and commercial spares operations will be  
consolidated, with the military side of the business in Windsor 
Locks and the commercial side in Rockford. Some 60 positions at 
Rockford Plant 1 will move to other facilities in Rockford, Miami, 
and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Work from two other Rockford-area sites will be moved to Plant  
1. Both smaller plants will be closed and the one owned by the 
company will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	To minimize the number of people who must be laid off, the  
company is first offering a voluntary separation package to 
salaried and hourly workers. The details of the package for hourly 
workers will have to be negotiated with the Machinists union. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the company knows how many people will take the buyout,  
the exact number of layoffs required will not be clear. Hamilton 
Sundstrand spokesman John Mayo said today the company hopes as many 
as 500 workers will take the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton Sundstrand already has cut 210 jobs this year.  
</P>
<P>
	The company has dozens of plants around the world, with 18,000  
employees and $3 billion in sales. Its products for the aerospace 
industry include electric power generation and distribution 
systems, fuel pumps, engine control systems, environmental control 
systems and propellers. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, McKenna had said he wanted to move the company away  
from making individual components and toward selling entire 
electronic, hydraulic and fuel systems to aircraft manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Feds Set To Prober Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Congressional leader intends to pursue  
legislation to end the ``culture of corruption'' that pervaded 
Atlanta's winning bid for the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said today his House commerce  
subcommittee on oversight and investigation will hold hearings next 
month on the Atlanta bid and will invite IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch to testify. If Samaranch doesn't appear voluntarily, 
Upton said a subpoena is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the Atlanta bid, submitted to Congress last week by  
former attorney general Griffin Bell, shows clearly that ``votes 
were for sale, and it's got to stop,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton said his panel will consider ending the IOC's exemption  
from the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as a possible way to end the 
longstanding practice of gift-giving to IOC members to influence 
the selection of host cities for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Upton announced his plans at a news conference one day after the  
U.S. Olympic Committee said it plans no further investigation of 
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC demanded last week the USOC explain why details of  
Atlanta's gifts, travel payments and scholarship offers were not 
included in an earlier report the USOC provided in an IOC inquiry 
into improprieties in candidate cities. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC spokesman Mike Moran told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution  
on Monday that an amended report submitted to congressional 
investigators last week ``does nothing to alter what we are clear 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is much wider than any American city,'' Moran said.  
</P>
<P>
	The report turned over to lawmakers by former Attorney General  
Griffin Bell, who revised it on behalf of Atlanta Olympics 
organizers, revealed that Atlanta bidders offered or considered 
lavish favors, gifts and perks for IOC members and their families, 
including college scholarships, free healthcare and job offers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report amended a previous accounting given to a U.S. House  
commerce subcommittee investigation opened in the wake of the Salt 
Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC forwarded a copy of Bell's report to the IOC late last  
week. In a cover letter, an USOC attorney said the Colorado 
Springs, Colo., organization did not plan any further 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've learned all the lessons to be learned in this,'' said  
Scott Blackmon, deputy executive director and lead counsel of the 
USOC. ``Based on what we've seen in the report, it looks like more 
of the same culture. There's nothing different between what 
happened in Atlanta and Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members were critical of the Bell report and comments  
Atlanta officials made, in which they implied that they had been 
drawn into a climate of corruption when they began their bid to 
hold the Games in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian IOC member Mario Pescante, who led Rome's losing  
campaign for the 2004 Games, accused the Americans of ducking 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't the Americans take the responsibility for the people  
who organized this strategy of bribery and corruption? Who started 
this? They did,'' Pescante told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran said the USOC would not be drawn into finger-pointing.  
</P>
<P>
	``The question of whether cities are forcing something on IOC  
members or whether IOC members are soliciting gifts is not the 
point,'' Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the USOC's own probe ``made it clear there is a culture  
of this involving all bid cities and the IOC itself. It has ebbed 
and flowed in various cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled in connection  
with the Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal.

<HEADLINE> Effort To Improve Minority Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --Almost half of blacks have bad credit, nearly  
twice the rate of whites, mortgage lender Freddie Mac reported 
today in announcing a joint initiative with black colleges to teach 
minorities good spending practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to ensure that as many families as possible have  
the opportunity to own a home,'' said Leland C. Brendsel, chairman 
and chief executive officer of Freddie Mac. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasing the pool of qualified minority home buyers will  
play an important role in future expansion of the home mortgage 
industry,'' Brendsel said. ``This initiative is not only good for 
our nation but makes good business sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mortgage lender in January awarded $1.3 million to five  
black colleges to conduct a national credit survey. The colleges 
participating are Benedict College in Columbia, S.C., Clark Atlanta 
University in Atlanta, Florida A&AMP;M University in Tallahassee, 
Howard University in Washington and Saint Augustine's College in 
Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that while bad credit crosses racial and  
economic lines, it is especially pervasive among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among all respondents, 30 percent had bad credit records. About  
47 percent of blacks and 34 percent of Hispanics had bad credit. 
Among whites surveyed, 27 percent had bad credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad credit is defined as those consumers who have been either 90  
days late on a payment in the last two years or 30 days late on a 
payment more than once in the last two years or have a record of 
delinquent liens, public records or bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	The schools and Freddie Mac are analyzing the results to develop  
an initiative to help consumers obtain and maintain good credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Urban League and the NAACP have agreed to help  
implement the project, which will include distributing an 
educational curriculum for teen-agers and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Some universities are already looking at ways to incorporate the  
spending lessons in students' curricula. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Washington, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at  
Florida A&AMP;M University, said the school plans to offer a course in 
its economics department and business school. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to start in the fall. If not the fall, we'll  
definitely try to start in January,'' Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington said the problem extends across all income brackets  
and solving it will require lessons to help people not only obtain 
credit but manage their money wisely. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just simply a poor person without money trying to get  
what they see as the American dream. It's one who has met the 
American dream but cannot manage money,'' Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Freddie Mac study found that among people with  
incomes under $25,000, 48 percent of black borrowers had bad credit 
while 31 percent of white borrowers had bad credit. And even in the 
$65,000-to-$75,000 income bracket, 34 percent of blacks had bad 
credit compared to 20 percent of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-six percent of blacks own homes, compared with 72 percent  
of whites. Poor credit is often cited as one of the leading factors 
in rejection of mortgage applications. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-page survey was mailed to over 20,000 consumers between  
the ages of 20 and 40 with incomes up to $75,000. There were about 
12,000 respondents. The margin of error for the survey is plus or 
minus 1 percentage point.

	Gov't Calls Microsoft a Monopoly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government wrapped up its historic  
antitrust trial against the Microsoft Corp., today. Its lawyers 
accused the company in closing arguments of acting as a vigilant 
monopolist intent on squelching upstart rivals at the expense of 
consumers. Microsoft, which was also to make its closing arguments 
today, said in a midday statement that the government ``truly has 
blinders on when it looks at what is going on in the high-tech 
industry.'' Today was the last time lawyers were meeting in the 
courtroom prior to U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's 
first part of a two-phase verdict. That decision could come as 
early as next month. Microsoft stock was down 2 5/16 at 95 1/4 in 
afternoon trading.

</P>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. stock was down 7  
15/16 at 71 1/8 this afternoon ell today after the company disclosed 
that a shortage of chips used in its Power Mac G4 would result in 
an unexpected shortfall in fourth quarter profits. The company said 
late yesterday that Motorola has not been able to supply enough 
chips to fill all the more than 150,000 orders Apple has received 
since announcing the product three weeks ago. As a result, the 
company expects to report earnings of between $75 million and $85 
million on Oct. 13, down from $106 million during the same quarter 
in 1998.

	Trade Deficit Swells in July  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. trade deficit ballooned to a monthly  
record of $25.2 billion in July as a flood of foreign cars, 
machinery and consumer goods pushed imports to an all-time high. 
The U.S. deficit with Japan, China and Western Europe all set 
records. The Commerce Department reported today that the trade 
deficit grew by 2.4 percent in July, surpassing the June imbalance 
of $24.6 billion. The growing deficit was seen as contributing to 
today's fall in stock prices on Wall Street. The U.S. trade 
imbalance has climbed to new highs for seven straight months, 
pushing the gap between imports and exports to an annual rate of 
$247 billion, far above last year's record deficit of $164.3 
billion.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government today approved a long-needed  
new weapon against the growing threat of drug-resistant bacteria: 
Synercid, the first alternative in 30 years to the antibiotic of 
last resort. The new drug comes at a critical time, as doctors are 
warning that more and more germs are developing resistance to that 
``silver bullet'' antibiotic, vancomycin. The FDA for the past year 
has allowed hundreds of patients at risk of death from 
drug-resistant germs to be treated with Synercid under a special 
emergency program. Today, the FDA approved Synercid to treat 
vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections, a life-threatening 
infection that typically strikes hospital patients.

<HEADLINE> Youngest Victims of Shooting Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Joey Ennis was an only child who  
dreamed of playing in the National Basketball Association, a 
curious teen-ager who only recently joined the Baptist church. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of three 14-year-olds remembered Monday in funerals  
for the last of seven people shot to death at a Fort Worth church 
last week. His cousin, Chris Belsher, described Ennis as a 
fun-loving teen to about 1,000 mourners at the First Baptist 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though, if I had never brought him to church, this  
wouldn't have happened, I'm so glad I did, so he would have a 
better chance to get closer to God and get to know Him better,'' 
Belsher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral for Kristi Beckel was at a nearly full Bethesda  
Community Church and the service for Cassandra Griffin was at 
Wedgwood Baptist Church, scene of last Wednesday's shootings that 
ended with the suicide of the gunman, Larry G. Ashbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miss Beckel's funeral, a Baptist minister told about 1,500  
people that the slain were victims of a ``deranged gunman who was 
in the power of the prince of darkness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The world has watched this community, this family of faith, in  
amazement this week. ... The prince of darkness began in Wedgwood, 
at my church,'' said the Rev. Al Meredith, pastor of Wedgwood 
Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seven precious lives were snuffed out, then the gunman turned  
the gun on himself. We need to pray for his family, too,'' Meredith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethesda Community Church is next door to Bethesda Christian  
School, where Miss Beckel was a ninth-grader. Classes were canceled 
Monday so classmates could attend the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Meredith remembered Miss Beckel as a girl who loved volleyball,  
singing and ``I Love Lucy'' reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're crying not for Kristi. She is with the Lord,'' he said.  
``She can spike every ball that comes over the net now. She can 
sing bass if she wants to, and first soprano. Her joy is 
unspeakable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hundred mourners attended Miss Beckel's late-afternoon  
burial at Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery in Ardmore, Okla., where 
her grandmothers live. Her volleyball uniform was draped over her 
casket. Members of her junior varsity team filed past, each placing 
a rose on top. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives and friends described the teen as tender-hearted and  
disciplined, with a contagious laugh and a strong faith in God. 
</P>
<P>
	Services for Ashbrook's four other victims were on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	After Miss Griffin's funeral, family friend Carolyn Jackson  
remembered her as a special girl. ``She was quiet, but she was 
powerful in her own right,'' Ms. Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the church, someone had parked a pickup truck and covered  
its windows with white-painted slogans: ``Rule heaven, Cassie'' and 
``Cassie always in our hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As family and friends mourned, police continued their  
investigation into the gunman's motivation, saying they were 
exploring whether Ashbrook had been taking antidepressant 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor prescribed Prozac for Ashbrook, police told the Fort  
Worth Star-Telegram in a story published today. A bottle of the 
drug was found in his home the day after the shooting, as were 
vials of medicine for his father, Jack, who died of cancer in July. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of paranoia within his life had advanced to an  
extreme stage,'' police Lt. Mark Krey said. ``We're investigating 
the possibility that with the death of his father, Mr. Ashbrook 
stopped taking medication.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The special counsel investigating whether  
there was an official cover-up in the 1993 Branch Davidian siege 
has taken a personal tour of the Texas site and is asking for a 
meeting with lawyers who have filed a wrongful death lawsuit 
against the government. 
</P>

were visiting the spot for the first time since their 27-year-old 
son, Peter, died in the gunfight that launched the 51-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real sorry about the loss of your son,'' Danforth told the  
couple during his unannounced visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Danforth has written the lawyers who are  
representing surviving Davidians and relatives of the dead, asking 
for meetings with his investigators within the next two weeks. 
``The purpose of the meeting would be to obtain information from 
you on any issues relevant to my investigation,'' Danforth wrote in 
the Monday letter, obtained today by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter requests the attorneys' views on the FBI's use of  
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters, the ``allegedly improper use of the 
U.S. armed forces,'' how certain evidence and testimony was 
presented to Congress, and who are the most important witnesses and 
evidence bearing on those issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrongful-death lawsuit, which accuses the government of  
using excessive force, had been set to begin next month. But U.S. 
District Judge Walter Smith in Waco last week postponed the trial's 
start to give the government more time to produce the evidence he 
has demanded. A new court date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth's visit to Waco and proposed meeting with the lawyers  
come on the heels of his request to Smith last week that discovery 
and depositions by plaintiffs' and government lawyers be delayed 
for a month to give him time to do his own witness questioning. 
Smith authorized the delay Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth was appointed two weeks ago by Attorney General Janet  
Reno to head an independent inquiry into the actions of law 
enforcement during the deadly raid after the FBI's belated 
admission that potentially incendiary tear gas grenades were used 
in the siege's final hours. The bureau had denied the use of such 
devices for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials maintain that Branch Davidians, not federal  
agents, set the deadly fire.

<HEADLINE> NHL, Union Discuss 2002 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The NHL and the players association  
made progress Tuesday toward an agreement that would allow players 
from the league to compete in the 2002 Olympics at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL officials and the union met with International Ice Hockey  
Federation president Rene Fasel. Some issues remain unresolved, but 
an announcement by the IIHF is expected before the end of the year, 
said a source close to the discussions who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is expected to include a provision for a World Cup  
tournament in 2004, an important issue for the players. With the 
collective bargaining agreement expiring and a major battle 
expected for a new deal, the players would benefit from a 
tournament that brings goodwill and money to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The length of the NHL break during the Olympics was among the  
issues under discussion. The league took 17 days off last year, 
when the NHL's participation helped the popularity of the sport in 
some countries but stirred less interest than anticipated in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Better TV ratings in North America are expected in 2002 because  
games can be shown live rather than on tape as the games from 
Nagano, Japan, in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from the players association and  
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bill Daly, the NHL's senior vice president of legal  
affairs, said in an interview Tuesday night at the Florida-Tampa 
Bay exhibition game that there were ongoing discussions with NBC 
about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``TV is very important,'' Daly said. ``It's important for the  
exposure of the game and for the NHL players. And for us to take a 
hiatus in the middle of the season, (TV) is very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fasel also met with reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	``By the end of the year, we hope to finalize some different  
points,'' he said. ``It's very important (for the NHL to be in the 
Olympics). It helps promote the game. It's not financial. It's 
about promoting the game.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Yankees Promote Mark Newman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark Newman, sought by other teams for general  
manager vacancies, has been appointed director of baseball 
operations for the New York Yankees, the New York Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman's promotion, which has not been officially annouced yet  
by the Yankees, makes him second in the team's hierarchy behind 
George Steinbrenner. The change apparently took effect at the 
team's organizational meeting Monday in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman has been very influential with Steinbrenner in recent  
years, and the Times said the appointment will not change the way 
the team is run. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it is a sign general manager Brian Cashman is falling  
out of favor with Steinbrenner. It has been widely reported that 
Steinbrenner was upset with Cashman for losing arbitration cases in 
the offseason against shortstop Derek Jeter and closer Mariano 
Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman, though, will still be responsible for contract  
negotiations and trade talks.

<HEADLINE>  Clemency Offer 'Loser' for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Absolutely, President Clinton said twice, for  
emphasis, when he denied that politics was involved in the clemency 
he offered 16 Puerto Rican separatists, in what Congress calls a 
deplorable concession to terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reasoning behind his decision, it has absolutely  
not been good politics for him, or for his wife's Senate campaign 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In a five-page letter explaining his decision, Clinton said he  
did not minimize the ``serious criminal conduct'' of the people he 
granted clemency, but that their long prison sentences were out of 
proportion to their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter to Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., on Tuesday he  
repeated that he acted on the advice of his White House counsel. 
``His recommendation and my decision were based on our view of the 
merits of the requests,'' Clinton said. ``Political considerations 
played no role in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans see a law-and-order issue they can  
press in House and Senate investigations, although a president's 
clemency decisions are not subject to review there. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem. Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary  
Committee and a long-shot candidate for the 2000 Republican 
presidential nomination, said he intends to look into the process, 
questioning whether the rules were followed. He also said in a Fox 
TV interview that almost anybody with brains would conclude that 
Clinton offered clemency to help Hillary Rodham Clinton in New 
York, home to about 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. And Rep. Dan Burton, 
R-Ind., said he'll show taped evidence that two of those who got 
clemency made bombs in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	If any of this actually was intended to benefit the first lady,  
it hasn't. Three weeks after Clinton's clemency offer, Mrs. Clinton 
said she was opposed to it, and that it should be withdrawn. New 
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the likely Republican nominee for 
the Senate, had called clemency a mistake, and there was Democratic 
criticism, too. Among the Democratic opponents was Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, whose retirement is opening the New York seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's turn against clemency angered leaders of the  
Puerto Rican political community in New York. Both Clintons said 
they had not discussed the matter before the president granted 
clemency on Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen of the convicted Puerto Ricans got clemency -- freedom  
for 11, forgiven fines for three others. Two rejected Clinton's 
conditions, which included renouncing violence and avoiding 
association with people who advocate it. So it may still be an 
issue in the Senate campaign. And it could come up in the campaign 
for New York's presidential primary next March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore has said only that he won't stand in  
judgment of Clinton's clemency decision, and has neither endorsed 
nor opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bradley, challenging Gore for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, said he wouldn't have granted clemency. He said on ABC 
that Clinton should explain his decision to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate already have declared their opposition to  
clemency, by overwhelming margins. In the House, it was 311 to 41. 
The Senate vote was 95 to 2. Those are political statements, 
nothing binding because Congress has no role in clemency; the 
Constitution grants that power to presidents alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making concessions to terrorists is deplorable,'' the  
resolutions declare, ``and ... President Clinton should not have 
granted clemency to the FALN terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is the abbreviation in Spanish for the Armed Forces of  
National Liberation, responsible for some 130 bombings and 
robberies between 1974 and 1983. Six people were killed, scores 
more injured, some of them disabled, in those episodes. Clinton's 
clemency drew protests from police and federal law enforcement 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the people involved ``had served very long  
sentences for offenses that did not involve bodily harm to other 
people.'' The sentences ranged from 15 to 90 years; the White House 
had called them excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	Their offenses included armed robbery, weapons violations and  
seditious conspiracy in support of FALN operations. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been pressure for years from Puerto Rican politicians,  
some in Congress, and human rights campaigners, for clemency in the 
cases of the Puerto Rican nationals. After granting it, Clinton 
pointed to the urging of figures like South African Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu and former President Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Ruff conducted the final review, just before leaving his  
post as White House counsel. Clinton said it got to him in ``the 
ordinary course of business from the counsel's office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it is part of the ordinary course of politics, Republican  
investigators versus the Clinton administration.

<HEADLINE>  Pistons Trade Draft Pick for Harper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons traded the rights  
to their top draft pick, Melvin Levett, to the Los Angeles Lakers 
for veteran Derek Harper Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Levett, a 6-foot-3 guard who played at Cincinnati, was the 54th  
overall pick in the June draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Harper will back up starting point guard Lindsey  
Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Derek gives us the backup point guard we've been looking

league for 16 seasons and has played at a high level his entire 
career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper has also played for the Mavericks, New York Knicks and  
Orlando Magic. He has averaged 13.3 points and 5.5 assists in 1,119 
career games, eighth on the NBA's all-time list. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Drought Leads to Silo Gas Danger / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Persistent dry weather during the summer is  
posing a leftover danger for farmers this fall: increased risk of 
exposure to ``silo gas,'' which can burn the lungs in seconds and 
kill in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risk is always there. The drought just makes this year  
more serious than ever,'' Pete Gregg, spokesman for the state 
Department of Agriculture and Markets, said Tuesday. ``Farmers need 
to take heed because their lives can be in danger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the drought, most crops did not grow to full size.  
Nitrates that are usually converted to proteins for grain formation 
accumulated instead in the plants' stems, said Nate Herendeen of 
Cornell Cooperative Extension. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, corn and hay stored in a silo will ferment at a  
quicker rate and produce more nitrogen dioxide, also known as silo 
gas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the gas is inhaled, it can dissolve the moisture in lungs  
and form nitric acid. The acid in turn burns the lungs, causing 
them to fill quickly with fluid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It literally burns, just like sulfuric acid burning. It  
displaces oxygen in the body,'' said Carol Evans, an occupational 
health nurse at the New York Center for Agricultural Medicine and 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Inhaling smaller concentrations over short periods of time can  
cause extensive lung damage, but inhaling large concentrations can 
mean death, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath and throat  
irritation may be immediate or could develop over a few hours or 
days after exposure. Treatment usually includes oxygen and fluid 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the center has investigated two silo gas inhalation  
cases in Schoharie County. One farmer was hospitalized and later 
released, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a dry summer in 1994, the number of incidents doubled.  
Evans said the same situation is likely to happen this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is especially serious in upright silos, Herendeen  
said. Silo gas is denser than air flow down the chute and it 
gathers at the base where people and livestock may be easily 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fermentation takes three to four weeks after silos are filled.  
During that time, the area should be sealed off from the barn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best advice is to stay away until the fermentation is  
over,'' Herendeen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said farmers should simply be more cautious when they fork  
crops in silos. ``Sometimes it's got an odor, sometimes it doesn't. 
Sometimes you see it, sometimes you don't. It's a double whammy,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers should watch out for bleach-like odors and  
yellowish-brown fumes, which can indicate the presence of silo gas. 
</P>
<P>
	If it is really necessary to enter a silo during fermentation,  
Herendeen recommends ventilating the silo for at least 30 minutes 
with a blower. 
</P>
<P>
	Only trained professionals with self-contained breathing  
equipment should enter the silo during that time. Dust masks or 
cartridge-type respirators will not protect against silo gas, 
health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the state agriculture department reported  
that hay and silage corn were the crops worst-hit in New York by 
the drought. Preliminary damages were estimated at nearly $35 
million, with state officials saying the final total could go much 
higher after farmers finished harvesting all their crops.

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis-Infected Insects Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Mosquitoes infected with the St. Louis  
encephalitis virus were discovered here Tuesday and a third case of 
the virus was confirmed in an adjacent county in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in both states announced plans to begin spraying the  
areas on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Connecticut, officials found the virus in mosquitoes trapped  
on a Greenwich golf course. The virus was also found in the brain 
of a dead crow removed from a home in Westport. 
</P>
<P>
	An infected mosquito transmits the virus to humans by first  
biting an infected bird. Encephalitis, an infection of the brain 
and spinal cord, is characterized by high fever, coma and 
convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	It has killed three people in New York City since late August  
and spraying there has been underway since early September. The 
spraying in Greenwich will be conducted by truck-mounted ground 
sprayers using resmithrin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosquitoes will cease to be a threat after the first hard frosts  
of the season.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Oil Co. Finds New Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian oil giant Petrobras has  
discovered new oil reserves in the offshore Santos Basin estimated 
at between 600 million and 700 million barrels, Mines and Energy 
Minister Rodolpho Tourinho announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the field has ``ultralight'' oil, which is considered of  
excellent quality. The field, located off the coast of Rio de 
Janeiro state, is in an area Petrobras has been prospecting since 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as foreign companies are beginning to  
operate in Brazil for the first time after the government ended an 
almost 50-year monopoly held by Petrobras. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said total potential  
reserves are worth $10 billion.

	Taiwan Earthquake Kills 656  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's strongest quake in decades jolted  
the island early Tuesday, killing at least 656 people, wrecking a 
12-story hotel in Taipei and destroying more than 1,000 homes 
islandwide, the government said. Nearly 3,000 people were injured. 
The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 and was centered 90 
miles south-southwest of Taipei, the U.S. Geological Survey's 
National Earthquake Information Center said. It also issued 
warnings of possible tsunamis, or huge waves that sometimes follow 
earthquakes.

	Clinton To Addresses General Assembly  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton can claim a broad  
international consensus on peacekeeping in Kosovo and, now, East 
Timor. But divisions over Iraq and the U.S. refusal to pay its 
debts are complicating his annual U.N. speech. Clinton will have a 
tough time persuading the international body to maintain 
decade-long sanctions on Iraq unless Baghdad agrees to allow U.N. 
weapons inspectors back into the country, U.S. officials concede. 
The president was addressing the 54th General Assembly Tuesday, and 
Iraq was a top agenda item.

	KLA Agrees To Become Civilian Corps  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Kosovo Liberation Army, which  
has long sought to become the military of an independent Kosovo, 
has agreed with NATO-led peacekeepers to disband and be transformed 
into a civilian corps. Under the agreement reached late Monday, the 
KLA will be turned into a 5,000-member Kosovo Protection Corps, 
armed with only a handful of light weapons, under the command of 
the former rebel army's chief, Gen. Agim Ceku. Although many 
question how completely the KLA has disarmed, the deal was a 
victory for the peacekeepers, who have insisted that their force, 
known as KFOR, be the sole armed power in Kosovo, where they are 
seeking to quell ethnic violence and create a pluralist society.

	Israeli Premier To Visit Germany  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The symbolism is strong as Berlin, once the  
seat of Nazi power, welcomes its first state guest as the restored 
capital of Germany: Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. By inviting 
Barak, who arrives Tuesday, Germany aims to show it is aware of the 
fears that some who suffered under the Nazis might feel now that 
the capital has returned to Berlin. Barak has warned that echoes of 
Germany's Nazi past remain amid the country's dramatic changes. 
Germany still has ``elements of extremism and neo-Nazism fermenting 
below the surface of a society in flux,'' Barak said in a recent 
interview in the German newspaper Welt Am Sonntag.

	U.N. Peacekeepers Arrest Two in East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- International peacekeepers assigned to  
bring peace to East Timor arrested two people for carrying weapons 
in Dili, the capital. Australian officials said the two were 
arrested in separate incidents, one on Monday night and the other 
on Tuesday. They say one of those arrested has been linked to 
pro-Indonesian militias, while the other person is being 
questioned. The militias launched a campaign of arson, terror and 
murder, after a majority of East Timorese last month voted for 
independence from Indonesia.

	White Supremacist Convicted in Dragging Death  
</P>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A second white supremacist was convicted  
Monday in the dragging death of a black man. Lawrence Russell 
Brewer, 32, could get the death penalty for murdering James Byrd 
Jr. in the town of Jasper last year. The jury of 11 whites and one 
Hispanic took just four hours to reach a verdict. The jury returned 
immediately to begin hearing testimony on whether Brewer should be 
sentenced to life in prison or death. Testimony in the punishment 
phase was set to continue tomorrow.

	L.A. Mayor To Investigate Police Scandal  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mayor Richard Riordan promised Monday a  
thorough investigation into one of the biggest police scandals in 
city history. The mayor's involvement is the latest development in 
a 17-month police corruption investigation. At the center of the 
probe so far has been Rafael Perez, a former narcotics officer, who 
has told investigators that officers have lied in court, framed 
innocent people, and shot at least one man, then put a gun in his 
hand and arrested him for assault.

	Reds 12, Padres 1

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Denny Neagle pitched two-hit ball for eight  
innings and Greg Vaughn hit his 41st homer as the Cincinnati Reds 
routed the San Diego Padres 12-1 Monday night to pull within 2 1/2 
games of NL Central leader Houston. The Reds moved within 3 1/2 games 
of the idle New York Mets in the wild-card race. Houston lost to 
Pittsburgh 11-5, and the Mets were idle.

<HEADLINE> Love III Ready for Ryder Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- There was never really any doubt that  
Davis Love III would be able to play in his fourth consecutive 
Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to break my arm not to play,'' he said Monday after  
hitting some practice balls at The Country Club. ``If I felt I 
wasn't going to help the team, fine. But I feel fine now. I'm 
actually shocked at how good I feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love was at the PGA Championship in mid-August when he first  
felt a pinched nerve in his neck, a pain that went from his 
shoulder to his back and even caused some numbness in his fingers. 
He played the next two weeks at the Sprint International and the 
NEC Invitational before doctors told him to shut it down 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what he did -- no hunting, no picking up his two children  
and definitely no golf -- for 19 days. He didn't even put up plywood 
on his Sea Island, Ga., home when Hurricane Floyd threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoff led to talk that he would not be ready for the Ryder  
Cup, which begins Friday; alternate Bob Estes even made a special 
trip to this Boston suburb to play a practice round. But Love said 
the time off has served him well, adding that he might even be 
available for two matches a day if his play merits it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more excited about playing than I've ever been before,''  
he said. ``I'm sure my game is not 100 percent. But health-wise, 
I'm 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love, 35, hit balls again for the first time on Friday, starting  
with a 9-iron and slowly working his way through the rest of the 
bag. He planned a practice round today -- his first 18 holes of golf 
since the final round of Firestone almost three weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams have Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to play  
practice rounds before play begins in earnest Friday with the first 
of two days of alternate-shot and best-ball matches. On Sunday, 
there will be a dozen 18-hole singles matches. 
</P>
<P>
	One point is awarded for each victory, and a half-point for a  
draw, with the United States needing 14 1/2 points to win the cup. As 
defending champion, Europe would retain the cup if it ends in a 
14-14 tie. 
</P>
<P>
	A Concorde carrying most of the European team -- some were  
already in town -- arrived at Logan International Airport in Boston 
on Monday. They were greeted by Gov. Paul Cellucci and Lt. Gov. 
Jane Swift, then escorted by state troopers to a waiting bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport workers crowded the scene, first posing with the  
supersonic plane that usually lands in Boston only in emergencies -- 
the last was in 1996 -- then crowding the check-in area for the 
captains' news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	European captain Mark James, with the Cup in tow, launched into  
a diplomatic stump speech that belied the importance of golf's most 
pressure-packed tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we would obviously like to bring the trophy home, or  
retain it, the main purpose is to enjoy the week,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But James' diplomacy had its limits. When the time came for him  
to pose with U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw and the Ryder Cup itself, 
James pulled the trophy away in jest, as if to say that Crenshaw 
would have to win it to touch it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were just fooling around,'' Crenshaw said with a laugh  
later. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said he ``took note'' of the fact that James came in  
with the Cup -- the Europeans won it at Oak Hill in 1995 and 
retained it at Valderrama in '97 -- and got to leave with it as 
well. That left Crenshaw to give his news conference standing next 
to an empty pedestal where the trophy had rested. 
</P>
<P>
	For Crenshaw, it was a stark reminder of the week's goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're the holders,'' he said. ``We're very intent because of  
the last two Ryder Cups. We've got a lot to prove.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Defense Echoes Winning Favor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Payback arrived quickly in the Dallas  
Cowboys locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after being bailed out by the offense, the Dallas defense  
returned the favor Monday night in a 24-7 victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Falcons, the guys who allowed Washington to put up  
504 yards and 35 points in the opener set up 10 of Dallas' first 17 
points with an interception and a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, when they started to slip in the final minutes, giving  
Atlanta at least a glimmer of hope, the defense roared back when 
Greg Ellis returned an interception 87 yards for a game-sealing 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week we were proud of our offense for coming back and  
winning the game,'' Ellis said. ``But we knew we didn't play well 
defensively and we wanted to come out and make a statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas joined Detroit as the NFC's only 2-0 teams. It is the  
best start for the Cowboys since their last Super Bowl season, 
1995, and they get an extra week to savor it as they have a bye 
this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dallas returns Oct. 3 at home against Arizona, the  
secondary could have a new and improved look. Deion Sanders' gimpy 
left big toe will likely be ready for action and there's a decent 
chance Kevin Smith will be ready to test his aching back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys managed three interceptions without them Monday and  
had a Sanders-like 154 yards in returns. Amazingly, Ellis, 
linebacker Dexter Coakley and safety Izell Reese combined for more 
yards than the Dallas offense had on the ground (133) or in the air 
(98). 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys had just 231 yards of offense, less than half the  
541 they gained against the Redskins in a 41-35 overtime victory. 
Then again, they didn't need much as their three scoring drives 
went 4, 60 and 26 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our team has a great sense that it takes everybody to  
win and it's not going to be exactly the same every week,'' Cowboys 
coach Chan Gailey said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offense isn't going to score 41 every week and the defense  
isn't going to get four, five turnovers and score every week. It's 
going to be probably somewhere in between most weeks. So our 
enthusiasm is for the whole team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The damper on the celebration is that Dallas didn't exactly stop  
the same Atlanta offense that represented the NFC in the Super 
Bowl. This unit was without Pro Bowlers Chris Chandler and Jamal 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler suited up but didn't play because of a strained  
hamstring. Anderson tore a ligament in his right knee six minutes 
into the game and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tony Graziani and Danny Kanell trying to fill in for  
Chandler at quarterback and Byron Hanspard replacing Anderson, the 
Falcons gained just 148 yards through three quarters. Atlanta 
crossed Dallas' 49-yard-line only once in that time, and that trip 
ended with a missed field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	A big push from the defensive line was the catalyst for the  
Cowboys. Dallas' five sacks was its most in 24 games, dating to 
November 1997. Chad Hennings had two of them, doubling his 1998 
total, and rookie Peppi Zellner got his first sack on the game's 
final play. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of good pressure without blitzing,'' Gailey  
said. ``I thought we got around the quarterback and made things 
happen with just our front four. That was good to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shutout lasted 56 minutes until a 45-yard touchdown pass  
from Kanell to Tim Dwight. Then the Falcons began making things 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	A 52-yard pass to Terance Mathis that ricocheted off a defensive  
back helped put Atlanta within four yards of making it a 17-14 game 
in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	But after two incompletions into the end zone, Kanell tried  
escaping a beeline attack from Darren Woodson and threw the ball 
into Ellis' facemask. He reacted quick enough to catch it, then 
huffed and puffed 87 yards for his first career touchdown and the 
fifth-longest return in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the quarterback was going to get me,'' Ellis said.  
``Once I got past him, I just kept going. I thought I was going to 
run out of gas at the 20, but I didn't.''

<HEADLINE> New Parties Arrive in Maine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Make room, Maine Democrats and  
Republicans: The Green Independent and Reform parties have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	A state law giving the Greens and Reform parties official status  
took effect over the weekend, although it was overshadowed by a new 
smoking ban in restaurants and scores of other laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``It legitimizes the democratic process of people organizing  
into political parties,'' said Jon Carter, a veteran Green party 
activist. It also shows that the Greens ``are a strong, viable 
growing force in the political arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Reform Party Chairman Wendall Kinney called the change ``a  
good move for democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the new law now on the books, the Green Independent and  
Reform parties will be listed along with the two major parties on 
state income tax forms' donation checkoff boxes, as well as on 
voter registration applications. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Greens and Reform parties get to participate in  
Maine's presidential primaries on March 7, 2000, if they have 
contests, Julie Flynn, a state election official, said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> 'Judging Amy' Makes Strong Debut / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is all smiles over the big audience for its  
new series, ``Judging Amy.'' Meanwhile, it's lights, camera and no 
action at Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS took last week's ratings crown with television viewership  
inching up in anticipation of the new fall season, Nielsen Media 
Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former ``NYPD Blue'' actress Amy Brenneman stars in ``Judging  
Amy'' as a single mother who leaves New York to become a judge in 
Hartford, Conn., living with her mother, portrayed by Tyne Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	Many critics appraised it as a knockoff of NBC's ``Providence,''  
but enough viewers tuned in to a special preview Sunday to make 
``Judging Amy'' the week's most-watched show after ``Monday Night 
Football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS shrewdly debuted the new series in the time slot usually  
filled by ``Touched By an Angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's telecast of the ``Miss America'' pageant finished in 10th  
place for the week. Although its ratings were an all-time low, 
Nielsen estimated 1.3 million more people watched Saturday night's 
competition than the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's big sendoff for ``Action,'' an acclaimed comedy starring  
Jay Mohr as a noxious studio executive, fell flat. Each of the two 
new episodes that aired last Thursday had less than half the 
viewers of a ``Frasier'' rerun that NBC scheduled against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's encore of the ``Action'' premiere on Sunday did even  
worse, attracting fewer viewers than professional wrestling on UPN. 
Fox finished in fourth place last week among adults aged 18-49, an 
ominous sign for a network that sees itself as young and hip. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week, CBS had an 8.0 rating and 14 share. ABC finished  
second with a 7.5 rating and 13 share, helped by football and 
``Miss America.'' NBC had a 7.0 rating and 12 share and Fox was at 
4.8 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB outpointed its mini-network rivals with a 2.6 rating and  
4 share. UPN was at 2.3 and 4 and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``NBC Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with  
a 7.6 rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 7.5 
rating and 16 share. Although it finished third, the ``CBS Evening 
News'' had a particularly strong week at 7.2 and 15, attributing 
its improvement largely to Dan Rather's coverage of Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Sept. 13-19, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were ``NFL Monday Night Football: Miami at Denver,'' 
ABC, 16.1; ``Judging Amy,'' CBS, 13.5; ``NFL Monday Showcase,'' 
ABC, 13.1; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 13.0; ``CBS NFL Coverage,'' CBS, 12.9; 
``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.4; ``Friends,'' NBC, 11.3; ``ER,'' NBC, 
10.9; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Sealed With a Kiss,'' CBS, 10.2; ``Miss 
America Pageant,'' ABC, 10.1.

<HEADLINE> Brown Resurrects Gators' Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida defensive end Alex Brown  
insists he is neither a soothsayer nor a superstar. He looked like 
all that last weekend, predicting the snap count with alarming 
regularity in a five-sack performance against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately, Brown began drawing comparisons to former  
Gator Wilbur Marshall. His 14 tackles and four sacks against 
Southern California in 1982 had ranked as the best defensive 
performance in Florida history. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach after coach and player after player proclaimed that  
Brown's was the best performance by a defensive player they had 
ever seen. And the compliments weren't just coming out of 
Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brown made a couple of plays and I said, `He's going to be the  
next Superman,''' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a man-child,'' said Kentucky coach Hal Mumme, who must  
devise a way to stop Brown on Saturday. ``Tennessee refused to 
block him and he took advantage of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers never kept a running back in to help block the  
6-foot-4, 251-pound sophomore. That, plus Brown's mastery of the 
Tennessee cadence, helped him blow past linemen and into Tee 
Martin's lap seemingly all night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen a guy take over a game or do as much as he did  
in one game,'' running back Earnest Graham said. ``I was amazed. It 
seemed like he was in on every play. He just played from beginning 
to end. I've never seen anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The performance seemed even more impressive considering the  
venom Brown spewed in the week of trash talk leading to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bring the house,'' Brown said in one of his more notable  
statements. ``We're going to hit him and hit him and hit him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He backed that up almost single-handedly. Brown finished with  
seven tackles, two pass deflections, a forced fumble and an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the first quarter, he drew a 15-yard unnecessary  
roughness penalty for knocking Martin's helmet off. It set the tone 
for a memorable night of hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was all just fun and games,'' Brown said of the trash  
talk. ``I try not to put too much pressure on myself. I know that I 
have to go out and give my best. And if I give my best and I only 
get one sack or I only get one tackle, I still did my best. There's 
nothing I can do about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It figures to get more difficult. Brown has eight of his team's  
16 sacks on the season, compared to 7 1/2 by last year's team leader, 
Jevon Kearse, who drew more preseason hype than most players get 
all year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, offenses designed schemes to avoid Kearse. Could  
the same start happening for Brown? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure people will be concerned about him because he made  
big plays,'' defensive coordinator Jon Hoke said. ``If I was an 
offensive person, I'd be a little concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown arrived at Florida after being named Most Valuable Player  
in his district on both defense, as a linebacker, and offense, as a 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew he was good from day one,'' receiver Alex Willis said.  
``A guy that big playing quarterback the way he did -- you know he's 
an athlete. You know he can make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now everybody else does, too.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Closes Down 225.43 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Tuesday, driving the Dow  
Jones industrials down 225 points, as traders grew uneasy about the 
weakening dollar, the growing U.S. trade deficit and upcoming 
earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 225.43 to 10,598.47 after falling as much as 272.03  
during the session. The index's decline, which amounted to 2 
percent, was its biggest one-day point drop since it fell 235.53 on 
May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also dropped sharply. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index fell 27.95 to 1,307.57, and the Nasdaq composite 
index fell 65.05 to 2,821.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the market's big losses, analysts said the selloff was a  
calm one, mostly growing out of the uncertainties raised by recent 
economic news. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no panic selling,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for  
Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. in Milwaukee. ``It has the feel of a market 
that was a little overextended, given the background of 
uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiremaker Goodyear and computer maker Hewlett Packard were the  
biggest losers among the Dow stocks. Goodyear, which reportedly 
expected third-quarter earnings to be disappointing, fell 4 5/8 to 47 
5/16. Hewlett Packard slipped 4 11/16 to 99 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Foremost in many investors' minds was the dollar's continuing  
slide against the Japanese yen. The U.S. currency was quoted at 
about 105 yen Tuesday, down from 106 yen on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A weaker dollar can be inflationary and lead to higher interest  
rates in this country. The rising yen also attracts investors to 
Asian markets and away from U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In this economic climate, investors increasingly worry that the  
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this 
year to combat inflation, a move that would raise borrowing costs 
and erode corporate profits. The Fed's policy-setting Open Market 
Committee meets in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fear of another interest rate hike is clearly weighing  
heavily on the market for now,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment 
officer at BankBoston. He said that anxiety was keeping stocks 
trading within a specific range -- with the Dow shuttling between 
10,500 and 11,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Riley noted that although September is a historically  
bearish month for the market, stocks aren't far from their highs 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Early morning news that the trade deficit ballooned to a monthly  
record of $25.2 billion in July disappointed investors. To many 
economists' surprise, imports rose to an all-time high as consumers 
bought foreign cars and other overseas goods. 
</P>
<P>
	With earnings reports for the current quarter expected within  
the next few weeks, the market was extremely sensitive to any bad 
news about profits. So prices also tumbled in response to Apple 
Computer's announcement late Monday that its earnings for this 
quarter would be hurt by a shortage of chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's shortage was unrelated to the earthquake in Taiwan,  
where many computer chips are made. But the announcement 
disappointed market watchers who had been expecting improved 
profits. The computer maker fell 9 13/16 to 69 1/4, while Motorola -- 
Apple's supplier -- fell 2 13/16 to 87 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan earthquake, meanwhile, led a range of other  
semiconductor stocks to fall. Applied Materials fell 2 1/2 to 81 5/16, 
while Texas Instruments fell 1 5/8 to 86 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-3 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 697 up, 2,362 down and 492 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 970.43 million shares, vs. 698.92 million in  
the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies dropped 6.70 to  
426.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.03 percent.  
Germany's DAX index closed down 1.29 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 
fell 1.64 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.44 percent.

<HEADLINE> Author Accused of Plagiarism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Scottish author accused of plagiarism four  
times before has had his biography of U.S. naval hero John Paul 
Jones put on hold by the publisher, The New York Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I Have Not Yet Begun to Fight: A Life of John Paul Jones'' by  
James Mackay was due for October release by the Atlantic Monthly 
Press of Grove/Atlantic Inc. It is a full-length biography of the 
Scottish-born Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	But the publisher has halted publication to check similarities  
to the last major Jones biography, published in 1959 by the late 
Samuel Eliot Morison, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am holding back distribution and getting an independent  
evaluation,'' Grove/Atlantic president and publisher Morgan 
Entrekin said. About 7,500 freshly printed copies of Mackay's $28 
book have been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Mackay, who has written more than 100 books, denied copying  
Morison's ``John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the two biographies share similar passages in part  
because ``there are only a certain number of words in the English 
language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entrekin acknowledged that before last week he had never talked  
to Mackay (pronounced muhk-EYE) or asked questions about past 
plagiarism allegations. Scholars and other authors have accused 
Mackay of plagiarizing material for four other books since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, another publisher recalled and destroyed thousands  
of copies of a Mackay book because of copyright infringement 
issues.

<HEADLINE> Progress in Canadian Auto Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers union reported progress  
today as a midnight contract deadline neared with Ford Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll either have a settlement here tonight or we'll have a  
shutdown,'' union leader Buzz Hargrove told reporters this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakthrough was an agreement today on pensions, a key union  
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have resolved the pension issue both for current and future  
retirees. This is a major step,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	While he would not disclose details about the pension offer,  
Hargrove said it was ``light years'' ahead of the Ford proposal he 
criticized Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official deadline for a strike, which would affect 13,000  
Ford workers in southern Ontario, was 11:59 p.m. EDT. There's no 
chance of an extension, the union said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said talks would continue at a hotel in downtown  
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite his optimism, the union leader said many tough  
issues remain on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a lot of work to do,'' Hargrove said early  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	George Peterson, president of Los Angeles-based AutoPacific  
Inc., said a strike in Canada could cause Ford Motor Co. plants in 
the United States that build the profitable F-Series pickup trucks 
to shut down because the V-8 engines -- popular in the pickups -- are 
made in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could be catastrophic if Ford runs out of engine  
capacity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The V-8 also is used in Ford Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators.  
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said he couldn't say exactly how long it would take,  
``but it would be a relatively short time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Windstar minivans and Ford Crown Victorias and Mercury  
Grand Marquis sedans also are made in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issues both sides will be concentrating on today is  
the union's demand that Ford draft a letter to nonunionized 
suppliers asking them not to interfere in union organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a key demand for the CAW because the leading U.S.  
automakers continue to shed components operations and the unionized 
jobs that go with them.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows To Help Stricken N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- More rain fell on North Carolina today, a  
dismal and unwelcome sight to Isabelle Baker and other owners of 
more than 30,000 homes damaged from the floods following Hurricane 
Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker did find comfort in the words of President Clinton, who  
said during a visit to Tarboro on Monday that the government would 
stand by those displaced by the deluge through federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a blessing for him to come here,'' said Baker, whose  
home is submerged in nearby Princeville. ``I really believe he will 
get all he can to help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between a half-inch and 1 1/2 inches of rain had fallen before dawn  
today, and forecasters said up to 4 inches were possible from a 
passing cold front and moisture from Tropical Storm Harvey. It 
could cause more flooding in a region that was soaked by 20 inches 
of rain last week as Floyd raised rivers to record levels, 
submerging roads, homes, businesses -- and people. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 people were killed from the Bahamas into New  
England when Floyd charged up the East Coast, and flooding 
continues to plague parts of New Jersey and New York. But the 
aftermath appears worst in North Carolina, where at least 35 people 
have died. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's office said at least 1,600 homes are damaged  
beyond repair. An estimated 1,500 people were still stranded, but 
most were not in life-threatening situations. Some 10,000 are 
already in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary damage figures estimate the price tag for damage at  
$1.3 billion, but it may exceed the $6 billion total for Hurricane 
Fran in 1996, the state's costliest natural disaster in which 24 
people died. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become painfully clear that Hurricane Floyd, combined  
with Hurricane Dennis, is shaping up to be the worst disaster North 
Carolina has ever seen, and I hope we'll ever see again,'' state 
public safety secretary Richard Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people remain unable to return home because of  
floodwaters that have virtually shut down the coastal plain east of 
Raleigh, an area spanning 18,000 square miles and containing 2.1 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton toured Tarboro, one of the hardest hit towns in an area  
drenched by more than 2 feet of rain from two hurricanes in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge you to keep your spirits up and know we're going to be  
with you every step of the way,'' Clinton told several hundred 
people. He announced emergency food stamps and unemployment 
payments for families in need, the hiring of temporary workers for 
the cleanup and low-interest loans for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things like this happen to some of us,'' the president  
said, ``we know they could happen to all of us. ... We know we have 
a responsibility as members of the American family to help you get 
back on your feet again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hunt made a nationwide appeal for donations to a relief  
fund for the state, saying ``we have been hit by a terrible blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials are also grappling with the health menace caused  
by rotting farm animals and sewage washed into the floodwaters. The 
state is seeking incinerators to deal with an estimated 100,000 
hogs, 2.4 million chickens and 500,000 turkeys killed in the 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 95 reopened Monday in North Carolina for the first  
time since Thursday, but about 300 other roads remained closed. 
</P>
<P>
	In northeastern South Carolina, scores of people have fled  
low-lying areas around Conway in anticipation of the worst flooding 
in more than 70 years along the Waccamaw River. The highest water 
is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surely enough to make you age a couple of years,'' Mary  
Roberts said Monday as she waited for some friends with a boat to 
take her back into the flooded Savannah Bluffs area just east of 
Conway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived down here for 40 years and I have never seen the  
water this high,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, workers piled up sandbags to protect sewage pump  
stations, yellow graders shored up a main highway and Gov. Jim 
Hodges asked the president to declare South Carolina a major 
disaster area.

<HEADLINE> Temporary Homes Coming to N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Villages of trailer homes and campers  
sprung up Tuesday for 1,000 families whose homes were swallowed by 
the floodwaters of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	It will still be a few days before the temporary homes open, and  
many weary evacuees welcomed the chance to get out of shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a home. I can call that a home because there's nobody  
but me and my family in one camper,'' said Angela Davis, who has 
been staying with her son, daughter and hundreds of others at 
Tarboro High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North  
Carolina on Thursday with catastrophic effect: 40 confirmed deaths, 
30,000 flooded homes, 10,000 people in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	About 47,000 people remained without power and nearly 300 roads  
remained closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, the storm caused at least 68 deaths from the Bahamas  
to New England. In New Jersey, more than a million did not have 
safe water to drink. 
</P>
<P>
	The early damage estimate of $1.3 billion is expected to soar  
and may well exceed the $6 billion for Hurricane Fran in 1996, the 
state's costliest natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hunt asked people to pitch in with efforts to rebuild  
homes and repair the damage to the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a long and difficult job restoring people and their  
communities to their normal lives,'' Hunt said in a speech 
broadcast statewide. ``But we can do it, we will do it, and we 
won't quit until the job is finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By air and by boat, rescue workers continued to look for anyone  
still stranded in flooded areas Tuesday night, but the state was 
unsure how many people that might be. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tarboro High, home to an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 evacuees,  
people were sleeping on cots in classrooms and the gymnasium. The 
school had no running water. People bathed in shower tents hooked 
up to water tankers. Portable toilets were overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have right now is like a small city,'' said Dave Stone  
of the American Red Cross, the shelter's manager. ``It would be 
nice to have flushable toilets, but that's not in the foreseeable 
future. Thank God we've got power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many people also were without their cars.  
</P>
<P>
	AAA Carolinas motor club estimated that as many as 40,000 to  
50,000 vehicles were damaged by the flooding, many belonging to 
low-income residents without adequate insurance to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural damage was devastating. At least 2.9 million  
poultry and 100,000 hogs drowned. Sewage plants and hog waste 
lagoons were swamped by the fast, brown waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffins, bloated animal carcasses and household goods could be  
seen bobbing in the polluted floodwaters across an 
18,000-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
	Two inches of rain fell Tuesday, delaying efforts to fire up  
incinerators and begin destroying the carcasses to prevent the 
spread of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers also were coping with how to save livestock that  
survived the floodwaters but lacked food and shelter. Drivers were 
trying to get feed to farms, though it took two to three times as 
long as normal to make deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take a real circuitous route to get to them,'' said  
John Pike, director of operations at Goldsboro Milling Co.

<HEADLINE> Belly Dancer Karioka Dies at 78 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Actress Tahiya Karioka, the Arab world's  
most famous belly dancer, has died of a heart attack in a Cairo 
hospital. She was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Karioka, born as Badawiya Mohammed Karim, had been in al-Safa  
Hospital for two weeks, where she was suffering from heart, 
digestive and breathing problems, according to hospital officials 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	She died Monday and was buried later the same day, with Egyptian  
Culture Minister Farouk Hosni leading the funeral procession. 
</P>
<P>
	Karioka, dubbed the ``Queen of Oriental Dancing,'' studied  
dancing as a young girl at Ivanova Belly Dancing School before 
moving to Mohammed Ali Street, Cairo's 1930s and '40s equivalent of 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Karioka's first film was ``Doctor Farahat'' in 1935, directed by  
Togo Mizrahi. Altogether, she performed in some 300 films, plays 
and television soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
	The beautiful and elegant Karioka was the Arab world's Marilyn  
Monroe. She attracted the attention of key figures in Egypt and won 
the admiration of the late King Farouq. 
</P>
<P>
	The outspoken Karioka -- who criticized the military rule of  
Egypt after the 1952 army coup led by Gamal Abdel Nasser -- 
temporarily stopped performing when the new regime accused her of 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Before her death, Palestinian-born writer Edward Said wrote that  
Karioka was not only a belly dancer but an artist who played a role 
in shaping Egypt's modern culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was an important part of Egypt's movie history,'' said  
film director Galal Sharqawi. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her most popular movies was ``Youth of a Woman,'' in  
which she played a landlady who seduces a young, naive peasant 
student. The film was shown at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival and 
won the international directing prize in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	Karioka married 14 times. Among her former husbands were an  
American army officer whom she married during World War II, the 
late actor Rushdi Abaza and famous playwright Fayez Halawa. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by an adopted daughter, Atiyat Allah.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Planning New Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange plans a new stock market  
for emerging companies that will relax conventional listing 
requirements, exchange president Mitsuhide Yamaguchi said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market, set to open in November, will be nicknamed  
``Mothers,'' for ``market of the high-growth and emerging stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will have no profit-history criteria for listing and will  
only require sales figures as evidence of existing business 
operations, Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothers will target ventures whose core operations are in  
emerging industries or are based on new technology, Yamaguchi said. 
Many will probably be computer or biotechnology related. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies will have to report earnings results every quarter,  
Yamaguchi said. Other firms on the Tokyo exchange must report 
results twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
	All Mothers companies to have a market capitalization of $4.7  
million through an initial public offering of at least 1,000 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Listed companies also have to create 300 new shareholders  
through the initial public offering, Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 40 companies have already shown an interest in applying  
for listing on the new market, Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We named the market MOTHERS with hope that it will help the  
growth of emerging companies in a motherly way,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Dying Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A convicted killer who dropped his  
appeals so he would be executed before dying of hepatitis C was put 
to death by injection Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Wayne Smith, 43, killed a Houston special education  
teacher who was moonlighting as a convenience store clerk in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith decided last year to drop his appeals so he wouldn't die  
from his advancing hepatitis C. His liver was failing and he used a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	When a warden asked Smith whether he had a final statement, he  
said, ``No, sir.'' With a tear glistening under his right eye, 
Smith licked his lips, closed his eyes and exhaled twice before 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was the 25th person executed in Texas this year and the  
fourth this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Smith robbed a convenience store where Karen  
Birky, 38, worked so she could buy supplies for her special 
education students. Ms. Birky complied with Smith's demand for 
money before he walked her into the parking lot, shot her in the 
neck and fled. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is thought to have contracted hepatitis through a shared  
heroin needle.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Coach Admits He Blew Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys coach Chan Gailey admitted  
Tuesday that he goofed by not requesting a free kick after a fair 
catch on the final play of the first half against the Atlanta 
Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey said he knew of the rule that gives coaches the option of  
trying an uncontested field goal after any fair catch, but he 
figured that only was possible if there was time remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	So when he saw 0:00 on the clock after punt returner Wane  
McGarity's fair catch at the end of the second quarter Monday 
night, Gailey took his team to the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always cognizant of being able to do it because I've  
always wanted to do it,'' Gailey said. ``I had a chance and I 
missed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The digest of rules in the NFL record and fact book specifically  
addresses no-time situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If time expires while ball is in play and a fair catch is  
awarded, receiving team may choose to extend the period'' with a 
free kick, the book said. ``However, place-kicker may not use 
tee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey already had decided that punter Toby Gowin, who also  
handles kickoffs, would try the field goal if the ball was caught 
in Atlanta territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lined Wane up on the 50 and said, `If you go behind the 50,  
let it go. If you can catch it there or in front of the 50, fair 
catch it so we can have the free kick,''' Gailey said. ``We were 
hoping there would be one second left on the clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity caught the ball at the 47. Gowin routinely puts  
kickoffs into the end zone and even without a tee would have had a 
pretty good shot at sending it through the uprights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys led 10-0 at the time. They ended up winning 24-7, so  
the squandered opportunity only hurt Gailey's pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I forgot you could ask for the free kick after the clock had  
run out,'' Gailey said. ``I should know that. That's my 
responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Bothered by Hoarseness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton continued to struggle  
with hoarseness today, nearly a week after straining his voice 
during his trip to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's voice broke at least twice today as he addressed  
the United Nations General Assembly. He cleared his throat each 
time, freeing up enough vocal power to finish his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who has suffered periodic bouts of hoarseness  
throughout his presidency, said last week that he strained his 
voice during the 20-hour return flight from New Zealand, where he 
participated in an economic summit with Asia-Pacific leaders. He 
spent a lot of time talking during that flight, making calls to 
governors and federal officials dealing with Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not have any voice problems during his visit Monday  
to hurricane-damaged sections of North Carolina.

<P>
	``If you should chance to strike up a conversation with an  
articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one 
of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva (Switzerland), and he is 
wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you 
that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and wants to 
talk to you about a joint venture, then there are four 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence  
officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian 
organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is 
that he may be all three -- and that none of those three 
institutions have any problem with the arrangement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolsey also said corruption and organized crime in Russia is  
one of the most important issues the United States faces because: 
</P>
<P>
	--They have the potential to destabilize the Russian state, which  
has a nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	--There is a real possibility that Russian organized crime groups  
may be, or become, involved in the sale of technology or materials 
for weapons of mass destruction or other modern military 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	--Russian organized crime can use its resources to corrupt  
institutions in the United States.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Urges Steady Production Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A key OPEC subcommittee recommended  
Tuesday that the group's current production levels be maintained 
until at least next March, making it likely that consumers will pay 
more to heat their homes this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's ministerial monitoring subcommittee, meeting one day  
before a gathering of all the OPEC members, backed a continuation 
of production cuts totaling 4.3 million barrels of crude oil a day 
that have been made over the past two years. Those cuts have caused 
fuel prices to surge since February. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the subcommittee appeared solid in its support for  
lower output and higher prices, OPEC's unity showed widening cracks 
amid a three-way fight over the post of OPEC secretary general. 
Iraq unexpectedly named its own candidate, vying against candidates 
from Iran and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	The political fight threatened to weaken the solidarity that the  
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has taken pains to 
build since last March, when along with major non-OPEC producers 
like Russia and Mexico, it made deep production cuts to try to lift 
world oil prices from 12-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The election appeared to preoccupy oil ministers of the  
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ahead of their 
semiannual meeting on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they should be discussing is expanding production because  
the market is overheating and has been for some time,'' said Leo 
Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	In a step timed to coincide with the meeting, Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., sent a letter Tuesday to President Clinton and 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, asking them to sell crude from 
the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve to help relieve surging oil 
prices in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer described OPEC's apparent refusal to increase output as  
``nothing less than economic warfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The OPEC subcommittee, which met Tuesday, included oil ministers  
from Iran, Kuwait and Nigeria along with current OPEC Secretary 
General Rilwanu Lukman. It decided to recommended to all of OPEC's 
members that current quotas should stay in place ``until at least 
March 2000,'' said Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh. 
</P>
<P>
	Zangeneh told reporters the subcommittee also determined that  
group members were more than 90 percent compliant with output cuts 
in August and that compliance in September should be even better. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's apparent resolve to continue pumping less oil bodes  
poorly for consumers, who already are paying higher prices to drive 
their cars and heat their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prices now in the market are normal,'' Iraq's Oil Minister  
Amer Mohammed Rasheed told reporters upon arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan Oil Minister Abdalla Salem El-Badri suggested prices must  
rise even higher before OPEC can boost output. OPEC produces more 
than 26 million barrels of crude each day, at least 35 percent of 
the of the world's total. 
</P>
<P>
	Contracts for U.S. benchmark light sweet crude oil closed  
Tuesday in New York at $24.46 a barrel, more than double the year's 
low price of $11.26, set Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Average retail prices for a gallon of gasoline in the United  
States stood at nearly $1.32 a gallon this month, up from less than 
$1 in February, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	And heating oil prices in the United States are expected to  
average about $1.04 per gallon this winter, up from 80 cents per 
gallon last year, the U.S. government estimated earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``This price (level) is good, we think, for both sides of the  
market,'' Zangeneh said, adding that OPEC needed to see ``a 
considerable drawdown'' in global oil inventories before increasing 
its output. 
</P>
<P>
	But higher prices could prove self-defeating over the longer  
term, by tempting OPEC members and other producers to pump more oil 
in hopes of making more money. This could have the opposite effect, 
increasing supply to the point that prices crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts contend OPEC will have to boost output before next  
March if it is to prevent prices from becoming too volatile. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some time they're going to have to increase production, and  
it's likely they'll do it before the end of the year,'' said Roger 
Diwan, manager of global oil markets for The Petroleum Finance Co., 
a Washington-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC is made up of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, the United  
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Indonesia 
and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> East Carolina Stranded by Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- East Carolina coach Steve Logan and his  
team dreamed they would go bowling this season, just not this soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates (3-0), still stuck in South Carolina's capital  
because of Hurricane Floyd's flood waters, had a peppy 2 1/2-hour 
practice Tuesday as they kept preparing for Saturday's showdown 
with No. 9 Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At night, Logan took the team bowling.  
</P>
<P>
	``A bridge tournament, bowling, croquet, I don't know, we'll  
think up something,'' he said. ``It's a constant deal trying to 
think up something to keep everybody from going stir crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's tentative plans keep them here until Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Then they leave for Raleigh's Carter-Finley Stadium where the  
home game was switched by school officials Monday over worries in 
part that basic needs like clean water and power would not be 
available by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates used South Carolina's indoor practice facility for a  
second straight day because of morning rain. Logan says that has 
put them behind in preparations, especially for punters and 
kickers. The short field also limits individual drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it does is take away your fundamental skills because you  
don't get a chance to polish them,'' Logan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least the Pirates looked sharper. Athletic equipment  
manager Dan Glinski got some practice shirts from the NFL's 
Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina athletic director Mike Hamrick said the school got  
verbal assurances from the NCAA that it could accept such donations 
during its hardships. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us we could do what we had to do,'' he said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The campus is still unfit for students, let alone a football  
team practicing for one of its biggest games this decade, Hamrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't have any water,'' he said. ``My staff is using  
Port-O-Potties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamrick said he talked with South Carolina senior associate  
athletic director John Moore during Saturday night's game -- East 
Carolina defeated the Gamecocks 21-3 -- about his team's plight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know what it was going to be like up there'' in  
Greenville, N.C., Hamrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Hamrick saw the stop-sign high waters and the flooded  
campus apartments, since condemned, where up to two dozen players 
lived and called Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us anything we needed, they would help with,'' Hamrick  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the $250,000 East Carolina got for playing here will be  
eaten up by extra expenses for the stranded team, Hamrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to do what's best for your students and bringing  
them back here was not best,'' he said. ``You can't put a dollar 
amount on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or the exposure lost for an important home game shown on ESPN2.  
The Pirates are 17-8 the past five seasons at Dowdy-Ficklen 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to lose a good recruiting weekend, there's a lot  
of stuff involved,'' Logan said. ``But I'm glad we're playing the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tailback Jamie Wilson said the time away has bonded players,  
maybe a little too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bunch of guys can't stay together too long,'' he said. ``But  
I think it has brought us closer together. We've come to know each 
other a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback David Garrard says players have gotten past worries  
about what's left for them at campus and are practicing hard for 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamrick says that will likely carry the players through  
Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``After they play Miami and return home,'' he said, ``that's  
when reality will set in for them.''

<HEADLINE> Trump Vs. The Buchanan Brigade? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's got the money. He appeals to women -- of  
the supermodel variety at least. And with his moniker splashed in 
gold across sky-high buildings, Donald Trump has the name ID for a 
presidential run. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other corner in this most unlikely of matchups is Pat  
Buchanan, the family values conservative who has made running for 
president something of a moral crusade every four years. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a slugfest worthy of one of Trump's casinos.  
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps we need Don King to moderate?'' said Maurice Carroll,  
a political analyst with the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute. 
``Both of these guys are showmen. They like the attention ... and 
they're both smart. I wouldn't want to get in their way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Buchanan flirts with defecting to the Reform Party to run  
for president, saying he's feeling abandoned by a GOP that's too 
close to the center, Trump has a top aide in Washington researching 
the cost and feasibility of getting on the 29 state and District of 
Columbia ballots that don't have permanent spots for Reform Party 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump has the Reform Party's highest-elected official, Minnesota  
Gov. Jesse Ventura, urging him to run. Buchanan has Republicans 
praying he won't or he may take conservative votes from the GOP to 
the benefit of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, Trump challenged Buchanan's provocative comments  
on Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Third Reich like a 
candidate-in-waiting. Buchanan argues in a new book that Hitler was 
not a direct threat to the United States after 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	But could Trump really be thinking of running for president? He  
may have to work at his populist touch. In his biography ``Trump: 
The Art of the Comeback,'' The Donald describes how he loathes 
shaking hands, because hands are crawling with germs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a bad custom,'' he says in the book.  
</P>
<P>
	He's no fan of the double kiss either.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing so phony,'' he told The New York Times  
recently. ``You usually end up knocking heads or noses. And it's 
disgusting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless,'' he added slyly, ``the woman is attractive.''  
</P>
<P>
	Now picture The Donald working a campaign rope line of your  
average Americans or kissing babies. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's his flamboyant and well-documented personal life.  
Since divorcing Marla Maples, the woman who ended his first 
marriage to Ivana, Trump appears in gossip pages with a rotating 
array of gorgeous models on his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was that infamous New York Post headline quoting  
Ms. Maples, then his girlfriend, trumpeting her trysts with him as 
the ``Best Sex I've Ever Had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's press clippings, in which he rails against abortion,  
homosexuality and premarital sex, are equally controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump characterized a potential match this way on Monday: ``As  
much as I like Pat, it would be nasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said on CNN's ``Crossfire'' on Monday that he  
personally likes Trump. What does bother him is the role money is 
playing in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're becoming a plutocracy,'' Buchanan said. ``You've got  
$200 million, $100 million candidates.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Send Relief Adviser to NY, NJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton dispatched his top  
disaster-relief adviser to flood-stricken New Jersey and New York 
today to make sure that federal assistance after Hurricane Floyd is 
being delivered ``responsibly, efficiently and in adequate 
amounts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after inspecting damage in North Carolina, Clinton said,  
``I know people in New Jersey and New York have also been 
injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke at the Wall Street helipad on his arrival in  
New York to address the United Nations General Assembly. He said 
that James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, would visit New York and New Jersey to inspect the damage 
and ``report back immediately on what more we need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president has issued disaster declarations for both states  
to speed federal relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing all we can at the federal level,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure that the assistance is delivered  
responsibly, efficiently and in adequate amounts,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In difficult times like this, we're reminded that the power of  
the American spirit is even stronger than the power of a hurricane. 
The American people are supporting all those who have been injured 
in this and we will stand by them until they recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Clinton declared a major disaster in Delaware and ordered  
federal aid to boost state and local recovery efforts.

<P>
	Rain spread across wide areas of the East on Tuesday as a cold  
front moved through the region and Tropical Storm Harvey soaked 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey was poorly organized but poured more than 10 inches of  
rain across southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm, born in the Gulf of Mexico, initially was forecast to  
cross central Florida, but it turned southward early Tuesday and 
was expected to cross the southern tip of Florida and the Bahamas 
on its way out into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusted to 53 mph and trees were reported blown down in  
Everglades National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The cold front curved from the lower Mississippi Valley across  
the Tennessee Valley and Appalachians into New England. 
</P>
<P>
	During the afternoon, showers and occasional thunderstorms were  
scattered along the front from Mississippi across Tennessee, 
Kentucky, southern Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, 
Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	A band of showers and a few thunderstorms also stretched along  
the East Coast, with heavy rainfall along the North Carolina shore 
and from Washington to Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, scattered showers developed during the afternoon from  
southern California across southern sections of Arizona and New 
Mexico. 
</P>

	Tuesday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a  
morning low of 23 at West Yellowstone, Mont., to a midday reading

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says U.N. Must Do More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton challenged the United  
Nations and countries in Africa, Asia and elsewhere on Tuesday to 
strengthen their ability to stop mass killings like those in Kosovo 
and East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States ``cannot respond to every humanitarian  
catastrophe in the world,'' he told the General Assembly. ``We 
cannot do everything everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also urged the world body to engage in an all-out battle  
against poverty for the 21st century and to ``assure that weapons 
of mass destruction will never be used on our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us resolve in the bright dawn of this new millennium to  
bring an era in which our desire to create will overwhelm our 
capacity to destroy,'' Clinton told the 188-member body. 
</P>
<P>
	His voice hoarse, apparently from allergies, Clinton coughed and  
cleared his throat as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton suggested the United Nations play an expanded role in  
preventing mass slaughter and dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we are faced with the deliberate organized campaigns to  
murder whole peoples or expel them from their land, the care of 
victims is important, but not enough. We should work to end the 
violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Clinton said, ``we need international forces  
with the training to fill the gap between local police and military 
peacekeepers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our response in every case cannot or should not be the same,''  
he said. ``Sometimes collective military force is both appropriate 
and feasible. Sometimes concerted economic and political pressure 
combined with diplomacy is a better answer, as it was in making 
possible the introduction of forces to East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton touched lightly on two contentious issues: a  
disagreement over Iraq and the failure of the United States to make 
more than $1 billion in delinquent U.N. payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is willing to ease the sanctions only  
if Iraq agrees to allow U.N. weapons inspectors back into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Security Council remains deadlocked. Russia, China and  
France -- each wielding veto powers -- have expressed sympathy with 
Baghdad's call for an immediate easing of the sanctions that have 
been in place since the Persian Gulf War in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearly three hours of talks Monday night, Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright failed to budge Russian Foreign Minister Igor 
Ivanov, said a U.S. official. That clouded the prospect for the 
Security Council adopting a renewal of the inspections that were 
halted in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Clinton: ``Despite all the obstacles Saddam Hussein has  
placed in our path, we must continue to ease the suffering of the 
people of Iraq. At the same time, we cannot allow the government of 
Iraq to flout 40 -- and I say 40 -- successive U.N. Security Council 
resolutions and to rebuild his arsenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also apologized for the U.S. delinquency on back  
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have strongly supported the United States meeting all its  
financial obligations to the United Nations, and I will continue to 
do so,'' he said. ``We will do our very best to succeed this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has pledged to pay the arrears, some dating  
to the 1980s, but has been blocked repeatedly by congressional 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	If a sizable installment isn't made by year's end, the United  
States will lose its vote in the General Assembly. Its Security 
Council vote would not be affected, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tardiness in payments wasn't lost on other members,  
even allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarja Halonen, Finland's foreign minister, told the General  
Assembly the United Nations needs ``a stable financial basis ... 
and unconditional payment of contributions to the U.N. by all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unilateral decisions and actions to the contrary are not  
allowed,'' she said. Finland currently holds the rotating 
presidency of the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed that the world community ``wage an unrelenting  
battle against poverty'' as it enters the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite quantum advances in technology and the globalization of  
the world economy, 1.3 billion people live on less than $1 a day, 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced he would convene a White House conference of public  
health experts, pharmaceutical companies and foundation 
representatives to encourage production of vaccines for developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Other speakers also sounded Clinton's call for more involvement  
in preventing humanitarian catastrophes -- but with a different 
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, suggested the  
international community do more to combat international terrorism, 
which he suggested included ``aggressive separatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community and, first of all, the United  
Nations, should decisively clamp down on any manifestations of 
separatism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow blames recent bombings in Moscow, and an escalation of  
the conflict in Chechnya and neighboring Dagestan, on 
seccessionist-minded Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana's foreign minister, James Victor Gbeho, urged the world  
body ``to do in Africa as much as it has done in other areas,'' 
including the Balkans. He suggested the United Nations was paying 
only lukewarm attention to humanitarian crises there.

<HEADLINE> New Online Auction Site Rivals eBay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- More than 100 companies, including  
Microsoft, Dell Computer and Lycos, have started an online auction 
site that challenges eBay Inc.'s dominance of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	By sharing their auction listings, the FairMarketPlace alliance  
could top 50 million customers per month. Any item put up for bid 
on one site will appear on all sites, except those selling only 
their own products. 
</P>
<P>
	The online auction industry has soared in recent years, led  
primarily by San Jose-based eBay, where 6 million users buy and 
sell everything from Star Wars toys to classic books. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay still had the greater volume of goods when FairMarketPlace  
began Monday. It averages 3.5 million individual items for sale, 
compared to 70,000 on the combined sites of the FairMarketPlace 
members.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Grand Jury to Meet This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The grand jury looking into the killing of  
JonBenet Ramsey is to meet again this week for the first time in 
four months, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which hasn't met since May 25, will meet on Thursday  
and possibly Friday, the Denver Rocky Mountain News said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Laurion, a spokeswoman for the Boulder district  
attorney, wouldn't comment on the report, which was unattributed. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pioneering Colt Brings in $160K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A son of Pioneering brought the top price  
of $160,000 during Tuesday's session of the Keeneland September 
Yearling Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Reed, as agent for Charles Kurtsinger, bought the chestnut  
colt from Iron County Farms Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneering, a son of Mr. Prospector, is a half-brother to  
leading sire Storm Cat. His first foals are yearlings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Second high price of the day was $150,000 paid by Dale Romans,  
as agent, for a bay colt by Silver Ghost. Douglas S. Arnold's Buck 
Pond Farm, as agent, sold the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeneland sold 304 horses for $6,332,800 during Tuesday's  
session. The average was $20,832. During the corresponding session

<HEADLINE> Ala. Athletic Dir. Bockrath Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama athletic director Bob Bockrath  
resigned Tuesday, ending a rocky three-year term with the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama president Andrew Sorensen praised Bockrath for  
developing the school's facilities and for following NCAA rules, 
but said ``from an administrative and leadership standpoint, a 
change was needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finus Gaston, Alabama's senior associate AD, will fill in on an  
interim basis. A national search will be launched to find a 
permanent replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorensen said Bockrath would be assigned other duties until June  
30, 2000. He is expected to take sick leave during part of the time 
to recover from shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Bockrath is out, the focus turns to football coach Mike  
DuBose's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Bockrath, who hired DuBose, chose to punish the coach rather  
than fire him when he admitted lying about a relationship with a 
university employee. The school settled a sexual harassment 
complaint filed by the woman in August and Bockrath cut two years 
off DuBose's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, whose team lost 29-28 to Louisiana Tech on Saturday,  
said Monday he has heard the calls by some for his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't worry about it,'' DuBose said. ``I can't worry  
about it, I can't linger on it. I come to work every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose said he didn't know whether his position was further  
weakened by Bockrath's departure. DuBose, who has a 13-13 career 
record at Alabama, said Monday that he hadn't considered resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this university and if I was 100 percent convinced it  
was the best thing for this university, sure, I would consider 
it,'' he said. ``But I have not considered it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bockrath's departure came just days after university trustees  
formed a committee to oversee athletics in the three-campus Alabama 
system. While trustees said the panel had no direct control, some 
saw the move as stripping Bockrath of his power. 
</P>
<P>
	Bockrath came to Alabama from Texas Tech in June 1996. Within  
six months, Gene Stallings had resigned as football coach and 
Bockrath, following what the fans and alumni were calling for, 
hired DuBose as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	An Ohio native who never played for or coached with former  
Alabama coach Bear Bryant, Bockrath was viewed as an outsider by 
most fans. 
</P>
<P>
	He gained support for the big things -- like hiring the popular  
choices to coach the Crimson Tide's football and basketball teams 
and for moving SEC football games out of Legion Field in 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Bockrath was vilified for little things -- like  
changing the brand of soft drinks sold at Alabama events and for 
not securing enough tickets to last year's Music City Bowl.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank is ready to offer financial  
support to a new government in East Timor as the province moves 
toward independence from Indonesia, Bank President James Wolfensohn 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would be meeting in early October in Washington with

<HEADLINE> WWF Sues Playboy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The World Wrestling Federation wants to get  
Playboy in the ring over some nude photos of former women's 
champion Sable. 
</P>
<P>
	Rena Mero, aka Sable, has twice appeared in Playboy and wants to  
do it again in the Oct. 19 newsstand issue, which isn't mailed to 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the WWF filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to block release of  
the issue and demanding the profits from an appearance Mrs. Mero 
made in Playboy last month. The federation claims it created the 
sex-kitten Sable image. 
</P>
<P>
	Playboy had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mero, who lives in Amelia Beach, Fla., filed a $110 million  
lawsuit against the WWF in June. She accused the federation of 
trying to degrade her with plans for a lesbian story line, exposure 
of her breasts on television and appearances in sexually degrading 
photos. 
</P>
<P>
	She has said she considers it tasteful to pose in Playboy.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mero was stripped of her championship belt in May after  
refusing to go along with the plans.

<HEADLINE> Former Radical Student To Be Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Katherine Ann Power, the '60s radical who went  
underground for two decades after the slaying of a police officer, 
gets out of prison next week after serving six years of an eight- 
to 12-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	For the family of Officer Walter Schroeder, who was gunned down  
on Sept. 22, 1970 -- 29 years ago this week -- while trying to 
prevent a bank robbery, that hardly seems like enough time. But 
there's not much they can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think six years is a fairly light sentence when you're  
talking about circumstances involving the death of somebody,'' said 
Clare Schroeder, one of Schroeder's nine children, and one of 
several who became police officers. But she added: ``It's a fait 
accompli. She's done the maximum amount of time under the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power, then a 20-year-old Brandeis University student, was  
waiting in a getaway car during the robbery, which was intended to 
fund the movement against the Vietnam War. The heist, which netted 
$26,000, went awry when William ``Lefty'' Gilday shot Schroeder in 
the back with a submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilday was captured days later and was convicted of murder and  
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Power fled. She took the alias Alice Metzinger, lived in women's  
communes, gave birth to a son and settled near Corvallis, Ore., 
where she married a bookkeeper, Ronley Duncan, and became known for 
her cooking at a tea and coffee house. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she shared her secret with Duncan, her past ate away at  
her. She hadn't seen her parents since college. After beginning 
therapy for depression, she decided to have a lawyer negotiate for 
her surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, or 23 years after she went underground, Power returned  
to Massachusetts and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, during a parole hearing, she apologized to the  
Schroeder family and dropped her bid for early release. 
</P>
<P>
	With time off for good behavior, she will get out on Oct. 2.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Boston Police Department, whose headquarters building is  
dedicated to Schroeder and his brother, another officer killed in 
the line of duty, officials said it was difficult accepting Power's 
relatively short sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the feelings of the Boston Police Department are she  
didn't serve enough time for what she took from the family and from 
the city,'' said a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Detective Margot Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Under her plea agreement, Power is barred from selling her  
story. She has denied requests for interviews, saying the media 
have focused too much on her and not enough on the Schroeders. 
</P>
<P>
	During Power's time in prison, several people who knew her in  
Oregon wrote the parole board in support of her, including some 
restaurateurs who promised to hire her once she was released. Her 
lawyer, James M. Doyle, said he is not sure what she plans to do 
after she is released. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached at his Oregon home Tuesday morning, Duncan said he did  
not know his wife was about to be released. He declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Power's release comes as another radical who spent years as a  
fugitive, Kathleen Ann Soliah, awaits trial on charges that she 
planted bombs under Los Angeles police cars in 1975. She was 
arrested in June in St. Paul, Minn., where she had settled into a 
comfortable life as Sara Jane Olson, an actress, a doctor's wife 
and a mother of three.

<HEADLINE> Grand Slam Nears Deal With PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- An agreement is near on a deal to keep the PGA  
Grand Slam of Golf in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Some minor details need to be worked out before the deal with  
the PGA of America can be announced, Michael Castillo, head pro at 
the Poipu Bay Resort Golf Club, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't provide details but said the deal would be for several  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament pits the winners of golf's four majors -- The  
Masters, British Open, U.S. Open and PGA Championship -- in a 
two-day competition for $1 million in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural tournament was held on Kauai in 1991, but was  
moved to California for two years because of damage caused by 
Hurricane Iniki in 1992. It returned to Kauai in 1994 and has been 
held there since. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's competitors are PGA champ Tiger Woods, Masters champ  
Jose Maria Olazabal, British Open champ Paul Lawrie and U.S. Open 
champ Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening round will pit Woods against Lawrie and Stewart  
against Olazabal. The matchups are based on the world rankings, 
with Woods seeded first, Stewart second, Olazabal third and Lawrie 
fourth, Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has played in the last three Grand Slams. He won last year  
as an alternate and played in 1997 after winning The Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart played in the first Grand Slam, Olazabal played in 1994  
and Lawrie is making his first appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The format this year again will be match play, which was used  
for the first time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament was moved back one week, to Nov. 23-24, to  
accommodate Woods, who is playing in the World Cup of Golf 
tournament and needs extra time to get to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	The change has caused little disruption for tournament  
organizers, Castillo said, and is worth the effort to ensure Woods 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods' appearance in 1997 brought the tournament its biggest  
crowds and highest television ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1997, when Tiger was here, he had a tremendous impact on  
the event,'' Castillo said. ``The PGA has always done what it 
could'' to bring the four major champions together.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Rest Drag Death Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A psychiatrist testified today that a white  
supremacist convicted in the dragging death of a black man has 
failed to learn from past mistakes and remains a ``substantial 
risk'' to society. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors seeking the death penalty for Lawrence Russell  
Brewer rested their case in the punishment phase of his capital 
murder trial after Dr. Edward Gripon testified today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors, rejecting the defendant's pleadings that he is not a  
racist and did not plan James Byrd Jr.'s death, returned a guilty 
verdict Monday for the June 7, 1998, killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys hope to persuade the jury not to send Brewer,  
32, to join his former fellow prison inmate, 24-year-old John 
William King, on death row. King was convicted in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Gripon testified that, based on Brewer's criminal history and a  
dysfunctional childhood, along with a review of his writings and an 
interview a week ago, ``his life has not been one that's had 
positive aspects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also described Brewer as antisocial and a person who did not  
learn from past mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would run a substantial risk,'' Gripon said. ``Past  
behavior appears to be a significant indicator of future 
behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the guilty verdict Monday, relatives of Byrd hugged law  
enforcement officers outside the courtroom and awaited the penalty 
phase to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever they come up with we will accept that, of course,''  
said Byrd's sister, Mary Verrett. ``I want to see the ultimate 
penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer showed no emotion as the jury of 11 whites and one  
Hispanic found him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they believe Brewer -- along with King and Shawn  
A. Berry, 24, who is awaiting trial -- killed Byrd to promote their 
fledgling white supremacist organization -- the Confederate Knights 
of America -- and initiate Berry into the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, sometimes sobbing, testified last week that he was with  
King and Berry when Byrd, 49, was chained by the ankles to the 
bumper of Berry's pickup and dragged for three miles on June 7, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Brewer, he climbed inside the truck cab, smoked a  
cigarette and didn't realize Berry had chained Byrd to the back of 
the truck until they began driving. Brewer said he was convinced 
Byrd had died earlier when Berry slashed his throat with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	But DNA evidence showed Byrd's blood on the shoes of all three  
men. The jury requested both Berry's and Brewer's shoes during four 
hours of deliberation on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The jurors concluded that Brewer helped kidnap Byrd as well as  
murder him. The panel could have convicted Brewer of the lesser 
charges of non-capital murder, aggravated assault or assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like the death penalty but that's what he deserves,''  
said Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray. ``The just 
punishment for this case and these facts and circumstances is 
death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday's verdict, Brewer's attorneys, Doug Barlow and  
Layne Walker declined to comment outside the courtroom, as has been 
their practice throughout the trial.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks Freeze Russian Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss banks have frozen $16.8 million  
in Russian accounts suspected to be linked to the Bank of New York 
money-laundering case, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Folco Galli, spokesman for the Federal Office for Police  
Affairs, told The Associated Press the banks had reported the 
action as required under a new Swiss law. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1998 law, banks are required to freeze accounts and  
report their action to the Swiss government when they have 
well-founded suspicion of money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Galli said that ``a number of such reports'' had been received  
in the Bank of New York case. 
</P>
<P>
	American investigators reportedly believe that up to $10 billion  
was illegally channeled by the Russian mob through the Bank of New 
York, possibly including loans from the International Monetary 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged, but the case has been described as  
potentially one of the biggest money-laundering affairs ever 
uncovered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Galli said federal authorities had referred ``about a dozen''  
reports of bank accounts to cantonal (state) authorities in Geneva, 
who are conducting the main Swiss investigation into 
money-laundering and corruption from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that the federal office only acted as a relay point  
and that so far the banks had only operated on a basis of 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss authorities have expressed eagerness to help the United  
States in its Bank of New York case as soon as U.S. authorities 
send a request for judicial assistance, but Galli said so far no 
such request had been received. Under international treaties the 
Swiss must receive such a request before they can start 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Devaud, the investigating judge looking into allegations  
of money-laundering in connection with Russian corruption, told The 
Associated Press Tuesday that he had found no direct link between 
the Bank of New York case and a Swiss construction company that had 
carried out work for the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, names of companies which were linked to the Bank  
of New York case had also appeared during the investigation of that 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Last January, Swiss authorities raided the Mabetex construction  
company in Lugano in connection with suspicions that several 
high-ranking Russian officials received ``a great deal of money'' 
for helping the firm get large contracts for renovating the 
Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	A top Kremlin official immediately denied the allegations.  
Behgjet Pacolli, president of Mabetex, also has denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspended Russian prosecutor Yuri Skuratov told The Associated  
Press earlier this month that he had received documents from the 
Swiss suggesting that President Boris Yeltsin and his two daughters 
received kickbacks from Mabetex. 
</P>
<P>
	Last July, Devaud sent out an order to Swiss banks that they  
report any accounts they were holding for 24 Russian individuals, 
including Kremlin property manager Pavel Borodin or his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Devaud also froze a number of bank accounts in connection with  
the order, but he declined to say how many accounts or how much 
money was involved.

<HEADLINE> Milton Bradley Has Game of His Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- What a game from Milton Bradley!  
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal prospect hit a grand slam with two outs in the  
bottom of the ninth inning Monday night, giving Harrisburg a 12-11 
win over Norwich in the deciding Game 5 of the Eastern League 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always dreamed of something like this and I never thought  
it would happen,'' Bradley told WHTM-TV in Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrisburg, the Double-A affiliate of the Expos, won its fourth  
straight championship. Almost a Monopoly, seeing how that had never 
been accomplished in the league's 77 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators scored five runs in the ninth. Bradley, the Expos'  
second-round pick in the 1996 draft, struck out three times before 
hitting his slam on a 3-2 pitch from EL saves leader Joe Lisio -- in 
the rain, no less. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley had a Clue was what coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he had to throw me a strike,'' he said. ``I just sat  
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt, Lisio was Sorry!  
</P>
<P>
	The slam set off a wild scramble -- not a Scrabble -- of happy  
teammates at home plate. And it capped an up-and-down year for 
Bradley, a 21-year-old outfielder who hit .329 with 12 home runs 
and 50 RBIs in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Bradley was suspended for seven games for spitting gum  
at an umpire. The incident occurred after Bradley was ejected for 
triggering a bench-clearing brawl by charging the mound when hit by 
a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bradley's first game back from the penalty, he hurt his left  
knee. He was slowed by injuries for part of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the summer, Bradley played for the United States in the  
Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley delivered several key hits for Harrisburg in the  
postseason. The Senators' last nine games in the playoffs each were 
decided by one run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through a lot of things this year,'' Bradley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 11-7 entering the ninth, Harrisburg loaded the bases  
with no outs. Lisio, who had 33 saves for the New York Yankees' 
Double-A affiliate, relieved and retired Jeremy Ware on a popup and 
struck out Brian Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
	After Jason Camilli hit an RBI single to make it 11-8, Bradley  
homered over the wall in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
	A young fan, Corey Swartzlander, retrieved the ball and Bradley  
signed it in the rain, then gave it back to the boy as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
	The win also provided a fine finish for Harrisburg manager Doug  
Sisson. 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the season, Sisson abruptly quit to become the  
assistant baseball coach at the University of Georgia. But halfway 
on his drive south, he changed his mind and returned to manage the 
Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Turned out not to be such a Trivial Pursuit.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley, expanding on his campaign  
finance reform proposal, suggested Tuesday that special interest 
groups that run political advertisements should pay for their 
opponents to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic presidential candidate said he also supports  
public financing of general elections, free television time for 
candidates 60 days before an election and a ban on unregulated 
contributions to political parties, known as ``soft money''. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that if a special interest group wants to run political  
ads, opposing groups should be given free air time so voters will 
hear more than one voice. Or, the interest group that wants to air 
an ad should have to pay for a response by its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the way to deal with that is to say if you're going to  
buy issue ads, there's got to be equal time for the other side,'' 
he said on New Hampshire Public Radio's ``The Exchange''. ``Or when 
issue ads are on, a 100 percent tax is given to the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, a caller said he was appalled by the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``You are compelling people to support the opposing view,'' said  
a man named Robin from Hanover. ``And you assume there is an 
opposing view, rather than many opposing views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, said the caller made a  
good point but defended the plan as ``simply a way to allow the 
market to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting quickly, Republican National Committee Chairman Jim  
Nicholson called Bradley's proposal ``the silliest notion we've 
heard this campaign season. Essentially, what Bradley is proposing 
is a new speech tax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also said he plans to announce a major health care  
reform plan in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a major effort to cover as many Americans as  
possible,'' he said. ``The issue here is can you do this in a way 
that preserves quality, puts doctors back in charge of 
decision-making, covers a lot more people than now and does so at a 
cost that you can put before the people?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to answer a question about whether the plan is based  
on the current private insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you pull the string in one place with that question, it  
leads to 50 other things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent polls in New Hampshire and New York have shown a tight  
race between Bradley and his only Democratic presidential opponent, 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no expectations about when things would move or when  
they wouldn't,'' Bradley said at a rally at his Manchester 
headquarters. ``Someone came up to me and said, `We have momentum.' 
I said, `No we don't, we have a little traction.'''

<HEADLINE> Jazz Owner: Anderson Won't Be Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah Jazz owner Larry Miller said Tuesday  
the team will not re-sign free agent guard Shandon Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller told KUTV he would have liked Anderson to return to the  
Jazz for the upcoming season, but he will not accept what the team 
can offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have reportedly offered Anderson as much as $3 million.  
Miller said Tuesday that Anderson wants more than Utah would be 
allowed to pay, and more than any other team is willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said Anderson and his agent were the ones to end the  
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Anderson averaged 8.5 points and 2.6 rebounds in  
50 games last season, then averaged 9.5 points and 3.7 rebounds in 
the playoffs as the Jazz were beaten by Portland in the Western 
Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was a second-round draft pick out of Georgia by Utah in  
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz will focus on developing first-round draft pick Quincy  
Lewis and give Jeff Hornaceck more playing time to fill the void, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also pending are contract talks with Hornaceck and John  
Stockton, but both guards usually negotiate directly with Miller 
and both are expected back.

<HEADLINE> Union, Ford Canada Talks Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers union said Tuesday that  
negotiations for a new contract with Ford Motor Co. were going 
well, but that there was still a chance that workers would go on 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very close to an agreement,'' CAW President Buzz  
Hargrove said Tuesday afternoon. ``I'd say we are slightly over 90 
percent ... But there are still issues here that would cause a 
national strike with Ford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year contract between the union and Ford that covers  
13,000 workers expires at midnight Tuesday. As a rule, the union 
does not extend its contracts while negotiations are underway. The 
CAW held a three-week strike against General Motors Corp. during 
the last round of negotiations in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike at Ford plants in Canada could disrupt the supply of  
engines for some of Ford's most profitable vehicles, including 
large F-series pickups and the Lincoln Navigator and Ford 
Expedition sport utility vehicles. Ford also assembles its Windstar 
minivan and Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis sedans in 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks continued Tuesday at a Toronto hotel.  
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said one of the major sticking points was the union's  
demands on work contracted out to suppliers. The CAW has asked Ford 
to tell non-unionized suppliers not to interfere in union drives; 
as automakers have shifted work to parts suppliers, the CAW has 
sought to organize supplier plants. 
</P>
<P>
	If the CAW was able to get such an agreement from Ford, it would  
expect a similar agreement from GM and DaimlerChrysler AG. A 
neutrality promise on plant organizing was reportedly part of a 
tenative agreement reached Thursday between DaimlerChrysler AG and 
the United Auto Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove did say the union and Ford had resolved wage and  
pension issues. While not giving any details, Hargrove said the 
pension agreement was ``light years'' ahead of a Ford proposal he 
criticized Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove had criticized Ford's first wage proposal, including a  
1 percent raise in each year of a three-year contract and a signing 
bonus of $500 for each worker, as shocking. 
</P>
<P>
	The average Canadian line worker at Ford earns a base wage of  
about $16 U.S. dollars an hour, while skilled workers earn $19 at 
current conversion rates. Similar workers in the United States earn 
$20.71 and $24.38 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last round of bargaining with automakers, the union  
won wage increases of two per cent in each year of a three-year 
deal. The UAW's tentative deal with DaimlerChrysler calls for a 3 
percent raise in each year of a four-year deal, plus a $1,350 
signing bonus.

<HEADLINE> Niners' Young Banged Up Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers know the  
blitzes are coming. So far, they haven't been able to handle them, 
and Steve Young is paying the price. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to protect better if he's going to make it through a  
season,'' San Francisco co-offensive line coach Pat Morris said. 
``I think it's the protection scheme as a whole that has got to 
make sure Steve doesn't take that many hits. No quarterback can 
last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who considered retirement after a series of concussions  
in 1996 and 1997, very nearly didn't last through San Francisco's 
28-21 win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He took one hit after another and at the finish was wobbly and  
unsteady, though he pulled himself together to throw a game-tying 
touchdown pass to Terrell Owens in the late going. 
</P>
<P>
	Still body sore Monday, Young was asked if it was among the  
roughest outings he's had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't keep track of that. My mother does,'' said Young, who  
also took a serious pounding from a blitzing Jaguars defense in 
last week's season-opening 41-3 loss at Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't see the game. She was flying to see my sister  
because she had a baby. She called and said, `I missed it.' I'm 
grateful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci was around to see it and he  
said Young can't take too many more games like the one he endured 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, some teams will blitz more than others, but  
pressuring the quarterback with a variety of stunts and 'dogs and 
blitzes is really the sign of the times, so we've got to be able to 
handle it,'' Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got blitzed last year as well. This is nothing new. What's  
a little bit new is Steve got hit 21 times. That hasn't happened to 
us like this before so we've got to be better protecting him and 
doing some of the things that help him in a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During San Francisco's final offensive series, Chris Hewitt  
rushed in on safety blitzes three times, coming in unblocked and 
decking Young each time. He drew a roughing-the-passer call for a 
helmet-to-helmet hit that left the quarterback shaken, but also 
kept the game-tying drive alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Young likened Hewitt's hits to being struck full-force by  
William ``The Rerigerator'' Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	In the locker room afterward, Young had his passing hand  
bandaged, there was a huge knot on his forehead, and his back and 
chest were covered with abrasions from getting knocked down on the 
infield dirt at the stadium the 49ers share with the baseball 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Young said dealing with the physical punishment is part of the  
job and he has one more day to recover this week, since San 
Francisco next plays at Arizona on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you play long enough, if you think about how hard  
you are getting hit, you are not going to win,'' Young said. 
``You've got to get past that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't helped that the 49ers are missing Greg Clark, one of  
the best blocking tight ends in the league who has been sidelined 
by five broken ribs suffered in a preseason game. And right tackle 
Jeremy Newberry has also struggled, failing on several key plays to 
protect the left-handed Young's blind side. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Derrick Deese said the 49ers have to do a better job of  
picking up the blitzes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you can put a stop to it, we'll probably keep seeing  
it,'' Deese said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Gert Takes Aim at Bermuda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) -- Police warned people in low-lying areas  
to evacuate their homes and islanders rushed to stock up on 
emergency supplies against Hurricane Gert, the biggest storm to 
threaten Bermuda in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of tourists fled and an already struggling tourist  
industry began counting the cost, as the storm bore down on the 
archipelago today. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect for Bermuda as forecasters  
warned of high, battering waves and a storm surge of up to 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a threat to Bermuda. ... It's a strong storm,'' said  
Public Safety Minister Paula Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Bermuda suffered major damage from a hurricane was  
in 1987, when Hurricane Emily hit the island, moved offshore, then 
struck again. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT today, Gert's center was about 170 miles southeast  
of Bermuda and moving to north at about 10 mph. This path is 
expected to continue today with a gradual turn to the northeast. 
Top sustained winds are near 110 mph with higher gusts. The storm 
is expected to weaken during the next 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds began picking up Monday afternoon and the Emergency  
Measures Organization told islanders to expect winds up to 85 mph 
when the hurricane is projected to pass within 90 miles southeast 
of the island at 9 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday afternoon, police officers visited at-risk homes and  
warned residents to evacuate to higher ground on the low-lying 
British island, 600 miles east of North Carolina in the Atlantic 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	All over the island of 62,000, people checked storm shutters and  
taped up windows or covered them. Shop owners reported a run on 
emergency supplies. ``Batteries are going like crazy, water's the 
same and so are canned foods,'' said supermarket owner Bill Moniz. 
</P>
<P>
	The international airport was to close Tuesday, but many flights  
were canceled Monday. The airport said that five charter flights 
carrying 1,000 relatives of sailors in the U.S. Sixth Fleet, which 
was to call into Bermuda on Monday, had been canceled. The fleet 
instead was steaming direct to its home port of Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruise ships diverted to other ports in the Caribbean and  
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, Gert had top winds of up to 145 mph, making  
the system the fourth Category 4 storm of the Atlantic hurricane 
season.

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings signed 19-year-old center  
Sean Avery to a three-year contract Tuesday, then reassigned him to 
Kingston of the Ontario Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Avery played last season for Owen Sound and Kingston of the OHL.  
He had 22 goals, 23 assists and 70 penalty minutes in 28 games for 
Owen Sound. With Kingston, Avery had 14 goals, 25 assists and 88 
penalty minutes in 33 games.

<HEADLINE> States May Lose Funds Over Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House drug control director Barry  
McCaffrey says Congress should rethink penalties in an anti-smoking 
law that have jeopardized $37 million in drug treatment dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has notified seven states and the District of  
Columbia that because they haven't sufficiently curtailed underage 
smoking, the law requires 40 percent cuts in 1999 block grants for 
substance abuse and treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
	States that failed to meet target rates for reducing sales of  
tobacco products to minors may appeal the ruling, and if they fail, 
states can choose to pay the penalty from this year's budget or 
have the funds shaved from the budget for fiscal 2000, which begins 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	White House drug control director Barry McCaffrey criticized the  
law as too harsh because he said it may force some drug treatment 
centers to close and ``some heroin addicts might be forced back on 
the streets to return to a criminal life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Named for the late Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., the 1992 law  
requires states to pass laws banning tobacco sales to anyone under 
age 18 and aggressively enforce those laws through random, 
unannounced inspections and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri merchants were supposed to be found to selling tobacco  
to minors fewer than 28 percent of the time last year under random 
checks using decoys at grocers and other retailers. But the state's 
failure rate was 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress passed a law and it is our job to enforce that law,''  
said Mark Weber, spokesman for the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration. ``This program has had tremendous 
success in reducing youth access to tobacco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inspection failures have dropped to 25 percent from a rate of 40  
percent in 1997, Weber said. The rate was at least 60 percent when 
the regulations took effect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll find that everyone is in favor of the goals and what  
the law has accomplished,'' Weber said. ``What you're finding 
disagreement with is the harshness of the penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri stands to lose the most, $9.6 million. Cuts could limit  
services from treatment for pregnant crack addicts to housing for 
addicted kids, said Michael Couty, director of the alcohol and drug 
abuse division of the Missouri Department of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the area of prevention, it would limit the amount of  
dollars available to work with communities to deal with issues of 
selling tobacco to minors, which gets right at the heart of the 
issue,'' Couty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Missouri originally set a 1999 target rate using  
methodology that was recently changed to be more strict, and they 
blamed poor enforcement on inaccurate reporting by local law 
officers whose attention is consumed by an explosion in 
methamphetamine manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	The other states were Delaware, with a $2.2 million penalty;  
Iowa, $5 million; Minnesota, $8.4 million; Oregon, $6 million; 
Rhode Island, $2.4 million; and Wyoming, $980,950. The District of 
Columbia would lose nearly $2 million.

<HEADLINE> Flight Attendants Boot Negotiators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Flight attendants who have rejected a proposed  
contract with American Airlines have also tossed out their 
negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of Professional Flight Attendants on Monday  
created an advisory panel to guide the next round of negotiations 
with the nation's No. 2 carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the union representing 21,000 flight attendants at  
American, said that members had voted down the contract by a 
2 1/2-to-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, in a recorded message left on a hot line for members,  
said its president, Denise Hedges, ``will no longer serve as 
spokesperson for the next APFA negotiating committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hedges, who had served as negotiating committee chairwoman,  
strongly supported the tentative agreement, which was rejected by 
73.2 percent of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unusual for airline contracts to be rejected on the  
first attempt,'' said Ms. Hedges. ``The fact that this tendency was 
repeated on this very strong contract is a clear indication that 
flight attendants want more from their jobs. That is something that 
all airlines, not just American, have to come to grips with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would have included pay raises totaling 15.9  
percent between November 1999 and November 2003. Also in the 
package was a 3 percent signing bonus, extra pay for workers with 
25 years of experience and additional employer contributions to 
workers' 401(k) plans. 
</P>
<P>
	However, opponents said the proposal's annual pay raises were  
too small and profit-sharing would have been eliminated. Also, 
attendants would have worked more hours each month under the 
proposal that required payment in advance for medical coverage in 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The APFA board of directors bypassed their national elected  
leadership to create the five-person advisory committee, which 
includes two former association presidents, Patt Gibbs and Tommie 
Hutto-Blake. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee members discussed the failed vote and a new round of  
negotiations Monday afternoon with the airline's negotiating 
committee, headed by Sue Oliver, vice president of employee 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have tremendous respect for the APFA negotiating committee,  
whose dedication and very hard work resulted in a tentative 
agreement last May, and we wish them well as they return to 
flying,'' American spokeswoman Karen Watson said. ``However, we 
will continue to work with whatever negotiating committee the APFA 
assembles.''

<HEADLINE> Two Big Dairy Cos. Consolidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Suiza Foods Corp. solidified its standing as the  
nation's leading milk processor by acquiring Southern Foods Group, 
which has a stable of well-known brands in the South Central 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would have annual sales of $6 billion and  
distribute such well-known regional dairy brands as Borden, Elsie 
and Meadow Gold in 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``This clearly establishes Suiza as the leader of the fluid-milk  
market, with about a 20 percent market share,'' said analyst 
Romitha Mally of Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition announced Tuesday makes Suiza a national player  
and therefore more attractive to large supermarket chains that want 
to buy goods from suppliers with broad reach, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza is strongest in the Southeast and Southern California, and  
chairman Gregg Engles said the acquisition of Southern will extend 
the company's geographic reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were one of the few big independent producers that we had  
an opportunity to do something with,'' he said. ``It really makes 
us a national dairy company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza was founded in 1993 as a holding company for acquiring  
food and dairy processors and has grown rapidly through 
acquisitions, especially in the Southeast and Southern California, 
to 56 processing plants and 12,400 employees. It has made more than 
30 acquisitions in the past three years, and produces packaged food 
and ice in addition to dairy goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza's main rival, Dean Foods Co. of Franklin Park, Ill., with  
fiscal 1999 sales of nearly $3.8 billion, has also been acquiring 
smaller operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza and Southern, both based in Dallas, will form a joint  
venture to include all domestic milk processing activities of both 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza will own 66.2 percent of the venture, to be called the  
Suiza Fluid Dairy Group, with Southern's partner, Dairy Farmers of 
America Inc., owning the other 33.8 percent. The two recently 
launched similar joint ventures in Southern California and several 
Northeast states. 
</P>
<P>
	No cash will change hands in the deal, said Engles, but each  
company will contribute its assets to the joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Suiza had revenue of $3.3 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Southern, with revenue of nearly $1.2 billion in 1998, has 25  
plants and 5,100 employees. It is concentrated in Texas and 
Oklahoma but serves other markets, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Counting the full-year revenues of operations that Suiza has  
acquired during the past year, the revenue of the combined company 
for the 12 months ended June 30 would be about $6 billion, said 
Suiza's chief financial officer, Barry Fromberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Suiza also announced that its president and chief operating  
officer, G. Irwin Gordon, is leaving the company to pursue other, 
unspecified interests. His duties will be divided among several 
executives at different divisions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of both companies have unanimously approved the  
transaction, which faces a federal antitrust review.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Moore Signs $17.5M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Wide receiver Rob Moore signed a four-year, $17.5  
million contract with the Arizona Cardinals on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, 31, will receive a $5 million signing bonus as part of  
the deal. This year, including the bonus and salary, he gets $8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing means the Cardinals can remove the franchise player  
designation from Moore and use it on another player, such as 
defensive end Simeon Rice, whose contract expires after this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore held out throughout training camp, but reported to the  
team three days before its Sept. 12 season opener at Philadelphia, 
then caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Jake Plummer in that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, he agreed to a one-year deal worth about $3.5  
million with the understanding that his agent, Gary Wichard, and 
the Cardinals would continue to work on a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big thing was Rob didn't want anything to interfere with  
this season,'' Wichard said. ``He said, `Gary, the difference 
between 9-7 and 8-8 could be the playoffs.' We were close, so he 
said, `Let me get in there and play while you guys finish out your 
deal.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, in his 10th NFL season, is 20th on the career receiving  
list with 596 catches for 8,872 yards and 45 touchdowns. Two years 
ago, he led the NFL in yards receiving with a Cardinals record 
1,584. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is nursing a strained hamstring this week, an injury from  
the final play of Sunday's 19-16 loss to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	He is so crucial to Arizona's offense that quarterback Jake  
Plummer uncharacteristically chastised management for failing to 
sign the big-play receiver. Three days later, Moore was with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, Frank Sanders and rookie David Boston give the Cardinals  
a dynamic trio of receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, Rob takes attention away from Frank, and he's  
also a great asset to the new kid,'' Wichard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two players remain locked in a contract dispute with the  
Cardinals: defensive tackle Mark Smith and rookie offensive tackle 
L.J. Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's agent, Gil Thompson, has said his client would report at  
some point. Thompson has lowered Smith's demand to about $700,000, 
but the Cardinals had withdrawn their $500,000 proposal and had 
gone back to their original $325,000 tender offer.

<HEADLINE>  Peacekeepers Move Into East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Tanks, trucks and armored personnel  
carriers rumbled off warships in Dili today as international forces 
took control of East Timor. Jubilant citizens cheered the 
peacekeepers and mocked the demoralized Indonesian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian soldiers took over warehouses pillaged by militia  
gangs and their Indonesian army backers, while other troops 
arrested gang members and stripped them of machetes and homemade 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the early optimism, force commander Maj. Gen. Peter  
Cosgrove cautioned that East Timor will not be under full control 
for some weeks and will remain dangerous until then. He said his 
troops will begin moving outside the capital on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will still be a number of weeks rather than days before we  
are in a position to have a pervasive presence in the province,'' 
Cosgrove said. ``It is too early for us to assert that the security 
situation overall is anything approaching benign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Dili, hundreds of refugees streamed out of the hills where  
they had sought refuge, returning to watch the U.N.-mandated force, 
which began arriving Monday, take control of the burned-out capital 
after the militias' three-week campaign of terror. As an Australian 
navy catamaran pulled into port, some broke into a traditional East 
Timorese dance of welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	With 24 years of iron-fisted Indonesian rule ending, Indonesian  
President B.J. Habibie urged lawmakers in Jakarta today to accept 
East Timor's overwhelming vote for independence in an Aug. 30 
referendum. He said acceptance would help restore Indonesia's 
international image. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Indonesia's highest legislative body still must  
approve the independence vote in a session expected by November. 
Opponents have said the presence of international peacekeepers 
violates national sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have done the best I could,'' Habibie said. ``I have been  
able to prevent Balkanization,'' he added, referring to fears that 
Indonesia could follow Yugoslavia on a path to violent 
disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
	The referendum results sparked a rampage by militiamen, who  
drove out hundreds of thousands of civilians, killed independence 
supporters, burned homes and looted, abetted by Indonesian troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights workers and refugees say hundreds, perhaps  
thousands of people, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Defense Minister Gen. Wiranto said the figure was far  
smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were only 90 victims, not, as outsiders said, thousands  
dead,'' told parliament on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dare, site of a large refugee camp six miles south of Dili,  
people burst into tears of joy as international soldiers in full 
battle gear and a group of United Nations officials drove up in a 
convoy of U.N. vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Viva Timor Leste,'' chanted the crowd, or ``Long live East  
Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between 190,000 to 300,000 people fled into hiding in the  
mountains and other areas during the violence, in addition to 
141,000 who fled to Indonesian-controlled West Timor, according to 
a report by the U.N. Children's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian troops used landing craft to unload trucks, jeeps,  
bulldozers and other heavy equipment from landing craft. Warehouses 
were being stocked with food, medicine and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Several truckloads of independence supporters drove past the  
dwindling number of Indonesian soldiers, jeering and making abusive 
gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted with the U.N. troops. This is the final  
defeat of the Indonesian military in East Timor,'' said Filomena 
Bianco, 34.''Indonesia will have to pay reparations for the loss of 
our hometown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Multinational troops stepped up the pressure on remaining gang  
members in and around Dili. Soldiers manning a roadblock near Dili 
airport halted a taxi with six men and discovered several weapons. 
The men were handcuffed and led away for further questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others were arrested for carrying weapons in Dili in two  
separate incidents this morning and the night before, said Maj. 
George O'Kane. One of the men was carrying documents linking him 
with a militia group, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many militiamen have fled ahead of the peacekeepers' deployment,  
and an Australian military spokesman, Col. Duncan Lewis, said there 
had been ``very little militia action'' since peacekeepers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaos reigned at the Indonesian military headquarters as  
soldiers loaded up furniture and filing cabinets. Most Indonesian 
troops are due to leave in the next several days, leaving behind a 
token force that has been ordered to cooperate with the 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to go home. I'm tired of this place,'' said an  
Indonesian soldier who refused to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the troops in East Timor today were from Australia.  
Others came from Britain, France, New Zealand, the Philippines, 
Thailand and the United States. The U.S. non-combat contingent has 
sent in small reconnaissance teams so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen other countries have pledged personnel or indicated a  
willingness to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 after Portugal left the  
colony it held for 400 years. More than 3,700 Indonesian troops 
died in the first five years, fighting a determined resistance 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor's independence leader, Jose Alexandre ``Xanana''  
Gusmao said in Darwin, Australia, that he would return to his 
homeland soon. In his first comments since international forces 
moved in, Gusmao thanked international leaders and their forces for 
intervening to stop the bloodshed by anti-independence forces.

<HEADLINE> Four Hyundai Executives Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Prosecutors on Tuesday indicted four  
executives of Hyundai, which is South Korea's largest conglomerate, 
on charges of stock price manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Ik-chi, head of Hyundai Securities Co., was accused of  
diverting $178 million in company funds from two other Hyundai 
subsidiaries to raise the stock price of Hyundai Electronics Co. 
last year. Lee is under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other Hyundai executives were indicted on charges of  
collaborating in the scheme, but they were not taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Conviction for stock manipulation is punishable by a prison term  
of up to 10 years or a fine of up to three times the profit gained. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves the largest stock price manipulation scandal  
in South Korean history and has rekindled calls for tougher 
supervision of the nation's giant family-controlled conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged stock price manipulation enabled Hyundai to make at  
least $125 million in profits, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's action brought to five the total number of Hyundai  
executives charged in the scandal. A Hyundai Securities executive, 
Park Chul-jae, was arrested and indicted earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyundai has denied any wrongdoing, saying the money diverted  
from other subsidiaries was legal investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The case received wide attention, partly because Hyundai  
Securities was credited with reviving the nation's depressed stock 
market with the successful launch of a fund in March that has drawn 
$9.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	With $67 billion in assets and $72 billion in annual sales,  
Hyundai is South Korea's largest conglomerate. It builds ships, 
cars, computer chips and a host of other products.

<HEADLINE> Moynihan To Endorse Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan plans to endorse  
Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley on Thursday, giving 
a boost to Bradley's underdog campaign against Vice President Al 
Gore, party officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-rumored endorsement is expected to be delivered in  
Moynihan's home state of New York, said three Democratic officials 
familiar with the plans. They spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore holds a wide lead over Bradley in national polls of  
Democratic voters and has secured endorsement of 109 members of 
Congress, with more expected to be announced this week. Bradley, a 
former New Jersey senator, has been publicly backed by just two 
senators and a congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska  
endorsed Bradley earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of the Moynihan endorsement, Gore's campaign on  
Tuesday announced the endorsements of nine members of the New York 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore's commitment to working families and the things they  
care about will make a difference in New York,'' said Rep. Charles 
Rangel, D-N.Y., in the Gore statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm honored to have the support of these effective leaders and  
to have them as a critical part of our team,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bradley trails in national polls, he has pulled into a  
dead heat with Gore in New Hampshire and New York -- two early 
primary states. Independents and moderate Democrats are siding 
early with Bradley, though some of his positions are more liberal 
than Gore, polls show. 
</P>
<P>
	He has nearly kept pace with Gore's fund-raising efforts.  
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan's endorsement is scheduled to take place as Democrats  
from across the country gather in Washington to hear from Gore and 
Bradley at the Democratic National Committee meeting.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Campaign in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- Responding to recent polls suggesting he  
could face tight primary races with former New Jersey Sen. Bill 
Bradley in neighboring New Hampshire and New York, Vice President 
Al Gore said Tuesday he was ``looking forward to the battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to fight for every vote,'' Gore said as he arrived  
here to attend a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, making stops Tuesday in Massachusetts and New  
Hampshire, downplayed the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no expectations about when things would move or when  
they wouldn't,'' he said. ``Someone came up to me and said, `We 
have momentum.' I said, `No we don't, we have a little traction.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was greeted at Hanscom Air Force Base here by a crowd of  
more than 200 that included servicemen and their families. He had a 
dinner at a restaurant in Newton and then went to a couple of 
private residences in Weston for fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the home of Paul Egerman, Gore met wiht 20 to 30 executives  
of high-technology companies in the Boston area. At the home of 
businessman Steve Belkin, he raised about $250,000, Belkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will we continue to move forward or will we take a right-wing  
U-turn back to the policy that failed miserably?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, meanwhile, fielded questions for about an hour at the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue that's closest to my heart is racial unity, quite  
frankly,'' he told the students, promising to use the president's 
``bully pulpit'' to speak out about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You try to educate white Americans about something I call  
`white skin privilege' that most haven't thought of,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the most pressing issue is ``continuing the economic  
prosperity and having it more broadly shared.''

	1,123 Die in Taiwan Earthquake  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- High-rise apartment buildings were knocked  
off foundations and roads buckled into waves of asphalt when a 
powerful earthquake struck Taiwan today, killing at least 1,123 
people and destroying hundreds of homes. With a preliminary 
magnitude of 7.6, the quake was the strongest to hit Taiwan in a 
decade and was about the same strength as the devastating tremor 
that killed more than 15,000 people in Turkey last month. The 
quake's epicenter was centered 90 miles south of Taipei, the U.S. 
Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center said.

<P>
	HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) -- Police warned people in low-lying areas  
to evacuate their homes and islanders rushed to stock up on 
emergency supplies against Hurricane Gert, the biggest storm to 
threaten Bermuda in a decade. Hundreds of tourists fled and an 
already struggling tourist industry began counting the cost, as the 
storm bore down on the archipelago today. A hurricane warning was 
in effect for Bermuda as forecasters warned of high, battering 
waves and a storm surge of up to 5 feet. At 5 a.m. EDT today, 
Gert's center was about 170 miles southeast of Bermuda and moving 
to north at about 10 mph.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Riding a wave of popularity and facing no serious  
opposition, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was re-elected today as 
head of Japan's ruling party -- a win that ensures him a fresh term 
as the nation's leader. Obuchi won 350 votes, far more than his two 
challengers. Former party Secretary-General Koichi Kato got 113 
votes, while former Construction Minister Taku Yamasaki had 51. 
Whoever leads the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is also prime 
minister because the Liberal Democrats control the majority in both 
houses of Parliament.

confirmed cases of St. Louis encephalitis, plus one ``highly 
probable'' case, have been found among Westchester County

Westchester cases has been fatal, but spraying by helicopter over 
the densely populated southern third of the county is scheduled to

others, police said. An unidentified woman was found dead on the 
bus, her head blown off, while a 36-year-old man and his 6-year-old 
daughter, along with an unidentified younger girl, died at a nearby

took control of East Timor. Jubilant citizens cheered the 
peacekeepers and mocked the demoralized Indonesian troops. 
Australian soldiers took over warehouses pillaged by militia gangs 
and their Indonesian army backers, while other troops arrested 
gangmembers, stripped them of machetes and homemade guns. In Dili, 
hundreds of refugees streamed out of the hills where they had 
sought refuge, returning to watch the U.N.-mandated force take 
control of the charred capital after the militias' three-week 
campaign of terror.

	Clinton To Addresses General Assembly  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton can claim a broad  
international consensus on peacekeeping in Kosovo and, now, East 
Timor. But divisions over Iraq and the U.S. refusal to pay its 
debts are complicating his annual U.N. speech. Clinton will have a 
tough time persuading the international body to maintain 
decade-long sanctions on Iraq unless Baghdad agrees to allow U.N. 
weapons inspectors back into the country, U.S. officials concede. 
The president was addressing the 54th General Assembly today, and 
Iraq was a top agenda item.

<HEADLINE> Desperate Vikings Sign Doleman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Chris Doleman is back in Minnesota,  
and the Vikings are hoping their once stout pass rush isn't far 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings on Tuesday signed the 37-year-old pass rusher who  
had 15 sacks last season with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green said the eight-time Pro Bowl selection will  
initially be used as a pass-rushing right end in the team's nickel 
defense, beginning Sunday at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	But Doleman, who turns 38 next month, admitted he wasn't in  
shape physically after spending the last eight months hitting golf 
balls instead of quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've haven't been doing anything but hitting the driver, the  
sand wedge,'' Doleman said. ``I don't even walk on the golf course, 
I ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings also signed linebacker Corey Miller, whom they cut  
during training camp. Miller, who sat out last season with a neck 
injury, was brought back after Kailee Wong pulled a hamstring 
Sunday, and his replacement, Rob Holmberg, sprained an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said Miller would start at strongside linebacker on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doleman, who got his old No. 56 back from linebacker Pete  
Bercich, who is on injured reserve, and the Vikings started talking 
in August after first-round draft pick Dimitruis Underwood went 
AWOL after one practice. But it took a lingering knee injury to 
defensive end Martin Harrison to bring them together again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's full circle, it's kind of a homecoming,'' Doleman said.  
``It's great to see everybody and it's amazing just how quick the 
names come back to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One player who didn't need any re-introduction was defensive  
lineman John Randle, who's been double-teamed since moving back 
inside after playing end last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1991-93, Randle and Doleman started 38 games together  
and amassed 67 1/2 sacks. Green said Doleman's addition will free up 
Randle to wreak his usual havoc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Johnny can use some help, make the load easier for  
everybody on the defensive line,'' Doleman agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Doleman, who signed a one-year deal for a prorated share of the  
NFL minimum of $400,000, said his motivation to come out of 
retirement wasn't money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is basically a chance to win a Super Bowl,'' he said. ``I  
watched John Elway lift his finger and walk off in the sunset. I 
felt I would like to have that opportunity. You know, 14 years and 
I've never had a chance to win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doleman, the Vikings' first-round draft choice in 1985 out of  
Pittsburgh, was one of the best defensive ends in the game during 
his stint in Minnesota, which lasted until 1993, when he went to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	He is fourth on the career list with 142 1/2 sacks, all but 60 with  
the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the roster for Doleman and Miller, the Vikings  
released fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo, who got into a fight with 
receiver Chris Walsh at a Twin Cities restaurant on Sunday night, 
and defensive back Kevin Devine. 
</P>
<P>
	They also reached an injury settlement with defensive back  
Antonio Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Doleman announced his retirement after the 49ers' 20-18 playoff  
loss to Atlanta in January after finishing the regular season with 
15 sacks, the second highest total in his 14-year career. He had 21 
in 1989 while with Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``His retirement in San Francisco can be considered premature,''  
Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doleman said this would be his final year in the NFL, Super Bowl  
or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Straight one-year deal,'' he said. ``I mean, if it happens,  
it's great. And if it doesn't, I think I aligned myself with the 
best team with the best opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Sewage Sludge Forces EU into Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Alarmed by growing evidence that sewage  
sludge was routinely mixed into livestock fodder, the European 
Commission said Tuesday it will seek to tighten animal foodstuff 
regulations to keep toilet residue and cleaning chemicals out of 
the human food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	European Union Health Commissioner David Byrne will press a  
meeting of the 15 EU farm ministers next Monday to impose a 
stricter definition of what can enter the food chain. Member states 
now interpret the existing legislation differently, allowing for 
loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, the Belgian government confirmed reports that  
toilet and animal waste sludge had been mixed into animal fodder 
for years. Belgian Farm Minister Jaak Gabriels insisted the 
practice was stopped in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission spokeswoman Thea Emmerling said reports on similar  
abuses had come from France, Germany and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure for the EU to tighten controls on animal feed has  
intensified since the outbreak of Britain's ``mad cow'' crisis in 
1996. Belgium's recent scare over cancer-causing dioxin in poultry, 
pigs and other foodstuffs was caused by the contamination of feed 
with motor oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium's sewage sludge report comes at an especially bad time,  
since the nation is still reeling from the dioxin crisis that led 
to a wide range of Belgian food products being pulled from 
supermarkets around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said the dioxin crisis is under control and  
it is working to improve the image of Belgian food. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabriels also said the government would investigate why it took  
so long to curtail the illegal use of such sludge in fodder. 
</P>
<P>
	``These practices that existed in the past will not exist in the  
future,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Buried Radioactive Site Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Back in 1991, the Environmental Protection Agency  
thought the problem at the old Shattuck Chemical Co. plant had been 
laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of digging up the contaminated soil and hauling it away,  
the EPA decided to mix the more than 50,000 cubic yards of 
radioactive dirt with concrete and fly ash and bury it on the spot 
under rock and clay, creating a tomb designed to last hundreds of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that decision may come back to haunt the agency.  
</P>
<P>
	City leaders and residents of the blue-collar neighborhood  
surrounding the Shattuck Superfund Site contend the waste is 
sinking and fear that contamination may have already seeped into 
water supplies. They are demanding the tomb be dug up and shipped 
out of state. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's supposed to last 2,000 years,'' neighborhood resident  
Irma Zimmerman said as she stood, hands on hips, surveying the 
unmarked chain-link fence surrounding the 10-foot mound of rocks 
that stretches nearly two blocks. ``But if it can't make it through 
one or two years, I don't know what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say photos and videotape of the ``hot rocks'' -- as Ms.  
Zimmerman calls them -- show that they are sinking. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA's ombudsman has launched an investigation to determine  
if the buried waste really is settling and whether it poses a 
health risk to the neighborhood, which is about four miles from 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	In its preliminary findings, an independent firm, S. Cohen &AMP;  
Associates of McLean, Va., found no immediate threat but said the 
EPA failed to address long-term effects, the extent of groundwater 
contamination and possible runoff into the nearby South Platte 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major concern here is the protection of the citizens of  
Denver and the people around the site, not just in the near term, 
but also in the long term,'' said Assistant EPA Administrator Tim 
Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields said he expects to decide by November what to do about he  
waste. ``It's clear to me right now, at a minimum, some changes are 
going to have to be made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From the early 1920s to 1984, Shattuck operated a plant at the  
site, processing uranium, radium, molybdenum and rhenium for such 
things as X-ray equipment and glow-in-the-dark clocks and gauges. 
The soil and groundwater became contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA and state health officials initially proposed shipping the  
waste out of state but decided the best plan was to bury it on the 
site. The decision has been criticized ever since by residents and 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not at all confident we know what's at the site,'' said  
Celia VanDerLoop, a city environmental health supervisor. The city 
of Denver has filed notice of its intent to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some neighbors believe the waste was buried rather than removed  
because it is a working-class neighborhood, home to modest 
bungalows and such businesses as lumber yards and auto repair 
shops. That allegation is part of the EPA investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the EPA and Shattuck said the decision to bury  
the waste on the spot came down to cost and to uncertainty about 
the ability of the company that was managing the only place the 
waste could have been shipped, a waste dump in Utah. Federal law 
also gave preference to onsite solutions, said Rebecca Thomas, 
former EPA project manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Shattuck officials will not object to waste removal; they just  
do not want to pay for it, said attorney John Faught. Shattuck paid 
more than $26 million for the cleanup. Removing the waste would 
have cost $46 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation itself has been fraught with controversy. EPA  
employees have refused to cooperate unless the interviews are 
off-the record. And Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., held up Fields' 
appointment until the agency agreed to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Allard wants EPA executives to promise to release all documents  
on Shattuck and to make staffers available for on-the-record 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is it they're reluctant to share that information?'' asked  
Allard, who hasn't taken a position on what should be done with the 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Kaufman, the ombudsman's chief investigator on Shattuck,  
said: ``The office has always had access to EPA personnel for 
on-the-record interviews. It's the first time it's been stonewalled 
by a regional office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EPA Regional Administrator Bill Yellowtail has said some  
information must remain confidential because of pending lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, EPA officials in Denver released some previously  
secret records, including one showing the agency's 
radiation-control expert believed burying the waste was the wrong 
choice.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Continued Russia Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration told Congress today  
that the United States must continue to support Russia or risk 
being branded as ``scapegoats'' for Russia's failure. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the wake of what may be the biggest money-laundering  
scheme in U.S. history, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said 
the administration will propose to strengthen laws and make it 
tougher for foreigners to clean ill-gotten gains through American 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers was the leadoff witness as Congress opened the first of  
a series of inquiries into allegations that Russian gangsters 
illegally channeled billions of dollars through the Bank of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration backs continued support for Russia in spite  
of these allegations because ``to quarantine, contain or write off 
Russia as too corrupt would ill serve our national interest,'' 
Summers told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Acting on that view would limit our ability to support Russian  
economic and financial stability; it would inhibit our ability to 
promote democratization and it would raise the risk that the United 
States and the West would be labeled as scapegoats for Russia's 
failure to address its problems,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of speculation, a top Russian intelligence official  
said Monday that U.S. investigators have material suggesting 
Russian businesses laundered money through the big American bank. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the alleged scheme, which became  
public in news reports on Aug. 19. U.S. investigators have not 
commented publicly on the case, in which as much as $10 billion 
allegedly was funneled through the Bank of New York, the 
15th-largest U.S. bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-level executives of the bank's Eastern European  
division, Natasha Kagalovsky and Lucy Edwards, were suspended, and 
Ms. Edwards was subsequently fired for alleged falsification of 
bank records and failure to cooperate with internal investigators. 
The two have denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has become a political flashpoint between Washington  
and Moscow and prompted Republican leaders to denounce the Clinton 
administration's policy of supporting aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summers stressed to lawmakers today that the administration  
must weigh the need to remain engaged with Russia, with its huge 
arsenal of nuclear weapons, while demanding reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the International Monetary Fund, at U.S. urging, has  
already acted to make sure the billions in loans provided by the 
West are used for legitimate purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that Russia's current $4.8 billion loan program is  
being provided in such a way that Russia can use the money only to 
pay back previous IMF loans. None of the money will be disbursed 
unless the IMF is satisfied that the Russian central bank has put 
in place adequate controls on foreign assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said that Thursday the administration will release a  
number of proposals to bolster international cooperation in 
investigating money laundering and strengthen U.S. enforcement 
through tighter regulation of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The report will call for Congress to make money-laundering laws  
applicable to a broad range of international criminals, including 
corrupt foreign officials, Summers said. The administration 
proposal will also broaden the requirements for filing 
suspicious-activity reports to cover not only banks but also money 
service businesses, security brokers and casinos, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Park Back on NFL's List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The idea of building a stadium for an NFL  
team at Hollywood Park, raised by the Raiders several years ago, is 
back on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, oil billionaire Marvin Davis is trying to convince  
the league that a suitable stadium for an expansion team can be 
built adjacent to the race track in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston is considered the favorite to get the NFL's 32nd team,  
with three contenders from the LA area: 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and his Hollywood Park plan; a proposal by Eli Broad and  
Ed Roski to return a team to the Los Angeles Coliseum; and 
Hollywood dealmaker Michael Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue met with Davis on Monday night  
in San Francisco, league spokesman Greg Aiello said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's deadline for dealing exclusively with groups in Los  
Angeles passed last Wednesday. However, NFL officials, who resumed 
talks with Houston, also have continued to speak with the LA 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 74, faces a decision later this week. The option he holds  
on approximately 100 acres of land at Hollywood Park expires Friday 
unless he makes another $250,000 payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's expansion committee plans to discuss possibilities for  
the new franchise at its Oct. 5 meeting in Atlanta. The league's 
full membership begins meetings Oct. 6, and Tagliabue has said he 
hopes a decision on the expansion franchise will be made then. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, and his sons, Gregg and John, reportedly met last week  
with John Elway. The Los Angeles Times reported there had been 
preliminary talks with Elway's representatives about the 
possibility of giving the former Denver Broncos quarterback a 10 
percent stake in the team in exchange for his becoming team 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	The price tag for a stadium at Hollywood Park and the league's  
franchise fee could combine to top $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has expressed interest in professional teams before, among  
them the Broncos, the Dallas Cowboys and the Oakland A's, without 
consummating a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Raiders owner Al Davis and Hollywood Park owner R.D. Hubbard  
approached the league about building a stadium more than five years 
ago. The Raiders left the Los Angeles Coliseum to return to Oakland 
following the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard sold the horse race track to Churchill Downs this year.

<HEADLINE> Resistant Strain of HIV on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Highly drug-resistant strains of the AIDS virus  
are on the rise, showing up in as many as 4.5 percent of newly 
infected patients, according to two new studies published today. 
</P>
<P>
	The studies in today's Journal of the American Medical  
Association involve mostly gay white men. Resistance, however, may 
be more prevalent in other groups, such as drug users and their sex 
partners, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Resistance is slowly increasing,'' said Dr. Roger Pomerantz,  
an expert not involved with either study, ``If you were looking at 
this five years ago, you would see zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 40,000 new HIV infections occur yearly in the United  
States. In recent years, powerful drug cocktails have subdued the 
virus to undetectable levels in many patients. But studies have 
found the virus persists or comes roaring back in 10 percent to 50 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The complicated drug regimen has proved difficult to adhere to,  
and many patients who missed doses or quit taking their medicines 
developed drug-resistant infections that are now being passed along 
to others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't that surprised. This is what happens in infectious  
disease,'' said Pomerantz, director of the Center for Human 
Virology at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	HIV is still so new that scientists disagree about even how to  
define resistance. And since both studies used laboratory tests, no 
one really knows how the definitions will translate into patient 
care. Giving high doses of a drug may be enough to overwhelm a 
virus' resistance, Pomerantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one study, researchers at the University of California at San  
Diego defined resistance as a 10-fold increase in HIV's ability to 
withstand a drug when compared with a laboratory strain. That 
study, led by Dr. Susan Little, tested 141 patients -- in San Diego, 
Los Angeles, Dallas, Denver and Boston -- and found that three (2 
percent) had HIV with at least 10-fold greater resistance to one or 
more drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 36 patients (26 percent) had HIV that was 2.5 to  
10 times more resistant. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other study, researchers at Rockefeller University in New  
York defined resistance as a threefold increase in HIV's ability to 
withstand a drug. That study, led by Dr. Daniel Boden of the Aaron 
Diamond AIDS Research Center, tested 80 subjects in New York and 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 67 in whom resistance could be tested, three (4.5 percent)  
had HIV that was highly resistant -- fivefold resistant -- to 
multiple drugs. The subjects were among 18 (26.8 percent) with HIV 
that was at least threefold resistant to at least one drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing every newly infected patient for drug resistance would  
be impractical because the tests cost several thousand dollars and 
are difficult to interpret, Pomerantz said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if a patient takes a drug cocktail faithfully and it isn't  
working, testing should be considered to see how the combination of 
medicines might be reformulated, he said.

<HEADLINE> Uranium Workers Detail Safety Flaws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- At times, it sounded as if Stephen King had  
written some of the testimony during a U.S. Senate field hearing 
into allegations of wrongdoing at a federally owned 
uranium-processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Tales of radioactive salt on lunch tables, burying truckloads of  
uranium shavings as they ignited and burned and tossing 
contaminated barrels into ponds emerged from the hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time after time, we were put at risk, lied to and made to feel  
that we were safe,'' Phillip Foley, a 24-year worker at the plant, 
told the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley testified during the first of several planned hearings  
into the operation of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The 
plant uses gaseous diffusion to enrich uranium for use as fuel in 
nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Energy owns the plant and oversees a  
costly environmental cleanup of the site. The agency is 
investigating why workers were unwittingly exposed to plutonium and 
other highly toxic and radioactive substances and whether 
contractors who operated the plant covered it up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported today that managers at the Paducah  
plant for decades knew of the radiation hazards inside the complex, 
but failed to warn workers for fear of a public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper cited old memos from the 1960s found in government  
archives. The documents had been turned over to a House Commerce 
subcommittee that is holding a hearing Wednesday on working 
conditions at the Paducah plant during the Cold War years. 
</P>
<P>
	In one 1960 memo, a government physician wrote that hundreds of  
workers should be screened for exposure to radiation from plutonium 
and neptunium, but the warning was ignored, the Post said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley, who is now an electrician, said when he first started  
working at the plant, he would dispose of contaminated barrels by 
tossing them into ponds that are scattered throughout the 
3,600-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
	He also testified that retirees often told him of wiping ``green  
salt'' off the lunch tables in two buildings. The substance 
actually was depleted uranium hexafluoride, a radioactive byproduct 
of the enrichment process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think probably the most overpowering feeling my fellow  
workers and retirees share is uncertainty and apprehension about 
how they might be affected by chemical and radiation exposures at 
the plant,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear stories and fears about everything from cataracts to  
cancers to heart disease and emphysema.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Naas, a heavy equipment operator who has worked at the  
plant for 25 years, said he used to bury truckloads of uranium 
chips and shavings. 
</P>
<P>
	When his co-workers dumped the uranium for him to cover with  
earth, the material would spark and burn because it spontaneously 
ignites when exposed to air. 
</P>
<P>
	Naas also remembered being taken off a job in 1974 because he  
was told he was ``hot.'' Hourly workers assumed it meant they had 
been exposed to a certain level of radiation, but management never 
explained what it meant. 
</P>
<P>
	Naas said his father turned up ``hot'' on several occasions  
during the 20 years he worked at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today he has a form of terminal cancer -- lymphoma. We will  
never know what was the cause,'' Naas said. ``My question is: Will 
I turn up the same, and what recourse will I have at that point in 
time?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced last week that he  
will ask Congress to expand the pilot medical-monitoring program 
for former plant workers. Richardson wants 600 more ex-workers in 
the program, bringing the total to 1,000, and to add 900 current 
workers.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Coach Says He Made Evans Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska coach Frank Solich said Tuesday  
that he made the final decision not to allow former running back 
DeAngelo Evans to return to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, who quit the team after a frustrating start, had a change  
of heart last week and went to Solich asking for a second chance 
with the Cornhuskers, Evans said Tuesday from his parents' home in 
Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Solich spoke to his coaching staff and players, and concluded  
Evans' initial choice to leave the team should stand. He would not 
say why. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can ever not take into consideration  
certainly the team's feelings, so you try to get a pulse on where 
everything is,'' Solich said. ``I'm not saying anything about the 
matter in terms of a decision other than when it came down to a 
final decision, as to who was going to make that decision, it was 
going to be me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solich said he wanted to concentrate on the sixth-ranked  
Cornhuskers' Big 12 opener Saturday at Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, who had a promising freshman season in 1996 but missed  
all of the following season and much of last year with injuries, 
said he was frustrated after having just 19 carries in blowout wins 
over Iowa and California. He gained 74 yards before abruptly 
quitting after the Cal game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left the team because I didn't feel like I was being used in  
the offense way I should have been,'' Evans said. ``It was a heat 
of the moment kind of decision. I felt like I made a mistake and 
wanted to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said he met with Solich on Monday and was informed his  
Nebraska career was finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I wasn't able to come back because he didn't want  
me to come back. He said the team didn't want me to come back,'' 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solich has refused to get into the specifics regarding  
conversations he has held with Evans after he quit the team. He 
said Tuesday that the Evans situation caused some distraction last 
week as the Huskers' prepared for Southern Mississippi, which they 
held off 20-13 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was difficult to prepare the way you wanted to prepare last  
week,'' Solich said. ``I am ready to move forward. I know our 
football team has told me and our staff that they were ready to 
move forward and that's what we're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solich did not want to comment further on Evans.  
</P>
<P>
	Evans said he was somewhat relieved to get away from Solich, in  
his second year since taking over as coach for Tom Osborne, but 
still wanted to finish his college career at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	``The program I was playing for and the program I signed with  
were different,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans had Nebraska fans feeling optimistic as a recruit out of  
Collegiate High School, where the 5-foot-10 215-pounder topped many 
of fellow Wichita native Barry Sanders' rushing records. 
</P>
<P>
	As a freshman Evans rushed for 776 yards. In 1997 a pelvic  
injury sidelined him for the season and last year he played in just 
three games after having preseason knee surgery. He finished with 
227 yards on 38 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans' former teammates said there were mixed feelings among the  
Huskers on whether or not Evans should be allowed back on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Eric Crouch, who was rumored to have quit the team  
when Bobby Newcombe was named the starter before the season opener, 
said the only similarity between his situation and Evans' was 
frustration over his role in the offense. Crouch has maintained he 
never quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never needed a second chance. With DeAngelo, I think he quit  
and decided that maybe that's not what he wanted to do so he wanted 
to come back,'' Crouch said. ``It's a tough situation with 
DeAngelo, but the team's going to try to put it behind us and move 
on. That's about the only thing we can do right now.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Tries To Wash Away Floyd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- The smell of disinfectant and furniture  
polish wafted through the air as residents of central New Jersey 
tried to scrub away the mud-strewn legacy of Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Sections of Manville looked as if a tornado -- not floodwaters --  
had sucked furniture, carpet and books from their homes, depositing 
them along sidewalks in piles 8 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is incredible,'' Cheryl Volker, 42, said as she sorted  
through belongings that had bobbed about for days in her temporary 
indoor pool -- her living room. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd dumped so much water on central New Jersey that more than  
a million residents were likely have to endure a fifth day today 
without safe water to drink. Floodwaters have swamped a water 
treatment plant in Bridgewater that wasn't expected to have water 
pressure or pumping equipment. Officials fretted about fire 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain fell again today in central and northern New Jersey, with  
as much as an inch expected by evening. The National Weather 
Service issued a flash flood watch for the area but said the threat 
of additional flooding was confined mainly to small streams and 
creeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Other flash flood watches were posted today in southeast  
Pennsylvania, northern Delaware and extreme northeast Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the relatively light rainfall unsettled some New Jersey  
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern New Jersey town of Lodi, residents were wary.  
Floodwaters 5 feet deep ruined the finished basement of Gouid and 
Yatna Vakharia's home on Garibaldi Avenue last Friday. This morning 
was the first time water wasn't coming up through the basement 
floor, Yatna Vakharia said. But then it began to rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scared because of structural damage,'' she said. ``I don't  
want this house to fall down because this is all we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even an inch is worrisome. It doesn't make me feel too good,''  
Alan Blitzer of Bound Brook said of today's rain. 
</P>
<P>
	But in general across the Northeast, the flooding produced by  
Floyd had receded Monday, revealing the storm's long-term legacy of 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
	Christina Hussein said she is ready to take her children to a  
hotel. ``We have no clean clothes left,'' she said while picking up 
free bottled water at an Edison distribution site. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks in northeastern Virginia were also worried about clothes.  
Hard-hit residents of Franklin, 50 miles southeast of Richmond, 
sifted through boxes of the Red Cross' colorful shirts and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 people attending a community meeting in the  
school auditorium heard local and state officials assure them that 
everything was being done to provide relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, little can be done until the Blackwater River entirely  
recedes, Mayor Jim Councill said. The water dropped a couple of 
feet Monday but isn't expected to completely fall until the 
downstream Nottoway River also drops. 
</P>
<P>
	None of Franklin's 8,700 residents would predict when they might  
get a good look at the damage. Up to 2 more inches of rain were 
expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the suburbs of New York City groaned at the news  
that more rain was headed toward the waterlogged Northeast -- and 
then began stacking sandbags. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's teeth are on edge about rain,'' said Paul Shew,  
village manager in Ossining, N.Y., where the storm did some of its 
worst local damage. ``We're all preparing for the next storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at the Sharon Saving's Bank in Darby, Pa., were just  
trying to recover from Floyd. They returned and found tables and 
desks that had floated from room to room in 5 feet of water. A 
thick layer of mud covered the office's two-week old copy machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found Friday's payroll sitting intact on top of my desk,''  
said Shirley Martin, a network administrator. ``We just came in to 
see what was salvageable. There's not much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Tittle, director of New Jersey's Sierra Club, said  
overdevelopment in flood plains across the Northeast has been the 
chief reason why losses from Floyd have been so high. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a flood, everyone blames nature and says it's an act of  
God but it's not,'' he said. ``Flooding is an act of man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Manville, it took four National Guardsmen to lift Joe  
Bonsignore's antique breakfront into a garbage truck, which 
crumpled it into wooden planks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be upset, there's nothing I can do,'' he said. ``But,  
you got to remember, this isn't garbage. This is people's lives.''

	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The director of New Jersey's Alcoholic  
Beverage Control division has quit after being arrested for drunken 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	John G. Holl, 47, was arrested on a charge of driving while

<HEADLINE> ABC's Compton Headed to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Another veteran ABC White House correspondent is  
taking the plunge into cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Compton, who has covered the White House for ABC News since  
the Ford administration, was appointed chief Washington 
correspondent on Tuesday at ABCNEWS.com, the network's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	She will deliver live and taped reports over the Internet, as  
well as occasional pieces for the TV network. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of a changing of the guard at the White House for ABC.  
The network said last week that Sam Donaldson is leaving the beat 
to anchor his own Web cast three times per week from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cochran is the new lead White House correspondent for ABC,  
joined by Terry Moran and Andrea McCarren. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton said she's thrilled by the change, which means no longer  
having to get up at 4 a.m. to prepare live reports on ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're kind of paving the way for what might be the future of a  
lot of broadcasting going from the television screen to 
computers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the first woman appointed a full-time White House  
correspondent by a network when she started, at age 27, covering 
President Ford in December 1974. She has also reported on 
presidential campaigns and covered Congress during President 
Reagan's second term. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988 and 1992, she was a panelist on the presidential  
campaign debates. 
</P>
<P>
	For Cochran, it's the second network he's served as lead White  
House correspondent. He had the job at NBC from 1988-93 before 
joining ABC as a Capitol Hill reporter. He will report primarily 
for ``World News Tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moran, who's been covering the Supreme Court, will take over  
Compton's role on ``Good Morning America'' and also report for 
other ABC broadcasts. McCarren has been a Washington correspondent 
for NewsOne, ABC's affiliate news service. She'll be the primary 
weekend White House correspondent.

<HEADLINE> Fires Force Evacuations in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A Benedictine monastery with stunning views  
of the Pacific Ocean was mostly empty today as wildfires raced 
through the scenic Big Sur and chased away as many as 250 monks and 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames also approached a Zen Buddhist center.  
</P>
<P>
	However, fire officials reported today that a cooling trend had  
helped in the fight against the fires in the scenic region, said 
fire spokeswoman Dena Chavez. ``We've had a better relative 
humidity for the past two days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fires had burned about 28,000 acres in the Los Padres  
National Park. In all, lightning-caused fires had burned more than 
72,000 acres of Northern California forest. 
</P>
<P>
	A mandatory evacuation order was issued Monday for the monks at  
the New Camaldoli Hermitage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in no immediate danger but they tell us it's better to  
keep moving,'' said a message left on the monks' answering machine 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the nonessential personnel are leaving; a few monks are  
remaining behind,'' the message said. ``God bless you. Pray for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the 10 monks who stayed behind, the Rev. Romuald Duscher,  
said today he could smell the smoke. ``But it's not hazy and the 
winds are calm,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The monastery, perched 1,300 feet above the Pacific Ocean about  
140 miles south of San Francisco, is popular with visitors seeking 
solitary contemplation. Rooms are available for rent by the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Reachable only by a narrow, twisting road from the coastal  
highway, it also houses 30 to 40 monks, who take vows of silence 
and support their contemplative life by selling fruitcakes over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Big Sur, a fire burned to within a mile of  
Tassajara Hot Springs, a center for Zen Buddhists. Residents were 
advised to either leave or be ready to leave in a hurry. It is the 
off-season for tourists, so only a few people remained Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 210 miles north of San Francisco, some 47,500 acres had  
burned in the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area, the largest active fire 
in the nation, fire spokeswoman Rosemary Hardin said.

<HEADLINE> Teens Charged With Violent Plots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Three teen-agers charged with plotting  
a massacre at their middle school were freed from custody Tuesday 
under a rule restricting their pretrial confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Clair County Judge James P. Adair ordered the boys released.  
Prosecutor Elwood Dowd said a state court rule bars juveniles 
awaiting trial as adults from being held for more than 91 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys are charged with conspiracy to commit murder,  
punishable by life in prison. Justin Schnepp, 14, and Jedaiah 
Zinzo, 15, are charged as adults, while 13-year-old Daniel Fick is 
charged as a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, who had been held for 133 days, will await their Nov.  
16 trial date under 24-hour parental supervision, the Times Herald 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Schnepp said he was relieved his son could come home.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy. He'll be under my guard. I think he wants an ice  
cream cone, pizza and a pop,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys are accused of masterminding a plot to kill students  
and teachers at Holland Woods Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	They were arrested in mid-May after classmates told  
administrators they overheard conversations about committing a 
massacre bigger than the April killing spree at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo., in which 15 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys have been expelled from the Port Huron Area School  
District and are prohibited from going back to school or attending 
any school functions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says U.N. Must Do More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton challenged the United  
Nations and countries in Africa, Asia and elsewhere on Tuesday to 
strengthen their ability to stop mass killings like those in Kosovo 
and East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States ``cannot respond to every humanitarian  
catastrophe in the world,'' he told the General Assembly. ``We 
cannot do everything everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also urged the world body to engage in an all-out battle  
against poverty for the 21st century and to ``assure that weapons 
of mass destruction will never be used on our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us resolve in the bright dawn of this new millennium to  
bring an era in which our desire to create will overwhelm our 
capacity to destroy,'' Clinton told the 188-member body. 
</P>
<P>
	His voice hoarse, apparently from allergies, Clinton coughed and  
cleared his throat as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton suggested the United Nations play an expanded role in  
preventing mass slaughter and dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we are faced with the deliberate organized campaigns to  
murder whole peoples or expel them from their land, the care of 
victims is important, but not enough. We should work to end the 
violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Clinton said, ``we need international forces  
with the training to fill the gap between local police and military 
peacekeepers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our response in every case cannot or should not be the same,''  
he said. ``Sometimes collective military force is both appropriate 
and feasible. Sometimes concerted economic and political pressure 
combined with diplomacy is a better answer, as it was in making 
possible the introduction of forces to East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Wednesday, Clinton authorized up to $55 million in U.S.  
military assistance to help countries participating in the East 
Timor peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton touched lightly on two contentious issues: a  
disagreement over Iraq and the failure of the United States to make 
more than $1 billion in delinquent U.N. payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is willing to ease the sanctions only  
if Iraq agrees to allow U.N. weapons inspectors back into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Security Council remains deadlocked. Russia, China and  
France -- each wielding veto powers -- have expressed sympathy with 
Baghdad's call for an immediate easing of the sanctions that have 
been in place since the Persian Gulf War in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearly three hours of talks Monday night, Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright failed to budge Russian Foreign Minister Igor 
Ivanov, said a U.S. official. That clouded the prospect for the 
Security Council adopting a renewal of the inspections that were 
halted in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Clinton: ``Despite all the obstacles Saddam Hussein has  
placed in our path, we must continue to ease the suffering of the 
people of Iraq. At the same time, we cannot allow the government of 
Iraq to flout 40 -- and I say 40 -- successive U.N. Security Council 
resolutions and to rebuild his arsenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also apologized for the U.S. delinquency on back  
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have strongly supported the United States meeting all its  
financial obligations to the United Nations, and I will continue to 
do so,'' he said. ``We will do our very best to succeed this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has pledged to pay the arrears, some dating  
to the 1980s, but has been blocked repeatedly by congressional 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris Smith, N.J., complained that Clinton vetoed a bill  
last year that would have paid the U.N. arrears and required U.N. 
reforms. The president objected to a Smith-sponsored anti-abortion 
amendment to the bill that would have barred U.S. funds for 
international family planning organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already have provided it once and he vetoed it,'' Smith  
said in an interview. ``There needs to be accountability'' on U.N. 
spending, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	If a sizable installment isn't made by year's end, the United  
States will lose its vote in the General Assembly. Its Security 
Council vote would not be affected, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tardiness in payments wasn't lost on other members,  
even allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarja Halonen, Finland's foreign minister, told the General  
Assembly the United Nations needs ``a stable financial basis ... 
and unconditional payment of contributions to the U.N. by all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unilateral decisions and actions to the contrary are not  
allowed,'' she said. Finland currently holds the rotating 
presidency of the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed that the world community ``wage an unrelenting  
battle against poverty'' as it enters the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite quantum advances in technology and the globalization of  
the world economy, 1.3 billion people live on less than $1 a day, 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced he would convene a White House conference of public  
health experts, pharmaceutical companies and foundation 
representatives to encourage production of vaccines for developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Other speakers also sounded Clinton's call for more involvement  
in preventing humanitarian catastrophes -- but with a different 
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, suggested the  
international community do more to combat terrorism, which he 
suggested included ``aggressive separatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community and, first of all, the United  
Nations, should decisively clamp down on any manifestations of 
separatism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow blames recent bombings in Moscow, and an escalation of  
the conflict in Chechnya and neighboring Dagestan, on 
seccessionist-minded Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghana's foreign minister, James Victor Gbeho, urged the world  
body ``to do in Africa as much as it has done in other areas,'' 
including the Balkans. He suggested the United Nations was paying 
only lukewarm attention to humanitarian crises there.

<HEADLINE> Britain Holds Second Gold Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England conducted its second gold sale  
today, disposing of 25 metric tons of British reserves at slightly 
more than the market price. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, the second this year, fetched $255.75 per troy ounce.  
The opening bid price in London Tuesday morning was $255.20. 
</P>
<P>
	World gold prices have declined markedly since the Treasury  
announced its sale intention in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold fell about $6 to $282.40 per troy ounce on May 7, the day  
the sale was announced. The first British sale, also of 25 metric 
tons, fetched $261.20 per troy ounce. A metric ton is about 2,205 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury said it was selling gold to buy U.S. dollars,  
Japanese yen and the European Union's new euro currency to create a 
more balanced cash reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain intends to dispose of 125 metric tons of gold by the end  
of next year. Over the longer term, it plans to reduce British gold 
reserves from 715 metric tons to around 300 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold, traditionally a haven for investors in times of turmoil,  
peaked at $875 per troy ounce in January 1980 -- a time when Soviet 
troops were moving into Afghanistan, the U.S. inflation rate was in 
double figures and oil prices were rising rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, central banks no longer feel compelled to  
maintain large gold stockpiles to maintain confidence in their 
currencies and economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Maude, Treasury spokesman for the opposition  
Conservative Party, called the sale a giveaway ``which will cost 
Britain hundreds of millions of pounds as a result of a slump in 
the world gold price.''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Tape Shown at Clemency Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A grainy videotape allegedly showing two of  
the Puerto Rican militants President Clinton freed from prison 
making bombs is getting star billing at a House hearing on the 
clemency deal. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans are using the videotape in an attempt to  
counter claims that the separatists had not been involved in 
violent acts carried out against U.S. targets two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here they are making bombs. I'd say that's pretty violent,''  
said Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the House Government Reform 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Corallo, the videotape turned over to the committee  
by the Bureau of Prisons shows Alejandrina Torres and Edwin Cortes, 
who both served 16 years of their original 35-year sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has explained that he agreed to commute the sentences  
because most of the jailed Puerto Ricans had spent nearly 20 years 
in prison, yet had not been charged with acts of violence that left 
anyone dead or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and some law enforcement officials have accused the  
president of making the clemency offer to boost his wife's Senate 
race standing among New York's 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. The White 
House denies that, and Hillary Rodham Clinton has since come out 
against the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Government witnesses from the Justice Department, the FBI and  
the Bureau of Prisons were also expected to testify today for the 
first time. But their testimony was to be strictly limited by the 
White House's decision last week to exert executive privilege and 
refuse to turn over to Congress documents related to the offer of 
clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents that were turned over to the House panel  
were pre-sentencing reports on the separatists from the Bureau of 
Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Corallo called the contents of those reports ``very troubling.''  
</P>
<P>
	Most of those offered clemency were associated with the FALN --  
the Spanish initials for the Armed Forces of National Liberation -- 
responsible for a wave of bombings of U.S. civilian and military 
targets in the late 1970s and early 1980s that left six dead and 
more injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Those granted clemency were convicted of seditious conspiracy  
and possession of weapons and explosives. Among those petitioning 
for their release was former President Carter and South African 
Bishop Desmond Tutu. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's offer to the 16 militants required that they renounce  
violence and meet other parole conditions limiting their travel and 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen accepted the offer and 11 of them were recently  
released from prison. One has to serve five more years before being 
released and two were already out of jail and had their fines 
eliminated.

<HEADLINE> NATO Eyes Balkan Deployments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Last spring's NATO bombing campaign against  
Yugoslavia proved to the 19 allied nations what they already knew -- 
that there are wide gaps in military capabilities among member 
countries that must be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what the alliance's defense ministers will be doing today  
and Wednesday at their annual ``informal'' talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate from their twice-yearly official meetings, the informal  
talks give the ministers an opportunity to talk about a wide range 
of issues in a tranquil ambiance, free from decision-making 
pressure. It's a search for new ideas and an opportunity to push 
old ones forward. 
</P>
<P>
	With 80,000 troops in Bosnia and Kosovo, many countries feel  
they are stretched thin. Canada, with 2,700 troops in the Balkans 
and others on their way to East Timor, is an example of one country 
feeling the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, on the other hand, wants to see the Europeans  
do more and pay more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans provided 80 percent of the air power in the  
Yugoslav campaign, which illustrated the wide disparity among the 
allies in military capabilities, equipment and the ability to 
operate effectively with other allied nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a signature year for NATO, the Kosovo campaign  
being at the forefront,'' Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton 
said. ``This will give us an opportunity to discuss the air 
campaign and the other aspects of the Kosovo effort ... a full 
post-mortem on this year's operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This meeting will also be the final ministerial session for  
Secretary-General Javier Solana, the 57-year-old former Spanish 
foreign minister who is moving on to the European Union, where he 
will be the 15-nation trade block's first special representative 
for foreign and security affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana will be replaced next month by British Defense Secretary  
George Robertson, 53, a Scot who won high praise for his strategic 
review of Britain's armed forces. Robertson is a big believer in 
the need for Europe to do more, to take on a greater share of the 
economic and military burden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans say they want greater responsibility for their own  
security. They are pressing a program within NATO called the 
European Security and Defense Identity, which would enable European 
members of the alliance to take action without American 
involvement, while still using NATO assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers will also discuss repairing relations with Russia.  
Moscow broke off military contacts with the alliance when the 
Kosovo campaign began, though Russia is now participating in the 
ground operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to help build confidence ... that NATO is not a threat  
to the Russians,'' Eggleton said.

<HEADLINE> Talks To Remove Bockrath Ongoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- As Alabama's athletics director, Bob  
Bockrath know he can't please everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	He gained support for the big things -- like hiring the popular  
choices to coach the Crimson Tide's football and basketball teams 
and for moving SEC football games out of Legion Field in 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Bockrath was vilified for little things -- like  
changing the brand of soft drinks sold at Alabama events and for 
not securing enough tickets to last year's Music City Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his latest move -- punishing rather than firing  
football coach Mike DuBose in the wake of a sexual harassment 
scandal -- that finally cost him. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama president Andrew Sorensen and Bockrath were putting the  
final touches on a deal Monday for the third-year AD's resignation, 
two school sources confirmed to The Associated Presson condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	An interim athletic director is expected to be named until a  
permanent replacement is found. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation could come as early as this week, although  
Alabama made no formal announcement and Bockrath declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustee Peter Lowe of Huntsville said Sorensen told the board of  
the impending deal, set in motion last week, and the trustees had 
nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they both just thought it would be best for the  
university and for him,'' Lowe said. ``That's my understanding. 
That's what the president wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Bockrath's ouster imminent, the question now turns to what  
becomes of DuBose. 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose, whose team lost 29-28 to Louisiana Tech on Saturday,  
said Monday he has heard the calls by some for his job, already 
imperiled because he admitted lying about his relationship with a 
female employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't worry about it,'' DuBose said. ``I can't worry  
about it, I can't linger on it. I come to work every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuBose said he did not know whether his position was further  
weakened by the impending departure of Bockrath. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Monday if he had considered resigning, DuBose, who has a  
13-13 career record at Alabama, said he hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this university and if I was 100 percent convinced it  
was the best thing for this university, sure, I would consider 
it,'' he said. ``But I have not considered it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bockrath chose not to fire DuBose in August when the coach  
admitted to lying to him. The employee settled a sexual harassment 
claim with Alabama, and Bockrath took away the two-year contract 
extension he granted DuBose. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior tailback Shaun Alexander said much of the speculation  
about Bockrath and DuBose stemmed from the loss to Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in these upstairs offices gets fidgety and starts  
talking and ruffling papers,'' Alexander said. ``And one thing it 
does is start rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bockrath's departure comes just days after university trustees  
formed a committee to oversee athletics in the three-campus Alabama 
system. While trustees said the panel had no direct control, some 
saw the move as stripping Bockrath of his power. 
</P>
<P>
	Bockrath came to Alabama from Texas Tech in June 1996. Within  
six months, Gene Stallings had resigned as football coach and 
Bockrath, following what the fans and alumni were calling for, 
hired DuBose as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	An Ohio native who never played for or coached with former  
Alabama coach Bear Bryant, Bockrath was viewed as an outsider to 
most fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hindsight is always 20-20,'' Bockrath said last year. ``But  
the fact that I had no connection to Coach Bryant, I didn't know 
that would affect some people as it obviously has.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 6, Giants 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Karros hit an RBI single with one out in  
the bottom of the ninth inning and the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated 
San Francisco 6-5 Monday night, further damaging the Giants' fading 
playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss left the Giants eight games behind Arizona in the NL  
West. The Diamondbacks lost to Colorado 12-7, but had their magic 
number cut to five by the Giants' loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Karros drove in four runs, and the Dodgers won on a night when  
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek and second baseman Eric Young got into 
a dugout argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Embree (3-1) walked Eric Young with one out in the ninth,  
and Grudzielanek greeted reliever Jerry Spradlin with a hit-and-run 
single that put runners at the corners. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Sheffield was walked intentionally to load the bases, and  
Karros lined the next pitch to left field. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Borbon (4-2) pitched a perfect ninth for the victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Karros had a two-run double in the fifth and Devon White added a  
sacrifice fly later in the inning for a 5-2 lead against Russ 
Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Giants, playing the first of seven games against the  
Dodgers in a span of 11 days, rallied to tie it in the seventh 
against rookie reliever Matt Herges. Barry Bonds doubled with one 
out, Jeff Kent drove him in with a single and J.T. Snow followed 
with his 21st homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Benard opened the game with a double, advanced to third  
on a wild pitch that bounced about six feet away from catcher Todd 
Hundley, and continued home on Hundley's errant throw to third. 
</P>
<P>
	Benard led off the fifth with his 15th homer, an opposite-field  
shot that just made it inside the left-field pole and tied the 
score at 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek put the Dodgers ahead 2-1 in the third with his  
seventh homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The dugout dispute began after a steal attempt by Ellis Burks.  
Hundley, who has thrown out only 18 of 123 baserunners this season, 
made a perfect belt-high throw that easily would have retired 
Burks. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither Young nor Grudzielanek covered the bag with  
righty-swinging Rich Aurilia at the plate, and the ball sailed into 
center field as Burks continued to third. 
</P>
<P>
	Burks did not score, but Young got into an animated discussion  
in the dugout with Grudzielanek over whose responsibility it was to 
take the throw. The argument continued while the next three Dodgers 
batted, and didn't subside until Young had to take his place in the 
on-deck circle. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Mike Scioscia, who has caught more games than any Dodger in  
history and had been with the organization for almost all of the 
past 24 years, suddenly quit as manager of Triple-A Albuquerque 
``to pursue options with other major league organizations.'' The 
announcement wasn't made by the Dodgers until 10 p.m. PDT. ... Bad 
Omen Dept.: The Giants' Single-A San Jose team lost its fifth and 
deciding game of the California League championship series to the 
Dodgers' San Bernardino farm club on Sunday night. ... Burks' 
stolen base ended a string of nine unsuccessful attempts by the 
Giants.

<HEADLINE> Encephalitis Outbreak Spreading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The outbreak of encephalitis that  
killed three people and prompted an insecticide spraying of New 
York City has spread to the northern suburbs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two confirmed cases of St. Louis encephalitis, plus one ``highly  
probable'' case, have been found among Westchester County 
residents, County Executive Andrew Spano said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Westchester cases has been fatal, but spraying by  
helicopter over the densely populated southern third of the county 
is scheduled to begin Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no choice at this particular point,'' Spano said. ``We  
have to protect the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of St. Louis encephalitis range from a low fever and  
headaches to a high fever, stiff neck, disorientation and tremors. 
Because it is a virus, there is no vaccine available to prevent it, 
but the symptoms can be treated. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City has confirmed 12 cases of the disease, including  
the three deaths, since late August. The fatalities were all senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	A second round of a mosquito-killing spray has begun in the  
city. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the first application killed 90 
percent of the mosquitoes in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Westchester County plans to use a pesticide called Anvil which  
is derived from chrysanthemums and is less toxic than the malathion 
used for much of the New York City spraying. 
</P>
<P>
	Spano said areas targeted for spraying would be warned so  
residents could close windows and take in children's toys and pet 
food bowls. All spraying will be done at night.

	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Gov. Thomas Carper said today he will  
seek the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat held by 
five-term incumbent William V. Roth Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Carper, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term

D.C. Civility must be restored in the nation's capital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, 78, is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and  
responsible for the legislation that created the Roth IRA, a 
well-known financial instrument. He has lost only once in eight

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Alderman Fred Roti, a once-powerful  
Chicago politician who was convicted of political corruption, died 
of lung cancer Monday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's Operation Greylord probe of City Hall corruption found  
that Roti had pocketed bribes for fixing court cases linked to 
organized crime. He was convicted of conspiracy, bribery and 
extortion by a federal jury and sentenced in 1993 to four years in 
prison. He was released in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Roti, the son of Italian immigrants, was a product of the  
notorious 1st Ward Democratic organization, long suspected of 
organized crime influence. The ward included the downtown section 
and the old Italian community around Taylor Street. 
</P>
<P>
	A diminutive man with a fondness for wearing fedoras, Roti held  
a series of city jobs, including working at the city morgue, before 
being elected alderman in 1968.

<HEADLINE> Sanders' Dad Said Planning Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The father of retired Detroit Lions running back  
Barry Sanders says he plans to talk with his son about rejoining 
the team in time for its fourth game, newspapers reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams Sanders told the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit  
News that he planned to meet with his son this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in for a father-and-son talk. I'm going to tell him to go  
back to Detroit,'' he told The Detroit News. ``No situation is so 
bad you can't go back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When reached at his Wichita, Kan., home Tuesday night by The  
Associated Press, William Sanders declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders, 31, was 1,458 yards short of breaking Walter  
Payton's NFL career rushing record when he retired July 28. Since 
then, the Lions have demanded that he repay $5.6 million of the $11 
million signing bonus he got when he signed a six-year, $36 million 
contract in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' agents, David Ware and Lamont Smith, are resisting the  
repayment demand, saying their client must be traded or granted 
free agency before any money is returned to the Lions. The club has 
said it will not give up its rights to Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were the Lions, I wouldn't trade Barry Sanders, either,''  
his father said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has gone to arbitration. But William Sanders said  
Arthur McAfee, an attorney with the NFL Players Association, told 
him that his son could not win the case.

	McAfee ``said they've got to back him, but he's still in a  
no-win situation,'' the elder Sanders told the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware said Tuesday that he was familiar with news reports of  
William Sanders' plans to try to talk with his son about rejoining 
the Lions. But Ware said Sanders still hasn't said anything about 
returning to football. 
</P>
<P>
	William Sanders said he would advise his son that he return to  
the Lions on the condition that he be traded after breaking 
Payton's record. But, he told the Free Press he didn't know what 
his son wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit, playing without Sanders for the first time since 1989,  
is 2-0 and off to its best start since 1993. The Lions play Sunday 
at Kansas City, then have a bye week; their fourth game is Oct. 10 
against San Diego at the Silverdome.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Leaves Public Health Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- State officials are fighting to contain a  
growing public health problem from farms, industries and sewage 
systems devastated by Hurricane Floyd and its ensuing floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a large number of different risks out there right  
now,'' said Johanna Reese of the state Division of Environmental 
Health. ``The most immediate one we have is lack of safe drinking 
water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have advised people in five counties to drink bottled  
water or boil tap water. It may be weeks before private wells and 
municipal water plants and lines are repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	Disease has become a growing threat from the rotting carcasses  
of millions of hogs, chickens and turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials also asked for incinerators to burn an estimated  
100,000 hogs, 2.4 million chickens and 500,000 turkeys killed. Gov. 
Jim Hunt's office estimates $1 billion in losses to agriculture, 
crops and livestock and $150 million to forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Drinking water has been tainted by overflow from sewage plants  
and animal waste lagoons. Floodwaters are fouled by fuel, farm 
chemicals and manure. 
</P>
<P>
	The contaminated water could cause a host of gastrointestinal  
illnesses, and dehydration from severe vomiting or diarrhea could 
be fatal in children, the elderly and people with weakened immune 
systems, Reese said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these people are down already. They're already weak,  
so they're at a greater risk,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	State health officials also recommended that residents get  
tetanus shots to protect them from infection from the filthy 
floodwater. 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard helicopters and trucks delivered clean drinking  
water to several counties Monday , while crews in Jones County 
brought in two industrial-size incinerators so workers could begin 
burning hog carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
	State agriculture commissioner Jim Graham has notified the U.S.  
Environmental Protection Agency that the state plans to use several 
insecticides to kill blowflies that feed on livestock carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fly populations could become a huge public health menace,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA said more than a million gallons of wastewater, possibly  
containing chromium, spilled at the Occidental Chemical plant in 
Castle Hayne. EPA investigators were also assessing a potential 
threat of mercury contamination from a containment pond at the 
HoltraChem plant in Riegelwood. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, health officials warned that mosquitoes will be  
out in force because of all the standing water and could spread 
deadly encephalitis.

<HEADLINE> Amway Launches Web Commerce Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *AP BUSINESS EXTRA   	
</P>
<P>
	ADA, Mich. (AP) -- The soaps, cosmetics, vitamins and friendly  
neighborhood sales force that made Amway Corp. into a 
billion-dollar success story are now just a few computer keystrokes 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	The direct-selling giant launched Quixtar, a new e-commerce site  
designed to sell its and other companies' products, on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at the biggest change in 40 years'' since Amway  
was founded, said Ken McDonald, a senior vice president. ``We're 
going to have the ability to combine high-tech ... with high-touch, 
which is what the independent business owners provide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the change didn't come without some growing pains. The  
volume of people logging on to www.Quixtar.com quickly overwhelmed 
it, causing it to jam and making it difficult to buy anything. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald said the problems are being corrected, and he isn't  
worried. Quixtar has since added 24 new servers to deal with the 
demand, and he estimates that there were $1 million in sales during 
the site's first two weeks in operation. 
</P>
<P>
	In many ways, the new site is still classic Amway. The company's  
freelance sales force, which Amway calls independent business 
owners, will continue to sell products to their friends and 
families as they always have, but with option of selling products 
online for Quixtar. 
</P>
<P>
	Online customers will be asked to identify their Quixtar  
independent business owner so commissions are credited. Those who 
come to the site without a dealer will pick or eventually be 
assigned one. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one significant change, however. Instead of using the  
word ``Amway'' in the new site's name, the company chose to go with 
Quixtar and start a new sister division by the same name to manage 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald said the Quixtar name is not intended to distance the  
Web site from Amway. Rather, he said, it's an effort to reflect the 
breadth of non-Amway products that will be available, such as 
electronics, jewelry and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're convinced we can make more money ... by building two  
businesses that are different than just by tweaking one business,'' 
McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission cleared the company 20 years ago of  
charges that its sales structure was a pyramid distribution scheme. 
But the controversy about direct selling persists. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, China banned all direct selling because of general  
concerns that such operations promoted illegal activity. Amway has 
since set up special retail stores there, but is still prohibited 
from direct selling. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in recent weeks, Web sites, such as deja.com, have been  
abuzz with postings from Amway and Quixtar supporters and 
detractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Moore, a University of Michigan School of Business  
professor, said Amway is not the first company to use a different 
name for its e-commerce site. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, he said, is that a new name will attract customers who  
might have been put off or less intrigued by the old name. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the name Quixtar, you wonder who is it? You don't walk in  
to this thinking Amway,'' Moore said. ``This could appeal to ... 
someone who doesn't like Amway or has a negative feeling about 
Amway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The real challenge will be whether the one-on-one salesmanship  
central to Amway's success can make the transition to e-commerce, 
said Chris Merritt of Kurt Salmon Associates, an Atlanta-based 
retail consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct sellers Tupperware and Avon already sell their products  
online, but Quixtar is designed to showcase more than Amway 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Amway dealers will have a choice of remaining traditional  
independent business owners or joining Quixtar, where they can use 
the company's Web site as a platform to build their own e-commerce 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 40,000 people, including many current Amway dealers,  
have signed up to be independent business owners for Quixtar, 
according to McDonald. Paul Miller of Raleigh, N.C., is one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way people are so busy with time, what we're seeing is  
with e-commerce is that's where people are going,'' said Miller, 
who sold Amway for 25 years before joining Quixtar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same company but a different look. This is sort of an  
upscale version,'' he said. ``You can already go shopping on the 
Internet. Now you can make money on the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amway is privately held, and won't discuss costs for Quixtar,  
other than to say early sales and interest have been above and 
beyond their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the early numbers for the traffic on the Web site appear  
strong. Customers have spent a weekly average of between 47 and 50 
minutes on the Quixtar site since its launch, according to Sean 
Wargo, an analyst at PC Data, Inc., which tracks e-commerce 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you rank the week ending Sept. 11 by average time spent,  
Quixtar would be at number 20,'' said Wargo. ``I would say that's 
pretty high. The sites in the top 5 are auction sites, gaming 
sites, Yahoo and other finance sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Quixtar visitors who were unable to get on the site  
because of the initial problems may be willing to give the site a 
second chance. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a sentiment McDonald shares, despite some of the early  
complaints about Quixtar. 
</P>
<P>
	``People went to the site because of their relationship with an  
independent business owner,'' he said. ``They're going to keep 
going back because of their friend's recommendation, and people 
have read enough about the Internet to know these types of problems 
aren't uncommon.''

<HEADLINE> Braves, Mets in Pennant Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The New York Mets doled out nearly $164 million  
to close the gap on the Atlanta Braves. In the next 10 days, 
they'll find out if it was money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets are just one game behind the Braves in the NL East with  
a dozen games left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding more drama to an already tense race, the teams meet  
head-to-head six times, beginning tonight with the start of a 
three-game series at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what you want when you've played for this long -- a  
chance to win the division,'' Mets first baseman John Olerud said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta has won seven straight division titles, the last four by  
an average margin of 14 games. A year ago, the Braves blew away the 
second-place Mets by 18 games, knocking New York out of a wild-card 
spot by sweeping a three-game series to end the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have a comfortable lead, but this is still fun,''  
Braves pitcher Tom Glavine said. ``It's exciting for everybody. It 
will continue to be as long as we come out on the right end of the 
stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves haven't been in a serious pennant race, when they  
beat San Francisco by one game to win the NL West. The following 
year, Atlanta moved to the East. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking to catch up with the Braves, New York committed to  
$163.9 million in contracts after last season, keeping Mike Piazza 
and Al Leiter while adding Robin Ventura, Rickey Henderson and Orel 
Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the beginning of spring training, we thought making the  
playoffs or winning the division might come down to something like 
this,'' Leiter said. ``We're definitely thinking about the 
division, and I think we're a better team than we were the last 
time we played them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won four of six games -- including a 16-0 rout at Shea  
-- when the teams met in home-and-home series in late June and early 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta (92-57) and New York (91-58) are the best teams in the  
National League, so there's a strong possibility the loser in the 
division race will live to fight another day as the wild-card 
entrant. 
</P>
<P>
	That occurred two years ago, when the Braves won the East by  
nine game over Florida but were beaten in the NL championship 
series by the wild-card Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Braves are protective of their unprecedented streak of  
division titles, they would gladly trade places with the Mets if it 
meant winning a World Series title, a la the '97 Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a choice between winning the East Division or  
winning a world championship, we'll take the world championship,'' 
third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``These games may not mean 
anything in the big picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the wild card is not a guaranteed consolation prize.  
The Cincinnati Reds are 3 1/2 games behind the Mets and could still 
make a run at both New York and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``If either team should slip up and get swept,'' Jones said,  
``all of a sudden they're in a dogfight with the Reds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with all the money spent by the Mets, Atlanta might have  
built another comfortable lead if not for an epidemic of illness 
(Andres Galarraga hasn't played because of cancer) and injuries 
(Kerry Ligtenberg, Javy Lopez, Rudy Seanez and Odalis Perez are out 
for the season). 
</P>
<P>
	Going into this critical series, the Braves could be without  
another of their top players. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Jordan, who leads the team with 106 RBIs, didn't play  
Sunday because of lingering pain in his right hand, which was 
injured when he was hit by a pitch June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had enough guys go down,'' said Jordan, who hasn't  
homered in more than a month and doesn't know when he will play 
again. ``I almost feel like I have to be in the lineup. It's 
killing me mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Mets won't have to face Atlanta's most reliable  
pitcher, Kevin Millwood, but they still get three Cy Young winners: 
John Smoltz (9-8) tonight, Glavine (11-11) on Wednesday and Greg 
Maddux (18-8) on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	New York counters with Rick Reed (10-4), Hershiser (13-10) and  
Leiter (11-12). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to pitch against them, but it just didn't work out  
that way,'' said Millwood (18-7, 2.78 ERA). ``We have three pretty 
good guys going against them. I like our chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones sounded a bit more pessimistic if the Braves don't have  
Jordan in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, we're not going to mail it in. We're going to fight  
to the bitter end,'' Jones said. ``If it falls in for us, great. If 
not, we'll know every guy tried as hard as he could, and we just 
had too many injuries to overcome.''

<HEADLINE> Encad Cites Hewlett-Packard in Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Corp. has been ordered to  
temporarily stop offering jumbo-sized color inkjet printers at 
below cost through its trade-in program pending trial of a lawsuit 
that accuses the computer maker of driving out the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Encad had sued H-P earlier this year, saying the company was  
violating the California Unfair Trade Practices Act and the Unfair 
Competition law by allowing customers to pay nothing if the value 
of a printer that is traded in is more than the cost of an H-P 
printer, said Ronald S. Katz, a lawyer for Encad. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they sell below cost, that is a problem. It may help the  
consumer in the short term. In the long run you get rid of 
competition and H-P can raise prices,'' Katz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco Superior Court Judge David Garcia on Friday  
ordered H-P to halt the trade in program pending the outcome of the 
trial, which was scheduled to begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Encad has lost at least $50 million because of the trade-in  
program, Katz said. Encad could be awarded as much as $150 million 
in damages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Murdy, a Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman in San Jose, said the  
company will comply with the court's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard is confident that ``a fuller examination'' will  
show the company has complied with California law, Murdy said in a 
statement. She declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard is the world's largest supplier of inkjet  
printers. The company won't disclose how much it makes on those 
sales, though analysts say H-P probably earns more on printer 
supplies than on the printers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say what the ruling is going to do,'' said Paula  
Bursley, senior industry analyst at Dataquest Inc. ``The objective 
of the business itself is to make the money off the supplies. 
Hardware is really a secondary thing.''
