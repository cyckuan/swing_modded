BRUINS' CHANGE REFLECTS LAVIN'S
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA has won five consecutive Pacific-10
basketball games for the first time since 1997, when it won eight
straight and the conference title.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins believe their success, now as then, reflects coach
Steve Lavin's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few weeks, his demeanor has been as close to 1997 as
it's been in four years,'' assistant coach Michael Holton said.
``It's his demeanor in practice more than anything, his firmness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no coincidence that the players have responded. Coach
Lavin has been extremely firm in what he's demanded of them. And
when I think back to '97, what I remember was his heavy hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin hasn't noticed a change in his demeanor, but he did
acknowledge a different approach. Because the Bruins finally
understand the new offense, he's explaining less and demanding
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going at a faster clip in practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Earl Watson noticed a difference in Lavin after the
disastrous weekend in Arizona, when the Bruins lost two games by 44
points.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't lost since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way coach has managed practice has been amazing the last
couple weeks,'' Watson said. ``It's his control of practice. He's
definitely been firmer. There's been a lot of discipline. The
transition from drill-to-drill is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The goodbye guy: The Bruins will honor their lone senior,
forward Sean Farnham, during today's season finale against
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Long a fan favorite, Farnham is averaging 1.4 points and 1.3
rebounds, but statistics have never been his thing. Instead, he'll
be remembered for his indefatigable spirit, charm and work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a lot of emotions, obviously,'' he said. ``It'll bea
great day and a sad day. It'll be everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is that I'm leaving on a higher note than it
looked like I would three weeks ago,'' when postseason prospects
were dim.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, Farnham will start today: in the last two years,
the Bruins are 13-1 with him in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Prime material: Forever in search of perspective, Lavin listed
all the national upsets on the greaseboard in UCLA's lockerroom -
South Carolina over Tennessee, Penn State over Ohio State,
Georgetown over Syracuse - and then warned the Bruins that they are
not immune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed them that's what can happen when one team is
physically and mentally fatigued and the (underdog) is loose and
relaxed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One upset meant more to Lavin than any other: St. Louis over
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The Billikens are coached by Lorenzo Romar, the former UCLA
assistant and Pepperdine boss and a longtime friend to many
involved with the Bruins basketball program. ``It's great,'' Lavin
said. ``I've left Lorenzo a couple voice-mail messages, one after
their first-round game and one after Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis beat Tulane on Friday and is one victory from the
Conference USA title and an NCAA bid.

<P>
   THE DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   GORE ON THE TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   In his continuing effort to woo independent voters, Vice
President Al Gore was planning to meet in Minneapolis on Saturday
morning with Jesse Ventura, the very independent governor of
Minnesota. Gore, who campaigned Friday night in Bloomington, Minn.,
picked up the endorsement of Sen. Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota
Democrat who had supported former Sen. Bill Bradley. Gore called
Ventura on Air Force II on his way to Minnesota to line up the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, in a speech in Albany, N.Y., Gore gave a
glimpse of his coming campaign against the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let those Confederate-flag-waving, Bob-Jones-embracing,
right-wing extremists divide us!'' Gore called out as he addressed
Puerto Rican and Hispanic members of the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering much of his speech in Spanish, he added: ``We are the
party of hope, not anger or exclusion. We are the party of the
people, and not the powerful. We're the party of the future and not
the past.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA CAUCUS
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Bill Bradley dropped out of the Democratic
presidential race Thursday, 172 people who deeply admired him
showed up at the party caucuses in South Carolina to give him their
votes. The display of die-hard loyalty was not quite enough,
however, to counterbalance the 8,864 people who voted for Vice
President Al Gore in a preview of one-sided primaries to come. Even
before Bradley quit, the Democratic caucuses had already been
declared essentially irrelevant, in comparison with the hotly
contested Republican primary in February that drew a record 573,000
voters.
</P>
<P>
   THE VOTERS
</P>
<P>
   YOUTH CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   Before Philadelphia plays host to the Republicans this summer, a
less well-publicized convention will be held there.
</P>
<P>
   In April the Generation X convention, a nonpartisan meeting of
voters ages 18 to 35, will consider issues like Social Security,
the environment, and First Amendment rights and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will be sponsored by the Foundation for Individual
Responsibility and Social Trust, a nonprofit group that promotes
civic engagement among younger people. The foundation has extended
invitations to all the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're really trying to court the young vote,''
Melinda Scott, 29, the associate director of the foundation, said
of the candidates. ``We're the swing vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will be held at the University of Pennsylvania and
Drexel University April 14 to 16, and the foundation is hoping that
1,000 people will attend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   It's Alan Keyes? The voluble Keyes, the lone remaining
challenger to Gov. George W. Bush for the Republican presidential
nomination, is set to appear in a skit on ``Saturday Night Live''
this weekend, say aides and NBC officials. The details of the skit
are closely held and are still subject to last-minute negotiations.
But Connie Hair, a spokeswoman for Keyes, said that he would appear
on the ``Weekend Update'' segment of the show and planned to make
``merciless fun'' of the media.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   GUNS AND MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Mark Detro, one of six Republican candidates in Oklahoma's 2nd
Congressional District race, wants to run a ``pro-gun donation
drive'' to raise campaign money and increase public awareness about
the right to bear arms. Campaign contributors would participate in
a lottery for two Ruger firearms donated by a gun broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a few bad apples,'' Detro, 32, said, ``but the
way the media distorts some of the school shootings and always
looks at the worst-case scenario, you'd never know that 99 percent
of the gun owners in America are law-abiding citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Federal Elections Commission approved the plan, he
says, Oklahoma state officials have objected because of the state's
anti-gambling laws. ``We're trying to work something out with them
now,'' Detro said. He said that about 25 people had called since he
announced the lottery, asking how to send checks to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEKEND'S SCHEDULES
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: Saturday: Austin, Texas Sunday: Plant City,
Fla., and Knoxville, Tenn. &QL;

<P>
   DENVER _ The emphatic success that Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas enjoyed in the Super Tuesday primaries
removed almost all relevance from Friday's balloting in Colorado,
Utah and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Any that was left dissipated on Thursday when their chief
competitors, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, called an end to their White House pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore and Bush won easily in Colorado and were well
ahead in Utah. In Colorado, the Democrat piled up 71 percent of the
vote and the Republican 64 percent, with 90 percent of the
precincts reporting. With 21 percent of the precincts reporting in
Utah, Gore had polled 75 percent of the vote; for the Republicans,
Bush had 66 percent and Alan Keyes 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, Republicans overwhelmingly supported Bush in a
nonbinding straw poll, with 14 of the 23 county caucuses reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who swept all the Democratic contests on Tuesday, did not
campaign in Colorado or Utah this week. As the winner in all but
four of 13 Republican contests on Tuesday, Bush did, appearing at
rallies in Denver, Provo, Utah and Cheyenne, Wyo., where he struck
his familiar themes of tax breaks, strengthening the military and
criticizing Gore for his fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   In each state, Bush was joined by the governor, Republicans all,
who were among his campaign's earliest supporters: Bill Owens of
Colorado, Michael O. Leavitt of Utah and Jim Geringer of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until late Thursday that it became clear that Bush
would have the three states, as well as the rest of the country, to
himself without another major challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Freda Poundstone, McCain's Colorado coordinator, said she had
been expecting the senator to appear at rallies in Denver and
Colorado Springs, but then had to notify supporters that he was
withdrawing. The turnabout came too late for the campaign to pull
advertisements on Denver television stations, which ran late into
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not that McCain's decision seemed to matter much to voters
casting ballots Friday. In Colorado, for example, a poll published
in The Denver Post on Sunday showed Bush with the support of 55
percent of registered Republicans, compared with 29 percent for
McCain. The margin of error was plus or minus 6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, too, had been a heavy favorite in Colorado over Bradley,
by 66 percent to 24 percent in the same poll. It mattered less how
he stood in Utah and Wyoming even though he was the favorite in
both. They are heavily Republican states, and, like many other
Western states, are expected to support Bush in November.

GANG-RELATED CRIMES RISE IN POST-SCANDAL RAMPART DISTRICT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG GITTRICH  
 and BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ With the Los Angeles Police Department's
Rampart Division crippled by scandal, gang violence on the streets
around the station house has soared - nearly 40 percent during this
year's first two months.
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti and other signs of street thuggery also have been
creeping back into the community, undermining a long-fought battle
against the notorious 18th Street gang, whose members were the
targets of many of the abuses allegedly committed by officers in
the anti-gang CRASH (Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums)
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the disturbing rise in gang crime in the low-income
community located between Hollywood and downtown is directly linked
to the scandal and the city's related decision to suspend gang
injunctions is the subject of debate in law enforcement circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a blip, or it could be that gang members are being
more brazen since the injunctions have been lifted,'' said LAPD
Capt. Robert Hansohn. ``It also could be some gang fight beneath
the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansohn was put in charge of the division in August 1998, two
weeks before Internal Affairs investigators arrested rogue cop
Rafael Perez at the station house for stealing eight pounds of
cocaine from the evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has told investigators that he and other dirty cops shot a
suspect, planted drugs and guns on several suspects and repeatedly
committed perjury to send innocent people to jail. The
vigilante-style law enforcement tactics led to a large number of
arrests and intimidated those in the neighborhood, at least
partially contributing to the fall in crime.
</P>
<P>
   At his sentencing hearing last month, Perez explained: ``The
lines between right and wrong became fuzzy and indistinct. The 'us'
against 'them' ethos of the overzealous cop began to consume me and
the ends seemed to justify the means.''
</P>
<P>
   The rogue actions by Perez and other officers he has implicated
forced the suspension of gang injunctions, a major tool used by the
LAPD to fight gang-related crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart anti-gang CRASH officers had provided sworn
declarations used in court by the City Attorney's Office to get
injunctions imposed to limit the activities of local street thugs.
With the cops' credibility undermined, the city had no choice but
to suspend the injunctions last year. One injunction had been in
place since August 1997; another since June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Since the two injunctions were lifted, gang-related violent
crimes - which include homicides, rapes, assaults, kidnapping,
robbery, witness intimidation, extortion and carjacking - have
jumped noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   Through last month, 151 gang-related violent crimes were
recorded by police, compared with 108 for the same period last year
- a 39.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It points out that gang injunctions work. They are very
effective,'' said City Attorney Jim Hahn, who has spearheaded the
implementation of 11 gang injunctions across the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this investigation continues, we are still not in a place
where we could say which declarations can be relied on. It may be a
few more months. Injunctions are a tool ... Other methods are
available to suppress gang crimes. This is by no means a green
light for gang activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hunt, president of the Police Protective League, predicted
gang-related crime will continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the sanctions were lifted, the gang members who
terrorized the community before now feel they've been given the
green light to go back and terrorize people - and it's going to get
worse,'' the union leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Under increased pressure to prevent problems similar to those
that poisoned the Rampart Division, LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks has
ordered the city's elite anti-gang Community Resources Against
Street Hoodlums units to be disbanded Sunday. Officers will be
reassigned to patrol details for the next month, and gang details
will be reorganized within normal patrol units.
</P>
<P>
   With many officers in the Rampart CRASH unit under investigation
and on administrative leave, the division's patrol officers have
faced the fallout of the scandal on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (problem) people are gone, but people still want to focus
on the station,'' said Sgt. S. Britt-Nickerson, driving her black
and white police car past a television camera crew, a common sight
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with the aftermath. It's hard. The bad element
in Rampart is really using this to their advantage, they're being
more brazen than they would have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the injunctions, gang members from outside Rampart are
beginning to return to the neighborhood, she said. If suspects are
arrested, many are emboldened to threaten officers with false
claims, such as evidence-planting.
</P>
<P>
   And while the new crop of Rampart officers prides itself on
doing a professional job, Hansohn and other officers said the
scandal might have made some officers overly cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Still, during the first week of March, the division led the
department in arrests, Hansohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Danny Burzumato said it's common now for suspects to
say, ``I know you're from Rampart, so I won't get convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   The rising gang violence statistics underscore the need for good
police work that prioritizes problems, Hansohn said. The captain
added that throughout the scandal the community generally has
backed the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in tune,'' Hansohn said. ``It's bothersome to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people interviewed in the community, the most crowded in
the city, said they were concerned about the possibility of
increased gang activity but had not seen evidence of it in their
own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard problem,'' said David Lopez, who assembles
vertical blinds in a shop near the Rampart station on Temple
Street.
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, Lopez said: ``You have to look at the future.''

NATIONAL DEBT ISN'T ALL NEGATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 COL.-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of people smart enough to know better buy the theory that
paying off the national debt is one of the best things America
could do for itself.
</P>
<P>
   What everyone should be clear on, however, is that nobody is
talking about paying off all the debt. They're only talking about
retiring the publicly held portion of the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   The debt has two components. One is the bills, notes and bonds
held by individuals, banks, institutional investors and foreigners.
This is the marketable debt, which is almost 60 percent of what
Uncle Sam owes. The other component is the nonmarketable debt,
which could be called the money government owes itself. Most of
this debt is Treasury IOUs credited to various trust funds. These
funds exist as parking places for excess revenues from taxes levied
for specific purposes. The Social Security trust fund is the
largest and best known, but many others exist for purposes as
varied as funding highway and airport construction and harbor
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The trust funds get these IOUs in the form of nonmarketable
securities because all of the tax money collected for specific
purposes isn't spent as intended. The unused revenue goes to
finance general budget outlays and the fund gets a redeemable
credit.
</P>
<P>
   It's important for Americans to understand the national debt's
bifurcated nature. Otherwise, they can be easily deceived. Although
the Treasury has been paying down public debt for more than a year,
the non-public portion of the debt has been rising even faster than
the public portion is being retired.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. pays off all of the publicly held debt but allows
the debt ``we owe ourselves'' to grow even faster, Americans will
end up with the worst of all worlds. The federal government would
still be obligated to redeem trust fund debt as needed, but
domestic and global financial markets would be denied the market
for public Treasury debt that is so necessary to maintaining an
orderly financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Without Treasury's publicly held debt, for instance, the Federal
Reserve won't be able to manage monetary policy nearly as
efficiently. Regardless of what you think of the Fed, this would
risk destabilization of the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's status as the world's reserve currency also would
be jeopardized, economist Larry Kudlow explained recently in an
analysis for Investor's Business Daily. This would undermine U.S.
economic health because foreigners' willingness to invest in
dollar-denominated assets has been key to financing big trade
deficits without sacrificing prosperity. Treasuries are often
foreign investors' asset of choice because they are super safe.
Foreign interests now hold about 40 percent of the marketable debt,
or double the total of just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Without a Treasury market, investors also couldn't hedge or
avoid risk during market turmoil by purchasing super-safe
Treasuries. The damage this would do to market stability both at
home and abroad is incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have long been told debt is bad. Not necessarily so.
Unmanageable debt is bad, but the U.S. debt situation has always
been manageable. What probably won't be as manageable is a
financial world without Treasury securities.

FBI IN KANSAS CITY OPENS INVESTIGATION INTO FETAL TISSUE INDUSTRY
 
</HEADLINE>
 TISSUE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI in Kansas City opened an investigation
Friday into whether anyone violated federal law in removing and
marketing tissue from fetuses at an Overland Park clinic where
abortions are performed.
</P>
<P>
   The probe will be carried out by the health care fraud unit of
the FBI in cooperation with the U.S. attorneys' offices in Kansas
and Missouri, Special Agent Jeff Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of a congressional subcommittee on Thursday called on
Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh to launch
an inquiry at a hearing on the fetal tissue industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Health and Environment Health Subcommittee cited documents
and interviews raising questions about fees charged by a company
run by a Lee's Summit pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   The pathologist, Miles Jones, told an undercover reporter with
ABC News that organs such as livers, hearts and brains are in high
demand and that researchers ``will pay whatever you ask.'' Jones
had a price list for organs.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has not returned numerous calls for comment on his work.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, tissue and organs can only be donated, not
sold. Reasonable fees are allowed for removal services and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Laws also prohibit women from being persuaded to prolong their
pregnancies, so organs are more developed and valuable, and it
prohibits altering normal abortion procedures in order to harvest
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Lanza said the FBI would look into fees as well as into abortion
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Fetal tissue is important to researchers seeking cures for
several diseases, from Parkinson's disease to juvenile diabetes.
Some fear that the current controversy, raised by abortion foes,
could set back such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Congress lifted a ban on fetal-tissue research in 1993 but made
it a felony to purchase or sell fetal tissue for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that in attempting to enforce the
laws...Congress may unnecessarily over-restrict fetal tissue
research,'' said Samuel Cohen, a University of Nebraska Medical
Center pathologist, at the hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many opposed to abortion say they agree with the importance of
such research, but strict procedures must be followed or
profiteering will encourage more abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, medical technician Lawrence Dean Alberty Jr. of
Lee's Summit, said he once saw twin fetuses, used for organ
donations, moving and breathing in a pan of blood and that another
fetus moved its eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But Alberty acknowledged in a sworn affidavit that he was not
qualified to judge fetal viability, did not know if procedures had
been altered and was unaware if a fetus had come from a woman who
had an abortion to save her own life.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty also admitted that he accepted more than $10,000 from an
anti-abortion group for secretly gathering information and that he
lied to the group about some of what he had witnessed. He said,
however, that his testimony Thursday was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Alberty was employed by Anatomic Gift Foundation Inc., an organ
harvesting firm, and later worked for Jones' company, Opening
Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Anatomic Gift and Opening Lines were under contract in the mid-
to late 1990s to remove fetal tissue at Comprehensive Health, an
Overland Park clinic affiliated with Planned Parenthood of Kansas
and Mid-Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood terminated both agreements after concerns
arose over some business practices, said Peter Brownlie, president
and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood. Brownlie said he
supported the federal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Jones failed to respond to a subpoena to testify to the House
subcommittee on Thursday. The subcommittee, which serves under the
Commerce Committee, voted to hold him in contempt of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For him to be charged with contempt and arrested, the Commerce
Committee and the full House would have to vote for contempt and
the Justice Department would have to indict him, House lawyers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Jones has held a medical license in at least
16 states and the District of Columbia since he got a medical
degree from Howard University in Washington, D.C., in 1977. He got
a license in Missouri in 1997 and in Kansas in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jones listed his other state licenses when he applied for a
license in Rhode Island in 1998, said Milton Hamolsky, chief
administrative officer of the Rhode Island Board of Medical
Licenses and Discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Hamolsky said it is not unusual for certain specialists, such as
pathologists and radiologists, to be licensed in many states
because their practices often involve filling in for doctors on
vacations and leave.
</P>
<P>
   In a related move Friday, Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan announced
creation of a 15-member task force to review Missouri's 1969 law on
organ and tissue research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task force will work to ensure that this important
research is not marred and exploited by someone seeking to make a
profit,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The task force will include physicians, organ-donation
specialists, individuals who have received organ donations, family
members of organ donors, lawmakers and others. The group will
review medical, legal and ethical opinions regarding fetal tissue
and organ donation.
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas House committee Thursday introduced a bill to require
tracking of fetal tissue and monitoring of fees.

AIDES TO RENO STRONGLY URGED INQUIRY ON GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for clarification inserts in 3rd and 2nd-to-last graf of 1st

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Justice Department officials twice urged
Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate Vice President Al Gore for his role in political fund
raising and at one point came closer to persuading her than was
previously known, according to government officials and previously
undisclosed documents.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the FBI director, Louis Freeh, and Reno's chief
campaign finance prosecutor, Charles La Bella, conclude that Reno
was obligated to seek an independent counsel, but so did aides like
Robert Litt, a highly influential political deputy at the Justice
Department who was often said to have opposed such appointments.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno decided against them, relying on the advice of career
prosecutors, and ordered the investigation of Gore closed in
December 1998. That decision lifted an enormous political weight
off Gore as he prepared to seek the presidency. The decision also
became one of Reno's most controversial and criticized moves.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said Reno
made her decisions on independent counsel impartially and that her
willingness to refer cases to outside prosecutors was demonstrated
by her decision to seek such appointments in the cases of seven top
Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, Marlin said: ``The attorney general relied on the
advice of a number of officials in this case, career employees who
worked throughout Republican and Democratic administrations and had
different views on the issue among them. In the end, the attorney
general based her decision on the facts and the law without regard
to politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's investigation of Gore followed an
erratic trajectory. It began before the 1996 election when federal
prosecutors in Los Angeles opened an inquiry into the vice
president's activities at a fund-raising event at the Hsi Lai
Temple, a Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But in an early, pivotal decision, senior Justice Department
officials in Washington ordered the prosecutor, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Stephen A. Mansfield, to cease his investigation and turn
over any information he had gathered to prosecutors in Washington
because Gore was covered by the independent counsel statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``As would be necessary in any matter with potential independent
counsel ramifications, your office should take no steps to
investigate these matters at this time,'' Lee J. Radek, the chief
of the public integrity section, wrote in a Nov. 1, 1996, letter to
a top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. The letter was recently
obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Temple inquiry exonerated Gore by 1997, and
when he was later interviewed by the FBI in 1997 and 1998, he was
never even questioned about the Temple. The investigation led to an
indictment of Maria Hsia, a California immigration consultant and
longtime fund-raiser for the Gore, who was convicted by a federal
jury in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hsia's conviction has kept alive the political embarrassment
that the event caused for the vice president, the putative
Democratic presidential nominee this year. His opponent, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, has vowed to make Gore's role in campaign
fund raising in 1996 a major issue in the campaign this fall.
Friday, Bush said, ``The vice president needs to clear up what role
he played in raising money from the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the president and vice president,
said: ``The fact that some disagreed with the attorney general's
decision isn't news. But the bottom line hasn't changed. This has
all been investigated by many people at a cost of millions of
dollars with absolutely no finding of wrongdoing on the part of the
president or vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of the Justice Department's inquiry of Gore's role in
the 1996 campaign finance investigation shows that the vice
president only narrowly avoided the appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate charges of illegal fund raising, not for any
actions related to the Temple for but for fund-raising phone calls
that the Gore placed from his White House office.
</P>
<P>
   The closeness of the call on Gore's case was not known
previously. The debates kept the decision open until the final day
of the 90-day deadline imposed by the independent counsel law, when
Radek and other lawyers from the public integrity section persuaded
Reno that the facts would never warrant prosecution, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The searing debate has left a residue of bitterness among a
wider group of current and former Justice Department and law
enforcement officials than has been previously disclosed. In
interviews and confidential documents reviewed by The Times, they
said that Reno's handling of inquiries involving Gore raised
suspicions that investigations involving senior White House
officials were handled differently than lower ranking officials
covered by the independent counsel statute.
</P>
<P>
   In a confidential memo to Reno in 1998, La Bella, her
hand-picked chief of the department's campaign finance task force,
argued strenuously that an independent counsel should be appointed
to investigate the fund-raising roles of Clinton and Gore. La
Bella's memo has never been made public. But verbatim notes taken
by someone who reviewed the memo demonstrate La Bella's
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella said that the Justice Department had launched
aggressive investigations of lower-level people ``based only on a
wisp of information,'' while he believed that top White House
officials had the benefit of a much higher legal threshold.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella pointed out in his memo, some details of which were
first reported in the Los Angeles Times, that the independent
counsel law had an assurance that senior officials would be
``treated neither more harshly nor more leniently than others in
less powerful positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Temple episode, where at least $55,000 in illegal ``straw''
donations were made to the Democratic Party, was not even among the
allegations under review by the Justice Department in late 1997
when Reno first considered whether to seek an independent counsel
to investigate Gore. In that deliberative phase, which some aides
later referred to as ``Gore I,'' Reno and her aides pondered a
single question, whether Gore's telephone fund-raising phone calls
from his office violated an old anti-graft law barring
solicitations on public property.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of her decision, which became known in Justice
circles as ``Gore II,'' involved allegations that the vice
president lied about the phone calls. La Bella wrote his stinging
memo a few months before Reno exonerated the vice president in
``Gore II.''
</P>
<P>
   The precise steps in the decision making process at Justice
remain hidden behind a veil of official secrecy. Nevertheless, a
pattern became well known within the Justice Department.
Allegations that were referred to the public integrity section, the
department's unit responsible for public corruption cases,
including independent counsel matters, seemed to languish and then
die. Meanwhile, career prosecutors who had intended to aggressively
investigate the allegations were left to speculate about what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield, the Los Angeles prosecutor who originally
investigated the Temple fund-raiser, said in a recent interview
that he had prepared to aggressively investigate.

POLL FINDS PREFERENCE FOR TEACHING EVOLUTION RATHER THAN CREATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Americans want evolution, not creation, taught in public
schools, according to a poll released Friday by the People for the
American Way Foundation, a liberal watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   About 83 percent of those polled favored the teaching of
evolution _ the theory that living things have changed through time
_ over biblical creation.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent see no conflict between the two ideas,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poll shows most Americans believe God created evolution,''
said Ralph G. Neas, president of People for the American Way
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven percent of respondents classified creation as an
accurate account of how humans developed..
</P>
<P>
   The People for the American Way Foundation commissioned the
Washington firm DYG Inc. to conduct the poll. Telephone interviews
with 1,500 randomly selected persons were conducted in early
November. The poll has a margin of error of 2.6 percentage points
at a 95 percent confidence level. That means that if the study were
repeated 20 times, the results would be within 2.6 percentage
points 19 of the 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of those polled disagreed with the Kansas Board of
Education's decision last August to de-emphasize evolution in new
state science standards.
</P>
<P>
   That is similar to results of a poll conducted last October by
The Kansas City Star and the Wichita Eagle. In that poll of 604
Kansans, 52 percent of respondents disagreed with the state board.
</P>
<P>
   The People for the American Way Foundation's poll results also
are similar to those of a Gallup Poll released in August.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway of Shawnee has heard all this before. She said
she suspects the poll results could be skewed by the way questions
were phrased.
</P>
<P>
   The question on whether respondents agreed with the state
board's decision is one example, Holloway said: Pollsters told
respondents the state board deleted evolution from the new science
standards, which isn't exactly true. Still present in the science
standards is microevolution, or change within species. The board
deleted macroevolution, or change from one species to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's leading the answer,'' Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that the poll results were being released months
after the dispute was at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why now? Why Kansas?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's an election year, Neas said, and because those who
disagree with the state board need a wake-up call to realize how
hard its supporters will work to maintain the ground they've
gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very determined, tenacious minority,'' Neas said.
</P>
<P>
   The People for the American Way Foundation also commissioned the
poll to gauge how Americans, not just Kansans, view the state
board's decision. Since August, local and state school boards in
states from Kentucky to Oklahoma to New York have tinkered with
state standards and local classroom guidelines as they struggle to
determine what to teach in science classes, Neas said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found:
</P>
<P>
   - Although 95 percent of respondents have heard the term
``evolution,'' only 42 percent said they are ``very familiar'' with
the concept. Thirty-two percent incorrectly believe evolution means
humans developed from apes over millions of years. (The correct
definition is that humans developed from less advanced forms over
millions of years.)
</P>
<P>
   - Most Americans do not favor teaching only evolution or
creation. Forty-six percent say students should either discuss
religious explanations for origins in other classes or discuss
creation as a belief, not a scientific theory, in science class.
</P>
<P>
   - Sixty-six percent said the issue of whether to teach evolution
in public schools is too important to leave to individual school
boards or schools to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway found that part of the foundation's poll intriguing
because it points to support for a national curriculum, something
the public has repeatedly rejected, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't they think the people closest to the children should
know what they want them to learn?'' Holloway said. ``How arrogant
and elitist.''
</P>
<P>
   John Morris, a geologist and president of the Institute for
Creation Research in San Diego, agreed. It's a common tactic and
somewhat Marxist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The People for the American Way has this hidden agenda to use
their power base to infiltrate Kansas and take the (control) from
the local district,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Neas agreed that the Kansas controversy goes to the heart of
People for the American Way's mission. Changing the science
standards spoke to issues of quality education, freedom of speech
and the separation of church and state, Neas said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results prove there's strong bipartisan support for the
foundation's position, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Molleen Matsumura of the National Center for Science Education
in Berkeley, Calif., said the results show something else, too.
Since August, Kansas has been the butt of jokes on late-night
television, in academic journals and in editorial cartoons. But the
results of the recent poll and earlier polls show that the opinions
of most Kansans aren't that different from those of their neighbors
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over the country have been poking fun at Kansas.
People don't want to be like Kansas'' said Matsumura, whose
organization advocates the teaching of evolution. ``Guess what,
folks. You probably are.''

WASHINGTON: aggressively investigate.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I wanted to move very quickly, to gather evidence by issuing
subpoenas, interviewing witnesses and considering the execution of
search warrants,'' said Mansfield, who had extensive experience
prosecuting campaign finance fraud cases. ``But it got yanked off
my desk and as far as I know, nothing happened for many, many
months,'' said Mansfield, who is now a partner at the law firm,
Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &AMP; Feld. ``The consequence of a strategy of
sitting back and doing nothing means you effectively make the
matter go away. It is so much harder to develop. Speed is
everything in a highly publicized case.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months that elapsed, several figures involved in the
Temple fund-raising scheme fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   During the early period of her department's investigation in
1997, Reno said repeatedly that the campaign finance task force was
``vigorously'' pursuing every lead with more than 120 agents,
attorneys and staff. In October 1997, Reno said her team was
``investigating and confronting low-level targets, and moving up
the chain of those involved to whomever is responsible.'' Gore,
meanwhile, said initially that he did not know that the Temple
event was a fund-raiser, though later he said he knew it was
``finance-related.'' As for the calls he made, he has said he was
sometimes inattentive at meetings where the types of fund raising
were discussed and that he was unaware that some of the funds he
raised from his office were federally restricted.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter in October 1997, after her task force had been
investigating for about a year, Reno had already decided that the
practices that first raised the biggest questions about the
Democrats, among them the seemingly inappropriate use of the White
House as a fund-raising tool, did not merit an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But one fund-raising statute, an 1883 civil service law that
barred elected officials from using government offices to raise
money, was clear and troublesome for Gore, who had made 45
fund-raising calls from his vice-presidential office. Gore's
supporters have said that the accusations were baseless, and that
the applicable law was created to correct political abuses before
the invention of the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Reno absolved him of any wrongdoing by saying
that his calls were intended to raise unrestricted soft money only
for general party purposes, not for potentially illegal hard money
donations for the use of the re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has repeatedly denied charges by Republicans that she
refused to appoint an independent counsel for political reasons.
And some aides said that, although she became more skeptical of the
law, she never wavered in her insistence in fully evaluating every
allegation involving Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong objections from La Bella and Freeh, Reno said
Gore's actions were lawful. ``Evidence found by the investigators
shows that the vice president solicited only soft money in these
calls, not hard money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Gore II'' matter focused on whether the vice president
lied to investigators during the initial inquiry into his
fund-raising phone calls. But this time, Reno's advisers were
sharply divided. There was much deliberation. La Bella and Freeh,
this time joined by Litt and other Justice Department officials,
redoubled their efforts to get the attorney general to appoint an
independent counsel. Again, this time more narrowly, Gore escaped
the appointment of an independent counsel when Reno overruled her
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's second investigation of Gore began in
September 1998 when the White House belatedly disclosed a
fund-raising memo by David M. Strauss, a deputy chief of staff to
the vice president. Strauss' notes were taken at a White House
meeting on Nov. 21, 1995, and suggested Gore might not have been
truthful in the 1997 inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had told investigators that he thought his White House
telephone calls were only to raise soft-money donations. But the
Strauss memo indicated that Gore might have known when he was
questioned by Justice Department investigators that money was being
split into both unrestricted soft-money accounts and restricted
hard money accounts.
</P>
<P>
   According to new documents, former White House Chief of Staff
Leon Panetta recalled that Gore was present and seemed attentive
when there was a White House discussion of how funds would be split
among party accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said he was sometimes inattentive and missed parts of
fund-raising meetings. Additionally, the vice president told the
FBI, according to notes of a 1998 interview, that ``he drank a lot
of iced tea during meetings, which could have necessitated a
restroom break.'' But Reno concluded the evidence against Gore was
too slight to support a prosecution of the vice president. However,
some aides protested vigorously that her role _ under the
independent counsel law _ was not to determine the weight of
evidence but merely whether it was credible and specific
information that indicated a covered official may have committed a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief to the three-judge panel of appellate judges, Reno
concluded that there was ``only weak circumstantial evidence of the
vice president's knowledge _ his presence at a meeting where the
subject was briefly discussed _ which I do not believe provides
reasonable ground to believe that further investigation of this
matter is warranted.''

 NCAA's QUEST TO ENFORCE RULES ON AMATEURISM UNSETTLES COLLEGE (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS, KATIE FUNK, HOWARD RICHMAN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ NCAA suspensions of big-time college
basketball players over violations of amateurism rules is roiling
the basketball world, angering coaches and even helping create a
new players association.
</P>
<P>
   Labeled a ``witch hunt'' and ``crackdown'' by some, the NCAA
finds itself with few defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Temple's longtime coach John Chaney fumed after the NCAA
suspended center Kevin Lyde last week for one game because an
amateur coach paid for a summer course when Lyde was in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is truly unbelievable,'' he told reporters. ``Why don't
they go back to the crib? Why don't they go back and see if the kid
changed his diapers in the crib. I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by anonymous tips and information from a federal
investigation based in Kansas City, the NCAA this season slapped
temporary suspensions on eight players at schools from Los Angeles
to Queens, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the suspensions involved players' accepting tuition
money to pricey East Coast prep schools to hone their skills before
entering college. Others involved players who accepted money or
shoes from summer league coaches and even from professional agents.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials say that despite some new wrinkles in the recent
cases, they're merely enforcing long-standing rules designed to
ensure an athlete's amateur status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cases we've been seeing since late last year are cases
that have come to the attention of the NCAA,'' said spokeswoman
Jane Jankowski. ``We have not changed the way we investigate these
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The wave of suspensions began when the NCAA penalized three
players who were high school stars in the Kansas City area:
Oklahoma State's Andre Williams, for accepting tuition payments;
UCLA's JaRon Rush, for accepting money from an amateur coach and an
agent; and Missouri's Kareem Rush, for accepting impermissible
benefits from the same summer-league coach.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, DerMarr Johnson at Cincinnati, Jamal Crawford
at Michigan, Chris Porter of Auburn and Erick Barkley at St. John's
were hit with similar suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   The recent suspensions have made one thing clear: An athlete's
tuition to a prep school better be paid by a parent or guardian.
And an athlete should be careful, very careful, about taking money
from amateur coaches and others.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime observers question whether the NCAA is prepared to
suspend every player who ever violated such amateurism rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confounding to me because this has been going on for
years,'' said Bob Gibbons, a recruiting analyst. ``If you or I want
to pay for a young man to go to school, what's wrong with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Annoyed with the suspensions, an Overland Park association that
represents college basketball coaches has helped organize the
Student Basketball Council to give players a voice.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling group's chairman, Duke junior forward Shane
Battier, left little doubt as to its top priority: ``We are
immediately concerned and highly disappointed about the image that
a lot of players are getting, due to perceived violations of NCAA
rules.'' More questions than answers
</P>
<P>
   School tuition or summer league spending money is all the same
to the NCAA: They're benefits or services received solely because
of the individual's athletic reputation or skill, and they're
against the rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the NCAA has permitted some payments by friends or
benefactors if they had a long-standing personal relationship with
the players.
</P>
<P>
   As JaRon Rush prepared to choose a university in 1996, the man
who had paid his tuition at Kansas City's Pembroke Hill School,
businessman Tom Grant, informed the NCAA, which did not object.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, the NCAA learned of a similar
relationship between Grant and Oklahoma State's Williams, and
tuition payments to a Maine prep school. Williams was suspended for
five games and ordered to repay $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The differences in the two cases are difficult to see. The NCAA
will not discuss the details of individual cases. But after
Oklahoma State beat Kansas on Friday in the Big 12 Tournament,
Williams said he wasn't surprised more cases came to light after
his suspension and the suspensions of the Rush brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much out there not to look at it deeper,''
Williams said.

 NCAA's QUEST TO ENFORCE RULES ON AMATEURISM UNSETTLES COLLEGE (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS, KATIE FUNK, HOWARD RICHMAN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ More such cases could emerge, even as the
NCAA prepares for this year's national championship tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star surveyed the top 25 men's teams on the Jan.
17 Associated Press poll. Of about 350 players on those teams, 35
had attended prep schools or private high schools recognized for
their basketball programs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the colleges contacted _ including top-ranked Cincinnati
_ did not return phone calls when they learned The Star wanted to
speak with players who had attended prep schools. In other
instances, spokesmen refused to set up interviews with such
players.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's vigilance also opens questions for players now in
prep schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Shaun Dunson, a former Pembroke Hill School
basketball player and 1999 graduate, is being recruited by several
big-time schools, according to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Like Williams and the Rush brothers, Dunson knows Kansas City
businessman Grant, who paid his tuition to Maine Central Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Dunson said recently he is not concerned because his
relationship with Grant goes back to when he was 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Caron Butler, one of the nation's top prep school players, who
signed to play at defending national champion Connecticut, could
soon find himself in the NCAA's headlights.
</P>
<P>
   The Bray Center, a private non-profit community center in
Racine, Wis., partly financed Butler's tuition at Maine Central
Institute, said Jameel Ghuari, the center's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Ghuari said the Bray Center had paid part of Butler's tuition
last year, but that its auditors said it couldn't help one person
without offering help to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Caron is paying this year. Bray Center isn't
contributing money,'' Ghuari said. Prep school defenders
</P>
<P>
   Much of this year's drama has focused on the role of expensive
prep schools, which can enforce academic discipline on a poor
student and expose a promising athlete to top competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors that help such students need to be encouraged, said
Gibbons, the recruiting analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth of the matter is this nation's public school system is
not working properly, and some aren't meeting the requirements of
NCAA standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ghuari said prep schools are important to big colleges because
they deliver players with four years of eligibility, rather than
the two years that a player retains after attending junior college.
</P>
<P>
   After prep school, he said, ``kids have four years to play, five
years to get a degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Good, once the head coach at Maine Central and now an
assistant coach at Nevada-Las Vegas, bristles when critics describe
Maine Central as a ``basketball factory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here for social growth and academic growth,'' Good said.
``We (would not) take kids just to have a good basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tolliver, who wants to play big-time ball after
finishing at Virginia's Fork Union Military Academy, has found the
prep-school experience valuable. His tuition was paid for by a
partial scholarship and contributions from the nearby West Bottom
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Tolliver said he wears a uniform every day: gray pants, brown
shirt, black jacket, gray hat and black gloves. Students march for
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go to (Fork Union) because I wanted to get better
by going against the best competition,'' Tolliver said. ``This is
pretty much like a college.''
</P>
<P>
   Jankowski of the NCAA said that ``with the heightened
attention,'' schools might want to work with the NCAA to make
certain the players they're recruiting will be eligible. In search
of fairness
</P>
<P>
   Jankowski acknowledged the NCAA has broken some new ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's different is the complex nature of these cases,'' she
said. ``They involve sums of money and other individuals who have
been involved which we haven't seen a lot of. I'm referring to
outside individuals that a prospective athlete is not legally
dependent on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghuari, who has coached traveling summer teams with shoe company
sponsorship, has a solution.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to see youth league coaches who develop the athletes
to be among those who pull down big money in college basketball,
like CBS and the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Without top-quality athletes, he argues, there would be no $6
billion TV contract with CBS for March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money and power,'' Ghuari said.
</P>
<P>
   But through a survey of its members last year, the NCAA made it
clear that it wants to reduce the influence of summer league,
non-scholastic coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NCAA is conflicted about its role.
</P>
<P>
   Made up of member universities and governed by college
presidents, the NCAA has charged its staff to enforce the
amateurism rules as they are now. But in the coming months, the
NCAA will consider revamping those rules, even to the point of
allowing players to return to the college game after playing a year
of pro ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all this publicity, it's possible the membership might
want to look at this,'' Jankowski said.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason for the publicity and hot comments from coaches
and others may stem from a change in philosophy by NCAA enforcers,
records in the Williams case show.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 13 letter to the NCAA, Oklahoma State's Gerald Lage
argued that the NCAA had changed its view of existing relationships
without notifying Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fairness mandates that consideration be given to the
reasonableness of Mr. Grant's reliance on the actions (or
inactions) of the enforcement staff,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness. That's what everybody wants.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent web chat by the basketball coaches association
Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened Pandora's Box. I don't know if we have the time or
the enforcement staff to investigate every kid that goes to prep
schools. Are we going to legislate for prep schools or against
them? That is the question.''

GAME SHOW CONTESTANT MISSES $125,000 GUESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ It was an expensive lesson in classical music
one that cost him $93,000 - but Shane Demmitt of Northridge still
felt rich Friday after appearing this week on ABC's wildly popular
quiz show, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   It was Demmitt's final answer - and ultimate decision to bypass
his last lifeline - that cost the Loyola Law School student much of
his $125,000 prize money when he missed a question about composers
of requiem Masses. The result? He walked away with a paltry
$32,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to try for the $1 million because it's a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Demmitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four composers that he had to choose from - Brahms,
Mozart, Rossini and Verdi - Demmitt guessed it was Guiseppe Verdi
who had never written a requiem Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that your final answer?'' asked host Regis Philbin. The
correct answer is Rossini.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin reminded the 28-year-old second-year law student that he
had a remaining ``lifeline'' that would allow him to eliminate two
of the choices for the $250,000 question, but Demmitt declined.
</P>
<P>
   He could have stopped. He could have walked away with the
$125,000. He knew he didn't know beans about composers. Why take a
$93,000 guess?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the doubts of mystified viewers, Demmitt said there was
a method to his apparent madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to take a shot at the million because a lot of
things had been going right,'' Demmitt said Friday. He believed the
final lifeline would not have helped, and thought it better to save
it for one of the final two questions for $500,000 and $1 million,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played it up to that point the way I was planning to play
it, to get in position for the million,'' he explained. ``Had that
question come up one question later, I would have walked.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the plan: If he made it to a quarter-million, he would
quit and keep the money if the questions looked too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Demmitt, the contestant's sister, had nothing but praise
for her brother's shot at the big money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really impressed with the outcome ... he just put it so
eloquently: He didn't look at it as losing $93,000, he looked at it
as gaining $32,000,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Demmitt, his sister and his girlfriend, Jenni Mischel, watched
the show with friends at Demmitt's Northridge condominium Thursday.
Other than Mischel, no one knew the outcome of the game, which was
taped in New York on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was, like, leaning into the TV,'' said Susan Demmitt.
On the last question, ``when his answer lit up, I thought he got it
right, then I saw the other answer in green, and I was just
devastated. I was, like, oh, God, because it was, like, so much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many events that boosted Demmitt's confidence was his
winning the ``fastest finger competition,'' which requires 10
potential contestants to arrange four items in a certain order.
</P>
<P>
   For Demmitt, he had to list heist movies in the reverse order of
their release. The film buff correctly guessed ``Entrapment,''
``Dead Presidents,'' ``A Fish Called Wanda'' and ``Oceans 11,'' and
did it in the fastest time possible.
</P>
<P>
   To reach that point, he had to answer similar questions by
phone. He guessed at some questions, which prospective contestants
answer by punching telephone buttons at home.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round, which he qualified for by repeatedly dialing
the show's toll-free number, he was faced with organizing sandwich
spreads according to their introduction on the market. Heinz
ketchup was first, he reasoned, because he remembered seeing a date
on a bottle, then Welch's Grape Jelly because, well, wine-making
had been around for centuries. Then it was between Jif and Skippy
peanut butter, and he figured that Jif was a more modern-sounding
name.
</P>
<P>
   On the final question that he missed, Demmitt had to do a
similar set of calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking that the answer was probably one of the two
Italians,'' in part because their culture had advanced more quickly
and he believed their art would be more secular in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was up to one of his five pre-picked ``phone-a-friends''
to bail him out. He chose Robert Nissenbaum, director of the law
library at his own Loyola School of Law in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane didn't really have a classical music buff on his list,''
Nissenbaum said. ``In my mind it was Verdi or Rossini, and I
flipped a coin in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   After the taping, ``my dad told me, '$125,000 isn't a
life-altering amount of money, but $1 million is,''' Demmitt said.
``Hell, I'm in law school, maybe I'll be making that $93,000 when I
get out.''

WINTER TEMPERATURES SET RECORD THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ Overall, this winter has been warmer than
average in the San Fernando Valley, one of the warmest ever in
California and the hottest in 105 years of record-keeping across
the nation, climatologists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A new report from the National Climatic Data Center attributed
the national warming trend - the third consecutive record-breaking
warm winter - to a transition phase from El Nino to La Nina and
global warming possibly caused by destruction of the ozone layer by
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the global warming skeptics have come around and said:
'Yeah, things are happening,''' said Mike Changery, chief of the
Climate Monitoring Branch of the data center, a division of the
National Weather Service. ``What's not answered by all of this is:
Is it part of a cyclical pattern, or are there human influences?''
</P>
<P>
   Until recent weeks of wet and cold weather, the national trend
played out in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   Weather watchers at Pierce College said December in the Valley
was 1.6 degrees warmer than the historical average for that month
and January was 1 degree warmer.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the three-month period was the fifth warmest in
105 years, with an average temperature of 48.2 degrees. The state's
hottest winter on record was in 1990-91 with an average temperature
of 49.2 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the average temperature for the months of December,
January and February in the United States was 38.4 degrees,
six-tenths of a degree higher than the previous record set in
1998-99 and nine-tenths of a degree warmer than the record holder
before that, 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   All 48 states in the continental United States were warmer than
average, with one, but only one, Oklahoma, recording its hottest
year ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many states were so close to the top that it made the
winter season the warmest overall,'' said Changery.
</P>
<P>
   The records cap a warming trend seen since the mid-1970s. Before
that, there had been a general nationwide cooling trend extending
back about 20 years. Changery said the temperature increase in the
latest warming trend has been much stronger than those seen in the
early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists cautioned against reading a global warming
scenario into the recent record-breaking string of winters. Jet
Propulsion Laboratory ocean scientist Bill Patzert said what could
be happening globally is not a general warming but simply a
rearrangement of worldwide weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the United States has three warm winters, it
doesn't mean global warming necessarily,'' he said. ``Asia has had
a really cold winter.''
</P>
<P>
   La Nina is blamed for California's wacky weather. Southern
California had an unusually dry, warm fall. But a cold snap in
February drove that month's temperature to 2.3 degrees below
normal.
</P>
<P>
   And now an expected La Nina pattern has temporarily waned,
allowing the jet stream to dip south and send winter storms to
California.
</P>
<P>
   But, overall, the jet stream's dodge of the United States has
been responsible for record-breaking warmth the past two winters.
The cold-bearing wind blowing high in the atmosphere stayed north
of the Canadian border, Changery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just never made its southern excursion this winter like it
normally would,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Climate forecasters predict next winter will see a return to
more normal temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Laver, deputy director of the Climate Prediction Center,
another branch of the National Weather Service, said he doubts next
year's winter will have what it takes to set another record.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into next winter, I think we're thinking now that
it should be kind of a neutral winter,'' Lavin said. ``That could
be one of the things that might break that string. One thing that
would be interesting is if it doesn't break that string.''

INTERIM CHANCELLOR IS GAINING SUPPORT FOR PERMANENT JOB, OFFICIALS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After just seven weeks at the helm of the New York
City school system, interim Chancellor Harold O. Levy has emerged
as the front-runner for permanent chancellor, and would win the
support of a majority of the Board of Education _ if he wants the
job, high-level education officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They said that in a short period, Levy had embarked on an
ambitious agenda _ setting tougher standards for the performance of
superintendents, vowing to move more quickly to remove incompetent
teachers and taking aim at the unwieldy central bureaucracy. By
doing so, he has convinced at least four of the seven board members
that he has the management ability it will take to turn around the
ailing school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Harold wanted the job, he would be the instant
front-runner,'' one top Board of Education official said. ``We
could put a 4-3 vote together.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy has been coy about his intentions, and refused to comment
again Friday on whether he would be a candidate for the permanent
job.
</P>
<P>
   To seal his hold on the job, Levy would probably need the
blessing _ or at least the neutrality _ of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
Giuliani vociferously opposed Levy's interim appointment and has
not yet spoken with him. But, behind the scenes, the mayor's aides
have opened lines of communication with Levy and have expressed
approval of some of Levy's initiatives. When told of comments by
Board of Education officials that Levy had a good shot at the
permanent chancellorship, the mayor's office said diplomatically
Friday evening that it would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Giuliani's persistent public attacks on the Board of
Education, there are signs that he and Levy have found ways to work
together.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest indication, officials said, is their tentative
agreement to allow Randy Levine, until recently a deputy mayor and
still a trusted confidant of Giuliani, to negotiate the school
system's labor contract with the United Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   And opposition from Giuliani might not kill Levy's chances. The
limits of the mayor's power became clear in January, when Levy's
supporters managed a surprise defeat of Giuliani's candidate for
interim chancellor, by a 4-3 vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There have been a raft of other indications that Levy is no
ordinary temporary chancellor, biding his time until a permanent
successor is chosen. He has won favorable notices from the
editorial boards of all four of the city's major daily newspapers.
He has not been shy about appearing in public in his new role, much
as a candidate might campaign for public office. In the next few
weeks, he has scheduled speaking engagements with influential civic
and business groups.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Thompson Jr., president of the board, said Friday
that the board had no intention of anointing Levy and that it would
be up to him to come forward as a candidate if he wanted to stay
past June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the beginning of a search process,'' Thompson said.
``If Harold said, `Gee, I would like to be considered,' we wouldn't
stop that process. Then it's a question of whether the board would
want to interview Harold and put him into that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, just that willingness to consider the possibility of a
Levy candidacy is a shift. Until now, Thompson has insisted that
Levy was chosen as an interim chancellor, and that it would be
far-fetched to imagine him as anything more. Under the new
thinking, Levy could count on the same four votes he got in
January, including Thompson's. Education officials added, however,
that a strong challenger to Levy could still emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said that whatever Levy's thoughts, it would do
him little good to express them: if he says he wants the job this
early in the game, it may sound like hubris; if he doesn't, he
becomes even more of a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   But some education officials have wondered all along why Levy
would have taken an expensive leave of absence from his job as a
corporate lawyer and manager for Citigroup if he did not have
longer-term aspirations to the job.
</P>
<P>
   Because he lacked formal education experience, Levy was required
under state law to get a waiver from the state education
commissioner to become chancellor. Although the contract granted to
him by the Board of Education in January is good for only six
months, the waiver is permanent.

JURY GETS SHOOTOUT CASE: POLICE CONDUCT CALLED ATROCIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; L &LR; OS ANGELES _ After the ``worst bank robbery in the history
of the world,'' police in effect got away with murder by allowing
the gunman in the 1997 North Hollywood shootout to bleed to death,
an attorney told a federal jury Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Stephen Yagman said police allowed Emil Matasareanu,
30, to die a ``tortured, prolonged death'' as officers told a
paramedic to get out of the area and lit up what appeared to be a
cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two Los Angeles Police Department officers have
figuratively gotten away with murder so far,'' Yagman said in
closing arguments of the civil rights lawsuit brought by
Matasareanu's children. ``Their conduct was atrocious.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys for retired policemen John Futrell and James
Vojtecky said some of the 17 victims wounded in the shootout had to
wait up to 2 hours to get help and the available paramedics treated
those with the most serious wounds who they thought would survive.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Bradley C. Gage, who is representing Futrell, said
officers and paramedics waited to treat or move Matasareanu because
he had 29 bullet holes in him, weighed 280 pounds, bled more when
he moved and had what appeared to be a ``booby trap'' belt on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the worst bank robbery in the history of the world
and that changes everything,'' Gage said. Officers were reluctant
to call medical personnel to the scene because of police radio
reports of a third masked gunman in the area, Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Yagman said he believes six people were involved
and four took part in the robbery. He said they were working for
the Montana Militia.
</P>
<P>
   After nine hours of closing arguments Friday, the case was sent
to the six-man, six-woman jury. They begin deliberations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The bank robbery took place on Feb. 28, 1997, when Matasareanu
and Larry Eugene Phillips, 26, used automatic weapons to hold off
police for nearly an hour as they tried to get away. The gun battle
spilled onto residential streets and was televised live to a
national audience.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether 17 people, including 11 officers, were wounded and
the two gunmen died.
</P>
<P>
   Yagman said the jurors must decide if the officers showed
``deliberate indifference'' to the plight of Matasareanu.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant City Attorney Donald Vincent, who represents
Vojtecky, said that of the 26 witnesses in this case, none proved
allegations of deliberate indifference.

MICROSCOPIC BEADS SUGGEST METEOR BOMBARDMENT PLAYED ROLE
IN  EARTH'S ABUNDANCE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiny glass-like beads that formed millions of years ago when
comets and meteors gouged deep craters on the moon and Earth have
revealed a surprising role those bombardments played in the
emergence of Earth's abundant life, a team of scientists from
Berkeley, Calif., suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The glassy objects _ so tiny that only microscopes can reveal
their details _ were brought back from the moon by Apollo
astronauts 30 years ago when manned space flight was in its
infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Four Berkeley scientists using new techniques to date the
objects have found that both the Earth and moon came under a
suddenly intensified bombardment just as a burst of diversified
plant and animal life on Earth began about 500 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of widely varied primitive life forms is known as
the ``Cambrian explosion.'' The fossil record indicates it
continued to produce more and more newly evolved plants and animals
_ the ancestors of all life on Earth today _ for about 10 million
years.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the bombardment on the Earth's environment might
have been so severe, researchers speculate, that it could have
caused major changes in the climate that forced some organisms to
disappear, while others adapted and diversified.
</P>
<P>
   The research was reported Friday in the journal Science by a
group headed by Paul Renne, director of the Berkeley Geochronology
Center, an independent research center, and three colleagues on the
University of California campus, where Renne is an adjunct
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the glassy beads, known as spherules, were formed by
cratering impacts on the Earth and moon about 4 billion years ago,
when all the newly made planets were under constant bombardment by
meteoroids and comets.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of those violent crater-forming impacts have long since
vanished from the Earth's surface as upheavals of new continents,
volcanic eruptions and earthquakes churned the surface of the young
planet again and again.
</P>
<P>
   But on the sterile, quiescent lunar surface the craters are
still a major feature of the moonscape. The Berkeley team's
analysis of 155 tiny spherules in moon rocks carried home by the
Apollo 14 crew have revealed two major episodes of crater-forming
bombardments from space.
</P>
<P>
   The first began during the early days of the solar system about
4.5 billion years ago. The impacts continued for nearly a billion
years before they waned _ just at the time when life first emerged
on Earth, Renne noted.
</P>
<P>
   By dating spherules from some of the moon's younger craters, the
researchers have concluded that the crater-forming bombardments
increased unexpectedly again about 500 million years ago and
continued through the time of the Cambrian explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So life may have arisen on the Earth many times, to be wiped
out each time by the cratering impacts, and then may have arisen
again,'' Renne speculated in an interview. ``But just what role
those impacts played in evolution is still open to question.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Renne's team are Richard Muller, a UC physicist
at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who conceived the idea
of using the spherules to calculate the timing of intense
bombardments from outer space; Timothy Culler, Muller's former UC
graduate student; and Timothy Becker, the manager of Renne's
Geochronology Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in cratering was roughly coincident with the
Cambrian explosion of complex life on Earth,`` Muller said
Thursday. ``As Darwin originally conceived evolution, survival of
the fittest meant superiority in conflict with other species. But
an increased crater rate also increases the stress on species to be
able to survive catastrophe. It is conceivable that this increased
stress helped drive evolution toward species with greater
adaptability and flexibility, away from instinct and toward greater
intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller is the physicist who has proposed what he calls the
``Nemesis Hypothesis,'' a theory that an unknown ``companion star''
orbits the sun every 26 million years from a distance of about 3
light years, or 18 trillion miles.
</P>
<P>
   Muller said he hoped to find evidence in the spherule ages of a
26 million-year period of increased cratering impacts that might
have been triggered by his ``Nemesis'' star.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he said, the accuracy of the spherule age dates is not
precise enough to support his hypothesis, although refining the
technique and analyzing more spherules may help. In the meantime,
he said, his own research group is in the process of building and
testing a new telescope that will soon be moved to a mountaintop
near Monterey, where it will hunt for the ``Nemesis'' star.

 CLEMENCY DENIED FOR KILLER OF 3 WOMEN AND GIRL  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Declaring that convicted murderer Darrell Rich acted in an
``almost unbelievably brutal manner,'' California Gov. Gray Davis
denied clemency Friday for the serial killer who is scheduled to be
executed next week.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's decision leaves the Cottonwood man with little
hope of avoiding a lethal injection in San Quentin's death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   His execution, set for 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, will come 19 years
after he was convicted of murdering three women and an 11-year-old
girl in Shasta County. He also was convicted of sexually assaulting
five other women during a grisly rampage in the summer of 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rich acted in a callous and almost unbelievably brutal
manner,'' Davis said in a statement accompanying his clemency
decision. ``There is absolutely nothing about Mr. Rich's brutal
behavior that warrants clemency,'' he concluded. ``Clemency is
denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich's lawyer, Jim Thomson of Berkeley, called the governor's
decision ``morally and legally unsupportable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clemency request, lawyers for the condemned man urged
Davis to follow the lead of Illinois Gov. Governor  &LR; George Ryan,
who imposed a moratorium in January on all executions until reforms
are made to the state's current death penalty system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Davis had the opportunity to lead this state out of the
19th century and into the 21st,'' Thomson said, ``and leading us
away from state-sanctioned killing that has been questioned and
repudiated throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson also was dismayed that the governor summarily rejected
Rich's argument that he is a changed man with an exemplary prison
record who has discovered his Indian heritage while behind bars.
Rich, who has adopted the name Young Elk, is one-quarter Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that every time he visits Rich, the inmate
expresses remorse for his grisly crime spree. ``This stuff haunts
him,'' Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
   Shasta County District Attorney McGregor Scott said he was
gratified by the governor's decision. ``If the death penalty is not
appropriate in this case, what case is it appropriate for?'' the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's decision comes four days after relatives of some
of Rich's victims implored Davis not to spare the inmate's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives have been changed forever,'' Twyla Yates cq &LR;  told
the state Board of Prison Terms at Monday's clemency hearing.
Yates's daughter Linda Slavik, a 28-year-old wife and mother, was
kidnapped, raped and shot to death by Rich. Her body was left in a
garbage dump along with another of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The execution of the animal who caused so much heartache will
finally bring closure,'' she told the board.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted unanimously to recommend that the governor deny
Rich's clemency request.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state filed a petition yesterday arguing against
Rich's request that he observe last rites at a Native American
sweat lodge on prison grounds. In a lawsuit he filed in federal
court, Rich said the ceremony represents his only opportunity to
make ``amends with those he has wronged and with his Creator.''
</P>
<P>
   But in its response, the state yesterday filed a declaration
from a Cherokee Nation official, who called Rich's argument
``hogwash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say with assurance that it has no religious significance
to the Cherokee people,'' Richard Allen said in court statement. A
judge will rule on Rich's request Monday.

THEATER OWNERS GET BOOST FROM STARS, THEIR STUDIOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _  &LR; He may have gotten snubbed by Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences voters, but theater owners love Jim
Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   So making like an overly sincere beauty queen, Carrey vowed to
``strive to complete (his) duties as Star of the Year over the next
12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey reeled off a list of things he would do to be more
``star-like,'' such as getting his teeth capped and his face
lifted, ``so I look more star-like.'' It doesn't matter that his
acceptance speech came at the annual theater owners convention
Showest awards banquet at Las Vegas' Paris Hotel. An award is an
award.
</P>
<P>
   And the winners aren't surprised when their names are announced:
That's known well in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a lively affair nonetheless, as stars let down their
hair with the folks who actually support those big paychecks of
theirs: theater owners.
</P>
<P>
   This year's event was hosted by the dryly witty Martin Mull, who
lampooned star-struck attendees by asking to have his picture taken
with the audience and joked that he was often up for the same roles
as winners Ving Rhames and Hilary Swank.
</P>
<P>
   After Comedy Star of the Year Drew Barrymore gushed that she
tried to be ``reincarnative'' of grandfather John Barrymore, Mull
quipped that he wondered if reincarnative was really a word - but
that he would never forget Barrymore saying, ``I live to please
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the statues were handed out by powerful
behind-the-scenes Hollywood folks you won't see on your standard
awards show. Supporting Actor of the Year Rhames received his
statue from Paramount Pictures Chairwoman Sherry Lansing. She
managed to find several opportunities to mention Rhames' role in
the upcoming ``Mission Impossible T2.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer of the Year Armyan Bernstein (``End of Days,'' ``The
Hurricane'') was introduced by Ron Meyer, president of Universal
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   This was a business convention, after all. Studio executives
want theater owners to know they are appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the female winners - Annette Bening, Swank and Angelina
Jolie - are considered Oscar front-runners, which often translates
into additional revenue for the people who show the films.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hectic and well-compensated work schedules, all showed
up - even Bening, named actress of the year, who was radiant and
very, very pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hesitant to fly here. But now that I've experienced this
moment, I'm so glad I did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks' ``American Beauty,'' considered a leader in the race
for the Best Picture Oscar, was the only film to spawn two winners:
Bening and screenwriter Alan Ball.

 AT S.F. MEETING, PRO-CHOICE GOP WOMEN LAMENT THEIR BITTER DILEMMA  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ State Assemblywoman Sue Jackson from Monte
Sereno put it best Friday when she described what it's like to be
pro-choice and a Republican in the election year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like to have things thrown at you?'' she said with a
wry laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But for Jackson and a corps of Republican women who sat at the
annual Power of Choice luncheon Friday, sponsored by the National
Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League in San Francisco, the
joke is more than painful.
</P>
<P>
   The NARAL gathering brought together nearly 1,000 pro-choice
women _ Republicans and Democrats alike _ to assess the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   And with Texas Gov. George W. Bush now the presumptive nominee
of the Republican Party, those GOP pro-choice women _ politically
active, educated and willing to write campaign checks _ appeared
especially frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   They say that in his haste to seize the anti-abortion mantle and
court the Christian right in the primaries just past, Bush has made
them unwelcome in their own party. And they fear he has irrevocably
damaged the GOP's presidential chances in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republican women, if they really vote their conscience, they
will have to go with Al Gore,'' said Dagmar Dolby, one of the
nation's leading abortion rights activists and an influential
Republican voice in San Francisco. Dolby _ the wife of sound
pioneer Ray Dolby _ said that although she has proudly held to the
GOP since 1982, when she became a citizen, she recently took the
step, for the first time, to register as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can no longer be part of the party,'' said Dolby this week.
``It's not just the choice issue. It's the whole social agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   At the NARAL lunch, Dolby told the gathering of women that,
sadly, '`reproductive rights have been made into a political
football.''
</P>
<P>
   And she was hardly alone in her anger on that front.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; California's Gender Gap
</P>
<P>
   In California, the abortion issue holds enormous sway among
women who have provided a crucial ``gender gap'' margin-of-victory
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Seven in 10 Californians support abortion rights, a factor that
played heavily in the 1998 governor's race. Republican candidate
Dan Lungren learned that firsthand when he paid for ads that
outlined his anti-abortion position to state voters _ and went down
to a historic landslide defeat to Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, a
supporter of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the 2000 election approaches and with Bush having
wrapped up the GOP nomination, many Republican women worry that the
party is simply hitting the rewind button on the issue all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just handed the election to Al Gore,'' said Honor
Bulkley, a Republican supporter of the ``Wish List,'' the GOP
version of EMILY's list, an organization that raises money for
pro-choice female candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkley said that although she couldn't bring herself to vote
for Gore, she is seriously considering the other alternative _
sitting out the presidential vote altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Many who said they voted for John McCain _ who reached out to
pro-choice women better than Bush, in their eyes _ said they will
now reassess their options.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; A Promise to Fight
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson, one of the rare pro-choice GOP women who has been
elected to office in California, is one who said she doesn't intend
to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be damned if they'll take my party away from me,'' she
said. ``We will fight this on to Philadelphia,'' where the GOP will
hold its national convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and many others of the GOP women said the state of the
party today is particularly painful because at the start of his
presidential run Bush appeared on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   He said then that Americans were unlikely to support a
constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion, and he stressed that
he hoped to bring Americans together, even while they may not agree
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor faltered, they said, when he began
stepping to the right to win voters in Iowa and South Carolina,
saying that the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing
abortion was ``a reach'' and that he supported the GOP platform on
abortion, which makes no exceptions even in cases of rape and
incest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush wanted to, he could get rid of the whole GOP
platform altogether,'' said Carol Mayer Marshall, a former member
of the administration of Bush's father, former President George
Herbert Walker Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But in November 2000, she said, ``I don't see how (George W.)
will win California. Gore will be all over the choice issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On this, Democrats agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area has become a Republican free zone, because not
only are the Democrats and independents voting heavily democratic,
but many of the Republicans have had it with their party's
opposition to choice,'' said Bob Mulholland, campaign strategist
for the state Democratic Party. ``In 1996, the Republicans were in
a circle shooting each other on the issue. (Now) it's the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, who heads NARAL, lauded the GOP women for
continuing to fight for the issue, though their party _ and their
presumptive nominee _ seems not to hear. ``I hope to the GOP will
come back to its roots ... of respecting individual freedom, and
keeping government out of individual lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Michelman said her organization will now pay for a series of
advertisements to remind women _ Republican and Democrat alike _
what's now at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is for four years,'' she said. ``The Supreme
Court is for decades to come.''

<P>
   DENVER _ The emphatic success that Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas enjoyed in the Super Tuesday primaries
removed almost all relevance from Friday's balloting in Colorado,
Utah and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Any that was left dissipated on Thursday when their chief
competitors, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, called an end to their White House pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore and Bush won easily in Colorado and in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the Democrat piled up 71 percent of the vote and
the Republican 65 percent, with 100 percent of the precincts
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   With 98 percent of the precincts reporting in Utah, Gore had
polled 81 percent of the vote; for the Republicans, Bush had 63
percent and Alan Keyes 20 percent. It was Keyes' best outing.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, Republicans overwhelmingly supported Bush in a
nonbinding straw poll. He received 78 percent with 22 of the 23
county caucuses reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who swept all the Democratic contests on Tuesday, did not
campaign in Colorado or Utah this week. As the winner in all but
four of 13 Republican contests on Tuesday, Bush did, appearing at
rallies in Denver, Provo, Utah and Cheyenne, Wyo., where he struck
his familiar themes of tax breaks, strengthening the military and
criticizing Gore for his fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   In each state, Bush was joined by the governor, Republicans all,
who were among his campaign's earliest supporters: Bill Owens of
Colorado, Michael O. Leavitt of Utah and Jim Geringer of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until late Thursday that it became clear that Bush
would have the three states, as well as the rest of the country, to
himself without another major challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Freda Poundstone, McCain's Colorado coordinator, said she had
been expecting the senator to appear at rallies in Denver and
Colorado Springs, but then had to notify supporters that he was
withdrawing. The turnabout came too late for the campaign to pull
advertisements on Denver television stations, which ran late into
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not that McCain's decision seemed to matter much to voters
casting ballots Friday. In Colorado, for example, a poll published
in The Denver Post on Sunday showed Bush with the support of 55
percent of registered Republicans, compared with 29 percent for
McCain. The margin of error was plus or minus 6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, too, had been a heavy favorite in Colorado over Bradley,
by 66 percent to 24 percent in the same poll. It mattered less how
he stood in Utah and Wyoming even though he was the favorite in
both. They are heavily Republican states, and, like many other
Western states, are expected to support Bush in November.

   LOS ANGELES _ A rotten week rerun is nothing new for the Los
Angeles Clippers, who've been working on their sequel to
``Groundhog Day'' for about three months.
</P>
<P>
   But their five-day run of serial disaster is remarkably
grotesque - even by franchise standards.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was Shaquille O'Neal's birthday massacre. Wednesday was
death by Vince Carter. Thursday was relatively safe practice time
for the NBA's pre-draft-lottery favorites, who learned that Kenyon
Martin - the top suspect to be the No. 1 pick - achieved a broken
leg. TGIF, in this instance, represents ``Thank God It's Fibula,''
because a knee injury could be far worse.
</P>
<P>
   Friday produced nothing more than a blown 20-point,
third-quarter lead, a disturbing turnaround that enabled the
Charlotte Hornets to finish off the Clips, 118-101, before 15,362
at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It's high time for ``Headband Night'' at Staples, a promotion
that would enable Clipper fans to use this freebie to cover their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The home team managed to go 3 for their last 35 games in the
usual way - have a swell first half that includes early foul
trouble for Michael Olowokandi, flirt with victory for a portion of
the second half, then disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest disgusting performance featured the aforementioned
20- point, third-quarter (ahem) cushion that was erased by
Charlotte (34-28) before the fourth period began. Riding the end of
pencil was rookie point guard Baron Davis (19 points), who narrowly
avoided employment on Planet Clipper when Charlotte passed on
selecting Lamar Odom in last summer's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips (12-50) played without lame duck Maurice Taylor, who
called in sick. His power forward gig was taken by mighty Pete
Chilcutt (8 points, 8 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   With Taylor at home, Tyrone Nesby (20 points) became the
self-designated trigger man, and produced 13 points in the first
quarter. The Clippers committed no turnovers and shot 52.6 percent
from the field to lead, 32-26, going into round two.
</P>
<P>
   Round two yielded another victory for the Clippers, who led by
as many as 11 points three times. Two of those advantages were
earned on 15-foot jumpers by CBA evacuee point guard Jeff McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson (24 points) finished the half with 18 points to
lead the Clippers, who made 54.5 percent of their field-goal
attempts and held a 52-46 edge. Odom (10 points, 10 assists, 10
rebounds) didn't scratch in the first half, but did hand out 7
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Coleman (31 points) had 17 to pace the Hornets. Former
Laker hero Eddie Jones (21 points) made just 1 of 8 shots to slow
down the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers started pouring it on in the third, Odom's 3-point
shot boosting the lead to 69-49 at the quarter's 9:50 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Led Davis, the Hornets rallied, closing to within six at 77-71
with 4:31 before the fourth quarter. Davis, who abandoned UCLA
after two seasons, had 8 points in that run.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers continued to crumble, and Jones scored on a
fast-break layup to put the Hornets ahead for the first time,
82-81, at 1:11 of the third. Davis scored after slick crossover
dribble with two seconds left in the period to give himself a dozen
points in the quarter and provide Charlotte with an 86-83 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter was amazing 12 minutes of garbage time.

PANTHERS CLAIM KINGS' BARRIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Len Barrie, the journeyman center recalled in
November when the Los Angeles Kings' first line was wiped out by
injuries, was claimed on waivers on Friday by the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie, 30, did not score much in 46 games with the Kings, just
five goals and 13 points. However, he did provide grit to the third
and fourth lines after Jozef Stumpel returned to the first unit.
</P>
<P>
   His spot was vacated in the event the Kings are able to make a
trade by Tuesday's deadline. However, coach Andy Murray said that
is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very disappointing day for me; very sad,'' Barrie
said before boarding a flight to South Florida. ``We were building
something special here. I will miss them and I think they will miss
me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrie was placed on waivers Wednesday and the club was hoping
he would clear during the 48-hour waiver period. But he was picked
up by the Panthers, a club he spoke to last summer before signing
with the Kings after playing two years in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if there is an upside, it is that I am going from one
playoff team to another,'' Barrie said. ``I played for (Panthers
coach)Bryan Murray so I know what to expect. But you really want to
finish what you started.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were the fourth club for Barrie, whose up-and-down NHL
career began in 1989-90 with Philadelphia. He played briefly for
the Panthers in 1993-94 and also the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the season with minor-league Long Beach and was the
leading scorer in the International Hockey League at the time of
his recall. Barrie was a gifted scorer in the minors, but he had
difficulty taking his game to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't going to start on either of our first two lines, but
he worked well on the third and fourth lines and was a great guy to
have on a hockey club,''said Andy Murray, who met with Barrie at
the club's El Segundo practice facility before preparing the Kings
for tonight's game against the Calgary Flames. ``Lennie helped
create a chemistry in the dressing room and that is something we
are going to miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Barrie rarely scored, he did have his moments. On
Jan.6, he scored two goals in a 4-2 victory over Florida and said
later there was an added incentive playing against a team that
snubbed him during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Feb 25, before 35 friends and family members from his
home in nearby Victoria, B.C., Barrie scored the first goal in a
5-2 victory against the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Quick whistles: Barrie is a free agent at the end of the season
and said the Kings would be the first team he'll contact....
Goaltender Stephane Fiset, sidelined since last Saturday with a
strained right groin, hopes to resume workouts Monday and could be
ready to return to action by the end of next week.... General
manager Dave Taylor sent faxes to the other 27 clubs notifying them
that disgruntled winger Donald Audette has requested a trade.
Taylor said he has not received any replies and expects Audette to
remain with the club. Audette returned to the second line Thursday
after a two-game benching and had an assist.

LAKERS STREAK PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers' latest flirtation with
history is being treated much the same as their prior ones - with a
smile and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   Their 17-game winning streak is tied for sixth-longest in the
NBA record books, second longest in Lakers lore. But if it means
anything to him,Kobe Bryant isn't letting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got 17 wins in a row. We have a lot of room for
improvement, so we don't have time to really sit back and think
about what we're doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When might the Lakers sit back and be impressed with the
achievement?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the season,'' said Bryant, ``when we're popping
champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory Sunday against the visiting Sacramento Kings, and the
Lakers would match the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' 18-game streak, which
preceded a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Two more wins after that - at Denver and Washington - would move
the Lakers into truly select company.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams have ever won 20 or more in a row - the 1970-71
Milwaukee Bucks, who won 20, and the 1971-72 Lakers, who won an
NBA- record 33.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper was part of the Bulls' 18-game streak, so the Lakers'
run ``doesn't faze me at all. I mean, this is a long year. It's
nice we get these 17 games in a row things, but the main priority
is to play later on this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson not only coached that Bulls' streak, but he
was alsoa member of the 1969-70 New York Knicks team that won a
then-record 18 in a row on the way to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   He called the Lakers' 17-game run ``nice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big number. I was in the league when 18 was the
largest number, and we used to think that was an incredible number
of games won. But then the Lakers in '71-72 just blew it out. It's
incredible to run up this number of wins, because it says that we
haven't been defeated now in almost six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' last loss was Feb. 1, at San Antonio. Their last
home loss was Jan. 22, against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   How does the streak compare to the Bulls'?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like this,'' Jackson said. ``We were playing a little
bit higher intensity, perhaps. This is a team that can grind things
out, very economically, actually, if they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Fading Blazers: Portland is still the Lakers' closest rival, but
the margin is 4 games in the wake of the Lakers' streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awesome thing for them,'' Jackson said. ``I know it's
affecting their morale a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said the extra breathing room is ``nice, but as far as
thinking about where their mentality is and where their head is, I
don't really care.''

BRUINS BEAT HURRICANES

<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ The winds of change, blowing with hurricane
force these days around the Bruins, roared again Friday night with
news here, following Boston's 5-3 win over Carolina, that Rob
DiMaio was traded to the New York Rangers for strapping right wing
Mike Knuble.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio, a top checker and grinder for the Bruins the last four
seasons, will fly to Pittsburgh this Saturday morning and is
expected to suit up for the Blueshirts Saturday night against the
Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hasn't hit me yet,'' said a somewhat stunned but
upbeat DiMaio, exchanging farewell handshakes with his teammates as
they boarded a bus that transported them to a charter flight to
Montreal. ``It's part of the game, I guess, just the way things
work. Things are happening around here fast and furious. I guess
this is just part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   For two of his seasons in Black and Gold, DiMaio was a key
contributor on a third line with center Tim Taylor. He now will be
reunited with Taylor in New York, presumably again on the No. 3
line, assigned to cover the top scoring trios among the rest of the
Original 28.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Knuble, ex- of the University of Michigan, began
his career with the Red Wings, who made him the 76th pick in the
'91 draft. He won a Stanley Cup with the Red Wings in the 1997-98
season and then was swapped to the Blueshirts for a draft pick Oct.
1, 1998. A potential power forward, if he can pick up his
intensity, the 6-foot-3-inch Knuble likely will be in Montreal
Saturday night when the Bruins face the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   The move was made, from strictly a personnel standpoint, for
size. The 32-year-old DiMaio is only 5-10, but plays an aggressive
game that most nights makes him look 4 or 5 inches taller. He backs
down from no one. He and defenseman Don Sweeney have been the
club's two grittiest and most consistent performers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knuble's big, I like his size,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``We
need that.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio also has been blunt, and that made him a more likely
candidate to get the gate. In the hours leading up to and after Ray
Bourque's trade to Colorado, DiMaio once more expressed his concern
(i.e. dismay) over management's failure to fill out the roster and
make the Bruins legitimate contenders. It wasn't quite akin to Adam
Oates's outburst prior to his being dealt in '97, but it was blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just being honest, that's all,'' said DiMaio, asked
again about those comments as he exchanged farewells. ``I certainly
wasn't trying to burn bridges or anything. I hope it's not the
reason I was traded, but who's to say? Boston was a great city for
me. I loved my time there. I had great teammates, great coaches. It
was just a great experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt his comments ultimately were the reason he was
shown the door, DiMaio said, ``Hey, I didn't say anything that no
one else has said. I reiterated some things that others have said,
and some of those have been reiterated to the public of late.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio was referring, of course, to Bourque's comments in
Tuesday's Lawrence Eagle Tribune, when he warned that his trade was
``just the start'' of things to come and that players around the
league no longer wanted to play in Boston. Bourque soon backed off
those statements, but only slightly, and Boston president/general
manager Harry Sinden said he didn't believe Bourque made those
comments.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio, hindered with a hand injury the last two weeks, did not
play in the victory here. He said the hand has healed, will not
need surgery (once a prospect), and he intends to suit up Saturday
night. It will be his second tour in the New York metropolitian
area, having begun his career with the Islanders as a 1987 draft
pick.

CELTICS BURY BULLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was how the Celtics thought it would be against the Bulls.
They played some role reversal with Chicago in their first two
meetings, but Friday night, the planets were in order and
everything went according to Hoyle.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, of course, are thinking about next August, which
makes games in March somewhat problematic and inherently difficult.
The Celtics are still thinking about making the playoffs, which
makes it a lot easier. It showed. They wanted this one. The Bulls
didn't care. They were in ``warm up the plane'' mode for the final
36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a thorough 104-74 drubbing that was over in the
first half. That is the harsh truth, harsher still given the
Celtics' affinity for blowing late, 20-something leads at home.
Boston led by 11 after one, 21 at the half, 28 after three and,
really, it was all ceremonial the rest of the way. Pervis Ellison
even got in the game for 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I like about this game is that when we got the
lead, we stayed with it, stayed aggressive all night,'' said Paul
Pierce, who had 15 points. ``We got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was the Celtics' third straight and kept them three
games (in the loss column) out of the coveted No. 8 playoff spot.
They got some help from Indiana, which beat Cleveland, and from the
Nets, who beat the Bucks. Orlando was idle.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics felt they were owed this one. ``We let two games
against them get away,'' said Kenny Anderson, who had a team-high
16 points. ``We had to take advantage this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Antoine Walker, who had 9 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 steals
in 28 minutes, ``This was definitely revenge. We wanted to make a
statement that we are tough and that the other two games were a
fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   You know it's a long night when Bulls coach Tim Floyd has to go
to his bench _ and his bench is as good (or bad) as his regulars.
Even celebrated rookie Elton Brand was in a funk; he had a
rotisserie 16/9, but was 6 of 19 from the field and was kept off
the offensive glass, where he has made a nice living this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming out at me a lot,'' said Brand. ``They really
came at me tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Celtics spread the wealth like Marxists with
eight players scoring between 8 and 16 points. They didn't shoot as
well as they might have liked _ 45 percent _ but it hardly matters
when your opponent shoots worse (38 percent), can't handle the ball
(26 turnovers leading to a whopping 32 points), can't pass (14
assists), and missed all four of its 3-point attempts. Other than
that, the Bulls were luminous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed with the effort,'' said Floyd, who
had every right to be. ``That was a ridiculous performance. There
are no excuses. Guys come. Guys go. At this level, you're supposed
to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, looking for payback and to stay in the playoff
frame (as opposed to picture), dominated from start to finish. They
never trailed, led by 15 before the game was nine minutes old, by
23 in the second, and by a comfy 37 midway through the fourth.
Chicago trailed by 28 after three and opened the fourth by missing
six shots, turning it over three times, and scoring a single point
in the first five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was what we've come to expect of the Bulls, who entered the
game having lost nine of 10 and with the worst record in the
conference. They had lost two nights earlier in Orlando by 36, and
have now lost 18 games by 15 or more points and 13 by 20 or more.
This one was their third worst of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Where to begin? The Celtics led, 13-10, and then scored 11
unanswered points, starting with an Anderson hoop. Chicago had four
turnovers in the run, which featured 4 points from Pierce (5 of 11
in 30 minutes). Danny Fortson (14 points, 7 rebounds, 6 fouls in 25
minutes) finished it off with a pair of free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics got the lead to 15 before a pair of hoops by
legendary Celtic-killer Chris Anstey brought Chicago back to within
31-20 after one. That margin would look mighty good to Chicago in a
few minutes. Over the final 36 minutes, it never got closer than
that.

CRITICAL TIME FOR BELTRE TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ On the eve of possibly signing a three-year
contract that could pay him anywhere between $5 and $10 million,
Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre admitted feeling
anxiety about possibly ending the five-month soap opera that has
surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly and Scott
Boras, Beltre's agent, worked deep into Friday night, trying to
resolve the issue before today's soft deadline imposed by both
sides. Today also is the major-league-mandated deadline to renew
the contracts of players with three years or less of service time,
or lose them to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little anxious about it, a little nervous,'' Beltre
said. ``I want to know what's going to happen. Sometimes at night I
think about it a little bit. But when I'm on the field and playing,
it doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Boras spoke each of the past few days in an attempt to
reach an agreement. The Dodgers are willing to pay Beltre $5
million, but Boras is asking for nearly $10 million, baseball
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Though both sides are hoping a deal is struck, neither said one
was imminent. Still, those familiar with the situation believe a
deal, worth $6 to $7 million, will be made today. If not, the
Dodgers will renew Beltre's contract for one season for
approximately $275,000. He made $220,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   But renewing the contract could make the issue more complex.
Though Boras and Daly could continue to negotiate afterward, both
sides said that would be much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, 20, was signed by the Dodgers at age 15, which violates
baseball's rules. Daly learned of the issue in October, papers were
filed with baseball in November and commissioner Bud Selig denied
Beltre's request for free agency in December. The players
association filed a grievance in January, but a hearing date is yet
to be set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was going to be this long,'' Beltre said.
``It should have been for two days, and then it was four, and six,
and you see how far it goes. Nobody knows what's going to happen. I
actually don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Say Uncle: When Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield was growing
up in Tampa, Fla., he remembers an uncle of his blowing pitches by
the neighborhood kids on the sandlot. That uncle was Doc Gooden,
and after years of being dominated by him, Sheffield finally has
something to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield homered in the first inning Friday against Gooden, who
is trying to make Houston's rotation. It was Sheffield's first
homer of the spring, and first off Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid and your uncle is dominating grown-ups, and
everyone else around the neighborhood, and everybody was
overmatched ... it took me 31 years to get to the point to where I
could hit the ball, and feel comfortable doing it,'' Sheffield
said. ``He was mad at me. I can't tell you what he was calling me
when he went in to do his sprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Manager Davey Johnson said right-hander Mike
Fetters is about a week away from pitching in a game. Fetters, who
strained his left quadricep, is having trouble covering first and
fielding bunts, Johnson said.... The Dodgers tried to get down to a
workable number of players in camp. They assigned Apostol Garcia
and Hiram Bocachica to Triple-A Albuquerque and sent Randy Galvez,
Geronimo Gil, Julio Vinas, Luke Allen and Chris Ashby to
minor-league camp.

USC GETS COMMITMENT FROM UPLAND DEFENSIVE END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jason Wardlow, a defensive end from Upland High,
has become the first high school junior to commit to USC for next
year's recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Wardlow (6-foot-3, 225 pounds) selected USC while visiting the
school last weekend on its academic day. He had 17 sacks last
season and is projected as a defensive end in college.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are eager for early commitments from players like
Wardlow, because current defensive ends Sultan Abdul-Malik,
Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed and Matt Childers will all be seniors
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Early impression: By the conclusion of the first practice, it
was apparent junior college transfer cornerback Chris Cash would
immediately challenge for a starting position. He intercepted a
pass, and broke up another that looked like a sure catch for wide
receiver Steve Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``He really has
picked up stuff fast. I'm pretty pleased. We have great
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cash does start, the Trojans would likely move junior Kris
Richard to free safety and keep Antuan Simmons as the other
cornerback. Simmons is sitting out spring drills while he recovers
from back surgery he had last November.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the shotgun?: After criticism last season that the
Trojans did not use the shotgun offense, Hackett vowed to install
some parts of it for next year. The first steps should be taken in
spring drills, although Hackett was not sure when he would start to
implement the passing formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will at some point look at the shotgun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New tight ends coach Brian Schottenheimer might help, since he
previously coached with Steve Spurrier at Florida, well known for
its use of the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Higher expectations: Quarterback Carson Palmer feels this year's
spring practices are more important than last year's, and not just
because he needs to get back in football shape after missing nine
games with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we have a chance to do a lot more than last year
because we have a better team,'' Palmer said. ``We're going to the
Kickoff Classic and have a chance to have a really good season.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready for a challenge: Hackett said he believes playing Penn
State in the Kickoff Classic is not a mistake, although some have
second-guessed the move, especially because the Nittany Lions
defeated USC 24-7 in the 1996 Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we aspire to be the best, we need to play against the
best,'' Hackett said. ``I don't think USC ever turns down a game
like that. Are we up to the task? We're going to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   On track: Wide receiver Marcell Allmond, cornerback Darrell
Rideaux and offensive lineman Lucais MacKay all missed the first
two days of drills to participate in a track meet. They will join
the football team when practices resume March 23.
</P>
<P>
   Position change: Sophomore tight end Scott Huber asked Hackett
this week if he could switch to defensive end, and will try the
position in spring drills to see if he can make the move
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Polamalu out: Sophomore safety Troy Polamalu missed the first
two days of spring practice because of a sore hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Extra scholarship: Hackett said the Trojans have an available
scholarship and could still sign a punter or kicker for next year.

ANGELS STRIVE TO SETTLE EDMONDS, ANDERSON SITUATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The Anaheim Angels are determined to make every
effort to settle their situations with free-agents-to-be Jim
Edmonds and Garret Anderson before opening night against the
Yankees on April 3 in Anaheim, a source said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The club does not want to begin the season distracted with trade
rumors involving the two players, particularly Edmonds, whose name
comes up the most and who could attract a better return package.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' goal is to re-sign or trade the outfielders, though
it is unlikely they would trade both. It's also doubtful they will
re-sign Edmonds, although the relationship between the two sides
has improved of late.
</P>
<P>
   Camp has gone so well for the first three weeks the club is
intent on keeping that feeling going into the season. Both Edmonds
and Anderson also would like to have their situations settled by
the time the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has said that he does not want to go to a team with
which he wouldn't re-sign because he'd still be trade bait. He
would prefer to go to a team that would immediately begin working
on signing him to a contract extension, or even agree to a deal in
advance of a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees remain the team most likely to land Edmonds because
of their needs, their financial ability to pay him, and because
they have the most to offer in return, most notably pitcher Ramiro
Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an abundance of outfielders and if we'd get ourselves
in position to get appropriate returns for our assets, it's
something we'll look at,'' Angels president Tony Tavares said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Short stint: Troy Percival made his first appearance of the
spring Friday, but those who blinked might have missed it.
</P>
<P>
   Percival started the Angels' Cactus League game against the
Padres and his day's work was short and sweet: one inning, three
outs, eight pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Percival has been recovering from shoulder surgery, which
included the removal of a large bone chip that was buried in muscle
and shaving loose fragments from his collarbone. The pain got so
bad last season that he had trouble holding his newborn baby, and
he was shut down by the club two weeks before the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   He's spent spring training building up strength in the shoulder,
and Friday was his first opportunity to test himself in a real
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my bullpens (workouts) I'm worried about mechanics,
worried about my arm,'' Percival said. ``When I get in the game,
all I want to do is go out and throw. Today I was pain-free. I
can't remember the last time I felt like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Percival is aware of his velocity, which typically
ranges from 93-97 mph. But now he is more concerned with simply
being able to throw over the top without pain and pitch like he did
in 1995 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how hard I'm throwing, which is unusual for
me,'' Percival said. ``All I want to do is go out there and throw
strikes. I know I was throwing good enough to get it by people. I'm
not throwing 100 mph, but I should be at 95 by the start of the
season. Getting my arm angle up was effortless. I didn't feel I was
trying to throw hard at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For where Troy is now I don't think any of us could be
happier,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``He showed his arm is sound
and it's going to get stronger. That's a big first step he took.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival has been working on a split-finger pitch this spring
and plans to use it often, along with his curveball, which he threw
once Friday for a called strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the one (curveball) I used last year - it bounced in
the on-deck circle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides getting his shoulder cleaned out, Percival also got in
shape, losing 20 pounds and getting down to 220.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got too heavy at the end of last year,'' he said. ``It's a
lot easier to go up than down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker struggles: Kent Mercker, competing for a spot in the
starting rotation, followed Percival and gave up five runs (two
earned) and seven hits in 2 innings. The Angels, however, beat the
Padres 9-5. Bengie Molina went 2 for 3 with a home run, and Darin
Erstad and Scott Spiezio had two hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In a split-squad game in Peoria, the Padres beat the Angels 4-3.

PRESSURE IS OFF DODGERS' BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Had Kevin Brown won all 35 of his starts last
season, thrown about five no-hitters, and had his tutoring of
younger pitchers translated into four 20-game winners, maybe the
expectations heaped upon him would have been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, none of that happened. The hoopla surrounding
Brown at this time last season was engulfed by midseason thanks to
a Los Angeles Dodgers team that imploded time and again.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the initial whirlwind swirling around Dodgertown,
Brown remains the highest-paid pitcher in baseball. It's just the
interest is very different.
</P>
<P>
   And Brown, no longer besieged by reporters every day because of
his industry-rocking contract, is experiencing the kind of spring
training he craves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nice and relaxed,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said.
``Obviously, coming in last year, there was a lot of pressure on
him. I think he handled it great. I think he's able to relax a
little more this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The day-to-day pressures, including dissections of his every
move, are gone. He's also comfortable in returning to a clubhouse
in which he's known, and in which he knows most others. And the
talk of Brown being the guy to return the Dodgers to glory is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be easier for me this year,'' Brown said. ``I'm not
coming in starting from square one. I know people here. I know the
coaching staff. I know the players. It's easier, certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Dodgers agreed to pay Brown $105 million over
seven years because he could handle such pressure. But one thing
Brown can't do is start every other day, turn double plays, hit
behind runners, provide depth in the bullpen (though he tried to at
times) and be a versatile player off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Brown can do a lot of things, but filling other gaping holes
isn't in his repertoire. Even so, Brown did very little wrong last
year for a club that made it a habit of doing the wrong thing. He
was 18-9 with a 3.00 ERA for a team that won 77 games. He tied a
career high with 35 starts and was consistent and quiet amidst a
sea of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Brown admitted he forced a few conversations with teammates in
trying to live up to the role of leader, and manager Davey Johnson
said numerous times last season that Brown may have put too much
pressure on himself early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have tried to make sure I was trying to talk to some of
the guys instead of letting it happen,'' Brown said. ``I really
didn't feel any adverse effect from anything. I know that those
things come about because of the things I need to do. The
leadership role, that's not a tag I put on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a tag everyone else wanted to put on Brown. From the
moment he was introduced as a Dodger, management talked about
Brown's unmistakable intangible qualities - his work ethic, his
intensity, his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   As the season developed, those attributes became more clear.
After a one of his few strong outings, a win against Atlanta,
Carlos Perez remarked how sitting next to Brown on the bench during
games was helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort talked about watching Brown's daily work routine
and learning from it. Brown's known for bearing down even more in
tight situations, and Dreifort frequently mentioned that when
talking about his run of strong pitching performances last season.
</P>
<P>
   And Chan Ho Park is perhaps Brown's biggest admirer. After Park
was pounded during a start last season on the road, Brown came to
Park's hotel room. The two talked for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant so much to me,'' Park, 26, said. ``He came to me
and told me about how he went through the same kind of things when
he was my age. I didn't know that. I thought he was always a great
pitcher like he is now. I didn't know he had the same problem. He
said he was just like me. That made me feel really good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Brown's inherent value lies.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wins more than nearly everyone else - only Greg Maddux's
71 wins are more than his 69 since he joined the National League in
1996. He's a workhorse who chews up innings with quality starts and
gets better as seasons progress.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that even though Brown pitched markedly better after
the All-Star break last season, going 9-3 with a 2.41 ERA, the team
digressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that was different than I hoped was we didn't
win,'' Brown said. ``You get used to winning. It's hard to go
back.''

JOSEPH TERENZIO, 82, FORMER HOSPITALS COMMISSIONER IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph V. Terenzio, a New York City commissioner of hospitals
under Mayor John Lindsay and a strong advocate of public health
care for the poor, died on Tuesday in a nursing home in Miami. He
was 82 and had been in ill health since suffering a stroke in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Terenzio was the first nonphysician to hold the hospital
commissioner's post. In announcing the appointment, Lindsay said,
``Mr. Terenzio is being asked to do whatever major surgery he has
to do to get rid of inefficiency and waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Terenzio ran as many as 21 hospitals between 1966 and 1970 and
was the architect of Health and Hospitals Corp., a public
organization that now operates the city's hospitals. The
corporation won passage in the state Legislature and the City
Council in 1969, as part of a total reorganization of the city's
health services and hospital management.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran the largest system in the world _ 21 hospitals _ and
ran it well,'' said Sid Davidoff, a Manhattan lawyer who was an
aide to Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as commissioner of Health and Hospitals Corp. for
several months, Terenzio resigned to become president of Evanston
Hospital in Illinois. But in 1972 he returned to New York to take
over the presidency of the United Hospital Fund, a health research
and philanthropic organization. He held the post funtil 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The current president of the fund, James R. Tallon, was chairman
of the New York State Assembly health committee when Terenzio, as
president of the fund, was an advocate of nonprofit hospitals. ``He
was one of the most powerful voices advocating support for
voluntary hospitals and providing health care for the poor in New
York,'' Tallon said.
</P>
<P>
   Terenzio held a bachelor's degree, a law degree and a master's
degree in hospital administration. The child of an Italian family
of modest means, he worked his way through Yale as a Fuller Brush
salesman and a waiter in the university's student dining rooms, his
son, John, said. After graduating, Terenzio spent five years in the
Navy and saw combat in the Pacific and North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming commissioner of hospitals, Terenzio practiced
law and was executive director of Brooklyn Hospital and of
Knickerbocker Hospital, which is now defunct.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to John, of Los Angeles, he is survived by two
daughters, Mary Louise Shafer of Manhattan and Joanne Blakemore of
Singapore; and six grandchildren. His wife of 51 years, the former
Marie Cozzolino, died in 1996.

NORTHRIDGE WINS, REACHES FOR SKY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ The late show was a great show for the Cal
State Northridge men's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Television forced the Matadors' Big Sky tournament semifinal
against host Montana to a 9:30 p.m. local time slot, and Northridge
proved to be ahit, beating the Grizzlies 76-65 in front of 5,038 at
Dahlberg Arena Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge (20-9) advanced to meet Northern Arizona for the
conference title tonight at 7:30. The winner gets an automatic bid
to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN went six minutes without a basket in the second half but
never gave up the lead. Hewitt Rolle's putback with 7:52 left put
Northridge up by nine (55-46) and Marco McCain's 3-pointer made it
58-46 at the 7-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's steal and layup just before halftime gave CSUN a 35-28
halftime lead. McCain also had a pair of baskets in an 11-0
Matadors run earlier in the half that led to a 33-25 Matadors lead,
and the 6-3 junior guard had nine points in the first 20 minutes,
tying Carl Holmes for the team lead.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge shot 55 percent (16 of 29) in the first half, and
Montana struggled from the floor (39 percent). But the Matadors
only made one of eight 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, the tournament host for the first time since 1992, took
advantage of sloppy play by the Matadors early and took a 15-7 lead
on Shane Christensen's 3-pointer. Christensen made a combined four
of 17 shots in the teams' two regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona 82, Eastern Washington 65: The Lumberjacks shot
61 percent to advance to their third consecutive tournament final.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Land (24), Cory Schwab (20) and Adam Lopez (15) combined to
almost outscore the Eagles (15-12) by themselves for third-seeded
NAU (18-10).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross, Adam and Cory really got their feet set and got some
good shots,'' NAU coach Mike Adras said.

<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ Almost a month ago, Carl Holmes stood in a
hallway in this arena and said he believed the Cal State Northridge
men's basketball team was the class of the Big Sky Conference.
</P>
<P>
   One more win, and his teammates will prove Holmes right.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded CSUN took a lead late in the first half, never
relented and beat tournament favorite Montana 76-65 Friday night to
advance to the conference championship game tonight against
Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The winner gets an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.
Northridge, enjoying its finest season at the Division I level,
improved to 20-9. The top-seeded Grizzlies ended their season
17-11.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream come true,'' Holmes said after scoring a
team-high 21 points and grabbing seven rebounds. ``This is a great
experience. We're 40 minutes away from going to the NCAA
Tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Bobby Braswell, who has guided the Matadors to two
conference tournament finals in four seasons, said: ``We've had an
up-and-down year. Right now we're playing good basketball and we're
playing unselfishly.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana led 25-24 with 6 minutes, 25 seconds left in the first
half. A layup by Brian Heinle made it 26-25 and the Grizzlies never
led again. CSUN led 35-28 at halftime, 49-43 with 10 minutes left
and 63-49 at the five-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had one goal in mind and that was to stay on top,''
Heinle said. ``We knew we would do it with defense, and that's what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge !ital!had!off! to win with defense. The Matadors went
six minutes between field goals in the second half but never
buckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got (the lead) down to three or four or five ... we
broke down and turned it over and didn't make a stop on defense,''
said Montana forward Matt Williams, who had 22 points and 10
rebounds in his final game. ``That really hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   What also hindered the Grizzlies was the shooting of CSUN
reserve guard Marco McCain, who made 7 of 12 shots and had 17
points in only 19 minutes. McCain made three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At different times we've had different people step up for
us,'' Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams fouled out with a little less than two minutes left and
CSUN comfortably ahead. He was one of two Grizzlies to foul out;
CSUN had Heinle, Andre Larry and Jeff Parris foul out of its 73-70
overtime loss here on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Holmes made his declaration. He wasn't being cocky
or petulant, just stating what he believes is fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working hard all season long to get to this
point,'' Holmes said after Friday night's game. ``Right now our
minds are on winning this tournament. I said before we left
Northridge, we're not coming home with anything less than the
tournament trophy. We're 40 minutes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Northern Arizona (18-10) advanced with an 82-65 win
over No. 2 seed Eastern Washington in the early semifinal. The
Lumberjacks shot 61 percent and got 24 points from senior Ross
Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know each other so well,'' NAU coach Mike Adras said about
facing CSUN tonight. ``There won't be any surprises. We're travel
partners. We're even staying in the same hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The CSUN men join the Matadors women on championship Saturday.
The women, who won the tournament last year, take on No.1 seed
Montana in the final at 1 p.m. Montana, ironically, was the last
school to win the men's and women's title in the same year (1997).

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ From the Annals of Diplomacy (Personnel
Department):
</P>
<P>
   It was March 2000. In 10 months, Madeleine Albright, first
female secretary of state of the United States, would be out of a
job.
</P>
<P>
   So what was a friend to do? As an admirer and what passed in
those days as a philosopher, Vaclav Havel had an idea: Albright
should succeed him as the president of the Czech Republic, her
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   And as an absurdist playwright, Havel had no intention of taking
no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   When the idea first floated up from the diplomatic universe of
leaks and hints, two weeks before, Albright scotched it, saying
that however flattered she might be, her loyalties lay with her
adopted country, the United States, which she was serving.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, of course, it was problematic for a government official
to entertain job offers while in office. It was doubly problematic,
then, for a secretary of state, the chief foreign-policy official
of her government, to express any interest in serving another
government, let alone in running it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what could seem a conflict of interest in some lower
apparatchik might be construed as treason in a secretary of state.

   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ From the Annals of Diplomacy (Personnel
Department):
</P>
<P>
   It was March 2000. In 10 months, Madeleine Albright, first
female secretary of state of the United States, would be out of a
job.
</P>
<P>
   So what was a friend to do? As an admirer and what passed in
those days as a philosopher, Vaclav Havel had an idea: Albright
should succeed him as the president of the Czech Republic, her
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   And as an absurdist playwright, Havel had no intention of taking
no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   When the idea first floated up from the diplomatic universe of
leaks and hints, two weeks before, Albright scotched it, saying
that however flattered she might be, her loyalties lay with her
adopted country, the United States, which she was serving.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, of course, it was problematic for a government official
to entertain job offers while in office. It was doubly problematic,
then, for a secretary of state, the chief foreign-policy official
of her government, to express any interest in serving another
government, let alone in running it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what could seem a conflict of interest in some lower
apparatchik might be construed as treason in a secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   But Havel, a patient man with his own domestic political
difficulties, seemed entirely serious _ and unbendingly persistent.
With Albright standing beside him at a memorial to the Czechs'
first democratic president, Thomas G. Masaryk, Havel, the second
democratic president, again pressed Albright to consider becoming
the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally would consider it excellent because, into this
rather stale provincial environment, this would bring an
international spirit,'' Havel told Czech Television in response to
a question that he himself had planted with a reporter covering the
ceremony. ``Someone who knows the world well would come to the
Czech Republic, already understands it, and would be able to act
here with regard to all broader world circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, clearly not taken by surprise, said nothing. But the
next day she planted a question of her own with a reporter so that
she could utter another polite refusal of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she had plenty of time to change her mind, with Havel
not scheduled to leave office until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Still, however tempted she might have been, she did not suggest

   A Primary Loser Who's Something of a Winner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is going on vacation. John McCain is going back to
the Senate. And Americans who were energized and entertained by
their candidacies have gone into mourning.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the national press corps. ``I now think of John
McCain as `Uncle Fun,''' said Jonathan Alter, the Newsweek writer
and NBC News commentator, after the Super Tuesday drubbings, from
Maine to New York to Ohio to California, that forced McCain and
Bradley out of the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley withdrew from the race Thursday morning, and McCain did
the same an hour later, as he stood in the brilliant sunlight of
Sedona, Ariz. Which was entirely apt, because of the two, McCain
cast the broader shadow. The unlikely coalition he mobilized, of
independents, moderate Republicans and disaffected Democrats, now
constitutes a crucial swing block in the general election, a group
over which the presumptive nominees, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore, are now expected to wage a fierce contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither of the vanquished contenders offered a ringing
endorsement of the survivors, it was McCain who at week's end was
playing the harder to get. Bush, seeking a rapprochement, sent out
feelers; Gore went out of his way to acknowledge McCain and invite
the senator's fans into his tent.
</P>
<P>
   The finality of Super Tuesday, with 16 states voting the closest
the country has come to a national primary, paved the way for a
long general election campaign. With their war chests all but
depleted _ some $200 million was spent on the primary campaign _
and the polls showing a virtual dead heat, Gore and Bush stand
shoulder to shoulder at the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   That, say analysts across the political spectrum, could make
McCain a de facto kingmaker. ``McCain has lost the Republican
nomination,'' said the conservative pundit William Kristol, ``but
he and what he stands for remain the central issues in the
campaign.''

   The 50-Year-Old Man and the Sea
</P>
<P>
   Normally, when crossing an ocean, a traveler might focus on
having enough legroom. Does it concern Remy Bricka? Nah! As he
crosses the Pacific, he'll have all the room he needs. He's
walking.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not some loopy gimmick. Bricka, for whatever reason,
has done this sort of thing before. His walk across the Atlantic in
1988 landed him in the Guinness Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``walk'' isn't the right word. Bricka, a 50-year-old
French entertainer, has mini-canoes on his feet, a paddle and,
behind him, a catamaran for provisions and naps. Presumably he
doesn't have e-mail, but, yes, there is a Web site
(www.stoeffler.com) that, for French speakers, helps track
``l'homme qui marche sur l'eau.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoeffler, a French food company, is sponsoring Bricka's
7,800-mile, six-month slog from Los Angeles to Sydney. The company
provided 22 pounds of sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   How did Bricka explain his quest? ``Our time goes quickly,'' he
said. ``I will use my time to realize my dream.'' How did
bystanders react? ``He's crazy.''

   Dow Takes a Sharp Drop While Nasdaq Hits a New High  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tale of two stock markets continued to confound investors.
It was the best of times for the Nasdaq Composite, which surpassed
the 5,000 mark for the first time on rising technology stocks. But
the more established companies in the Dow Jones industrial average
fell, bringing the average down to 9,796.03 on Tuesday. The split
in the two markets reflects investors' ardor for so-called new
economy stocks, thought to be immune to the ill effects of rising
interest rates. But market strategists doubt that hot technology
companies can remain a safe haven forever.

   The Price for Taking Bribes
</P>
<P>
   China executed Hu Changqing, a former provincial vice governor,
for taking $600,000 in bribes. The government is seeking to
demonstrate its resolve in cracking down on high-level corruption,
which is damaging the Communist Party's reputation. Hu was the
highest official ever put to death for corruption. An investigation
has already linked dozens of relatively high-level local officials
with a $10 billion smuggling ring in Xiamen in southern China. But
many Chinese are skeptical that China's leaders will pursue the
campaign to the top party ranks. When the Xiamen investigation was
about to implicate the wife of the Beijing party chief, Jia
Qinglin, party propaganda departments sprang to life, professing
her innocence.

   Gassing Up Goes Up

   American drivers will have plenty of gasoline this summer, say
Energy Department analysts. And they'll pay plenty for it: a
national average $1.56 for a gallon of regular unleaded, much more
in high-cost areas like New York City and California. By 2001,
prices will be on their way down, the analysts said, assuming that
oil countries step up production, as expected, and that there is no
war in the Middle East. Those are big ifs.

   Three New York City police officers were found guilty of

</P>

in the attack. At a previous trial last year, Schwarz was found
guilty of restraining Louima while another officer, Justin A.
Volpe, sodomized him with a broken broomstick.

   Sinkhole, Boston Style  &QL;

<P>
   Boston's ``Big Dig,'' the monumental project to sink the city's
raised Central Artery underground, is presenting even more of a Big
Bill than expected. Its overseers were grilled by lawmakers about
why the federal- and state-financed project will cost at least $12
billion, not the supposedly set-in-stone $10.8 billion, and why
they did not reveal the overrun earlier. They responded that not
everything is controllable when an undertaking is the most complex
urban infrastructure project in the country's history. They have
until Wednesday to come up with a plan to pay for the overrun.

   Fueled by a surge in conservative primary voters, two of the

overwhelmingly approved: a ban on the recognition of same-sex
marriages and tough new penalties for juveniles who stray from the

</P>
<P>
   Proposition 21, the juvenile crime initiative, allows
prosecutors to try 14-year-olds charged with violent crimes as
adults without a judicial review and makes it easier to incarcerate
youths with adult inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22, the ``limitations on marriage'' initiative,
anticipates that one day marriage between same-sex couples may be
sanctified somewhere and allows California the right not to

   In a matter of months, a free software program called Napster

Developed by a 19-year-old college dropout, the program compiles a

making it easy to find and copy almost any musical selection, free.
A trade association representing the major record labels is suing
the start-up company that distributes the program for contributing
to copyright infringement. But if it loses, the music industry may
have to sue the college students who are Napster's most avid users
_ or else figure out how to make money without selling quite so

overwhelmingly approved: a ban on the recognition of same-sex
marriages and tough new penalties for juveniles who stray from the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 21, the juvenile crime initiative, allows
prosecutors to try 14-year-olds charged with violent crimes as
adults without a judicial review and makes it easier to incarcerate
youths with adult inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22, the ``limitations on marriage'' initiative,
anticipates that one day marriage between same-sex couples may be
sanctified somewhere and allows California the right not to
acknowledge those unions.

   Policing Cyber Music  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of months, a free software program called Napster
has turned millions of law-abiding citizens into music pirates.
Developed by a 19-year-old college dropout, the program compiles a
master list of all the songs on the computers of all of its users,
making it easy to find and copy almost any musical selection, free.
A trade association representing the major record labels is suing
the start-up company that distributes the program for contributing
to copyright infringement. But if it loses, the music industry may
have to sue the college students who are Napster's most avid users
_ or else figure out how to make money without selling quite so
many CDs.

   Close Call for Oscar
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if some glittering Oscar presenter intoned, ``The
envelope, please'' and got a brown envelope that read, ``You
absolutely, positively have a chance to win $10 million!'' An Oscar
moment indeed. Such a tableau was conjured by word that more than
1,000 of a missing 4,200 Academy Award ballots addressed to
California members were found in a warehouse, mistaken for junk
mail. The academy may just have to send out more ballots. And soon.
The awards are March 26.

</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, March 12:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ For months, Mexico's
presidential race seemed headed inexorably toward a 14th
consecutive victory by the governing party. Suddenly, it has turned
into a real race, because Vicente Fox has made advances that give
him a better chance at the presidency than any other opposition
figure since the Mexican revolution. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   PERU-POLITICS (Tacna, Peru) _ There are eight candidates in the
race against President Alberto K. Fujimori. But their standing is
low. This is in part explained by Fujimori's lasting popularity,
particularly among Peru's large Indian population, which credits
the president with defeating two terrorist groups and ending years
of hyperinflation. But the opposition candidates have also had
trouble gaining traction because, in their view, they are competing
on a tilted playing field. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-PARAMILITARY (Bogota, Colombia) _ His private army has
killed thousands of people in the past decade, making him perhaps
the most feared man in this violent country. But a decision to
submit to a grilling on television early this month has allowed the
paramilitary leader Carlos Castano to come out of the shadows and
present himself as one more victim of the violence he had
previously been seen as personifying here. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DILEMMA (Washington) _ Nine months after they declared
victory in the war over Kosovo, Washington and its NATO allies are
now fighting among themselves over how to prevent a deteriorating
situation in the Serbian province from spinning out of their
control. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-U.S. (Berlin) _ The fiasco over the appointment of a new
managing director for the International Monetary Fund has caused
serious damage to the critical German-U.S. relationship and
revealed deep personal rifts within the governing coalition of
Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democratic chancellor. By Roger
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-VOTE-BUYING (Chin Jin, Taiwan) _ Taiwan's voters will
elect a new president on March 18 to succeed Lee Teng-hui. With the
three main candidates locked within a few percentage points of one
another in the polls, party officials are girding themselves for a
spree of vote buying, and opposition and election officials fear
that the practice could play a substantial role in determining the
winner. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-POLITICS (Madrid, Spain) _ What incumbent would not envy
Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar? During his four years in
office, Aznar surprised many doubters by successfully guiding Spain
into the European monetary union. And Spain's economy is booming.
Unemployment has dropped to 15 percent from 23 percent. But if
Aznar is the victor in Sunday's elections, it will probably be by a
hair. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-CITIZENSHIP (Geneva) _ This weekend, in what some view as
a worrying trend that may fan right-wing xenophobia in Switzerland
and neighboring Austria, voters in an industrial suburb of scenic
Lucerne will get to decide in the most personal way just who should
be a Swiss citizen. Every eligible voter in Emmen has received a
booklet containing family photographs and intensely personal data
on tax status, salary, background and hobbies for each of the 56
people in the town seeking naturalization. By Elizabeth Olson.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-U.N.-DUES (United Nations) _ A long, hard battle to lower
U.S. payments to the United Nations begins next week, and diplomats
from a wide cross-section of nations say there is no guarantee that
the issue will be resolved. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-WORLD-CUP (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ South Africa
kicked off a campaign this week to hold the most important sporting
contest in the country's history when it welcomed a delegation of
international soccer officials who will decide on the country's bid
for the 2006 World Cup. By Henri E. Cauvin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   FLA-WATER-SHORTAGE (Land O'Lakes, Fla.) _ There may be water,
water everywhere, but as remarkable as it may seem in Tampa Bay,
there is not enough to drink. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVELING-HABERDASHER (Fairfield, Iowa) _ As the sun rose over
slumbering Iowa cornfields, Tim DeFord rambled along Interstate 80
in an old station wagon stocked with men's suits and shirts.
DeFord, a haberdasher who makes house calls, caters to customers in
little Midwestern towns that no longer have a men's shop. By Dirk
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   GUN-INITIATIVES (Denver) _ Frustrated by their legislatures'
unwillingness to pass new gun-control measures, citizen groups in
three Western states are collecting signatures to put the issues
before voters this fall as ballot initiatives. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   CRAFT-NETWORKS (Honaker, Va.) _ Phyllis Street is about to
plunge into the global economy. The coal miner's widow, who turned
for survival to the quilt maker's arts that run two centuries deep
in her family, will leave her home on Monday for the first airplane
trip of her life. It will be to London, where she will be a star
entry in the Ideal Home Show, Europe's premier exhibition for the
booming crafts industry. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   LEE-HOME (Alexandria, Va.) _ Unable to pay for the upkeep of a
museum, a Civil War historical preservation group has sold the home
where Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee grew up to a couple who intend
to turn it into their own.
</P>
<P>
   FIREFIGHTER-RAMPAGE (Memphis, Tenn.) _ As funerals began
Saturday for victims of an off-duty firefighter's shooting spree
here on Wednesday, authorities said the alleged gunman has not yet
explained exactly what drove him to murder his wife, a deputy
sheriff and two fellow firefighters who came to his home to put out
the blaze he had set there. By Emily Yellin.
</P>
<P>
   OCEAN-WALKER (Los Angeles) _ The journey of an Alsatian man who
intended to walk cross the Pacific Ocean from Los Angeles to
Sydney, Australia, came to a rapid end about 30 miles off the coast
of Los Angeles this week, when his sleeping quarters were destroyed
by debris in a storm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   OIL-POLITICS (Washington) _ Republicans in Congress have begun
to blame the Clinton administration generally and Vice President Al
Gore in particular for the recent jump in the price of gasoline,
and that seems sure to become a hot issue in the presidential race.
By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   NOMINATION-SYSTEM (Washington) _ This year's primary season was
far more competitive, far more engaging to the voters and far more
compelling a story than almost anyone expected. There is just one
problem, critics of the nominating system say. It is, essentially,
over, even though more than half of the states have yet to hold
nominating contests for one or both parties. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-VOTERS (Seattle) _ The McCain voter is America's hottest
political quarry these days. But while the bloc has come to be
hugely significant in electoral terms, interviews with dozens of
such voters here in Washington state, and in Michigan,
Massachusetts and California, vividly confirmed what polls have
suggested from the outset: beyond their allegiance to McCain and a
somewhat vague banner of reform, there seemed to be virtually
nothing that amounted to a common bond in their political views. By
Sam Howe Verhovek.

   JERUSALEM _ In less than four months, Israeli soldiers may well
turn their backs on the nation's 18-year national nightmare and
give up their occupation of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Hezbollah militia, which successfully waged a war of
attrition against the Israeli forces, has begun to crow that its
guerrillas drove out the strongest army in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true _ Israelis are sick of losing their sons
on Lebanese soil in order to preserve an occupation of dubious
strategic value _ it is also true that Israel deliberately chose
the time and manner of its departure.
</P>
<P>
   Any American tempted to think that the pullout from southern
Lebanon evokes the profoundly dispiriting U.S. pullout from Vietnam
should keep that last fact in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a better analogy would be a chess move: By retreating
with his knights (and his pawns in the South Lebanon Army) from the
Lebanese board, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has exposed his
opponents' king.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is the backstage ruler in Lebanon, and it is Syria's power
that Israel is ultimately interested in holding in check. Syria has
more than 30,000 of its own soldiers based in Lebanon, securing not
only Syrian interests but supply lines for Hezbollah whenever
arming the guerrillas suits the regime in Damascus. (Syria can also
veto independent moves by Lebanon's own weak government).
</P>
<P>
   Lately Hezbollah has been particularly aggressive in attacking
Israeli soldiers in the occupied zone. While this has made the
guerrillas look even more heroic in the eyes of many young Arabs in
the region, the mounting casualties also have concentrated minds in
Israel on the significance of Syria and especially the mischief it
could commit through Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a decision made last week, the Israeli Cabinet has
publicly gotten behind Barak in his determination get Israeli
soldiers out of Lebanon by July, even if there is no peace deal
with Syria to provide a mechanism and cover for the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   It was revealing that instead of unalloyed satisfaction at the
prospect of seeing the back of retreating Israeli soldiers,
Lebanese and Syrian officials reacted to the news with immense
pique.
</P>
<P>
   The view in Israel, expressed with no lack of self-satisfaction,
is that Syria has now lost a bargaining chip in its dealings with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no more Israelis to kick around in southern
Lebanon, this reasoning goes, it will be too risky diplomatically
and militarily for Syria to allow Hezbollah to continue its
attacks, because the only Israeli targets would be in Israel
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Syrians want a deal, then unilateral withdrawal will
facilitate it,'' said Foreign Minister David Levy last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli move also undercuts the unusual outbreak of Arab
solidarity that emerged in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Hezbollah attacks in the security zone in
southern Lebanon, in which seven Israelis were eventually killed,
Israel mounted fierce bombing raids on Lebanese civilian targets.
The destruction of Lebanese electrical generating plants galvanized
the Arab Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, senior Arab officials were making the pilgrimage
to Beirut to pledge solidarity with Lebanon against Israel and its
occupying force. Even Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a staunch
advocate of reconciliation between Arab states and Israel, flew to
Lebanon to show his support _ the first time he had ever visited.
</P>
<P>
   It was the greatest display of Arab unity in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with a single vote in the Cabinet, Israel cracked the common
front. Although nearly all of Israel's neighbors in the Middle East
expressed reservations about a unilateral withdrawal from southern
Lebanon, none could complain too loudly after so forcefully and
recently calling for an end to the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Rearranging the board, however, is not all to Israel's
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah remains a political force in Lebanon, one that might
become especially emboldened after an Israeli withdrawal to demand
a bigger role in the political and military life of the country. Or
a unilateral Israeli pullout could be followed by still more
attacks and counter-attacks that might escalate to involve Syria or
destabilize Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A fractured Lebanon is a frightening prospect. For the many Arab
states, it evokes the long civil war that, in 1989, prompted them
to invite Syria to enter Lebanon to bring order. And for Israel,
instability in Lebanon was the justification for invading the
country in 1982, the beginning of the nightmare that is ending only
now.

   Hand-wringing aside, negative political campaigning has been
shown to work. It's only March and already the presidential
candidates have spent vast sums of money on ads vilifying their
opponents. Still, as Jimmy Durante used to hoot, ``You ain't seen
nothin' yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, strategists for both Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas predicted that the campaign is only now
starting to heat up. But what more can the candidates say after
they've called each other a fool, a liar, a bigot and worse?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, one suspects. As a public service, here is a trove of

   Hand-wringing aside, negative political campaigning has been
shown to work. It's only March and already the presidential
candidates have spent vast sums of money on ads vilifying their
opponents. Still, as Jimmy Durante used to hoot, ``You ain't seen
nothin' yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, strategists for both Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas predicted that the campaign is only now
starting to heat up. But what more can the candidates say after
they've called each other a fool, a liar, a bigot and worse?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, one suspects. As a public service, here is a trove of
insults that can be adapted phase by phase as the campaign careens
to its bitter end in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A young man who goes by the nickname Kaos confided several
months ago that he wouldn't mind being perceived as a bad-guy
computer hacker, but reputation-wise, things weren't working out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the menacing image his moniker might conjure, the
19-year-old Kaos wore a retainer and his voice squeaked when he got
excited. ``Even if you're not capable of instilling fear, you think
your alter ego has to be able to,'' said Kaos, whose mom knows him
as Corey.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that computer vandalism is a serious threat, as
evidenced by the arrest last week of Denis M. Moran, 17, for
allegedly hacking into the Web site of the anti-drug organization
DARE, and also by the recent rash of attacks on major e-commerce
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the fascination with malicious hacker culture has spawned a
profusion of wannabes whose bark is far worse than their bite. They
tend to be adolescent denizens of online chat rooms and Internet
junkies who assume nicknames meant to convey tough-guy personas
with superhero powers but whose actual intimidation factor is
closer to Super Geek.
</P>
<P>
   Their real threat to national security might be starting a run
on acne medication, but judging from their online handles, you'd
think they could wipe out the Kremlin with a keystroke while
bench-pressing Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important _ your nickname defines who you
are,'' said 25-year-old Brian Hansel, a k a Noid, at last summer's
Defcon, an annual gathering of serious computer hackers,
enthusiasts and hangers-on held in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Hansel explained that his nom de Net derived from an impish
character in a Domino's Pizza advertising campaign, which may say
more about his diet than his hacking prowess. Like many
self-proclaimed hackers, Hansel says he has burned through more
than one ``nick.'' He originally called himself Punisher, but
decided it was too run-of-the-mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can call themselves Deathmonger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that someone who calls himself Deathmonger would
carry a heavy burden of dishing out death on a whim, but V1RU5 cast
doubt on that theory. ``You know Evil Pete?'' asked V1RU5, whose
name refers to computer viruses but who signs his checks Robert
Lupo. ``He's one of the nicest guys in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people with the most menacing names are the nicest
people,'' said the 30-something V1RU5, who added that hackers take
their names much less seriously as they age. ``The people with the
least-menacing names are the biggest jerks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably an overgeneralization, though Moran's screen
name, Coolio, doesn't sound especially threatening. And Analyzer,
who was arrested in 1998 in Israel in connection with an attack on
U.S. and Israeli government computer systems, chose a nickname that
makes him sound less like a hacker than a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Death Veggie, whose nickname seems fairly benign unless
you happen to be a zucchini. Yet the group to which he belongs,
Cult of the Dead Cow, has published software used to break into and
control computers installed with Microsoft's Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   It goes to show that you can't tell much about a person from a
handle _ though in some cases what you see is what you get. Squeak,
a young man no older than 16, said he chose his nickname because of
his high voice. Another teen-ager, Sloth, confessed to being pretty
lazy.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, what you get is more like Walter Mitty. Mistress
Evyl, 21, acknowledged that she's been known to show her unfriendly
side only if someone messes with one of her inner circle. And Spew
said he's had his nickname for a long time, even though he's never
really hacked into anything and frankly isn't very computer savvy.
``Really, I'm more into playing games,'' he said shyly, standing
around with Sloth at Defcon.
</P>
<P>
   Some purists don't like nicknames, whether or not they are apt.
True hackers do constructive work, they say, not by trespassing in
computer systems but by taking apart software programs and
improving them. These hackers don't require the bravado associated
with flashy, ostentatious nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Raymond, president of Open Source Initiative, a group that
promotes the free publication of computer programming languages
owned by corporations, said real hackers give their names readily
while wannabes and malicious types ``try to build a mystique
through concealment and secrecy.''
</P>

<P>
   A young man who goes by the nickname Kaos confided several
months ago that he wouldn't mind being perceived as a bad-guy
computer hacker, but reputation-wise, things weren't working out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the menacing image his moniker might conjure, the
19-year-old Kaos wore a retainer and his voice squeaked when he got
excited. ``Even if you're not capable of instilling fear, you think
your alter ego has to be able to,'' said Kaos, whose mom knows him
as Corey.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that computer vandalism is a serious threat, as
evidenced by the arrest last week of Denis M. Moran, 17, for
allegedly hacking into the Web site of the anti-drug organization
DARE, and also by the recent rash of attacks on major e-commerce
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the fascination with malicious hacker culture has spawned a
profusion of wannabes whose bark is far worse than their bite. They
tend to be adolescent denizens of online chat rooms and Internet
junkies who assume nicknames meant to convey tough-guy personas
with superhero powers but whose actual intimidation factor is
closer to Super Geek.
</P>
<P>
   Their real threat to national security might be starting a run
on acne medication, but judging from their online handles, you'd
think they could wipe out the Kremlin with a keystroke while
bench-pressing Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important _ your nickname defines who you
are,'' said 25-year-old Brian Hansel, a k a Noid, at last summer's
Defcon, an annual gathering of serious computer hackers,
enthusiasts and hangers-on held in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Hansel explained that his nom de Net derived from an impish
character in a Domino's Pizza advertising campaign, which may say
more about his diet than his hacking prowess. Like many
self-proclaimed hackers, Hansel says he has burned through more
than one ``nick.'' He originally called himself Punisher, but
decided it was too run-of-the-mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can call themselves Deathmonger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that someone who calls himself Deathmonger would
carry a heavy burden of dishing out death on a whim, but V1RU5 cast
doubt on that theory. ``You know Evil Pete?'' asked V1RU5, whose
name refers to computer viruses but who signs his checks Robert
Lupo. ``He's one of the nicest guys in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people with the most menacing names are the nicest
people,'' said the 30-something V1RU5, who added that hackers take
their names much less seriously as they age. ``The people with the
least-menacing names are the biggest jerks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably an overgeneralization, though Moran's screen
name, Coolio, doesn't sound especially threatening. And Analyzer,
who was arrested in 1998 in Israel in connection with an attack on
U.S. and Israeli government computer systems, chose a nickname that
makes him sound less like a hacker than a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Death Veggie, whose nickname seems fairly benign unless
you happen to be a zucchini. Yet the group to which he belongs,
Cult of the Dead Cow, has published software used to break into and
control computers installed with Microsoft's Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   It goes to show that you can't tell much about a person from a
handle _ though in some cases what you see is what you get. Squeak,
a young man no older than 16, said he chose his nickname because of
his high voice. Another teen-ager, Sloth, confessed to being pretty
lazy.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, what you get is more like Walter Mitty. Mistress
Evyl, 21, acknowledged that she's been known to show her unfriendly
side only if someone messes with one of her inner circle. And Spew
said he's had his nickname for a long time, even though he's never
really hacked into anything and frankly isn't very computer savvy.
``Really, I'm more into playing games,'' he said shyly, standing
around with Sloth at Defcon.
</P>
<P>
   Some purists don't like nicknames, whether or not they are apt.
True hackers do constructive work, they say, not by trespassing in
computer systems but by taking apart software programs and
improving them. These hackers don't require the bravado associated
with flashy, ostentatious nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Raymond, president of Open Source Initiative, a group that
promotes the free publication of computer programming languages
owned by corporations, said real hackers give their names readily
while wannabes and malicious types ``try to build a mystique
through concealment and secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond and others probably don't have much to fear from the
likes of Kaos and Spew, whose real assault is on traditional syntax
and spelling.

THE GEFFEN BIOGRAPHY: NOT READY FOR HIS CLOSE-UP

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ He had a quick temper, and friends found it ugly. He
was profane, rapacious and Machiavellian _ a brilliant strategist
who rarely took a step without anticipating the consequences. He
wept easily _ but one film director said he fed on other people
with the hunger of a praying mantis.
</P>
<P>
   These harsh comments were made about the legendary Hollywood
moguls David O. Selznick, Harry Cohn and Louis B. Mayer. Compared
with these men _ whom he idolizes _ David Geffen, the billionaire
entertainment mogul, seems almost benign. Yet Geffen is outraged
and depressed about a new biography, ``The Operator,'' published by
Random House last week, that depicts him as _ surprise! surprise! _
smart, ruthless, abrasive, calculating, generous and complicated.
</P>
<P>
   What especially disturbs Geffen is that he handpicked his
biographer, Tom King. King believes he was chosen because he is a
reporter with The Wall Street Journal and because, like Geffen,
he's gay. What Geffen wanted was a book that treated him like the
Omaha investor Warren Buffett _ another idol. But his personality
is more colorful than that of Buffett, who never wanted to marry
Cher or pal around with Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   So Geffen got a warts-and-all biography that, while hardly
flattering, is not quite as brutal as he says it is. The book
details Geffen's climb from an unhappy Brooklyn boyhood to the
pinnacle of Hollywood success in the music business and, currently,
as a partner at DreamWorks SKG. Along the way, his relationships
soured with several artist-clients and music executives, and he is
portrayed, at worst, as a bully willing to sacrifice friends to
achieve enormous wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``David very much wanted a serious book about him,'' King said.
``I think he was bowled over by the notion that a Wall Street
Journal reporter would spend two years examining his life.'' King
said it was ``enormously brave'' of Geffen to open virtually every
door to him, including interviews with a psychiatrist the mogul saw
as a child and several former lovers. ``Even though David withdrew
his cooperation roughly halfway through,'' he said, ``to my
knowledge he didn't once tell people after that point that they
shouldn't talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Geffen book follows two biographical
traditions. One is of the well-known, powerful and controlling
subject seeking a respectable biographer _ but then not wanting
candor. The most recent example is Edmund Morris' biography of
Ronald Reagan, ``Dutch'' (Random House, 1999). Morris, a Pulitzer
Prize winner who was handpicked by the Reagans, spent 10 years
researching the former president's life and created a bizarre
biography, using fictional devices. The portrayal was extremely
harsh.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Hollywood tradition of biographies _ often
by writers who are either flattered and intimidated by their
subjects or come to loathe them. ( King seems neutral about
Geffen.) Certainly Geffen took an unusual risk that other Hollywood
moguls, like Michael Ovitz and Michael Eisner, avoided. He sought a
serious biographer who controlled what he wrote. Compare that with
Ovitz, whose pallid biography in 1997 never caused a stir. Or
compare it with Eisner, whose autobiographical book, ``Work in
Progress'' (Random House, 1998), was criticized for its lack of
candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biographies here tend to be simplistic, veering from
hagiography to portrait of the devil as a young man,'' said Robert
Bookman, a top literary agent at Creative Artists Agency. ``They're
often either black or white, as opposed to a more complex and
realistic portrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanine Basinger, chairman of the film studies department at
Wesleyan University and author of several scholarly books about
Hollywood, put it another way: ``There's sort of an attitude _
everyone hates a mogul. If you write a nasty book about a star,
half the people out there may be fans who won't like it and won't
buy it. But if you write about a mogul, no one cares. No one
defends moguls. They don't have fans. They're guys who care about
money and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Geffen cares, most certainly, about money and power. But he is
not quite in the same league as the great moguls of the 1930s and
'40s whose power and cultural influence _ far more than he has ever
had _ were matched by outsized, often savage personalities. In his
book ``An Empire of Their Own'' (Crown, 1988), Neal Gabler called
Jack Warner, who founded Warner Brothers with his brother, Harry,
``crude, vulgar, shallow, flashy, contrary and galling.'' ( Geffen
purchased Harry Warner's 13,600-square-foot mansion in Beverly
Hills, and all its contents, for $47.5 million in 1990.)
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant but irascible Harry Cohn, who built a movie empire
as president of Columbia Pictures, kept a photo of Mussolini in his
office. ``He was the meanest man I ever knew _ an unreconstructed
dinosaur,'' Budd Schulberg, the writer, once said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn provoked perhaps the most famous quotation ever made about
a Hollywood mogul. His funeral in 1958 included some of the biggest
stars in town. Mourners packed two studio sound stages. After
attending the funeral, the comedian Red Skelton said, ``Well, it
only proves what they always say _ give the public something they
want to see, and they'll come out for it.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Geffen, the archetype of the contemporary mogul, is
complex, benevolent at times with his money and even a bit
vulnerable. But a mogul is a mogul. ``None of these guys got to be
moguls by being a boy scout,'' King said. On that point, Geffen
would probably agree with his biographer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With his special Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope John Paul
II has set out to do what none of his 262 predecessors felt called
to do: apologize for historical transgressions committed by Roman
Catholics in the name of the church.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, John Paul _ whose pontificate has been remarkable
in many ways, from his globe-circling pastoral travels to his
support for democratic change in Eastern Europe _ is acknowledging
the grim side of the church's past, in eras distinguished by forced
conversions, support for the Crusades (whose violence fell on Jews,
Muslims and Eastern Orthodox Christians) and creation of the
Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   No one can deny that his statement of mea culpa will be a
significant event in the life of the church, as it may also be for
the descendants of those who fell victim to its persecution. But
the pope's apology should also be viewed within its theological
context _ it will, after all, take place during a Mass and is fully
in keeping with the Christian belief that repentance of misdeeds is
necessary to future service to God. ``Forgive us our trespasses,''
asks the prayer that, according to the Gospels, Jesus taught his
disciples.
</P>
<P>
   In an ecumenical sense, the apology is the dramatic culmination
of an unusual period of public penance by major Christian groups.
In the mid-1990s, for example, three American Protestant
denominations issued statements of repentance _ the Southern
Baptists for supporting slavery and segregation, the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America for anti-Jewish writings by the
Reformation leader Martin Luther, and the United Methodists for the
brutality of a lay preacher who led a Civil War-era Indian massacre
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater global impact, however, was another, recent statement
by the Vatican _ the 1998 ``call to penitence'' on behalf of
Catholics who remained silent in the face of the Holocaust. ``We
deeply regret the errors and failures of those sons and daughters
of the church,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   That document provoked a contentious reaction, some hailing it
as a boon to Catholic-Jewish relations, others criticizing its
cautious tone and failure to acknowledge Pope Pius XII's refusal to
speak out publicly against the Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   This apology may evoke a similar response. A preliminary
document released by the Vatican two weeks ago made it clear that
the apology would have limits, that it will be offered on behalf of
the church's ``sons and daughters,'' but not the church itself,
which is considered holy, the bride of Christ. It was also most
unlikely that the pope would discuss blame for specific events _ no
naming names, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a kind of politically correct exercise in
self-abnegation,'' said George Weigel, a senior fellow at the
Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington and author of a
recent biography of John Paul II, ``Witness to Hope''
(HarperCollins). ``This is the pope making plain in a liturgical
context that the people of the church have failed to make plain the
truth that the church bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may wonder whether the pope will somehow undercut the
church's doctrine of papal infallibility by effectively rejecting
actions of some of his predecessors. But his apology can also be
understood as affirming that doctrine, which applies to the
church's teaching on Christian faith and morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the acts which contradict the teachings, which make the
apology pertinent,'' said the Rev. Michael J. Baxter, a professor
of theology at the University of Notre Dame. The apology
acknowledges that the church, through the men and women who make up
its ranks, ``has strayed from its own mission,'' Baxter said. ``And
yet that doesn't undermine the integrity of the mission, which
impresses its importance on us all the more.''
</P>
<P>
   One might ask, too, why now? After all, it's been centuries
since the Crusades and Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in timing, personal outlook and recent
history: the symbolic significance of the dawn of the third
Christian millennium, combined with the readiness of this
particular pontiff to face the past, and a watershed event in the
church's history (the reformist Second Vatican Council of the
1960s) that provided the institutional basis for making such a
reckoning possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the pope's apology comes during a Year of Jubilee,
a Holy Year, when tens of millions of Catholics are expected to
make a pilgrimage to Rome. March 12 is also the first Sunday in
Lent, the 40-day fast in the church calendar that precedes Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no coincidence, I'm quite sure,'' said Baxter. ``Lent
is a time of reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that in order to follow Christ, ``one needs to begin
from a disposition of repentance'' is a recurring and vital theme
in John Paul's encyclicals, Baxter said, adding that it has been an
essential tradition of the church that a confessional examination
of the past is required if one is to move forward faithfully into
the future.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Baxter said, by offering an apology for past
transgressions, a gesture that would include the Crusades and the
Inquisition, the pope is giving a new endorsement to the most
controversial document of the Second Vatican Council, the
Declaration on Religious Freedom, promulgated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   That document, heavily influenced by the thinking of the
American theologian John Courtney Murray, rejected the idea that
religious and political power should be linked. It treated the idea
of religious pluralism with respect and declared that people accept
faith as a free act and cannot be compelled to do so. ``In order to
convey the truth,'' Baxter said, ``how one conveys it makes all the
difference in the world. And one cannot convey that unless one
embodies the peace of God revealed in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   But what effect will the pope's apology have in the wider
Catholic world? Will it inspire Catholics in Europe (scene of the
Crusades and Inquisition) to reflect more positively on religious
minorities in their midst? ``Now the question is, how much of this
will be implemented at the pew level?'' said Rabbi Leon Klenicki,
interreligious affairs director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith.

   With his special Mass at the Vatican on Sunday, Pope John Paul
II has set out to do what none of his 262 predecessors felt called
to do: apologize for historical transgressions committed by Roman
Catholics in the name of the church.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, John Paul _ whose pontificate has been remarkable
in many ways, from his globe-circling pastoral travels to his
support for democratic change in Eastern Europe _ is acknowledging
the grim side of the church's past, in eras distinguished by forced
conversions, support for the Crusades (whose violence fell on Jews,
Muslims and Eastern Orthodox Christians) and creation of the
Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   No one can deny that his statement of mea culpa will be a
significant event in the life of the church, as it may also be for
the descendants of those who fell victim to its persecution. But
the pope's apology should also be viewed within its theological
context _ it will, after all, take place during a Mass and is fully
in keeping with the Christian belief that repentance of misdeeds is
necessary to future service to God. ``Forgive us our trespasses,''
asks the prayer that, according to the Gospels, Jesus taught his
disciples.
</P>
<P>
   In an ecumenical sense, the apology is the dramatic culmination
of an unusual period of public penance by major Christian groups.
In the mid-1990s, for example, three American Protestant
denominations issued statements of repentance _ the Southern
Baptists for supporting slavery and segregation, the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America for anti-Jewish writings by the
Reformation leader Martin Luther, and the United Methodists for the
brutality of a lay preacher who led a Civil War-era Indian massacre
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater global impact, however, was another, recent statement
by the Vatican _ the 1998 ``call to penitence'' on behalf of
Catholics who remained silent in the face of the Holocaust. ``We
deeply regret the errors and failures of those sons and daughters
of the church,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   That document provoked a contentious reaction, some hailing it
as a boon to Catholic-Jewish relations, others criticizing its
cautious tone and failure to acknowledge Pope Pius XII's refusal to
speak out publicly against the Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   This apology may evoke a similar response. A preliminary
document released by the Vatican two weeks ago made it clear that
the apology would have limits, that it will be offered on behalf of
the church's ``sons and daughters,'' but not the church itself,
which is considered holy, the bride of Christ. It was also most
unlikely that the pope would discuss blame for specific events _ no
naming names, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a kind of politically correct exercise in
self-abnegation,'' said George Weigel, a senior fellow at the
Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington and author of a
recent biography of John Paul II, ``Witness to Hope''
(HarperCollins). ``This is the pope making plain in a liturgical
context that the people of the church have failed to make plain the
truth that the church bears.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may wonder whether the pope will somehow undercut the
church's doctrine of papal infallibility by effectively rejecting
actions of some of his predecessors. But his apology can also be
understood as affirming that doctrine, which applies to the
church's teaching on Christian faith and morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the acts which contradict the teachings, which make the
apology pertinent,'' said the Rev. Michael J. Baxter, a professor
of theology at the University of Notre Dame. The apology
acknowledges that the church, through the men and women who make up
its ranks, ``has strayed from its own mission,'' Baxter said. ``And
yet that doesn't undermine the integrity of the mission, which
impresses its importance on us all the more.''
</P>
<P>
   One might ask, too, why now? After all, it's been centuries
since the Crusades and Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in timing, personal outlook and recent
history: the symbolic significance of the dawn of the third
Christian millennium, combined with the readiness of this
particular pontiff to face the past, and a watershed event in the
church's history (the reformist Second Vatican Council of the
1960s) that provided the institutional basis for making such a
reckoning possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the pope's apology comes during a Year of Jubilee,
a Holy Year, when tens of millions of Catholics are expected to
make a pilgrimage to Rome. March 12 is also the first Sunday in
Lent, the 40-day fast in the church calendar that precedes Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no coincidence, I'm quite sure,'' said Baxter. ``Lent
is a time of reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that in order to follow Christ, ``one needs to begin
from a disposition of repentance'' is a recurring and vital theme
in John Paul's encyclicals, Baxter said, adding that it has been an
essential tradition of the church that a confessional examination
of the past is required if one is to move forward faithfully into
the future.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Baxter said, by offering an apology for past
transgressions, a gesture that would include the Crusades and the
Inquisition, the pope is giving a new endorsement to the most
controversial document of the Second Vatican Council, the
Declaration on Religious Freedom, promulgated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   That document, heavily influenced by the thinking of the
American theologian John Courtney Murray, rejected the idea that
religious and political power should be linked. It treated the idea
of religious pluralism with respect and declared that people accept
faith as a free act and cannot be compelled to do so. ``In order to
convey the truth,'' Baxter said, ``how one conveys it makes all the
difference in the world. And one cannot convey that unless one
embodies the peace of God revealed in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   But what effect will the pope's apology have in the wider
Catholic world? Will it inspire Catholics in Europe (scene of the
Crusades and Inquisition) to reflect more positively on religious
minorities in their midst? ``Now the question is, how much of this
will be implemented at the pew level?'' said Rabbi Leon Klenicki,
interreligious affairs director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith.

   ATLANTA _ Once it was solid, solidly Democratic. Then it began
shifting, seemingly inexorably, toward becoming solidly Republican.
And now? For the moment, at least, the South seems to have settled
into a state of bipartisan equilibrium, where depending on the
place, the year, the candidates, their resources, the economy and
the issues, either party can prevail.
</P>
<P>
   That new dynamic could make the South an interesting place to
watch in November. Because the region remains more conservative
than the rest of the country, it poses formidable challenges for
the presumptive Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. Indeed,
recent polls show Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent
Republican nominee, with a healthy lead over Gore in the South,
even as he trails the vice president in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, however, Southern Democrats have managed
to stall the Republican advance, even in the most conservative
states, and some believe those successes provide a glimmer of hope
for Gore. If the vice president can split the South, as President
Clinton did by winning four of 11 Southern states in both 1992 and
1996, he is likely to follow his mentor to the White House. In the
three presidential elections before Clinton, the Democratic Party's
sole Southern success was Jimmy Carter's 1980 victory in his native
Georgia (one of only six states he won nationwide in that
Republican landslide election.) .
</P>
<P>
   As the remnants of the presidential primary campaign move south
this week, with contests on Tuesday in Texas, Florida, Tennessee,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the candidates will encounter
a kinetic political landscape that is still searching for partisan
definition. Recent elections suggest there simply is no majority
party these days in the South, a region where the politics of the
moment are often pitched by crosscurrents of race, religion,
migration and economics.
</P>
<P>
   Today's South is a place where conservative whites in
southwestern Georgia can embrace a black Democratic congressman,
Sanford D. Bishop Jr., while their compatriots in South Carolina
and Alabama rally for the Confederate battle flag .
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Bush from restoring the Republican lock on the South,
Gore will have to follow a formula tested in recent years by an
array of Democratic candidates. It calls for focusing on mainstream
concerns like education, Social Security, managed care and urban
sprawl, depicting Republicans as right-wing extremists, and
maximizing black turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans maintain that recent Democratic successes may
be as attributable to local circumstances as to any regional
realignment. But Democrats argue that more enduring forces may be
at work. Clinton, though disdained for his moral lapses, has
demonstrated that Democrats can manage the economy, they say.
Welfare reform has disarmed the Republicans of one of their most
lethal weapons, and prosperity has quieted the clamor for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A smoking economy and the passage of time have softened racial
tensions, raising the stakes for Republican candidates who employ
racial tactics. And while they are predominantly Republican, the
more than 1 million migrants who flood into the region each year
tend to be less conservative than native white Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy E. Barnes of Georgia, who has won high ratings by
championing school reform and fighting sprawl, maintains that
Southern Democrats have learned how to win again. ``We centrist
Democrats and the African-American community have come together in
a coalition that encompasses a base of middle-class whites,'' he
said. ``It's a new emerging common ground, and let me tell you,
it's a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Although troubled by Democratic victories in 1998 and 1999,
Southern Republicans assert that there is plenty of room for their
party to grow with help from continuing immigration, term limits,
reapportionment and redistricting. The key, as in the rest of the
country, may be whether Republicans can reassure the middle by
distancing themselves from the unbending social conservatism
promoted by the party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be better politicians and learn how to package
our campaigns,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La. ``We've got to hold
to our conservative credentials and yet speak in more moderate
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 40 years, the 11 states of the old Confederacy have
undergone a striking political transformation. First gradually, and
then with runaway speed, a party that barely existed has supplanted
a party that dominated at every level.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, there were no Southern Republicans in the U.S. Senate,
none serving as governor, and only seven among the region's 106
members of the House. As recently as 1980, only 17 percent of
Southern state legislators were Republicans, and there were
legislative houses in three separate Southern states _ Alabama,
Arkansas and Louisiana _ without a single Republican member.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, the apex of Republican strength, the numbers presented
nearly a mirror image. Eight of the South's 11 governors, 15 of its
22 U.S. senators and 71 of its 125 members of Congress were
Republicans. In state legislatures, where the power of incumbency
has made change more grudging, Republicans now hold 42 percent of
all seats and control six chambers. Republicans also have made
gains in the suburbs of metropolitan areas like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the South did not grow appreciably more
conservative during these years. But they indicate that beginning
in the Reagan years, conservative Southerners have increasingly
identified themselves as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the 20th century, solid Democratic control
of the South was vital to the preservation of white supremacy. That
rationale began to disintegrate when national Democratic leaders
broke with the party's Southern wing and aligned with the cause of
civil rights.

   Many Southern whites then found a home in the Republican Party,
which was already compatible with their views on economics and
defense, and which lured defectors by playing the race card.
Paradoxically, Southern blacks, many of them just gaining the right
to vote, then flocked to the once-segregationist Democratic Party
because of its national leaders' views on race.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an almost exclusively white Republican Party,
which is now dominated by religious conservatives, and a biracial
Democratic Party where black voters play an equally influential
role. That racial dynamic has generated a tried-and-true electoral
equation, said Merle Black, an Emory University political
scientist. ``The Democrats can count on 90 percent of the black
vote but typically need 40 percent of the white vote to win,'' he
said. ``The Republican Party starts with almost nothing of the
black vote and thus needs 60 percent of the white vote.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last two decades, that calculus has favored the
Republicans. But in the last two years the trend lines have
shifted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Democratic candidates defeated Republican incumbent
governors in Alabama and South Carolina, hung on to the Georgia
governorship in a tough race and lost the seat in Florida. The
Democrats also picked up one Senate seat that year, in North
Carolina. They stopped the Republican advance in the House and gave
up only eight legislative seats in 1,782 elections, far fewer than
usual. Last year, the Democrats added the governorship of
Mississippi. In addition, there has been a slowdown in
Democrat-to-Republican party switching.
</P>
<P>
   Those results suggested that centrist Democrats have learned to
unite voters around kitchen-table issues, even if their positions
upset Democratic interest groups. Republicans, by contrast, remain
bewildered about how to both accommodate and control their right
wing, a point driven home by this year's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to the Democrats in the '70s and '80s is now
replaying itself with the Republicans,'' said Rep. Harold E. Ford
Jr., D-Tenn. ``There's a discomfort on the part of many Republicans
for their party to be known for prayer in schools, pro-life, racial
intolerance, Bob Jones and the Confederate flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican, said that Southern
voters are now less concerned with party labels than with
performance in areas like education and children's health care.
``The Republicans who have proven winners are ones who have tried
not to sell their brand but have tried to sell their cereal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rep. Gene Taylor, a conservative Mississippi
Democrat, said that his party has been helped by the anemic record
of the Republican Congress. ``What I now see is people falling out
of love with the Republicans,'' he said. ``It doesn't necessarily
mean they're in love with the Democrats, but the infatuation with
the Republicans has passed. So it's now up to the individual
candidates to prove their case. And that's the way it should be.''

<P>
   It is said that a portrait of Peter the Great hangs in the
office of Vladimir Putin, the acting president of Russia, who seems
likely to win the presidential election March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the West who perceive Peter as the Westernizing
reformer and scourge of xenophobes, and who have heard Putin's
paeans to free enterprise and democracy, are likely to find this
heartening.
</P>
<P>
   Others, who know Peter primarily for his unrelenting pursuit of
power and empire, and who have nervously watched the Kremlin's new
master, a former KGB agent, presiding over the destruction of
Grozny and expounding the glories of a strong Russian state, might
find the identification alarming.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the presumed dichotomy between the ``good'' westernizing
reformer and the ``reactionary'' Russian nationalist has shaped _
and sometimes distorted _ much of the discussion about Putin, as it
has about other Soviet and Russian leaders. In the end, they have
all defied these imposed categories, from the ``whiskey sipping''
Yuri Andropov to the democratic champion Boris Yeltsin, forever
leaving a disappointed West wondering, ``Who lost Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   So it might be useful at this juncture in Russian history to
look back at the ruler who first turned Russia westward, and at why
the Russians anointed him as ``the Great.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians' historical image of Czar Peter I, who ruled from 1682
to 1725, was shaped by their greatest poet. Ask a provincial pupil
or a vodka-addled bum how St. Petersburg was founded, and they will
instinctively launch into the opening lines of Pushkin's ``Bronze
Horseman'': ``On the shore of desolate seas/ stood he, full of
great thoughts . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'' is a mighty giant _ Peter stood 6 foot 7 and could rip
leather soles with his bare hands _ who imposes greatness on a
backward-looking, indolent nation through sheer force of will.
Pushkin's Peter is an almost mystical czar/creator, a ``powerful
master of fate,'' a ``miracle-working builder.'' Ordaining that his
brilliant new capital be raised in the swampy delta of the Neva
River, he proclaims: ``By nature we are fated here/ To hew a window
into Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   That this epic feat opened Russia to the West and established it
as a major power certainly qualifies Peter to be remembered as
``the Great.'' But it is another question whether that ranks him as
a westernizer or a Russian nationalist _ or whether these have ever
been the relevant categories for judging any Russian leader, Putin
included.
</P>
<P>
   That the superhuman image of Peter was sculpted for the Russians
by a poet who otherwise bridled at any authority is curious, but
not surprising. The window Peter opened into Europe created the
dynamic clash of East and West in which a brilliant culture was
forged, and in which Pushkin himself was reared a century later.
</P>
<P>
   It was a culture in which poets like Pushkin or Brodsky were
forever worshiped as bearers of a higher truth and forever hounded
as threats to the omnipotence of the state. This gave their art a
power that neither East nor West alone could have sustained.
</P>
<P>
   Also curious, and unsurprising, is that the greatest antipathy
for Peter persists among Russian xenophobes of the sort who believe
in a mythical and unique ``Holy Russia.'' That he expanded Russia's
borders far beyond Muscovy's swampy forests and assumed the
grandiose title of Emperor of All the Russias has always been of
little consolation to hard-core Russophiles; to this day they
cannot forgive Peter for his hostility to Holy Russia _ for rudely
hacking off the great beards of the boyars, subjugating the
Orthodox Church to the state and abandoning ancient Moscow for a
Rococo new capital designed by Europeans. Indeed, he gave this new
capital a consummately foreign name, the Dutch ``Sankt-Piterburkh''
(it was Russified as Petrograd in World War I, and known as
Leningrad during the Soviet era).
</P>
<P>
   That identification of reform with Western models, and of
resistance to it with the symbols of Holy Russia, set the model for
all subsequent reformers _ Alexander II imposing Western-style
uniforms and sidewhiskers on his officers, Lenin in a three-piece
suit forcing peasants into collectives, Mikhail Gorbachev launching
his perestroika with an assault on vodka.
</P>
<P>
   So it should not have come as the surprise it did to the
Kremlin's servile ideologues that Stalin chose not to purge Peter
along with the rest of Russia's ``feudal'' past; instead, he kept
Peter _ or at least a politically correct version of him _ in the
Bolshevik version of Russian history. Perhaps the notion of a
predecessor who thought nothing of sacrificing tens of thousands of
his subjects for the greater good of the state found a certain
resonance in the master of the gulag.

</P>
<P>
   In the West, meanwhile, Peter evolved into something of a great
individualist driven by the longing to reform his backward society,
to make it Western. He became the template for the sort of Russian
the West believes it likes to do business with _ Catherine the
Great, Andropov, Gorbachev, the ``liberal reformers'' of Yeltsin's
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Peter's real intention for his perestroika, much
like Gorbachev's for his, was not to emulate or join the West, but
to use it _ in the czar's own elegant (and possibly apocryphal)
phrase, ``We need Europe for a few decades, then we must show it
our rear end.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the pursuit of happiness by his people was never
even remotely a factor in Peter's reforming zeal, and that he never
entertained the notion that his subjects had rights. Once it
identifies a reformer, it takes a lot for the West to lose faith _
or, in the presumptuous parlance of Washington, to lose Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is Peter's true greatness, that in his enormous
contradictions _ his voracious appetites and his extraordinary
curiosity, his frightening cruelty and his grand visions, his
physical prowess and his bouts of madness, his hatred of Russian
slovenliness and his profound Russianness _ he both fostered and
reflected the ambivalent greatness of his nation.
</P>
<P>
   In Pushkin's masterpiece, Peter is the ``powerful master of
fate,'' but he is also a terrible apparition of a relentless and
oppressive bronze horseman that drives a poor clerk to madness and
death in the flood-soaked alleys of St. Petersburg. Peter's pursuit
of greatness and power, and the misery and sacrifice they created,
have defined all subsequent cycles of Russian and Soviet history.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, of course, is no Peter. The KGB lieutenant colonel who
was abruptly bumped into the presidential throne of a nation in
total disarray comes nowhere near ``the Great'' in ambition,
potential, drive or physical height. And too little is known at
this stage to predict his behavior once he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   But in any speculation about whether he is reformer or
nationalist, autocrat or democrat, Western or Eastern, it must be
kept in mind that in Russia these have never been mutually
exclusive; that the most potent driving force in Russian history
has been neither the sentimental xenophobia of bearded Slavophiles
nor the pursuit of American-style happiness, but a deep-seated
conviction that the Russian state is destined for greatness, power
and respect. That has been true whether Russia aspired to being an
empire, a utopia or a presidential republic.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclical bouts of westernizing and reforming have always
more to do with power than with democracy, more with matching the
West than with joining it, more with discipline than with rule of
law.

<P>
   FAIRFIELD, Iowa _ As the sun rose over slumbering Iowa
cornfields, Tim DeFord rambled along Interstate 80 in an old
station wagon stocked with men's suits and shirts. A haberdasher
who makes house calls, DeFord caters to customers in little
Midwestern towns that no longer have a men's shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can size a guy up over the phone,'' said DeFord, 43,
reaching under the car's front seat for a metal box that held the
names and addresses of his far-flung customers. ``I ask their
height and weight. And if a guy says, `Oh, I guess I weigh about
210, maybe 215,' I write down 230.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFord owns Lord's Fine Men's Wear in Perry, about 30 miles
northwest of Des Moines, a store that would have closed long ago,
meeting the fate of so many small-town shops, if DeFord did not
keep his business alive by traveling to customers in places where
men's shops have disappeared, towns like Indianola and Keosauqua,
Webster City and Oskaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, stores of all kinds on Main Street have been dying,
as shoppers have turned to big shopping centers and outlet malls,
even if it means a long drive. But for men's shops, it is not just
the competition that has changed, but the customers. Americans have
gone to casual attire.
</P>
<P>
   Workplaces now routinely allow employees to ``dress down.''
Principal, a big insurance company in Des Moines, has adopted a
policy of letting workers dress informally. In the computer field,
a suit is about as common as a manual typewriter. When they go to
the opera or to church, people wear blue jeans and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into some of these places, and there aren't 25 men in
town who wear a suit to work,'' said DeFord, who carries brands
like Austin Reed, Christian Books and Warren Sowell. ``But for
those 25 guys, somebody's got to sell them a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   From Interstate 80, DeFord turned off at Oskaloosa, passing
Happy Joe's ice cream parlor and the A.D. Gun store, then turned
off on a hilly country road just west of Ottumwa, before cruising
past faded barns and grain elevators into Fairfield, a town of
10,000 people, where his first customer of the day, Stew Gaumer,
54, was waiting for the clothier at Agri-Industrial Products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got some nice slacks, Stew,'' DeFord told Gaumer, after a
handshake, some pleasantries and a word about the balmy weather.
</P>
<P>
   The two men retreated to a conference room for privacy, as
DeFord laid out six pairs of trousers on a table. Gaumer, a
53-year-old salesman, slipped off his pants to try on a new pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuff or plain hem, Stew?'' DeFord asked, bending to his knees
to measure the fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuff,'' Gaumer replied.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the slacks on the table, Gaumer chose three: navy,
khaki and olive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll do it,'' said Gaumer, who was in a hurry to catch a
plane for a business trip to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As he wrote a check, Gaumer talked about the convenience of this
style of shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could drive 60 miles to a mall in Iowa City and waste half a
day,'' Gaumer said. ``Here we started at 10 minutes to 10. Now
we're all done, and it's not even 10 o'clock yet.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFord, a tall, angular man with reddish hair graying at the
temples, hurried back to his station wagon, fired the engine and
drove off to his next stop: Henderson's frame shop and gallery.
</P>
<P>
   At the store, Don Henderson shouted a friendly greeting, but
pointed to a line of customers and lifted his palms to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm awful busy right now,'' Henderson said. ``Can you come
back later?''
</P>
<P>
   DeFord nodded, then headed back to the car, and drove a few
blocks to Central Valley Bank, just to chat for a minute with Greg
Lowenberg, an old customer, about his latest fishing exploits.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Back out on the sidewalk of Burlington Avenue, DeFord was
stopped by a woman who shouted, ``Hey, you're the traveling clothes
man.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Rose Kennedy, who runs a real estate office in downtown
Fairfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband bought a pair of pants from you last summer,''
Kennedy explained. ``Well, he's quit smoking and gained some
weight. So he needs to have them let out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he around?'' DeFord asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's down at the carwash now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll try him later,'' the clothier assured her.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to another bank, the Iowa State Bank &AMP; Trust,
where Jerry Green, 43, was waiting for his new suit.
</P>
<P>
   On an earlier trip, Green had selected a swatch of clothing for
a custom-made suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feels right,'' Green said, as he slipped on the trousers
in a basement meeting room, ``as long as I don't gain some
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Want some more room?'' DeFord asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he replied, ``I'd just fill it up.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he measured the fit, DeFord tried to make another
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want to look at some ties?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Green said, a bit apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   DeFord slapped down a dress shirt on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real dress, French cuffs,'' DeFord told him. ``I'd really
like to get your shirt business.''
</P>
<P>
   Green told him he would think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Next it was back to Don Henderson's store, where his wife,
Donna, explained that he had run out on a key job, part of his
locksmithing sideline in the frame business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' she said, ``he'll be back in the late afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   On every road trip to Fairfield, which DeFord makes once or
twice a week, he makes time for a retired clothier, Ralph Perry,
who ran the finest men's shop in town for 30 years until retiring
in 1981. In almost every town, DeFord calls on the retired
haberdashers, partly for advice, partly for leads on customers.
</P>
<P>
   Green, 81, who favored skinny long brown cigarettes and long,
colorful stories, took a seat in a rocking chair and thanked DeFord
for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``I tell people around here that they can
trust you.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFord nodded appreciatively.
</P>
<P>
   Perry quickly moved to one of his favorite topics, the
unpardonable dressing habits of Americans today. The leisure suit,
as he recalls it, was the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd go to a funeral and see pallbearers wearing leisure
suits,'' he said, grimacing as if he had just bit into a lemon.
``It was a disgusting development.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFord said he knew too well about the changed dressing habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could put my inventory on the sidewalk with a sign that says
`free' and half the people in the town would walk right past it,''
he said. ``They'd think, `Now what would I want to put that in my
closet for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Perry told him that all was not lost. There were still some
people out there with taste and standards in dressing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a group of people you enjoy pleasing,'' Green
said, ``gosh that's dandy.''
</P>
<P>
   The protege and the mentor shook hands and said goodbye until
the next time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Back on the road, DeFord headed to a newer neighborhood of
Fairfield, turned down a winding street and pulled into the
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the front door, Leland Gookin waved the clothier
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking thunderstorms,'' Gookin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ground needs the moisture,'' the clothier said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men nodded. Then it was time to get down to business.
</P>
<P>
   Gookin was not an easy fit for a sport coat: size 46 short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at this,'' DeFord said, holding up a sport coat
for Gookin to inspect. ``It's got some blue in it, some tan, maybe
some olive. You could wear it all year round.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know,'' Gookin said. ``I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go look in the mirror, Leland,'' the clothier said. ``Give it
a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Gookin walked to a mirror, then returned to the living room,
where DeFord waited with hope for a sale on the $240 coat.
</P>
<P>
   But Gookin was still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was time for more small talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's that Mercury of yours?'' asked DeFord, who knew how
Gookin loved his 1957 vintage automobile, the one in a framed
photograph in the living room.
</P>

   ``Got it stored in the garage uptown for now,'' Gookin answered,
as he turned back to the sport coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't I leave it here for your wife to look at it when she
comes back,'' DeFord said as he lay the sport coat on the couch.
``She's your fashion adviser, right.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Out in the car, DeFord said he knew it would be a struggle to
make a sale without a woman on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys of a certain generation,'' he said, ``they've never
bought clothes by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the clock neared noon, DeFord drove to a Hardy's restaurant,
his usual stop in Fairfield, and ordered lunch. Wearing a dark
suit, crisp white shirt, print tie and tassled loafers, the
clothier had a hamburger and a carton of milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my business are better off if they don't have a
memory,'' he said, talking about earlier times, when people dressed
to the nines. ``The old days are gone, and they're not coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, DeFord made his third trip to Henderson's
frame shop.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the store, the salesman admired some prints on the wall
and waited, until Henderson, 53, who was working behind the
counter, called out: ``I guess I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men retreated to a back room, and DeFord laid out eight
or nine shirts and a handful of ties on a work table.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who said he counted on DeFord to ``keep my colors a
little bit coordinated,'' considered his choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a wedding coming up,'' he said, ``so I need a good
summer shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFord pointed to a tie with a Norman Rockwell print.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of neat for a guy in a gallery, don't you think?'' the
salesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   But he did like two of the dress shirts, especially after his
wife, Donna, said she liked them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should fit the bill,'' Henderson said as he hurried back
to wait on a customer at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   It was past nine o'clock that night by the time DeFord had seen
his last customer of the day. He got a room at the Super 8 motel,
and prepared to get up early for the next day's rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about the competition,'' DeFord said. ``Nobody
is going to work this hard.''

<P>
   One of them was born just a dozen blocks from the White House
and reared, at least when Congress was in session, in a hotel set
amid the embassies of Washington. The other knew 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue as the place where his father worked for a dozen years in
successive jobs: vice president of the United States for two-thirds
of that time, president for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their parallel paths of privilege took them past landmarks that
were different in name but identical in spirit: St. Albans School
and Harvard University for one, Phillips Academy and Yale
University for the other.
</P>
<P>
   And politics pumped so strongly in their blood that one of them
first ran for a seat in the House of Representatives _ the same
seat his father had once occupied _ in 1976, at the age of just 28.
(He won.) The other lagged only two years behind, making his own
bid for Congress in 1978 at the age of 32. (He lost.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite all the primary-season chatter about giving
Americans a new kind of politics, despite the tussles in both
parties over which presidential contender could bring a fresh and
unjaded perspective to governing, the contest has narrowed to these
two: Albert A. Gore Jr. and George W. Bush, a former senator's only
son and a former president's firstborn _ namesakes and political
princes with dissimilar styles but astonishingly similar
inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential historians and political analysts said they could
not recall a previous election in American history when the
nominees (presumptive, for now) of both major parties were not only
such prominent political heirs but also from such similar stations
and members of the same generation.
</P>
<P>
   That equivalence could simply be accidental, the analysts said,
but several said it speaks in part to the state of politics and the
mood of the electorate. It also imbues this year's presidential
race with an unusual and fascinating dynamic: among the challenges
facing both Vice President Gore and Bush, the Texas governor, is
how they relate to their political ancestries, particularly the
degree to which they reap the benefits of their backgrounds while
avoiding the drawbacks. That balancing act has been a theme in both
men's careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either of them is going to have a slogan of
`Vote for me, keep the tradition alive,''' said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic strategist, adding that such bald elevations of pedigree
over merit would surely invite rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But to some extent, he and other political analysts noted, the
Democratic voters who backed Gore and the Republican voters who
supported Bush were indeed choosing to keep certain traditions
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the more relevant tradition may have been the
last seven years of the Clinton administration. But in the cases of
both candidates, voters were choosing someone with an almost
congenital grasp of politics, all the social and material
advantages that went along with that life style and milieu and a
relative unfamiliarity with hardship or tests of character on the
scale of Sen. John McCain's five and a half years as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both dealt with that war in a way that reflected
their memberships in a younger, more coddled generation. Gore went
to Vietnam, but only briefly, and as an Army journalist. Bush got a
coveted spot as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard and was
able to stay close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in a recessionary period, where class distinctions
are more on the surface, there might have been more of a dialogue
about that,'' said Don Sipple, a Republican strategist. Similarly,
he said, if the nation were in the grip of a crisis, voters might
reject any semblance of the status quo and seek someone who seemed
just a bit more idiosyncratic and adventurous, a bit less destined.
</P>
<P>
   A brief period of economic fright yielded the man from Hope,
Bill Clinton. A nationally devastating corruption of the public
trust yielded the man from Plains, Jimmy Carter. With the world
relatively peaceful and the nation phenomenally prosperous, there
is no such invitation this time around for a slightly unusual
upstart or self-styled maverick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bradley or McCain understood that,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``There's sometimes an
assumption that Americans are risk-takers in good times. But
Americans are really only risk-takers in bad times. There's a real
interest out there in finding someone who is going to preserve what
we have, someone who knows the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said that in some focus groups she has conducted, voters
expressed both an assumption that Bush might call his father at
crucial times and a sense of comfort _ not alarm _ in that
likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bush and their supporters say it is the men's
accomplishments that have made them credible presidential
contenders. But their ancestries undeniably helped start and guide
them on their way in politics, providing them with networks, access
to money, instantly high profiles and other tactical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, their fathers' careers _ especially their failures
_ taught them valuable lessons, some reflected in their current
campaigns. When Albert Gore Sr.'s many distinguished years as a
senator from Tennessee ended with his defeat at the polls in 1970,
one reason was his Republican rival's nasty and negative approach,
which Gore did not match. His son exhibited no such reticence in
taking on former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey over the last nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father's political demise was as instructive to him as
anything that his father did while in office,'' said Bill Turque,
author of a recent biography of the vice president, ``Inventing Al
Gore'' (Houghton Mifflin). ``It taught him the power of attack
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a similar reference point: his father's failed bid for
a second term as president in 1992. President Bush ran a campaign
more responsive than assertive and hampered by dissension and
disloyalty in the ranks. His son sought to avoid those mistakes,
quickly putting McCain on the defensive and entrusting his effort
to a tightly knit circle of longtime political allies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both candidates' relationships to their patrimony are
more complicated. They recognize that if they seem to be trading
too heavily on their backgrounds, it could turn off voters. They
also realize that their backgrounds inform and play into some of
their most potent liabilities: in Gore's case, that his life and
world view are utterly circumscribed by politics; in Bush's case,
that his late-blooming political prominence is the result of his
father's connections, not his own talents and toilings.

   In the years between 1992, when Gore won the vice presidency and

</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore almost constantly invokes Albert Gore Sr. on
the campaign trail, but largely to emphasize what a self-made man
his father was. He mentions that his father was poor and had to
attend law school at night. The vice president need not worry that
voters will think he is trying to trade on Americans' affection for
his father, because only older voters in Tennessee would have the
requisite memory of the man.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, by contrast, is keenly remembered
_ he left office only seven years ago _ and that creates both an
added impetus for his son to mention him and a greater danger that
some voters will raise an eyebrow when he does so. So the Texas
governor is artful and sparing about it.
</P>
<P>
   For much of last year, Bush's stump speech included a passage in
which he acknowledged that the leap from governor to president
would be a big one. ``But,'' he added, `'I've had some pretty good
training.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to talk about running Texas, but the pauses he
took before and after that line, and the applause it reliably
elicited, left no doubt about its intent. Bush was saying, without
quite saying, that being his father's son should give Americans
some reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bush and his advisers
abandoned such subtlety, putting the governor's parents on a stage
with him. The event was deemed by many to be a disaster, signaling
to voters that a torch was being passed, rather than earned.
</P>
<P>
   It was odd, because Bush usually goes out of his way to avoid
that impression. His almost strenuously folksy side _ the cowboy
boots he sometimes wears, the hyper-informal manner that recently
prompted him to address several of the physicians at a recent
campaign event as ``Doc'' _ seems like a self-conscious purging of
the blue in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore takes his own stabs at a common touch. Did you know that he
once lived in a trailer park? That he likes and watches ``The
Simpsons''? Voters at his town hall-style meetings do, because Gore
has made a point of telling them.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a somewhat surreal spectacle between now and
November: two candidates whose life stories could not be more
entwined in establishment politics, and whose current situations
owe a great deal to those circumstances, competing to convince
Americans that they have just the right distance from it all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once it was solid, solidly Democratic. Then it began
shifting, seemingly inexorably, toward becoming solidly Republican.
And now? For the moment, at least, the South seems to have settled
into a state of bipartisan equilibrium, where depending on the
place, the year, the candidates, their resources, the economy and
the issues, either party can prevail.
</P>
<P>
   That new dynamic could make the South an interesting place to
watch in November. Because the region remains more conservative
than the rest of the country, it poses formidable challenges for
the presumptive Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. Indeed,
recent polls show Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent
Republican nominee, with a healthy lead over Gore in the South,
even as he trails the vice president in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, however, Southern Democrats have managed
to stall the Republican advance, even in the most conservative
states, and some believe those successes provide a glimmer of hope
for Gore. If the vice president can split the South, as President
Clinton did by winning four of 11 Southern states in both 1992 and
1996, he is likely to follow his mentor to the White House. In the
three presidential elections before Clinton, the Democratic Party's
sole Southern success was Jimmy Carter's 1980 victory in his native
Georgia (one of only six states he won nationwide in that
Republican landslide election.) .
</P>
<P>
   As the remnants of the presidential primary campaign move south
this week, with contests on Tuesday in Texas, Florida, Tennessee,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the candidates will encounter
a kinetic political landscape that is still searching for partisan
definition. Recent elections suggest there simply is no majority
party these days in the South, a region where the politics of the
moment are often pitched by crosscurrents of race, religion,
migration and economics.
</P>
<P>
   Today's South is a place where conservative whites in
southwestern Georgia can embrace a black Democratic congressman,
Sanford D. Bishop Jr., while their compatriots in South Carolina
and Alabama rally for the Confederate battle flag .
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Bush from restoring the Republican lock on the South,
Gore will have to follow a formula tested in recent years by an
array of Democratic candidates. It calls for focusing on mainstream
concerns like education, Social Security, managed care and urban
sprawl, depicting Republicans as right-wing extremists, and
maximizing black turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans maintain that recent Democratic successes may
be as attributable to local circumstances as to any regional
realignment. But Democrats argue that more enduring forces may be
at work. Clinton, though disdained for his moral lapses, has
demonstrated that Democrats can manage the economy, they say.
Welfare reform has disarmed the Republicans of one of their most

<P>
   Although troubled by Democratic victories in 1998 and 1999,
Southern Republicans assert that there is plenty of room for their
party to grow with help from continuing immigration, term limits,

<P>
   In 1960, there were no Southern Republicans in the U.S. Senate,
none serving as governor, and only seven among the region's 106
members of the House. As recently as 1980, only 17 percent of
Southern state legislators were Republicans, and there were
legislative houses in three separate Southern states _ Alabama,
Arkansas and Louisiana _ without a single Republican member.

<P>
   By 1998, the apex of Republican strength, the numbers presented
nearly a mirror image. Eight of the South's 11 governors, 15 of its
22 U.S. senators and 71 of its 125 members of Congress were
Republicans. In state legislatures, where the power of incumbency
has made change more grudging, Republicans now hold 42 percent of
all seats and control six chambers. Republicans also have made
gains in the suburbs of metropolitan areas like Atlanta.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once it was solid, solidly Democratic. Then it began
shifting, seemingly inexorably, toward becoming solidly Republican.
And now? For the moment, at least, the South seems to have settled
into a state of bipartisan equilibrium, where depending on the
place, the year, the candidates, their resources, the economy and
the issues, either party can prevail.
</P>
<P>
   That new dynamic could make the South an interesting place to
watch in November. Because the region remains more conservative
than the rest of the country, it poses formidable challenges for
the presumptive Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. Indeed,
recent polls show Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent
Republican nominee, with a healthy lead over Gore in the South,
even as he trails the vice president in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, however, Southern Democrats have managed
to stall the Republican advance, even in the most conservative
states, and some believe those successes provide a glimmer of hope
for Gore. If the vice president can split the South, as President
Clinton did by winning four of 11 Southern states in both 1992 and
1996, he is likely to follow his mentor to the White House. In the
three presidential elections before Clinton, the Democratic Party's
sole Southern success was Jimmy Carter's 1980 victory in his native
Georgia (one of only six states he won nationwide in that
Republican landslide election.) .
</P>
<P>
   As the remnants of the presidential primary campaign move south
this week, with contests on Tuesday in Texas, Florida, Tennessee,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the candidates will encounter
a kinetic political landscape that is still searching for partisan
definition. Recent elections suggest there simply is no majority
party these days in the South, a region where the politics of the
moment are often pitched by crosscurrents of race, religion,
migration and economics.
</P>
<P>
   Today's South is a place where conservative whites in
southwestern Georgia can embrace a black Democratic congressman,
Sanford D. Bishop Jr., while their compatriots in South Carolina
and Alabama rally for the Confederate battle flag .
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Bush from restoring the Republican lock on the South,
Gore will have to follow a formula tested in recent years by an
array of Democratic candidates. It calls for focusing on mainstream
concerns like education, Social Security, managed care and urban
sprawl, depicting Republicans as right-wing extremists, and
maximizing black turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans maintain that recent Democratic successes may
be as attributable to local circumstances as to any regional
realignment. But Democrats argue that more enduring forces may be
at work. Clinton, though disdained for his moral lapses, has
demonstrated that Democrats can manage the economy, they say.
Welfare reform has disarmed the Republicans of one of their most
lethal weapons, and prosperity has quieted the clamor for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A smoking economy and the passage of time have softened racial
tensions, raising the stakes for Republican candidates who employ
racial tactics. And while they are predominantly Republican, the
more than 1 million migrants who flood into the region each year

<P>
   Many Southern whites then found a home in the Republican Party,
which was already compatible with their views on economics and
defense, and which lured defectors by playing the race card.
Paradoxically, Southern blacks, many of them just gaining the right
to vote, then flocked to the once-segregationist Democratic Party
because of its national leaders' views on race.
</P>
<P>
   The result was an almost exclusively white Republican Party,
which is now dominated by religious conservatives, and a biracial
Democratic Party where black voters play an equally influential
role. That racial dynamic has generated a tried-and-true electoral
equation, said Merle Black, an Emory University political
scientist. ``The Democrats can count on 90 percent of the black
vote but typically need 40 percent of the white vote to win,'' he
said. ``The Republican Party starts with almost nothing of the
black vote and thus needs 60 percent of the white vote.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last two decades, that calculus has favored the
Republicans. But in the last two years the trend lines have
shifted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Democratic candidates defeated Republican incumbent
governors in Alabama and South Carolina, hung on to the Georgia
governorship in a tough race and lost the seat in Florida. The
Democrats also picked up one Senate seat that year, in North
Carolina. They stopped the Republican advance in the House and gave
up only eight legislative seats in 1,782 elections, far fewer than
usual. Last year, the Democrats added the governorship of
Mississippi. In addition, there has been a slowdown in
Democrat-to-Republican party switching.
</P>
<P>
   Those results suggested that centrist Democrats have learned to
unite voters around kitchen-table issues, even if their positions
upset Democratic interest groups. Republicans, by contrast, remain
bewildered about how to both accommodate and control their right
wing, a point driven home by this year's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to the Democrats in the '70s and '80s is now
replaying itself with the Republicans,'' said Rep. Harold E. Ford
Jr., D-Tenn. ``There's a discomfort on the part of many Republicans
for their party to be known for prayer in schools, pro-life, racial
intolerance, Bob Jones and the Confederate flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican, said that Southern
voters are now less concerned with party labels than with
performance in areas like education and children's health care.
``The Republicans who have proven winners are ones who have tried
not to sell their brand but have tried to sell their cereal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rep. Gene Taylor, a conservative Mississippi
Democrat, said that his party has been helped by the anemic record
of the Republican Congress. ``What I now see is people falling out
of love with the Republicans,'' he said. ``It doesn't necessarily
mean they're in love with the Democrats, but the infatuation with
the Republicans has passed. So it's now up to the individual
candidates to prove their case. And that's the way it should be.''

   One of them was born just a dozen blocks from the White House
and reared, at least when Congress was in session, in a hotel set
amid the embassies of Washington. The other knew 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue as the place where his father worked for a dozen years in
successive jobs: vice president of the United States for two-thirds
of that time, president for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their parallel paths of privilege took them past landmarks that
were different in name but identical in spirit: St. Albans School
and Harvard University for one, Phillips Academy and Yale
University for the other.
</P>
<P>
   And politics pumped so strongly in their blood that one of them
first ran for a seat in the House of Representatives _ the same
seat his father had once occupied _ in 1976, at the age of just 28.
(He won.) The other lagged only two years behind, making his own
bid for Congress in 1978 at the age of 32. (He lost.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite all the primary-season chatter about giving
Americans a new kind of politics, despite the tussles in both
parties over which presidential contender could bring a fresh and
unjaded perspective to governing, the contest has narrowed to these
two: Albert A. Gore Jr. and George W. Bush, a former senator's only
son and a former president's firstborn _ namesakes and political
princes with dissimilar styles but astonishingly similar
inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential historians and political analysts said they could
not recall a previous election in American history when the
nominees (presumptive, for now) of both major parties were not only
such prominent political heirs but also from such similar stations
and members of the same generation.
</P>
<P>
   That equivalence could simply be accidental, the analysts said,
but several said it speaks in part to the state of politics and the
mood of the electorate. It also imbues this year's presidential
race with an unusual and fascinating dynamic: among the challenges
facing both Vice President Gore and Bush, the Texas governor, is
how they relate to their political ancestries, particularly the
degree to which they reap the benefits of their backgrounds while
avoiding the drawbacks. That balancing act has been a theme in both
men's careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either of them is going to have a slogan of
`Vote for me, keep the tradition alive,''' said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic strategist, adding that such bald elevations of pedigree
over merit would surely invite rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But to some extent, he and other political analysts noted, the
Democratic voters who backed Gore and the Republican voters who
supported Bush were indeed choosing to keep certain traditions
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the more relevant tradition may have been the
last seven years of the Clinton administration. But in the cases of
both candidates, voters were choosing someone with an almost
congenital grasp of politics, all the social and material
advantages that went along with that life style and milieu and a
relative unfamiliarity with hardship or tests of character on the
scale of Sen. John McCain's five and a half years as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both dealt with that war in a way that reflected
their memberships in a younger, more coddled generation. Gore went
to Vietnam, but only briefly, and as an Army journalist. Bush got a
coveted spot as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard and was
able to stay close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in a recessionary period, where class distinctions
are more on the surface, there might have been more of a dialogue
about that,'' said Don Sipple, a Republican strategist. Similarly,
he said, if the nation were in the grip of a crisis, voters might
reject any semblance of the status quo and seek someone who seemed
just a bit more idiosyncratic and adventurous, a bit less destined.
</P>
<P>
   A brief period of economic fright yielded the man from Hope,
Bill Clinton. A nationally devastating corruption of the public
trust yielded the man from Plains, Jimmy Carter. With the world
relatively peaceful and the nation phenomenally prosperous, there
is no such invitation this time around for a slightly unusual
upstart or self-styled maverick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bradley or McCain understood that,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``There's sometimes an
assumption that Americans are risk-takers in good times. But
Americans are really only risk-takers in bad times. There's a real
interest out there in finding someone who is going to preserve what
we have, someone who knows the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said that in some focus groups she has conducted, voters
expressed both an assumption that Bush might call his father at
crucial times and a sense of comfort _ not alarm _ in that
likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bush and their supporters say it is the men's
accomplishments that have made them credible presidential
contenders. But their ancestries undeniably helped start and guide
them on their way in politics, providing them with networks, access
to money, instantly high profiles and other tactical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, their fathers' careers _ especially their failures
_ taught them valuable lessons, some reflected in their current
campaigns. When Albert Gore Sr.'s many distinguished years as a
senator from Tennessee ended with his defeat at the polls in 1970,
one reason was his Republican rival's nasty and negative approach,
which Gore did not match. His son exhibited no such reticence in
taking on former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey over the last nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father's political demise was as instructive to him as
anything that his father did while in office,'' said Bill Turque,
author of a recent biography of the vice president, ``Inventing Al
Gore'' (Houghton Mifflin). ``It taught him the power of attack
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a similar reference point: his father's failed bid for
a second term as president in 1992. President Bush ran a campaign
more responsive than assertive and hampered by dissension and
disloyalty in the ranks. His son sought to avoid those mistakes,
quickly putting McCain on the defensive and entrusting his effort
to a tightly knit circle of longtime political allies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both candidates' relationships to their patrimony are
more complicated. They recognize that if they seem to be trading
too heavily on their backgrounds, it could turn off voters. They
also realize that their backgrounds inform and play into some of
their most potent liabilities: in Gore's case, that his life and
world view are utterly circumscribed by politics; in Bush's case,
that his late-blooming political prominence is the result of his
father's connections, not his own talents and toilings.

`Vote for me, keep the tradition alive,''' said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic strategist, adding that such bald elevations of pedigree
over merit would surely invite rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But to some extent, he and other political analysts noted, the
Democratic voters who backed Gore and the Republican voters who
supported Bush were indeed choosing to keep certain traditions
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the more relevant tradition may have been the
last seven years of the Clinton administration. But in the cases of
both candidates, voters were choosing someone with an almost
congenital grasp of politics, all the social and material
advantages that went along with that life style and milieu and a
relative unfamiliarity with hardship or tests of character on the
scale of Sen. John McCain's five and a half years as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both dealt with that war in a way that reflected
their memberships in a younger, more coddled generation. Gore went
to Vietnam, but only briefly, and as an Army journalist. Bush got a
coveted spot as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard and was
able to stay close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in a recessionary period, where class distinctions
are more on the surface, there might have been more of a dialogue
about that,'' said Don Sipple, a Republican strategist. Similarly,
he said, if the nation were in the grip of a crisis, voters might
reject any semblance of the status quo and seek someone who seemed
just a bit more idiosyncratic and adventurous, a bit less destined.
</P>
<P>
   A brief period of economic fright yielded the man from Hope,
Bill Clinton. A nationally devastating corruption of the public
trust yielded the man from Plains, Jimmy Carter. With the world
relatively peaceful and the nation phenomenally prosperous, there
is no such invitation this time around for a slightly unusual
upstart or self-styled maverick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bradley or McCain understood that,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``There's sometimes an
assumption that Americans are risk-takers in good times. But
Americans are really only risk-takers in bad times. There's a real
interest out there in finding someone who is going to preserve what
we have, someone who knows the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said that in some focus groups she has conducted, voters
expressed both an assumption that Bush might call his father at
crucial times and a sense of comfort _ not alarm _ in that
likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bush and their supporters say it is the men's
accomplishments that have made them credible presidential
contenders. But their ancestries undeniably helped start and guide
them on their way in politics, providing them with networks, access
to money, instantly high profiles and other tactical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, their fathers' careers _ especially their failures
_ taught them valuable lessons, some reflected in their current
campaigns. When Albert Gore Sr.'s many distinguished years as a
senator from Tennessee ended with his defeat at the polls in 1970,
one reason was his Republican rival's nasty and negative approach,
which Gore did not match. His son exhibited no such reticence in
taking on former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey over the last nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father's political demise was as instructive to him as
anything that his father did while in office,'' said Bill Turque,
author of a recent biography of the vice president, ``Inventing Al
Gore'' (Houghton Mifflin). ``It taught him the power of attack
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a similar reference point: his father's failed bid for
a second term as president in 1992. President Bush ran a campaign
more responsive than assertive and hampered by dissension and
disloyalty in the ranks. His son sought to avoid those mistakes,
quickly putting McCain on the defensive and entrusting his effort
to a tightly knit circle of longtime political allies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both candidates' relationships to their patrimony are
more complicated. They recognize that if they seem to be trading
too heavily on their backgrounds, it could turn off voters. They
also realize that their backgrounds inform and play into some of
their most potent liabilities: in Gore's case, that his life and
world view are utterly circumscribed by politics; in Bush's case,
that his late-blooming political prominence is the result of his
father's connections, not his own talents and toilings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the years between 1992, when Gore won the vice presidency and
his father said publicly that ``we raised him for it,'' and 1998,
when his father died, Gore's advisers sometimes sought to steer
reporters away from his dad.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore almost constantly invokes Albert Gore Sr. on
the campaign trail, but largely to emphasize what a self-made man
his father was. He mentions that his father was poor and had to
attend law school at night. The vice president need not worry that
voters will think he is trying to trade on Americans' affection for
his father, because only older voters in Tennessee would have the
requisite memory of the man.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, by contrast, is keenly remembered
_ he left office only seven years ago _ and that creates both an
added impetus for his son to mention him and a greater danger that
some voters will raise an eyebrow when he does so. So the Texas
governor is artful and sparing about it.
</P>
<P>
   For much of last year, Bush's stump speech included a passage in
which he acknowledged that the leap from governor to president
would be a big one. ``But,'' he added, `'I've had some pretty good
training.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to talk about running Texas, but the pauses he
took before and after that line, and the applause it reliably
elicited, left no doubt about its intent. Bush was saying, without
quite saying, that being his father's son should give Americans
some reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bush and his advisers
abandoned such subtlety, putting the governor's parents on a stage
with him. The event was deemed by many to be a disaster, signaling
to voters that a torch was being passed, rather than earned.
</P>
<P>
   It was odd, because Bush usually goes out of his way to avoid
that impression. His almost strenuously folksy side _ the cowboy
boots he sometimes wears, the hyper-informal manner that recently
prompted him to address several of the physicians at a recent
campaign event as ``Doc'' _ seems like a self-conscious purging of
the blue in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore takes his own stabs at a common touch. Did you know that he
once lived in a trailer park? That he likes and watches ``The
Simpsons''? Voters at his town hall-style meetings do, because Gore
has made a point of telling them.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a somewhat surreal spectacle between now and
November: two candidates whose life stories could not be more
entwined in establishment politics, and whose current situations
owe a great deal to those circumstances, competing to convince
Americans that they have just the right distance from it all.

MEXICO'S PRESIDENTIAL RACE BECOMES A REAL ONE AS THE CHALLENGER

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For months, Mexico's presidential race seemed
headed inexorably toward a 14th consecutive victory by the
governing party. Suddenly, it has turned into a real race because
Vicente Fox Quesada has made advances that give him a better chance
at the presidency than any other opposition figure since the
Mexican revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who usually wears cowboy
boots, has considerably narrowed the once-overwhelming lead in
public opinion held since last fall by Francisco Labastida Ochoa,
the nominee of President Ernesto Zedillo's party, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, recent polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   A bankers' convention in Acapulco this month showed just how
clearly some members of an elite that has always supported the
governing party unconditionally now believe it is time to end its
long monopoly over the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention on March 4, hundreds of financial executives
leaped into a standing ovation the moment Fox strode onto the
convention floor, cowboy boots freshly _ and personally _ polished
on the plane ride up. Several times, the bankers punctuated his
speech with applause, even when he said that ``after 70 years, we
Mexicans have finally understood that there are better political
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one step away from changing governments,'' said Fox, the
nominee of the conservative National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers gave Labastida a lukewarm reception.
</P>
<P>
   The third major candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a
former Mexico City mayor, is so far behind that some in his camp
are urging him to withdraw from the race so the opposition can
unite behind Fox. That is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's important is that some of Cardenas' backers have
concluded that Fox is the only candidate who can beat the PRI,''
said Jorge Castaneda, a political scientist who knows both
opposition candidates well.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, voters have elected thousands of
opposition mayors, a dozen opposition state governors and an
opposition majority in Congress. But Fox's current strength is
extraordinary because in presidential politics Mexico has been a
one-party nation since the PRI was founded in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   No presidential nominee of the governing party has ever received
less than 50 percent of the vote, according to official results in
a country with a tradition of ballot stuffing and vote-buying. As
recently as 1976, Jose Lopez Portillo was elected with 100 percent
of the votes _ no other name was on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition's best presidential showing, officially, came
when Cardenas garnered 32 percent in his first presidential bid in
1988. But many Mexicans believe he won, only to have victory stolen
from him by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   All previous presidential elections were organized by agencies
controlled by the governing party. This year, the Federal Electoral
Institute is fully autonomous. Still, Fox said in an interview he
is not convinced that the governing party would relinquish the
presidency if an opposition candidate won by a margin smaller than
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Factors that may decide the outcome of the July 2 elections
include several planned presidential debates and how voters finally
react to the economy, one of Latin America's most robust.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Mexicans, crediting Zedillo's stewardship for
lowering inflation and producing steady growth, will elect the
governing party once more. Others argue that stability favors Fox
because even conservative voters may be more willing to risk
political change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox is an outsider,'' the candidate said of himself one recent
day, climbing into the Chevrolet Suburban that ferried him between
rallies in villages around the western state of Michoacan. ``He's
the citizen worried about his country who gave up his business life
to work for change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few Mexicans believed you could beat the PRI,'' he said.
``So they wanted to see an aggressive guy, a rough guy with boots
and his sleeves rolled up, who wouldn't shrink from a fight for
social justice, a Lech Walesa, a Nelson Mandela, a challenger, a
guy who's a winner, a guy with guts. That's something I've tried to
reflect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting a monster and people had lost hope of
victory,'' Fox said, alluding in particular to the failure of
Mexico's opposition parties to unite behind one candidate. ``But
now that we're getting close to the election, people are realizing
I can win. And now they want to see a statesman. So now I'm trying
to build up that presidential image.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll in mid-February by the newspaper Reforma gave Labastida
39 percent and Fox 32 percent. Several other surveys have shown
Labastida's lead to be smaller and declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question answered by all the recent surveys was, `Can the
PRI lose the presidency?''' said Rafael Gimenez, the pollster for a
nationwide newspaper group. ``And the answer was, `Yes, the PRI
could lose.'' '
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with reporters, Esteban Moctezuma, Labastida's
campaign manager, denied that the recent polls marked any
significant turn in the campaign. Labastida simply had not bought
as many television or radio commercials as Fox for weeks before the
surveys, he said. In recent days, Labastida has begun an
advertising blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is 57. At 6 feet 6 inches, he towers over most Mexicans. He
establishes a quick rapport with rural crowds, clutching a
microphone in huge, weathered hands and speaking a rustic slang he
learned as a boy on his father's vegetable farm.
</P>
<P>
   But when he talks politics, he reasons like a marketing
strategist, the career he pursued at Coca-Cola, where he rose from
route supervisor to chief executive in 15 years. Later he helped
manage his family's footwear factories before a successful 1988 run
for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He says the governing party cheated him out of victory in his
first run for governor of Guanajuato state, in 1991. But four years
later he won the statehouse. As governor, he has attracted major
foreign investments, but the state remains poor.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's National Action Party, founded in the 1930s by
conservative Catholics whose forebears fought a guerrilla war
against anti-clerical generals, has grown over the decades into
Mexico's largest opposition party. But it remains a pygmy compared
with the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   Fox joined National Action shortly before he ran for Congress,
at a time when scores of other northern businessmen, disgruntled by
repeated devaluations of the peso, were also signing up. Some
leaders who previously controlled the party have never completely
accepted these newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Fox began his presidential bid in 1997 without asking his
party's permission. The party nominated him last year, but some
leaders do little to hide their dislike for him. Sidestepping
conflict, Fox has forged a campaign organization that operates
independently of the party.
</P>
<P>
   He has attracted support with his outspoken discussion of topics
more timid politicians fear to broach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The narcos took over the PRI long ago,'' Fox told a television
interviewer at a Morelia studio, pointing to narcotics accusations
lodged against the brother of Mexico's former president and other
governing party figures. ``No president from the PRI can solve this
because their governments have participated in the drug trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The reactions of Mexicans when Fox passes in his campaign convoy
suggest some voters are reluctant to back him openly. His slogan is
the single word Ya! (Enough Already!), which Mexicans understand as
a call to oust the governing party. His logo is a hand with two
fingers raised, superimposed on the letter Y, transforming the
V-for-victory into a Y-for-Ya signal. It is a slightly subversive
gesture of defiance to the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, as Fox's Suburban rolled slowly into
Morelia, the Michoacan capital, he leaned out the window, waving
his two-finger Enough Already! gesture to sidewalk crowds. Many
cheering pedestrians raised two fingers back. Others hesitated,
glancing sideways before flashing it back surreptitiously.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, Fox has promised to channel new loans to
small-business owners, modernize agriculture, decentralize the
bureaucracy, and attract billions in new foreign investment. Those
measures, he said, would allow economic growth, 3.7 percent last
year, to reach 7 percent by the third year of a Fox presidency.
Experts doubt Mexico can grow that fast any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   He promises what he calls an ``educational revolution,'' based
on new scholarships, teacher raises, and other broad new
investments in schools, which he says will be financed with oil
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've driven cows, I've planted corn, I know country life,
getting up before dawn, the dreams that come crashing down every
harvest,'' Fox said in a rally in the cobblestone plaza of Santa
Clara del Cobre, a town in hills south of Morelia.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Farias, an out-of-work electrician, watched local
residents surround Fox after the speech, mobbing him with the
frenzy aroused among humble people who believe they may be in the
presence of a future president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows what it's like to work for a living,'' Farias said.
``Cardenas is a spent cartridge. Fox is the only choice left.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fox's invitation to share the microphone at a rally in the
Indian village of Tarecuato, a teacher complained that his school
had no desks. On a nearby college campus, an economics student
reported that hundreds of recent graduates had left Mexico for lack
of jobs. Later, when Fox visited the lakeshore village of
Patzcuaro, fishermen said deforestation had turned their pristine
lake into a fetid swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to keep eating this bitter soup forever,'' Fox
said. ``The PRI's time is passed.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is the second week of school, and Kathleen Sampson
has been presenting the same lesson for several days: ``Amina is
from Somalia. Somalia is in Africa. Da Quan is a boy. Da Quan is
from China. China is in Asia.'' She builds sentences using facts
about the students in the classroom, repeating them over and over.
</P>
<P>
   This is not first-grade, but ninth-grade at Liberty High School
in Manhattan, with immigrants 14 to 17 years old. Unlike the
high-performing immigrants who remain a staple of the American
education system, these teen-agers arrive from all corners of the
earth with one thing in common: little or no education. Long
neglected, they may have come from cultures that educate boys but
not girls, their schooling may have been interrupted by war or the
need to work, or their education may simply have been woefully
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Regular programs in English as a second language often fail to
help these students, many of whom cannot read or write in the
languages of their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant youths with limited literacy have been coming to the
United States for centuries, of course. But as they seek their
places in an information-based economy with steeply rising academic
standards, their plight is now viewed in a very different light.
For the first time, cities are collecting data on their numbers,
researching their needs and creating programs to teach them
first-grade material in a high school context.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue was there all along,'' said Pamela Dungy, a program
manager in the Fresno Unified School District in California, where
22 percent of its nearly 10,000 foreign-born students had less than
three years of education before enrollment. ``But now we realize
they are really different groups and that we have got to treat them
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These students can be a delicate issue, as Herman Badillo,
chairman of the City University of New York, found out last fall.
In talking about poorly educated students from the Dominican
Republic and Mexico in New York schools, he described them as
``pure Indians _ Incas and Mayans who are about, you know, 5 feet
tall with straight hair,'' and he added that Mexico and Central
America had never had ``a tradition of education.'' Hispanic
politicians accused him of an ethnic slur. Badillo, who was born in
Puerto Rico, apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo's point was largely lost in the furor. Across the
nation, students who are illiterate in their native languages are
turning up in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some estimates suggest that as many as 10 to 20 percent of all
immigrant students in America arrive with gaps in their schooling.
A study for the U.S. Department of Education in 1992 estimated that
20 percent of the students with limited English in high school and
12 percent of those in middle schools had missed two or more years
of school before they arrived in America. New York state estimates
that such immigrants account for 12 percent of the students with
limited English in the state.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has more immigrant students than any other city in
the United States, and the number has risen sharply in recent
decades. Only now, however, is the city working on its first count
of those with limited literacy.
</P>
<P>
   In a classroom on West 18th Street, one of those students, Amina
Simba, a dark-eyed 16-year-old in a decorous lacy-edged head scarf
favored by Muslim women, strains for the teacher's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss, miss,'' she calls, waving her hand urgently.
</P>
<P>
   Her eagerness belies the brief but arduous educational journey
she has taken to get there. Before arriving in New York three years
ago from war-shattered Somalia and a Kenyan refugee camp, she had
never been to school. In upstate New York, where she first lived,
she was dropped into the eighth-grade, where she learned little
English and failed to master the ABCs. Now at Liberty High in
Manhattan, she is finally coming to terms with English and the
alphabet, addition and multiplication, continents and countries.
</P>
<P>
   Amina was placed in the middle level of the literacy program
when she arrived in September: her reading and writing were weak,
but she could answer simple questions in English, like, ``What is
your name?'' ``Where are you from?'' ``Who do you live with?''
</P>
<P>
   After several months, Amina was still struggling, so she was
moved to the beginning literacy class with Sampson, where she is
thriving. In her class, there are also students from Panama, Haiti,
Yemen, China, Vietnam and Sierra Leone. Other literacy classes at
the school include students from former Yugoslavia, Pakistan and
the Dominican Republic. Of the school's 500 students, about a fifth
are in its literacy programs.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty was not set up to run literacy programs, but to offer a
one-year transition for immigrant students. But in the early '90s,
teachers at Liberty recognized that a growing number of their
students could not keep up because their previous education was
either weak or nonexistent. Today Liberty runs three literacy
programs: one in English, and bilingual programs in Spanish and
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Although the only grade offered at Liberty is the ninth, nearly
two-thirds of its students are 17 or older and a fifth are 19 or
older. Not only do older students have more trouble learning new
languages than younger children, but they have less time to make up
what they have missed. In addition, those who are illiterate in
their native language find it harder to learn another language.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Posner, director of high school bilingual education for the
New York City Board of Education, said schools tried to incorporate
these students into their regular programs for those who need to
learn English as a second language, ``but it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no clue,'' he said. ``They couldn't read Spanish or
Chinese. We had to create a separate track because the kids
couldn't keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Posner said about 15 to 20 high schools, including Liberty, now
have programs for these students, but in other schools, these
immigrants are still mixed with other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are not enough students to form a class,'' he said,
``or there isn't a teacher who knows how to teach them, you've got
a real mess on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Dokie, a Liberian immigrant who views education as
crucial, knows what Posner means. She said that when her daughter,
Kou, who had no education in her war-torn homeland, enrolled in a
local middle school in upper Manhattan, she made no progress. Dokie
demanded more, calling the school and the Board of Education.
Eventually, Kou, now 15, ended up at Liberty with her two older
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say this is the land of opportunity,'' Dokie said. ``But
they forget to tell you that opportunity comes only with education.
On the farm in Liberia, whether you have education or not doesn't
matter. Here, it is not good to be a dummy, especially in New York.
If you can't read, you're going nowhere. I don't want my children
to be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Even students who say they had 10 years of school before coming
to the United States sometimes show very limited reading and
writing skills in their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a kid has gone to school for four years in Long Island or
Westchester, you'd assume there are certain things he can do,''
Sampson said. ``But when one of our students says, `I went to
school for four years,' it doesn't mean the same thing, because he
may not have had the same rigor or consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahmood Ghaleb, a gregarious 14-year-old who aspires to be an
airline pilot or a police officer, said the school he attended for
three years in Yemen had one grade and broken windows, and was
nothing like school here. ``Here I learn lot of things,'' he said.
``In Yemen I learn nothing.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Sampson's classroom at Liberty is like any other
high school classroom, with computers on the sides, maps of the
world up front, and backpacks stowed under the desks.
</P>
<P>
   But there are alphabet letters above the chalkboard _ uppercase
and lowercase _ each with illustrations: lions, rabbits, zebras.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson begins with the basics, including how to write the
letters of the alphabet, what they sound like, how to make simple
words, when to use capital letters. She and others reject using
primers made for kindergarten or first-grade, believing that these
are uninteresting to their older students. Instead, the teachers
often build their lessons around the students themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Even in gym, language is emphasized. On a recent morning,
students from the literacy program sat on the floor and labeled a
skeleton's bones: heels, shins, jaws, elbows. In later classes,
they will learn about equipment and exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that when our students left us, they were flunking
gym in their new schools because they didn't understand the
instructions,'' said Bruce Schnur, the principal of Liberty.
``Stand up. Sit down. What a whistle means.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In three or four semesters, some Liberty students make rapid
progress, mastering some spoken and written English and beginning
to use standard textbooks for students their age.
</P>
<P>
   When the students get to the third step in the literacy program,
taught by Katie Farrell, the focus is on preparing them to move out
of Liberty and survive, like fledglings being pushed out of the
nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to help them make the transition to regular high
school, where they will have to deal with big fat American
textbooks and with teachers who are not going to cut them a lot of
slack for being non-native English speakers and not highly
literate,'' Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She feeds them coping skills to help them through the long,
dense chapters of the world history textbook they are starting: how
to preview a chapter, how to think about questions they might want
to answer, how to figure out the meanings of unfamiliar words from
the context.
</P>
<P>
   The literacy program recently developed relationships with the
high schools that take their students. But the new emphasis on the
tough state Regents exams is making some schools less receptive;
they fear that such students may not be able pass these required
tests and graduate.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to find data on what happens to immigrant
students when they start out so far behind, and Liberty has not
tracked its students in any systematic way. The teachers know that
some students drop out after a year or two. Others have enough of a
start and enough grit to graduate. And there are the occasional
tales of students who make it to _ and through _ college, like the
Ethiopian boy who swam a river to escape the fighting and was
captured before he made his way to New York.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not expect miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want for them is to be good enough to stand as good a
chance as anyone else,'' Sampson said. ``If we don't give them a
chance, we are closing doors in their face.''

   WASHINGTON _ When the United Arab Emirates bought 80 Block 60
F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corp. in February, it got
special fuel tanks above the wing, a new color cockpit display, a
forward-looking infrared targeting system and a radar dish in the
nose cone.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the emirates are an oil-rich ally, and the United
States wants them to have a robust (and expensive) air defense.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16 is among the world's most sophisticated fighter jets.
Lockheed Martin has sold 3,992 of them since production began in
1978, for more than $50 billion. Foreign nations bought 1,686 of
those. Over the past 10 years F-16s have been purchased by Egypt,
Israel, Turkey, South Korea, Bahrain, Greece and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these sales must be approved by the State Department,
which determines just how sophisticated these planes should be. The
department must ask the following questions: Does Washington trust
the purchasing government? Does it have nearby enemies? Is it an
enemy of one of America's friends? Depending on the answers, the
purchaser may, like the emirates, get the highest performing
machine money can buy. Or something less.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Washington allowed Block 50 model F-16s to be
sold to Greece and Turkey, there was just enough difference between
the two planes to maintain something like a strategic balance
between those rivalrous nations.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey got the basic model with night-time capability, use of
precision weaponry and the exterior lantern system for targeting
and navigation. Greece, with a much smaller fighter fleet, bought
the Block 50 plus model, with greater range and an internal
electronic warfare system that could presumably confound Turkey's
radar system.
</P>
<P>
   When Taiwan bought some F-16s several years ago, the United
States, to calm China, would only approve sales of the older Block
20 model. But they also quietly approved the latest onboard
avionics.

   POLITICAL-PRINCES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Despite all the
primary-season chatter about a new kind of politics, the contest
has narrowed to these two: Albert A. Gore Jr. and George W. Bush, a
senator's only son and a president's firstborn, and their
respective namesakes. They are political princes with dissimilar
styles but astonishingly similar inheritances. Historians and
political analysts cannot recall an election when both nominees
came of age in the same generation and circumstances. By Frank
Bruni. (`a' category)

<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN-PETER-REVIEW (Undated) _ A portrait of Peter the
Great hangs in the office of Vladimir Putin. Those who have heard
Putin's paeans to free enterprise and democracy will find this
heartening, invoking an image of Peter as the Westernizing reformer
and the scourge of Russia's xenophobes. Others, who have nervously
watched Putin destroy Grozny or have sensed his belief in a
powerful Russian state, might find the identification alarming,
recalling Peter's singleminded pursuit of a mighty empire. So it
may be helpful to look back at who Czar Peter I really was. By
Serge Schmemann. (`i' category)

<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH-POLITICS-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ The South was once solidly
Democratic, then began to shift toward being solidly Republican.
But for now, it seems to be a region where, depending on the place,
the year, the candidates, their resources, the economy and the
issues, either party can prevail. Because the South is more
conservative than other regions, it poses a challenge for Democrat
Al Gore. But in the last two years, Southern Democrats have managed
to stall the GOP advance, and some believe this offers hope for
Gore. If he can split the South, as Bill Clinton did by winning 4
of 11 states in 1992 and 1996, Gore is likely to follow his mentor
to the Oval Office. By Kevin Sack. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-APOLOGY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Pope John Paul II's apology for
historical transgressions committed in the name of the Catholic
Church is remarkable but should be viewed within its theological
context _ it will, after all, take place during a Mass and is
consistent with the Christian requirement of repentance for
misdeeds. In an ecumenical sense, the apology is the dramatic
culmination of an unusual period of public penance by major
Christian groups. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   GEFFEN-BIO-REVIEW (Hollywood) _ Entertainment mogul David Geffen
is angry about a new biography, ``The Operator,'' that depicts him
as smart, ruthless, abrasive, calculating, generous and
complicated. But while hardly flattering, it's not quite as brutal
as he says it is. It follows two biographical traditions: that of a
famous and powerful subject seeking a respectable biographer _ but
then not wanting the author to probe too deeply _ and that of the
traditional Hollywood biography _ often by writers who are either
flattered and intimidated by their subjects or who have come to
loathe them. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   HACKER-HANDLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The fascination with malicious
hacker culture has spawned a profusion of wannabes who tend to be
adolescent denizens of online chat rooms and Internet junkies who
assume nicknames meant to convey tough-guy personas with super-hero
powers but whose actual intimidation factor is closer to Super
Nerd. Indeed, their real threat to national security might be
starting a run on acne medication, but judging from their online
handles, you'd think some of these pretenders could wipe out the
Kremlin with a keystroke while bench-pressing Rush Limbaugh. By
Matt Richtel.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-INSULTS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Hand-wringing aside,
negative campaigning has been shown to work. But what more can
George W. Bush and Al Gore say after they've called each other a
fool, a liar, a bigot and worse? Plenty, one suspects. As a public
service, here is a trove of insults that can be adapted phase by
phase as the campaign takes off.

   F16-SALES-REVIEW (Washington) _ A look at issues involved in
U.S. sales of F-16 fighter aircraft to other countries. By

</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-LEBANON-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ In less than four months,
Israel may conclude its 18-year national nightmare and end its
occupation of southern Lebanon. Already the Hezbollah has begun to
boast about driving out the Israelis. While that may be true _
Israelis are sick of losing their sons in order to preserve an
occupation of dubious strategic value _ it is also true that Israel
deliberately chose the time and manner of its departure. Any
American tempted to think that the Israeli pullout evokes the
dispiriting U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam should keep that last fact
in mind. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   CZECH-ALBRIGHT-REVIEW (Prague) _ Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will be out of a job in 10 months. So what's a friend to
do? Vaclav Havel had an idea: Albright should succeed him as the
president of the Czech Republic, her birthplace. And as an
absurdist playwright, Havel had no intention of taking no for an
answer. By Steven Erlanger.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nine months after they declared victory in the war
over Kosovo, Washington and its NATO allies are fighting among
themselves over how to keep a deteriorating situation in the
Serbian province from spinning out of their control.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, tens of thousands of alliance troops and a U.N.
administration have failed to prevent de facto partition of Kosovo
and continued ethnic bloodshed. The threat of more violence is
intensifying as both Serbs and Albanians try to foment unrest
across the border with Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   The problems are provoking mounting criticism from Congress _
which is even envisaging U.S. withdrawal _ as well as reluctance
from NATO allies to keep troops in Kosovo and pleas for more money
from an underfunded U.N. mission struggling to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, administration officials acknowledge that an
overriding priority is to avoid U.S. casualties and keep Kosovo out
of the news during an election year. One administration official,
who served in Bosnia, said that the driving force behind the policy
now is to keep it ``off the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation has frayed to the point where Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright met Friday with European allies at NATO
headquarters to discuss how to avoid what she called a ``hot
spring'' of new violence. The meeting yielded no statements about
planned action by the alliance, although Albright's spokesman,
James Rubin, said she was confident that more European troops were
being found for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he would be in Kosovo this week ``to urge restrained
behavior on the part of the Kosovo Albanians.'' But similar
warnings from Albright herself, and from top NATO commanders, have
failed so far to quell the unrest that is spreading into Serbia
proper from eastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, administration officials acknowledge that they are
finding Kosovo much harder to deal with than Bosnia, where a peace
agreement with the force of international law was signed by the
belligerents to end a war in which all sides were worn down after
three and a half years of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, a vague U.N. resolution formally concluded
hostilities, leaving the status of the Serbian province in limbo
and a weak U.N. mission in control of Albanians and Serbs seeking
revenge against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of about 37,000 NATO-led troops in Kosovo,
the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, has continued to meddle
in northern Kosovo, and elements of the Albanians' secessionist
Kosovo Liberation Army are stirring new trouble on the border of
eastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the division of the city of Mitrovica _ with
the Serbs in the north, the Albanians in the south and barbed wire
between them _ leaves Kosovo effectively partitioned, something the
Clinton administration has vowed it would not accept.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's concern over avoiding U.S. casualties was
only heightened last month when GIs sent into northern Mitrovica
were forced to retreat before a stone-throwing crowd of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Henry Shelton, has placed restrictions on how the 5,000 U.S.
soldiers in Kosovo can be deployed, even though the troops are
under NATO command. He followed up with a surprise visit on Tuesday
to the U.S. troops in eastern Kosovo to seek reassurances that the
risk to the troops had been minimized.
</P>
<P>
   In a further indication of distress in Washington about Kosovo,
the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
John Warner, said he would seek to withhold half of the $2 billion
appropriation for U.S. troops in Kosovo unless European nations
increased their financial contributions to the U.N. efforts there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has the coalition achieved?'' Warner asked on the Senate
floor on Thursday, referring to the United States and NATO. The
military had stopped the large-scale fighting, he said, but he
added: ``Unacceptable, dangerous levels of criminal activity
continue, and put our troops at constant risk. Precious little
other progress has taken place in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said that if President Clinton could not certify that the
Europeans had met their commitments in Kosovo, he would call for
the remaining $1 billion to be used for a ``safe, orderly and
phased withdrawal'' of U.S. soldiers from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the administration
did not believe that any of the money for U.S. troops should be
dependent on whether the Europeans contributed more to Kosovo. ``We
share the overall objective that the Europeans should do their fair
share,'' Lockhart said. ``The Europeans have done more recently,
and it is our hope that we can move forward with this money without
any contingencies.''
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Belgium, the commander, Gen. Wesley
Clark, who is in a battle with the Pentagon over how to save the
situation in Kosovo, has asked the 19 allies for more troops. Given
Washington's reluctance to expose U.S. soldiers to danger, however,
other nations are also hanging back.
</P>
<P>
   Only three NATO countries _ Britain, France and Denmark _ allow
their troops in Kosovo to be deployed quickly, wherever they are
needed in the province, without prior consultation with their
capitals, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has argued that troop levels in Kosovo have dropped too
much as some nations have already withdrawn soldiers. He has told
the North Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of NATO, that
he needs more soldiers and more flexibility in how they are
deployed. NATO forces are being reinforced in Mitrovica, where 16
French peace-keepers were injured last week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, according to NATO officials, no nation has come forward
with more troops. The French, who promised an extra battalion of
soldiers two weeks ago, have now made that offer contingent upon
other nations coming forward too, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nations don't want to expose their people to particular
dangers,'' the chief U.N. administrator, Bernard Kouchner, a
Frenchman, said after the French troops were injured. ``The
reaction of governments is to withdraw their troops'' in such a
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said that the
administration expected the French to ``live up to their
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon added, ``It's important that everybody work together,
police and military forces, to provide the troops we need, the
people we need on the ground to maintain stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark has asked NATO countries to contribute troops to a
``multinational specialized unit'' _ the euphemism for a
riot-control unit _ and to an intelligence-gathering unit, NATO
officials said. The riot-control unit has been considered too
risky, and intelligence gathering is something that NATO nations
have been reluctant to do under the alliance umbrella, though such
a unit does operate in the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To try to restore some authority in Mitrovica, Kouchner _ with
the backing of the Clinton administration _ is ready to appoint a
retired U.S. general, William L. Nash, as the civilian
administrator there. Officials said that Nash, who was the
commander of the U.S. troops in Bosnia in 1995 and 1996, has been
chosen for his military background and his ability to bring
disparate groups together.
</P>
<P>
   But Kouchner said that while a naming new administrator was
important, the appointment of one individual was unlikely to bring
fundamental change to Mitrovica, the divided city that has come to
represent Kosovo's most intractable problems.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials who run the Kosovo policy
publicly defend the situation, noting especially that the 800,000
Kosovo Albanians who fled a wave of Serbian repression that claimed
thousands of lives and destroyed tens of thousands of homes have
returned to lives that are better now than before the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not freeze during the winter. Construction went on,''
a senior administration official said. The official also pointed to
the $2.6 billion that Congress appeared prepared to approve for the
military and civilian operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the overall situation, Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, said, ``We will be urging patience and time to meet the
extremely difficult objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The two likely presidential nominees, Gov. George W. Bush and
Vice President Al Gore, have addressed the Kosovo issue
intermittently on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bush campaign, Scott McClellan, said on
Friday that Bush had serious concerns about the Clinton
administration not being able to carry out the agreement that ended
the war. He said Bush believed that ``America must work hard to
find political solutions for an orderly withdrawal from places like
Bosnia and Kosovo,'' and that Europeans should be the peacekeepers
there.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Gore campaign, Tyler Beardsley, said that
the administration was working ``diligently with our allies to
bring calm to Kosovo, particularly in Mitrovica.'' He added that
``these difficulties should not obscure the progress we have made''
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the administration hopes for is that Kouchner's
civilian authority will get all the money it needs from European
countries that pledged billions of dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said on Thursday that the Europeans should provide
another 2,000 police for Kosovo to cope with the violence that
ranges from revenge murders to rampant smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   But Kouchner said that while he desperately wanted more police,
it was not clear that the police alone could quickly solve the
problems stemming from deep bitterness between Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, NATO officials said it was difficult to see how
the effective partition of Mitrovica _ and hence of Kosovo _ could
be reversed. It took 21 armored vehicles and large numbers of
NATO-led troops just to return 40 Albanians to their homes on the
northern side of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   But if Kosovo is not kept in one piece, as the Albanians have
insisted and as the administration had pledged, the relations
between NATO and the Albanian community will worsen, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians will feel we have betrayed them,'' a senior NATO
official said, ``and will turn against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as the Serbian authorities singled out educated Albanians
before the NATO air campaign and during it, now Albanians were
singling out the dwindling number of educated Serbs in an effort to
expel all Serbs from the province, Kouchner said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the increasing difficulties faced by Serbs in
Albanian-dominated towns, he told of a Serbian gynecologist who
chose to stay in his town, Gnjilane, after the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, Josef Vasic, was one of two remaining Serbian
doctors in the city, the U.S. troops' main Kosovo base, and was
shot and killed one Sunday morning as he left his clinic. He had
spent much of his professional life treating Albanian women, and
was one of the moderate Serbs working with Kouchner to try to build
a functioning multiethnic Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my best ally,'' said Kouchner, who is also a medical
doctor and who founded the humanitarian organization Doctors
Without Borders. ``His death was one of the most horrible defeats.
We were not able to protect him.''

ANALYSIS: IMF DEBACLE STRAINS U.S.-GERMAN RELATIONS

<P>
   BERLIN _ The fiasco over the appointment of a new managing
director for the International Monetary Fund has caused serious
damage to the critical German-American relationship and revealed
deep personal rifts within the governing coalition of Gerhard
Schroeder, the Social Democratic chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   With accusations flying between Berlin and Washington over one
aborted German candidacy and another whose fate remains unclear,
two things are evident: Germany's new political assertiveness makes
the United States uncomfortable, and the German perception of
America is increasingly critical.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Schroeder,
said: ``It has been quite an experience trying to hit this moving
target set by the Clinton administration. We have discovered that
the superpower sees its global role not only in the military area
but also in setting the rules of globalization through the IMF.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The superpower in Washington grew stronger, but
Europeans are also gaining consciousness of themselves and cannot
share the view that the role of the IMF is simply to transport the
philosophy of the superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   His words reflected a strained moment in a German-American
relationship that has stood at the core of Germany's postwar growth
into a European power. ``The fight with America'' was the
unambiguous headline in the influential paper Die Zeit last week
over a lead article that was a chronicle of discord.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the disputes, for the moment, is that surrounding
the fund. The collapse of the candidacy of Caio Koch-Weser,
Germany's deputy finance minister, after it was rejected by the
United States has left a bitter residue marked by charges and
countercharges as to who misled whom and who really made the mess.
The atmosphere was not improved when the government of Social
Democrats and Greens last week proposed a more conservative
official, Horst Koehler, and the Clinton administration scarcely
rushed to embrace him.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, the German president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, appears likely to gain at least the
formal approval of European Union finance ministers on Monday. But
Italy is known to have strong reservations, and the position of the
United States remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The affair has proved particularly poisonous because Schroeder _
habitually a follower of the all-politics-is-local school with
little taste or instinct for international affairs _ chose to make
a personal crusade of the German quest to head the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the chancellor's step into the foreign policy
arena,'' said a member of the Cabinet. ``And now he is angry with
the United States, angry with Joschka Fischer and angry with
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor's irritation with Fischer, the Green foreign
minister, has some of its roots in the fact that he remains much
more popular than Schroeder. But it has been immeasurably
compounded by Fischer's evident decision, in the words of the
cabinet member, ``to disappear into the bushes on the IMF matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister, whose taste for the cameras is normally
little short of irrepressible, has been conspicuously quiet, and if
his much vaunted closeness to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
is real, it has proved of no evident usefulness to Germany in its
quest to lead the fund.
</P>
<P>
   There is little love lost between Fischer and Steiner, the
modern-day representatives of an old German rivalry between the
foreign ministry and the chancellery over the control of foreign
policy. Always simmering, this friction has now been revived with a
bang.
</P>
<P>
   To U.S. officials involved in the debacle, the overall
impression has been one of German inexperience, mismanagement,
clumsiness and ineptitude. This view, naturally, is not appreciated
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The German approach was to say, now we're grown-up, we're
going to show you we're grown-up, and we're just going to do it,
without prior consultation, without lobbying, without involving our
embassies _ nothing,'' said one American who has played a central
role in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Germany feels it is grown-up. Schroeder's government
has been at pains to make clear that it views itself as the
initiator of a new phase in German history, one in which the period
of post-war tutelage is over, a ``Berlin Republic'' has been born,
and the country is ready to drop all adolescent coyness and call
itself ``a great European power.''
</P>
<P>
   As Die Zeit put it last week in trying to explain why so many
tensions with the United States exist _ over the monetary fund,
over U.S. plans for a national missile-defense system, over capital
punishment, over the European role in NATO and over much else:
``Past are the times when one was afraid of one's own courage and
rather hid differences under the carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the United States pays lip service, and perhaps a
little more, to the view that Germany's assumption of new
responsibilities is healthy, it finds this more abrasive Germany
unsettling. Especially when, as U.S. officials put it, the country
manages to mishandle a sensitive diplomatic quest to such an
extent.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said Germany's quest to lead the International Monetary
Fund had been handled as ``professionally as could have been
done.'' He added that he had documentary evidence that Germany had
initially been misled by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of this ``evidence'' appeared in Saturday's issue of
the respected Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which published an
elaborate, unsourced account of how the United States had told
Germany that it would accept any consensus candidate of the
European Union, before changing its view at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   Germany had therefore played exactly by the rules in putting
forward Koch-Weser and gaining formal backing for him from the
European Union, only to be let down _ in Berlin's view _ by an
unreliable Clinton administration wielding U.S. power with all the
subtlety of a sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the Europeans just had to agree,'' Steiner said. ``Then
we had to agree on somebody with the so-called necessary strengths.
Well, nobody can think about reproaching Koehler for being weak.
Nobody can even think about reproaching him for not knowing his
job. And Clinton himself has now said a German managing director
would suit him.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has indeed expressed interest in a German head of
the fund. But even quick U.S. approval of Koehler _ and it is far
from assured _ will not rapidly set right the battered
German-American bond that remains the bedrock of America's security
interests in Europe.

WITH THE RACES OVER, A QUESTION REMAINS: DID THE SYSTEM WORK ? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year's primary season was far more
competitive, far more engaging to the voters and far more
compelling a story line than almost anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one problem, critics of the nominating system say.
It is, essentially, over. Even though more than half of the states
have yet to hold nominating contests for one or both parties. And
more than half of the delegates in both parties have yet to be
chosen. And fewer than half of the Americans surveyed last week by
Harvard's Shorenstein Center said they had even settled on a
favorite candidate in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, nobody quite knows what will happen to voter interest
and engagement in the five-month lull between the de facto end of
the primaries and the party conventions, which traditionally kick
off the general election campaign. But the sense of
disenfranchisement in the states that have not yet held primaries
or caucuses is likely to be strong, and some analysts predict that
turnout, which set records this year on the Republican side, will
plummet.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, which holds its primary March 21, Jack Tatooles,
co-chairman of the John McCain for President campaign, said simply,
``It's just not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, some politicians and analysts say, the primary
system worked well for the two parties this year, settling on the
two candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, who had the deepest support among the party establishment.
``Having said that,'' said William E. Brock, who is heading the
Republican Party's Advisory Commission on the Presidential
Nominating Process, ``the process, I think, argues even more
strongly for some remediation, some improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, I think, fair to say that the nominations are over
before the great majority of Americans even focused on the
question. We had, almost, a national primary, and yet well over
half the American people had no voice,'' said Brock, a former
senator and chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said, ``The real answer is we don't know yet how it
worked, and ultimately I don't think we'll know until we see what
turnout looks like in the fall, because our ultimate goal is
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both parties say they are pushing ahead with their
efforts to explore a major restructuring of the primary system,
although no decisions have yet been made. (The nominees themselves,
of course, will play a major role in party affairs.) The
Republicans are under the greatest time pressures, because their
party's rules require that any changes to the system for 2004 must
be approved at this summer's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said that without some action, more states will inevitably move
their primaries earlier on the calendar to have more of an
influence, putting the party ``on a trail inexorably to a national
primary day, and I think that's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   What many students of the nominating system prefer is some
system that gives lesser-known insurgent candidates at least a
chance to build support, gives various regions of the country a
fair shot at seeing the candidates, and occurs over a long enough
time frame that voters not only get to know the candidates and
their positions, but also have enough time for second thoughts and
buyer's remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts argued that the truncated nature of this year's
primary campaign meant the only things truly debated were tactics
and endorsements, at least when the average voter was beginning to
tune in. William Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of state and
the head of the National Association of Secretaries of State's
committee on presidential primaries, argued: ``If this had been
extended over maybe two months instead of six weeks, there would
have been an opportunity for more substantive discussions. They had
just about talked out Bob Jones University.''
</P>
<P>
   In several respects, of course, this year's primary season
confounded the conventional wisdom about problems in the nominating
system: Bush, the darling of party leaders and fund-raisers, did
not have a painless glide to the nomination. Turnout soared in the
fractious Republican contest, despite the maxim that negative
campaigns keep voters at home. And John McCain showed that powerful
insurgencies are still possible, even in an exceedingly compressed
calendar that puts a premium on money and name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say it is increasingly apparent how much this
heightened participation was a function of the McCain candidacy,
and they worry that the collapse of that candidacy will lead to
further disillusionment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Shorenstein Center poll, conducted March 1-5,
showed deep discontent with the way politics is practiced, with 87
percent of the respondents agreeing that ``most politicians are
pretty much willing to say whatever it takes in order to get
themselves elected.'' But 41 percent said there was an exception to
that rule this year, and McCain was the exception most frequently
cited.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also asked if the nominating system was ``fair to all
candidates,'' and found that a majority of McCain's supporters felt
it was not, while a majority of Bush's felt it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our polls showed that one of the things that was driving down
interest and essentially keeping people out of the process was this
sense of, `I just don't like what's been happening in politics, I
just don't like it,''' said Thomas E. Patterson, a Harvard
professor and co-director of the poll.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was able to tap into that discontent, Patterson said,
adding that the question now is whether his defeat feeds his
supporters' disillusionment or makes them realize how much is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The next five months, though, may not be the most edifying in
politics, if history is a guide. ``If the Clinton election of '92
or '96 is any indicator, you'll see candidates lobbing grenades
across the fence with almost no communication,'' Brock said. ``It's
a long-distance artillery barrage, a lot of it based on attack ads.
Not very illuminating stuff.''

</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Germany feels it is grown-up. Schroeder's government
has been at pains to make clear that it views itself as the
initiator of a new phase in German history, one in which the period
of post-war tutelage is over, a ``Berlin Republic'' has been born,
and the country is ready to drop all adolescent coyness and call
itself ``a great European power.''
</P>
<P>
   As Die Zeit put it last week in trying to explain why so many
tensions with the United States exist _ over the monetary fund,
over U.S. plans for a national missile-defense system, over capital
punishment, over the European role in NATO and over much else:
``Past are the times when one was afraid of one's own courage and
rather hid differences under the carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the United States pays lip service, and perhaps a
little more, to the view that Germany's assumption of new
responsibilities is healthy, it finds this more abrasive Germany
unsettling. Especially when, as U.S. officials put it, the country
manages to mishandle a sensitive diplomatic quest to such an
extent.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said Germany's quest to lead the International Monetary
Fund had been handled as ``professionally as could have been
done.'' He added that he had documentary evidence that Germany had
initially been misled by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of this ``evidence'' appeared in Saturday's issue of
the respected Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which published an
elaborate, unsourced account of how the United States had told
Germany that it would accept any consensus candidate of the
European Union, before changing its view at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   Germany had therefore played exactly by the rules in putting
forward Koch-Weser and gaining formal backing for him from the
European Union, only to be let down _ in Berlin's view _ by an
unreliable Clinton administration wielding U.S. power with all the
subtlety of a sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the Europeans just had to agree,'' Steiner said. ``Then
we had to agree on somebody with the so-called necessary strengths.
Well, nobody can think about reproaching Koehler for being weak.
Nobody can even think about reproaching him for not knowing his
job. And Clinton himself has now said a German managing director
would suit him.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has indeed expressed interest in a German head of
the fund. But even quick U.S. approval of Koehler _ and it is far
from assured _ will not rapidly set right the battered
German-American bond that remains the bedrock of America's security
interests in Europe.

PARAMILITARY LEADER IN COLOMBIA SPEAKS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ His private army has killed thousands of
people in the past decade, making him perhaps the most feared man
in this violent country. But a decision to submit to a grilling on
television early this month has allowed the paramilitary leader
Carlos Castano to come out of the shadows and present himself as
one more victim of the violence he had previously been seen as
personifying here.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute interview was not Castano's first appearance on
Colombian television. In the past he has occasionally been shown
with his back to the camera or with sunglasses and a fake beard to
disguise his features. But never before had the main leader of the
country's right-wing death squads discussed his philosophy and
background in such detail or with such startling candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that what I do violates international law, but the
violation of international law is inherent in a guerrilla war,'' he
said, adding, ``Wars are to be won, period'' and ``Our methods
produce excellent results.'' At another juncture, he maintained,
``I'm an extortionist, just like the guerrillas, but with more
delicacy,'' and warned, ``If an enemy has to be killed, then I say
kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the interview suggests that Castano has been
attentive to the shifting political currents here. His mortal
enemies on the left, the guerrilla group known as the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, toured Europe in February with
Colombian government peace negotiators, and their stature grew as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Colombian United Self-Defense, as Castano's
private 5,500-member army is called, has been described as a band
of murderous thugs in human-rights reports published in the last
month by the U.S. State Department, the United Nations and the
private monitoring group Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the State Department is seeking to have Castano's
group added to its list of terrorist organizations along with the
likes of Osama bin Laden, who is accused of blowing up U.S.
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview on the private network Caracol, Castano,
wearing a blue dress shirt and matching tie that made him look like
a young executive, expressed hurt at being cast in such a role. ``I
am a patriot, not a bandit,'' he said indignantly, adding that his
group acts on behalf of ``the middle class, which has no one to
defend it,'' because the armed forces and police are too busy
defending ``the oligarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a damaging new report from the government
ombudsman's office here blames paramilitary death squads for the
execution of 902 people in 155 ``massacres'' last year. So Castano
was under pressure to do something to ``consolidate his status as
chief of a counterinsurgency project'' and ``paladin and defender
of property,'' as the country's main daily, El Tiempo, put it, and
to dispel the notion that he is a mere butcher and drug trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the country to know Carlos Castano, and my sons their
father,'' he said. ``I don't want my sons to have to do this. It is
very difficult and cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   If Castano's strategy was to appear more human, it seems to be
succeeding. In an opinion poll published on Thursday by El Tiempo,
38 percent of those questioned said their image of Castano had
improved as a result of the interview, and 72 percent said the
government should bring his group into peace negotiations now under
way with left-wing guerrillas.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I saw that he is not the monster I had always thought him to
be,'' said Alba Rosa Guerrero Castro, a 46-year-old waitress. ``He
has done many bad things, but he has suffered a lot in this war
too, maybe even more than most people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a biographical sketch published in 1996, Castano explained
that his hatred of the country's various leftist insurgencies dates
back to September 1981, when he was 15 years old and a leftist
guerrilla unit kidnapped his father. When the family was unable to
come up with the ransom the guerrillas were demanding, the father
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the family has waged a campaign of vengeance aimed
at anyone thought to be supplying the guerrillas, or to even be
sympathetic toward them. Four of Castano's brothers have been
killed in clashes with guerrilla groups, he said in the television
interview, and a sister was killed during a bungled kidnapping
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of this interview, Castano has undergone a
surprising metamorphosis,'' the columnist Maria Isabel Rueda wrote
in the weekly news magazine Semana. ``Overnight he manages to
transform himself from a barbarian with hands stained with blood
into a father forced to live apart from his children as the result
of a patriotic mission that obliges him to commit atrocities only
because it is necessary to halt the guerrillas.''

SPAIN TURNS COOL TO PRIME MINISTER WHO ENGINEERED ITS BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ At a campaign rally in the bull ring in the
Mediterranean port of Valencia recently, the band played, the
crowds cheered and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar boasted of his
record before being deluged with confetti.
</P>
<P>
   What incumbent would not envy Aznar? Most everyone here agrees
that they are better off today than in 1996. During his four years
in office, Aznar surprised many doubters by successfully guiding
Spain into the European monetary union. And under his conservative
policies, Spain's economy is booming. Unemployment has dropped to
15 percent from 23 percent. Spain has created as many new jobs in
the last four years as the rest of the European Union put together.
</P>
<P>
   But if Aznar is the victor in Sunday's elections, it will
probably be by a hair. Despite the clamor in his stronghold of
Valencia, recent polls show Aznar's center-right Popular Party
ahead of the Socialists by just four percentage points, a very
small margin in a country that is notoriously difficult to survey.
In 1996, Aznar's party held a seven-point lead in the polls going
into the elections and won with a 1.1 percent lead.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish politics always include a heavy dose of insult. And this
year is no different. Aznar, who brought the center-right back to
power after 14 years of Socialist rule that ended in multiple
scandals, has said voters had a right to ask whether his opponent
``had an idea in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist candidate, Joaquin Almunia, has called Aznar ``a
right-wing big mouth'' and ``a puppet'' of the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the contest has turned bitter with each side
accusing the other of false promises while engaging in tit-for-tat
campaign pledges. Barely had the Socialists, for example, produced
a proposal for a windfall profit tax on newly privatized companies
and a one-time bonus for pensioners of about $165 than the
government proposed to lower taxes and to increase the number of
people eligible for pensions.
</P>
<P>
   But this could hardly be called a hot-blooded campaign. With the
economy in good shape, neither side is suggesting big changes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And neither candidate is capable of whipping up a crowd. At an
event in downtown Madrid last week, the prime minister, his
forehead shining with sweat, never cracked a smile or deviated from
a prepared text. His only nods to the rules of good delivery were
the occasional robotic turns to the left, right and center.
</P>
<P>
   Almunia is hardly more expressive. It remains to be seen whether
large numbers of Spaniards will even come out to vote. Polls
indicate that as many as 30 percent of Spain's 30 million voters
are undecided or may not vote at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a pretty flat campaign,'' said Victor de la Serna,
who writes a political column for Madrid's conservative daily El
Mundo. ``It's hard to think of anything to write about. Imagine if
you have Al Gore on the Socialist side and Al Gore on the
government side. That's what it's like here.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent terrorist bombings have given the contest an edge of
danger. Police officers are swarming all over Madrid's streets, and
access to campaign events is restricted. But few political analysts
believe that the resurgence of violent tactics by the Basque
separatist organization, known as ETA, will have much impact on the
election. Traditionally, Spain's mainstream parties have tried to
present a united front on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   One new element in the political lineup is the French-style
cooperation pact between the Socialists and their long-time
enemies, the United Front, led by the Communists. But analysts say
this may be something of a desperate gamble. Already, relations
between the two seem strained. When the Socialists announced the
$165 bonus for pensioners, the Communist leader, Francisco Frutos,
suggested that the program smacked of vote buying. Frutos has also
been heard grumbling that the Socialist platform did not include
several Communist-backed programs including a 35-hour work week.
And analysts say that the coalition could actually drive some
Socialists away.
</P>
<P>
   In campaigning for another four years in office Aznar, a
47-year-old former tax collector, keeps warning of a return to the
country's Socialist years _ his code for heavy taxes and bloated
bureaucracies. But he is battling entrenched voting patterns.
Surveys show that after decades under the dictatorship of Francisco
Franco, who died in 1975, the majority of Spaniards still lean to
the left.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond his lack of charisma, Aznar has what many Spaniards
consider a suspicious past. As a young man, he wrote articles
against the constitution. Since then, he has worked hard to
disassociate himself from the far right. This time, he has
campaigned under the slogans, ``Compromise of the Center,'' or
``Let's go for more.'' Still, he is often seen as a man who
inclines toward the rich. The Socialists' most successful campaign
ploy has apparently been their attempt to paint his friends as the
primary beneficiaries of Spain's extensive privatization program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my generation, we were anti-Franco, so it seems
unthinkable to vote for the right,'' said Javier Tosell, 57, a
professor of contemporary history at the University of Madrid.
``The polls are hard to do because I think we have a lot of closet
Socialists. Spain is doing well so they are too embarrassed to say
they will vote against Aznar. But in the voting booth they may.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spain is doing well, but Aznar is not doing so well. He is too
much to the right. When he speaks he still sounds like that.''
</P>
<P>
   One asset for the Socialists is that Almunia, 51, has a clean
record. Despite a long ministerial career _ at 34, he became the
youngest member of the Socialist Cabinet _ he has never been
tainted by any of the numerous scandals that brought down the
Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   However, he was not even the Socialists' first choice. Two years
ago, Almunia organized a primary election to become the Socialists'
candidate for prime minister _ only to lose. He got the nomination
back last year when the man who beat him withdrew. And his
ground-breaking deal with the Communists was less than a total
triumph. The Socialists had hoped that the United Front candidates
would step aside in certain contests, enabling the Socialists to
win those seats. But that did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   In the last elections in 1996, Aznar's party won 38.8 percent of
the vote, the Socialists 37.7. To form his government, Aznar joined
forces with the moderate Catalan party, a partnership which may
well be needed again.
</P>
<P>
   Many Spaniards say that this year's political scene leaves them
cold.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vincente Maria, who has been driving a taxi since being
laid off from a factory job eight years ago, says business has
never been better, the city is booming and he has a brand new
subway stop near his house. A lifelong supporter of the left, he
was disgusted by all the scandals and says he would probably vote
for Aznar, if he voted at all. But he doubts he will make it to the
polling booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sick of politics,'' Vincente said. ``Almunia
doesn't have much to say and doesn't have good people around him.
Aznar doesn't have much to say, or can't get it out. And in the
end, I just can't be bothered with all of them.''

<P>
   CHIN JIN, Taiwan _ Three days before Taiwan held its last
presidential election in 1996, the local boss of this busy fishing
village in southwestern Taiwan called on Yang Cheng-ho. After
shooting the breeze a bit, he got down to business: the Nationalist
party hoped it could count on Yang's vote, and to show its
gratitude, the boss thrust a wad of bills into his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Yang, 61, who sells cigarettes and betel nuts, pocketed the
money. But he still voted for the candidate of the opposition
party. ``People have gotten smarter,'' he said with a devilish
grin. ``They'll take the money, but that doesn't mean they'll vote
for the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's voters will elect a new president March 18 to succeed
Lee Teng-hui. With the three main candidates locked within a few
percentage points of one another in the polls, party officials are
girding themselves for another spree of vote buying, and opposition
and election officials fear that the practice could play a
substantial role in determining the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Taiwan has never seen an electoral cliffhanger like
this one. In the last opinion polls, the three principal candidates
_ Vice President Lien Chan of the Nationalists, or Kuomintang; Chen
Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party; and James Soong, an
independent _ each had about 25 percent of the vote, with the rest
undecided. Taiwan law bars the publication of new polls in the last
two weeks of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Not all attempts at vote buying are as brazen as that
experienced by Yang, who said he had not yet been approached this
year. As democracy takes root in Taiwan, the practice of handing
over cash is gradually waning. But more subtle attempts to bribe
voters are proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   From free dinners and junkets to vinyl jackets and scented soap,
Taiwan's 15 million registered voters can board a gravy train that
runs night and day from now until the vote. Most of the largess is
courtesy of the Nationalist party, which is in danger of losing
power for the first time in five decades.
</P>
<P>
   After so much time in power, the Nationalists have amassed one
of the greatest war chests of any political party in the world, as
well as assembling a formidable machine to mobilize voters.
Political analysts here said the party has set aside more than $60
million to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always thieves in society, so vote buying exists,''
said Huang Shih-chen, the chairman of Taiwan's Central Election
Commission. ``My personal view is that the dead-heat competition in
this election has raised the incentive for vote buying.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the race so tight, the Democratic Progressive Party
contends that the election could hinge on 200,000 or 300,000 votes.
It also believes that about 500,000 people _ mostly poor and living
in rural areas of central and southern Taiwan _ are ripe targets
for manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has taken steps to stamp out vote buying, outlawing the
practice in 1985 and threatening violators with jail sentences of
up to five years. It also offers $500,000 for information leading
to the conviction of vote buyers. But Huang, the election official,
conceded that convictions were rare, in part because many of the
recipients of gifts regard the practice as customary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In traditional Chinese culture, people view gifts as a gesture
of respect for their act of voting,'' said said Bau Tzong-ho, a
professor of political science at National Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon in Chin Jin illustrates why vote buying is so
deeply rooted. Although the nearby port city of Kaohsiung is a
stronghold of the Democratic Progressive Party, Chin Jin votes
reliably for the Nationalist party, local officials said, because
its fishermen depend on the state for access to fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole district has been bought and paid for the KMT,''
said Chuang Ming-tsong, 53, a restaurant owner and opposition
supporter, using the acronym for the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts doubt the impact of vote buying in a
presidential election, saying the practice works best in local
races, where people know the candidates personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to buy votes successfully in a national
election,'' said Lee Fu-hsing, a spokesman for Lien's campaign in
Kaohsiung, as he sat next to a bank of ringing phones. ``A
vote-buying operation of that scale would be too big for anybody,
even the KMT.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the opposition parties say the Nationalists will be careful
about handing over cash, for fear of getting caught. But they say
the party has developed more sophisticated strategies. The latest
craze in Kaohsiung and other cities is gambling parlors, which
opposition officials contend are linked to the governing
Nationalist party. People place bets on the candidate they believe
is favored by the owner, and if that candidate wins, they receive a
large payout.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hsieh, the mayor of Kaohsiung and a Democratic
Progressive, said the system is a disguised form of vote buying and
has asked the local police to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists said Chen, the Democratic Progressive
candidate, was harping on the issue of vote buying to damage Lien.
And besides, they said, Chen gives away free dinners and campaign
souvenirs to supporters. ``It's the pot calling the kettle black,''
Lee Fu-hsing said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the Nationalists say it is a matter of degree. In
the days leading up to a ballot, according to the China Times
newspaper, the party will deploy 70,000 people to knock on doors,
hand out jackets and caps, and serve up dinners at party-run
banquet halls around the island.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, the Nationalists will post thousands of
monitors at voting booths throughout Taiwan _ as many as 40 or 50
per station, the Democrats say. Each person is paid $100 for his or
her efforts, guaranteeing a fresh stream of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The police force is another arrow in the Nationalists' quiver.
Chen Pi, the former chief of police for Taiwan Province, said that
85 percent of police officers are party members. Chen, who was
recently expelled from the party for supporting Soong, said those
officers would seek to persuade voters on their beats.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Jin-pyng, the president of Taiwan's legislature, said:
``The KMT has a powerful organization, even in the most remote
villages. These people can be mobilized to win over votes for
Lien.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang has the quiet confidence of a Nationalist heavyweight. He
estimates that once the party machine is running full tilt, the
Nationalists will be able to convert 8 percent of the electorate.
Given that Lien is lagging by less than 3 percentage points in most
polls, Wang said he could not conceive of the Nationalists losing.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, the party is spending heavily to insure its
primacy in another type of campaign hucksterism. It pays taxicab
unions $50 for each driver they persuade to fly a flag with Lien's
campaign symbol of butterflies. The union passes along $43 to the
driver, but keeps $7 as profit. At one of Taipei's largest taxicab
unions, 300 of the 500 drivers are flying butterflies on their
hoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Chen Shui-bian,'' said Liu Shing-ming, the secretary of
the union. ``He came from a poor background, so working people are
comfortable with him. But this is a business decision.''

REPUBLICANS SEE AN OPPORTUNITY AS GASOLINE PRICES RISE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress have begun to blame the
Clinton administration generally and Vice President Al Gore in
particular for the recent jump in the price of gasoline, and that
seems sure to become a hot issue in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   When prices started to rise, ``the administration was asleep at
the wheel,'' Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader,
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi,
referred to the 4.3-cents-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline
tax enacted in 1993 as ``the Gore gas tax'' and told reporters it
should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska said flatly what was on the
minds of many of his fellow Republicans: ``This is going to be a
big issue in the political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The matter was hardly raised in the presidential primaries,
largely because there was little difference in the positions of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona on the
one hand and those of Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey on the other. But the Bush and Gore camps have little doubt
now that they will be arguing about this until the election in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Bush had talked much in his campaign about
gasoline prices, Mindy Tucker, a campaign spokeswoman, said with a
small laugh, ``Not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign spokesman, Douglas Hattaway, said that if Bush
embraced a plan being pushed by some Republicans in Congress to
lower fuel taxes, it ``would add to the perception that he is
reckless and doesn't know what he is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline,
which was about $1.25 at Christmas, is now more than $1.35. Last
week, the Energy Department warned that the price would rise to an
average of $1.80 and as high as $2 a gallon in some places by the
time people go on summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   That is not just costly to motorists. Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, has warned that high energy prices
could damage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the public tends to have more confidence in
Democrats on some of the most prominent issues in this year's
election campaigns, including education, health care and gun
control. Republicans clearly hope that high fuel prices will work
in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the increase was a decision in March 1999 by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and one major
producer that does not belong to the cartel, Mexico, to force up
the price of crude oil by limiting production. The price of a
barrel of crude oil is now about $32, up from $12 a year ago. There
are 42 gallons in a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The principal response from the Clinton administration has been
to try to persuade the oil-producing nations to reverse course.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has been traveling the globe to
twist arms, and he told the House Commerce Subcommittee on Energy
and Power last week that he expected a decision to raise production
when OPEC meets on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress deride this policy. ``What's this
administration done?'' asked Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the
assistant Republican leader. ``Nothing except to increase energy
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Richardson, Nickles said, ``All he's done is run around
the world saying, `We need more imports; send us more imports.'''
</P>
<P>
   But despite their contempt for the administration's policy,
there is no consensus among Republicans on a solution. That
prompted Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, one of the leading
Democratic authorities in the House on energy matters, to say in an
interview, ``It sounds to me as if they're playing politics with
the problem and doing it in a way that doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the proposals being considered in Congress:
</P>
<P>
   _ Releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve;
alternatively, some lawmakers want to allow oil companies to borrow
from the reserve and sell the oil at the current high price with a
promise to return even more oil to the reserve after prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Suspending the federal tax on diesel fuel or repealing the
4.3-cent additional gasoline tax, or both.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and
perhaps other federal land in the American West to oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
   _ Repealing the moratorium on offshore drilling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Imposing sanctions against countries that restrict oil
production.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring that one-fifth of the United States energy supply in
2020 come from renewable sources like wind and solar power.
</P>
<P>
   Some or all of those proposals will be debated when Congress
considers renewal of the law creating the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. The law expires at the end of this month. But each of the
proposals has drawbacks and opposition.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, President Clinton said last month that he was
still considering whether to release crude oil from the strategic
reserve, 600 million barrels in storage in Texas and Louisiana that
was set aside by a 1975 law for use in a national emergency like an
oil embargo or a war. Richardson said he had recommended against
release on the ground that price fluctuation did not meet the test
of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers from both parties favor tapping the reserve. But
Bush agrees with Richardson. ``The strategic petroleum reserve is
meant for a national wartime emergency,'' he said in a debate in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans favor suspending or repealing the taxes on
motor fuels. The federal tax is now 24.4 cents on a gallon of
diesel fuel and 18.4 cents on gasoline. The last 4.3 cents of the
gasoline tax was part of Clinton's 1993 budget, which was approved
by the Senate, 51-50, when Gore cast the tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee and one of the most ardent tax-cutters in Congress,
worries that the amounts are so small they would hardly help
consumers and that the action would have no effect in states like
California that mandate an increase in the state gasoline tax when
the federal tax drops. Worst of all, Archer says, the money from
the taxes is earmarked for highway construction and other important
transportation expenses, and the loss of that money could be
damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not taken a public stand on the tax question, but he
favors the proposal of Republican lawmakers from oil-patch states
to allow exploration in the wildlife refuge in northern Alaska,
known as Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also agrees with the Clinton administration that the best
short-term solution to the high prices is, as he said in the New
Hampshire debate, to insist to the oil-producing countries that
``we expect you to open your spigots,'' but a spokesman, Ari
Fleischer, contended that the administration was being ineffective
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush wants to encourage the use of natural gas and emphasize
research into alternative sources of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore vigorously opposes oil exploration in the wildlife refuge
as damaging to the environment, and he has promised that as
president he would ban new offshore oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign says the problem is not so much
underproduction as overconsumption. It chides Republicans for
blocking for years a tightening of fuel economy standards for motor
vehicles. And vigilant as always in opposition research, Gore's
staff is broadcasting the fact that the federal tax on gasoline and
diesel fuel went up 5 cents a gallon in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That was part of the budget of Bush's father.

<P>
   One of them was born just a dozen blocks from the White House
and reared, at least when Congress was in session, in a hotel set
amid the embassies of Washington. The other knew 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue as the place where his father worked for a dozen years in
successive jobs: vice president of the United States for two-thirds
of that time, president for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Their parallel paths of privilege took them past landmarks that
were different in name but identical in spirit: St. Albans School
and Harvard University for one, Phillips Academy and Yale
University for the other.
</P>
<P>
   And politics pumped so strongly in their blood that one of them
first ran for a seat in the House of Representatives _ the same
seat his father had once occupied _ in 1976, at the age of just 28.
(He won.) The other lagged only two years behind, making his own
bid for Congress in 1978 at the age of 32. (He lost.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite all the primary-season chatter about giving
Americans a new kind of politics, despite the tussles in both
parties over which presidential contender could bring a fresh and
unjaded perspective to governing, the contest has narrowed to these
two: Albert A. Gore Jr. and George W. Bush, a former senator's only
son and a former president's firstborn _ namesakes and political
princes with dissimilar styles but astonishingly similar
inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential historians and political analysts said they could
not recall a previous election in American history when the
nominees (presumptive, for now) of both major parties were not only
such prominent political heirs but also from such similar stations
and members of the same generation.
</P>
<P>
   That equivalence could simply be accidental, the analysts said,
but several said it speaks in part to the state of politics and the
mood of the electorate. It also imbues this year's presidential
race with an unusual and fascinating dynamic: among the challenges
facing both Vice President Gore and Bush, the Texas governor, is
how they relate to their political ancestries, particularly the
degree to which they reap the benefits of their backgrounds while
avoiding the drawbacks. That balancing act has been a theme in both
men's careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either of them is going to have a slogan of
`Vote for me, keep the tradition alive,''' said Bill Carrick, a
Democratic strategist, adding that such bald elevations of pedigree
over merit would surely invite rejection.
</P>
<P>
   But to some extent, he and other political analysts noted, the
Democratic voters who backed Gore and the Republican voters who
supported Bush were indeed choosing to keep certain traditions
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the more relevant tradition may have been the
last seven years of the Clinton administration. But in the cases of
both candidates, voters were choosing someone with an almost
congenital grasp of politics, all the social and material
advantages that went along with that life style and milieu and a
relative unfamiliarity with hardship or tests of character on the
scale of Sen. John McCain's five and a half years as a prisoner of
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both dealt with that war in a way that reflected
their memberships in a younger, more coddled generation. Gore went
to Vietnam, but only briefly, and as an Army journalist. Bush got a
coveted spot as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard and was
able to stay close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in a recessionary period, where class distinctions
are more on the surface, there might have been more of a dialogue
about that,'' said Don Sipple, a Republican strategist. Similarly,
he said, if the nation were in the grip of a crisis, voters might
reject any semblance of the status quo and seek someone who seemed
just a bit more idiosyncratic and adventurous, a bit less destined.
</P>
<P>
   A brief period of economic fright yielded the man from Hope,
Bill Clinton. A nationally devastating corruption of the public
trust yielded the man from Plains, Jimmy Carter. With the world
relatively peaceful and the nation phenomenally prosperous, there
is no such invitation this time around for a slightly unusual
upstart or self-styled maverick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bradley or McCain understood that,'' said
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``There's sometimes an
assumption that Americans are risk-takers in good times. But
Americans are really only risk-takers in bad times. There's a real
interest out there in finding someone who is going to preserve what
we have, someone who knows the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake said that in some focus groups she has conducted, voters
expressed both an assumption that Bush might call his father at
crucial times and a sense of comfort _ not alarm _ in that
likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Bush and their supporters say it is the men's
accomplishments that have made them credible presidential
contenders. But their ancestries undeniably helped start and guide
them on their way in politics, providing them with networks, access
to money, instantly high profiles and other tactical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, their fathers' careers _ especially their failures
_ taught them valuable lessons, some reflected in their current
campaigns. When Albert Gore Sr.'s many distinguished years as a
senator from Tennessee ended with his defeat at the polls in 1970,
one reason was his Republican rival's nasty and negative approach,
which Gore did not match. His son exhibited no such reticence in
taking on former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey over the last nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father's political demise was as instructive to him as
anything that his father did while in office,'' said Bill Turque,
author of a recent biography of the vice president, ``Inventing Al
Gore'' (Houghton Mifflin). ``It taught him the power of attack
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a similar reference point: his father's failed bid for
a second term as president in 1992. President Bush ran a campaign
more responsive than assertive and hampered by dissension and
disloyalty in the ranks. His son sought to avoid those mistakes,
quickly putting McCain on the defensive and entrusting his effort
to a tightly knit circle of longtime political allies.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both candidates' relationships to their patrimony are
more complicated. They recognize that if they seem to be trading
too heavily on their backgrounds, it could turn off voters. They
also realize that their backgrounds inform and play into some of
their most potent liabilities: in Gore's case, that his life and
world view are utterly circumscribed by politics; in Bush's case,
that his late-blooming political prominence is the result of his
father's connections, not his own talents and toilings.

</P>

</P>
<P>
   In the years between 1992, when Gore won the vice presidency and
his father said publicly that ``we raised him for it,'' and 1998,
when his father died, Gore's advisers sometimes sought to steer
reporters away from his dad.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore almost constantly invokes Albert Gore Sr. on
the campaign trail, but largely to emphasize what a self-made man
his father was. He mentions that his father was poor and had to
attend law school at night. The vice president need not worry that
voters will think he is trying to trade on Americans' affection for
his father, because only older voters in Tennessee would have the
requisite memory of the man.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, by contrast, is keenly remembered
_ he left office only seven years ago _ and that creates both an
added impetus for his son to mention him and a greater danger that
some voters will raise an eyebrow when he does so. So the Texas
governor is artful and sparing about it.
</P>
<P>
   For much of last year, Bush's stump speech included a passage in
which he acknowledged that the leap from governor to president
would be a big one. ``But,'' he added, `'I've had some pretty good
training.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to talk about running Texas, but the pauses he
took before and after that line, and the applause it reliably
elicited, left no doubt about its intent. Bush was saying, without
quite saying, that being his father's son should give Americans
some reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bush and his advisers
abandoned such subtlety, putting the governor's parents on a stage
with him. The event was deemed by many to be a disaster, signaling
to voters that a torch was being passed, rather than earned.
</P>
<P>
   It was odd, because Bush usually goes out of his way to avoid
that impression. His almost strenuously folksy side _ the cowboy
boots he sometimes wears, the hyper-informal manner that recently
prompted him to address several of the physicians at a recent
campaign event as ``Doc'' _ seems like a self-conscious purging of
the blue in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore takes his own stabs at a common touch. Did you know that he
once lived in a trailer park? That he likes and watches ``The
Simpsons''? Voters at his town hall-style meetings do, because Gore
has made a point of telling them.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a somewhat surreal spectacle between now and
November: two candidates whose life stories could not be more
entwined in establishment politics, and whose current situations
owe a great deal to those circumstances, competing to convince
Americans that they have just the right distance from it all.

   In the years between 1992, when Gore won the vice presidency and
his father said publicly that ``we raised him for it,'' and 1998,
when his father died, Gore's advisers sometimes sought to steer
reporters away from his dad.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gore almost constantly invokes Albert Gore Sr. on
the campaign trail, but largely to emphasize what a self-made man
his father was. He mentions that his father was poor and had to
attend law school at night. The vice president need not worry that
voters will think he is trying to trade on Americans' affection for
his father, because only older voters in Tennessee would have the
requisite memory of the man.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, by contrast, is keenly remembered
_ he left office only seven years ago _ and that creates both an
added impetus for his son to mention him and a greater danger that
some voters will raise an eyebrow when he does so. So the Texas
governor is artful and sparing about it.
</P>
<P>
   For much of last year, Bush's stump speech included a passage in
which he acknowledged that the leap from governor to president
would be a big one. ``But,'' he added, `'I've had some pretty good
training.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went on to talk about running Texas, but the pauses he
took before and after that line, and the applause it reliably
elicited, left no doubt about its intent. Bush was saying, without
quite saying, that being his father's son should give Americans
some reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bush and his advisers
abandoned such subtlety, putting the governor's parents on a stage
with him. The event was deemed by many to be a disaster, signaling
to voters that a torch was being passed, rather than earned.
</P>
<P>
   It was odd, because Bush usually goes out of his way to avoid
that impression. His almost strenuously folksy side _ the cowboy
boots he sometimes wears, the hyper-informal manner that recently
prompted him to address several of the physicians at a recent
campaign event as ``Doc'' _ seems like a self-conscious purging of
the blue in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore takes his own stabs at a common touch. Did you know that he
once lived in a trailer park? That he likes and watches ``The
Simpsons''? Voters at his town hall-style meetings do, because Gore
has made a point of telling them.
</P>
<P>
   It promises a somewhat surreal spectacle between now and
November: two candidates whose life stories could not be more
entwined in establishment politics, and whose current situations
owe a great deal to those circumstances, competing to convince
Americans that they have just the right distance from it all.

   The New York Times News Service is planning an expanded weather
package, with a planned starting date of Monday, March 20, which
will be transmitted on Sunday, March 19. The package, consisting of
a weather map as a graphics file and a text file to accompany the
map, is available to graphics clients of the News Service. The new
map grows to 4 columns in width (52 picas), from 3, and is 6 inches
deep; the old was 4 inches deep. This new size permits the
insertion of cloud cover information and the addition of many new
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The map is available both in color and in black and white.
Because the map is much more detailed, we have devised an entirely
new palette of colors to make it easier to read the added
information. A sample of the new map is available at Wieck,
Newscom, Presslink and AP's GraphicsNet.

<P>
   LAND O'LAKES, Fla. _ There may be water, water everywhere, but
as remarkable as it may seem in Tampa Bay, there is not enough to
drink.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed by abundant rainfall, the region has for decades drawn
all of its water from a network of inland wells. But spreading
development along roads with names like Progress Parkway,
stretching north all the way to Land O'Lakes, has finally overrun
what those ground-water well fields can safely produce.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the verdant landscape here, some 30 miles north of
downtown Tampa, is dotted with small lakes. But in its search for
new sources of water, Tampa Bay is looking in another direction. To
help meet the needs of the area's 2.3 million residents, it plans
to desalt the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a large American urban area bet so heavily on
sea water desalination for fresh water. If approved by state
environmental officials, a plant to be built on the shores of Tampa
Bay would become the largest desalination plant this side of Saudi
Arabia by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when other American coastal communities are bracing
for water crises, the effort by the Tampa Bay Water authority may
serve as an important test. Rejected for years as too expensive,
desalination is winning converts as the price of the process begins
to drop, but it still faces skepticism, even in Tampa Bay, where
some fear that the desalination plant could cause environmental
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we resolve the problem in Tampa Bay could very well set
the mold, the blueprint for other parts of the country,'' said E.D.
Vergara, executive director of the Southwest Florida Water
Management District, the regulatory agency that was the driving
force in persuading Tampa Bay to change course.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of Tampa Bay's problem can be seen in three
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   One is demographic, after 50 years that have seen a fivefold
population increase in the Tampa Bay area, which includes the
cities of Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater, and the counties of
Pinellas, Hillsborough and Pasco.
</P>
<P>
   The second is environmental _ depleted aquifers, dry wetlands
and fallen trees, all casualties of pumping water from the ground
to supply rapidly growing communities, often carried out with
little heed for the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   And the third is a clock that began to tick in 1995, when the
Tampa Bay Water authority submitted to years of pressure from state
regulators and agreed to cut back sharply on pumping ground water,
and to look elsewhere for new water sources.
</P>
<P>
   In its new plan for the decade ahead, Tampa Bay now envisions
desalted sea water providing about 10 percent of the region's
freshwater needs. Water from other newly developed sources, rivers
and a new reservoir, would account for about 25 percent of the
need, with the balance to be made up by highly restricted flows
from ground-water well fields.
</P>
<P>
   A Tampa Bay water timetable shows that without the 25 million
gallons of fresh water a day that the new plant is supposed to
produce, the area would face a major water shortage by early 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are where we are because of the travesty of development in
Florida,'' said Jerry L. Maxwell, who as general manager of Tampa
Bay Water has become a leading advocate of the desalination plan.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, American coastal cities have generally steered clear
of sea-water desalination. The main reason has been the cost,
usually many times more than that of conventional water sources,
like ground aquifers, lakes, rivers, streams and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-water desalination has been given a leading role in
overcoming water poverty only in parts of the world where such
alternatives are all but nonexistent, particularly in the wealthy
desert kingdoms of the Arabian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, only two American cities have invested in
full-fledged sea-water desalination plants _ Key West, Fla., in the
early 1980s, and Santa Barbara, Calif., a decade later. Notably,
both cities mothballed their operations soon after they began,
having managed to line up less-expensive alternatives; the plants
are now maintained to provide emergency alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still cheaper for us to pump fresh water 130 miles down
here from the mainland than to make it from sea water,'' said Jim
Reynolds, deputy executive director of the Florida Keys Aqueduct
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   But a more basic form of desalination, aimed at brackish ground
water, has made major inroads in the United States, with plants now
operating along the coasts of Virginia, North Carolina, Florida,
Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   Brackish water is much less salty than the sea, so cleaning it
is much less expensive, making the process more attractive. To
remove the salt from sea water usually requires that the water be
passed through synthetic membranes at exceedingly high pressures,
making the process more energy intensive and thus particularly
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tampa Bay is not the only place whose problems have sunk
to the level that serious thought is being given to drinking from
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   In Monterey County, Calif., which faces a severe water shortage,
public discussion about sea-water desalination has rumbled for
years, despite the voters' narrow rejection of it in the early
1990s. The water authority there proposed, instead, a new dam on
the Carmel River, but that plan has met with even more opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, a turn to sea-water desalination is seen by some
experts as inevitable, unless the federal government and Florida go
forward with a multibillion-dollar plan to reclaim the Everglades
through a project that would help restore the flow of scarce
surface water to Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Tampa Bay, sea-water desalination was made more feasible by
the terms of a bargain that was struck in 1995, when the local
water authority agreed to cut back on ground-water pumping.
</P>
<P>
   As a sweetener, state regulators promised to help pay for the
cost of creating new water resources, and under that formula, the
Southwest Florida Water Management Agency will use tax money it
collects to underwrite all but 10 percent of the $95 million cost
of building the desalination plant.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Water authority awarded the construction contract
last year to an affiliate of the Stone &AMP; Webster Engineering Corp.
under terms that require the plant to begin operations by Dec. 31,
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Initial estimates by water officials in Tampa had projected the
cost of water produced by the plant to average $4 to $6 per 1,000
gallons, within the rough range of the costs in Key West and Santa
Barbara. But they said that technological advances had already
driven the projected costs down substantially. Under the terms of
the contract, the price the Tampa Bay Water authority itself will
pay for the desalted water will average $2.08 per 1,000 gallons
over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But that is nearly four times what the authority now pays for
water from some of the rural wells.
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, will drive up the costs the municipal governments
pay the authority for water. For an ordinary household, it is
likely to translate into a monthly increase of about $7.50 on the
water bill.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect has generated little public complaint, and in
fact, the switch to more expensive sources of water has been loudly
welcomed in the parts of Tampa Bay that have suffered most from
ground-water pumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's not even safe to walk across your yard anymore
because the oak trees are shedding foot-thick limbs in order to
survive,'' said Gilliam Clarke, of Wesley Chapel, Fla., who lives
just outside the Cypress Creek well field, a once-isolated tract
that is one of 11 set aside long ago to feed the region's demands.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, however, some residents who benefited from the old
system have begun to mobilize in opposition to the new arrangement,
on grounds that the shift toward desalination might simply produce
a different environmental harm.
</P>
<P>
   A recent public meeting held in Tampa to review the proposed
plan attracted some 700 people, and all but one of those who spoke
expressed strong opposition to the idea of the desalination plant.
</P>
<P>
   The featured guest, David Struhs, who is the state's top
environmental official and who has yet to approve construction of
the water plant, was greeted on arrival with signs saying things
like ``Too Much Salt Kills'' and ``If I wanted the Dead Sea, I'd
Live in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics' worry is that the desalination plant would result
in a saltier Tampa Bay, with possible harm to water life, including
some fish and perhaps the manatee, an endangered marine mammal. The
bay would have to absorb the main byproduct of desalination, a
briny concentrate twice as concentrated as the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa water officials say that the concern is misguided. The
concentrate would be heavily diluted, they say, before it reached
the open water, mixed with the sea-water outflow from the Tampa
Electric Co.'s Big Bend plant, with which the sea-water
desalination plant would share a site. The mixing formula calls for
a gallon of concentrate for 70 gallons of sea water from the
electric company.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by Tampa Bay Water found no reasonable risk
that salinity in the bay would build up over time, said Anthony
Janicki, an environmental consultant who conducted the project. The
research found that the estuary into which the outflows would be
pumped already flush naturally, and it pointed out that native
species of fish and sea grass are already accustomed to salinity
variations.
</P>
<P>
   But some independent experts have been more skeptical, saying
that any salinity problems caused by a desalination plant might be
compounded by Tampa Bay's parallel plans to draw from new surface
water sources that now flow into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be no problem at all, but there needs to be more
study,'' said Holly Greening, a marine scientist who works for the
state-supported Tampa Bay Estuary Program.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some Tampa Bay officials have become so confident of
solving the region's water problems that they have begun talking
about building a second sea-water desalination plant, this one
north of Clearwater, on the Gulf of Mexico, to help meet demand
after 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have these counties done anything to control their growth?''
asked Steve Simon, a Pasco County commissioner who is a member of
the Tampa Bay Water board. ``No. So the question is how to provide
the water, and as I see it, desal is the only answer.'''

   GORE _ WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore believes the turning
point in his presidential campaign was his decision last summer to
halt his constant calculations about what was best for the Clinton
administration and to start speaking ``straight from the heart.''
``I made a big change in my priorities,'' Gore said during an
interview in which he took stock of his bumpy but successful
campaign for the Democratic nomination and his general election

the amount of money he had to spend and his tactic of changing

   RUSSIA-OLIGARCHS _ MOSCOW _ While experts agree that Russia's
popular acting President Vladimir Putin could be the runaway winner
in this month's presidential elections, many experts warn that none
of his efforts will matter unless he does what his predecessor
Boris Yeltsin failed to do: rein in Russia's oligarchs. Reform or
no reform, they say that Russia's woes will continue while the
robber barons retain their power. But while Putin would certainly
win about 100 percent of the vote if he did crack down on these
moneyed plutocrats, he would lose their financial backing _ crucial
to his success. (Coke, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

Phillips rang the bell as usual at his beloved Cove Creek
Missionary Baptist Church near Waynesville, N.C., and greeted some
members with words still etched in their memories: ``If anyone
doesn't believe in God, all they need to do is look at these
mountains.'' But by the next Sunday, church members were wondering
why God would allow three generations of the Phillips family to be
slaughtered, allegedly at the hands of two marauding spree killers,
drunk and in a panic-stricken frenzy to outrun the law after having
already killed one person. (Scruggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   STARGAZERS _ GREEN BANK, W. Va. _ In isolated Deer Creek Valley,
where folks traditionally rely upon moonshine and timber for their
livelihoods, construction crews are nearing completion of a
gigantic radio telescope with an ``ear'' bigger a football field.
Weighing 17 million pounds and rolling on a 25-foot-thick
foundation of reinforced concrete, the Green Bank telescope will be
``one of the largest moving things on Earth,'' its builders
promise. Since 1958, an astronomy observatory has been located at
Green Bank precisely because it is so remote and surrounded by
mountains that block out all radio interference. About 130
scientists and engineers live near the rural community of Green
Bank, which is 100 miles from the nearest town. The scant populace
is an interesting mix of brainy stargazers and their down-to-earth
backwoods neighbors. (Dart, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

   TACNA, Peru _ As Alejandro Toledo, the leading candidate
opposing President Alberto K. Fujimori's re-election, arrived in
this desert city he was met by the headline in the local newspaper:
``Candidate Offers Tacna Nothing.'' When he toured downtown,
Fujimori's supporters threw eggs and tomatoes at his campaign
caravan while the local police stood by and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical day on the campaign trail for Toledo, the
director of a business school, whose challenge is so short on funds
that the van transporting a brass band in his campaign caravan ran
out of gas before it arrived for a rally in Tacna.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a David vs. Goliath situation,'' Toledo said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   There are actually eight Davids in the race against Fujimori,
hoping to deny him an outright victory in the April 9 vote and to
force a runoff. Their low standing is in part explained by
Fujimori's lasting popularity, particularly among Peru's large
Indian population, which credits the president with defeating two
terrorist groups and ending years of hyperinflation. But the
opposition candidates have also had trouble gaining traction
because, in their view and that of international election
observers, they are competing on a tilted playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's challengers are slandered and ridiculed nearly daily
by the news media, over which Fujimori exerts considerable sway.
They and their families are followed by undercover police agents,
and they dare not discuss campaign strategy on the telephone for
fear that the lines are tapped. When they hold rallies in one
village, government officials work to keep down attendance by
distributing milk and food in another nearby village at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we compete when dead people are registered to vote?''
said Beatriz Merino, who is running on a ticket led by the mayor of
Lima, Alberto Andrade, referring to one of the few charges against
Fujimori that has surfaced in the press. ``I'm a vice presidential
candidate, and only one cable television station will put me on the
air _ and that was a month ago at 7 a.m. for 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, other Western governments and
various private groups like the Atlanta-based Carter Center are
raising daily criticisms of Fujimori's political methods _
threatening to isolate Peru internationally and weaken the
president's ability to govern even if he does win. In a recent
human rights report on Peru, the State Department charged that
``questions remain about the openness and fairness of the electoral
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition's legal efforts to uphold the constitutional ban
on a third term for Fujimori have been squashed at every turn by a
judiciary, congress and electoral tribunal dominated by the
president's allies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the opposition candidates, Andrade is credited with
cleaning up much of the urban blight in Lima's colonial center.
Another, Luis Castaneda Lossio, a former Fujimori aide, is credited
with fixing a bankrupt social security system.
</P>
<P>
   But their inability to unite or to come up with a credible
campaign message has so far prohibited them from together amassing
even 40 percent support in most opinion polls. The opposition
candidates are already crying fraud, and several are holding
private meetings to consider whether to unite their efforts or to
withdraw from the race altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Daily character assassination in the news media, which Fujimori
controls in several ways, has so far been highly effective at
reducing the popularity of one opposition candidate after another.
Several newspapers are controlled by Fujimori's political allies or
depend on government advertising, as do many television stations,
which are subject to lawsuits to be decided by judges aligned with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition received a rare boost last week when El Comercio,
a newspaper read by the elite, published a story quoting witnesses
who said that Fujimori's volunteers had forged 1 million signatures
to put the president on the ballot. Jorge Santistevan, the widely
respected independent ombudsman appointed by Congress, called for
an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the election board refused to investigate. And several
tabloid newspapers believed to receive instructions from Fujimori's
intelligence service ran bold headlines accusing Santistevan and
the owners of El Comercio of being communists. Channel 2, a leading
television station, began showing interviews with analysts accusing
Santistevan of purposely trying to destroy Peru's image. The word
``conspiracy'' flashed ominously across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Andrade has been especially wounded by the news media attacks.
His rallies have been broadcast on television in slow motion or at
high speed to the theme song from the situation comedy ``Gomer
Pyle'' to make him look silly.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid press has routinely made fun of Andrade's weight,
nicknaming him ``porky.'' And they have published articles about
other candidates, suggesting that they are in the habit of engaging
in exotic sexual acts and shady financial deals.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition rallies are customarily interrupted by protests by
Fujimori's supporters, whom his opponents accuse of being organized
by the president's intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda, the former social security chief, became so annoyed
about being subjected to surveillance that he personally seized a
man last December who appeared to be following him and took the man
into a police station under ``citizen's arrest.'' The man was
subsequently identified as a member of the National Police, but
Castaneda's response backfired when he found himself facing
kidnapping charges.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori belittled Castaneda's action as a publicity stunt,
adding, ``There is no political persecution in Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda and Andrade have plunged in the polls, allowing Toledo
to rise as the current best hope to contest Fujimori in the outside
chance there is a second round. In one poll taken of 556 Lima
voters last week, Fujimori won 42 percent to Toledo's 16 percent, a
9 point gain for the 54-year-old challenger from a comparable poll
a month before.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that Fujimori emerged from single digits in just
over two months to win the 1990 presidential election and that
Peruvian politics can shift quickly and in unpredictable ways.
Nevertheless, analysts say Fujimori will fall far short of his 1995
re-election total of nearly two-thirds of the vote, and it is
doubtful that he will win control of Congress again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Toledo's appeal comes from his strong Indian appearance,
and modest upbringing by a father who was a bricklayer and a mother
who was a street vendor of fish. He campaigns in a van dubbed ``the
Cholomobile'' _ referring to Peruvian slang for a person of Indian
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from allegations that Fujimori is stealing the election,
the campaign so far has been virtually devoid of issues. And some
of the opponents have tried to fight fire with fire, raising the
issue of Fujimori's Japanese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo is not shy about sniping at Fujimori _ known popularly as
``El Chino'' for his Asian features _ for being of Japanese rather
than traditional Peruvian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any real Peruvian with Peruvian roots would prefer a job to a
government handout,'' he told a crowd of several thousand people in
Tacna. ``Millions of Peruvian mothers and fathers spend sleepless
nights of Chinese torture wondering if they will be able to feed
their children the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled widely as his supporters responded with the chant:
``Cholo si, Chino no.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Holly Hamilton, a high school English teacher in
suburban Seattle, had never voted for a Republican _ until the
recent presidential primary, when she almost giddily marked her
ballot for John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still kind of shocked at myself,'' she said with a laugh
the other day as she was out walking her dogs, Nick and Winnie. She
said she did not agree with some of his positions, but admired the
way he wanted to ``shake things up.'' And now that McCain has
suspended his campaign? ``Oh, I'll wind up voting for Gore, I
guess. He certainly doesn't do a whole lot for me, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ardent McCain supporter, Joyce Maund, from West Seattle,
has voted for plenty of Republicans and, with her man out, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas ``would probably be an acceptable second
choice for me.'' Bush could seal the deal if he could talk McCain
into being his running mate, Maund said. ``I know that's unlikely,
their being so different and all. But you know the saying _ variety
is the spice of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Kris Lenning, a phone company technician and
two-time Ross Perot voter, another passionate McCain supporter who
said she saw ``not a dime's worth of difference between Bush and
Gore.'' She said she wanted McCain to bolt his party and run as an
independent or a Reform Party nominee. If he did not, she said: ``I
really don't have any idea what I'd do in November. My vote's
completely up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Lenning, Troy Miller, a purchasing agent who supported
McCain, said he was dismayed to be stuck now with ``two
establishment candidates.'' His vote? ``I'll listen to what they
have to say over the next several months, but if I had to vote
right now, I think I'd write in somebody like Pat Paulsen _ I'm
totally serious about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain voter is the United States' hottest political quarry
these days _ the large swing bloc that is being assiduously courted
by Vice President Al Gore and Bush, and whose decision on a
second-choice candidate, if their man remained out of the race,
could well be the deciding factor in November's election.
</P>
<P>
   But while the bloc has come to be hugely significant in
electoral terms, interviews with dozens of such voters in
Washington state, and in Michigan, Massachusetts and California,
vividly confirmed what polls have suggested from the outset: Beyond
their allegiance to McCain and a somewhat vague banner of reform,
there seemed to be virtually nothing that amounted to a common bond
in their political views.
</P>
<P>
   If either Gore or Bush somehow managed to project himself as
``the real reformer'' in a two-man race, to use the mantle that the
Bush campaign has already put on its candidate, it seemed clear
that a significant majority of McCain voters could wind up being
theirs on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But it also seemed possible that the two candidates could end up
simply splitting much of the bloc roughly down the middle, with the
remaining McCain voters either not voting or voting for third-party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The passion of many McCain voters for their candidate was
clearly deep, with many using words like ``honest,''
``straight-shooting,'' ``genuine human being,'' and even
``incredibly interesting,'' to describe him, and then going further
to express their opinion that these are qualities neither Gore nor
Bush has.
</P>
<P>
   But far from having a set of issues that united them, the McCain
voters seemed all over the political map on some of the central
questions these days, including the environment, gay rights and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only one who really came out and said he was
pro-life,'' said an admiring Art Majkowski, a retired Ford Motor
Co. worker in Centerline, Mich., who described abortion as the most
important issue to him in the election.
</P>
<P>
   But Melissa Price, an accountant in Seattle for Alaska Airlines,
said she thought that McCain paid lip service to conservative views
on the issue while ``in reality, he's a lot more open-minded on a
question like that. He's really more of a libertarian on it, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   These comments also point to another distinguishing
characteristic of the McCain campaign: Many voters seem to have
projected their own personal views onto McCain, believing that he
shared them no matter what his public pronouncements were.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while many solid Republicans spoke approvingly of McCain
calling himself a ``proud Ronald Reagan Republican,'' many
Democrats dismissed such remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just something he had to say to try to get some
Republican votes,'' said 20-year-old Edgar Klepers, a computer
sales clerk and student at South Seattle Community College, who
voted for McCain partly because he thought it would be
``interesting and fun'' to have him as president. ``He's clearly
really much more of an independent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, McCain's campaign may end up helping to weaken
both political parties.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, longtime Democratic voters switched their party
status to vote for the Arizona senator. James W. Hennigan III, 44,
an insurance broker from the West Roxbury section of Boston, became
officially unenrolled to vote for McCain, and while he is leaning
toward Gore in a Bush-Gore match-up, he said he was in no hurry to
reclaim his old party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have myself positioned right there in the middle,'' said
Hennigan. ``I still feel like a Democrat. It's an interesting
position now because I intentionally say I'm going to stay here in
the middle and decide what happens. Since I made the move, I said,
`I'm just going to sit on this unenrolled thing for a while.'''
</P>
<P>
   For many McCain supporters, the next logical step for their
candidate would be to jump back into the race as an independent
candidate, much as former Rep. John Anderson of Illinois did in
1980. That is an idea that clearly has wide support among many
McCain voters, but others said such a candidacy would be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think McCain running as an independent makes much
sense,'' said Anne O'Shea, 40, a former prosecutor who lives in
Alameda County, Calif. ``It sounds great, but he wouldn't have the
support of any leadership in the country. And I think the reason
why it was so difficult for him in this race is it's very clear
that you need the support of the GOP or the Democratic Party, and
if you don't have it, they will cremate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in addition to feeling bitter that their candidate had
fallen short, many McCain voters also said the experience confirmed
their belief that anybody who posed a true challenge to the
country's power structure could not be elected.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``To me, by Bush winning, it really showed the whole thing is
skewed,'' said Michael Hansen, 32, a bank manager in West Seattle.
``The people really don't have a voice.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bart Ferko, of Oakland Township, Mich., a dance-studio
owner, said he had concluded that a real rebel like McCain could
not be elected president. ``Obviously if you're not part of the
network, you're out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if many of these voters expressed contempt for both Gore
(``plastic,'' ``detached,'' ``a bore'' were some of their
descriptions) and Bush (``an airhead,'' ``out of his depth,''
``unqualified''), they also typically said they were likely to vote
in November, and to choose one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Bush is that some McCain voters grudgingly
admit that they now think Bush is tough enough to be president.
``This whole thing did show that he didn't crumble under pressure,
that's for sure,'' said Lynn J. Turk, a career foreign-service
officer who is now a business consultant in Redmond, Wash. ``He
showed he could organize a counterattack.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Gore, the bright spot in the temporary ``McCain Mutiny''
of many Democrats is that such voters hardly seem to have
permanently abandoned their party. ``I'm going out to get a Gore
bumper sticker to put over my McCain bumper sticker,'' said James
M. Marshall, a Seattle lawyer who described himself as a Democrat,
albeit one who could never bring himself to vote for Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said he was planning to send some money to the Gore
campaign, though he cautioned that he had a remarkably unsuccessful
track record for backing presidential candidates: Anderson, Walter
Mondale, Michael Dukakis, George Bush (in 1992), and Bob Dole.
``Given my history of contributing to losers,'' he said, ``maybe
Gore won't even want my money.''

LIMITING AIR FROM RESPIRATORS CAN SAVE LIVES, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: this story, sent and held Friday, is now restored.) 
(bl) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A large new federal study shows that doctors can save certain
patients' lives in the intensive care unit if they set their
respirators so that less air is delivered than many doctors had
thought necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome, a condition in which the lungs are partly filled with
fluid, making it impossible for patients to breathe without
respirators. The condition can occur with pneumonia but it also
occurs in trauma patients, including people who have been in
automobile accidents or who have had major surgery.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100,000 Americans of all ages develop the disorder
each year, medical experts said. If they recover, most have no
lingering symptoms. But nearly half die.
</P>
<P>
   To determine how best to keep these patients alive with
respirators while their lungs recover, the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute sponsored a study that enrolled 861 patients across
the country. They were randomly assigned to one of two treatment
strategies. The results showed that death rates from the disease
could be cut by nearly 25 percent, a result so decisive that the
study ended last March, nine months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   One of the principal investigators, Dr. Roy G. Brower of Johns
Hopkins University, announced the findings at a medical meeting in
April and began preparing a paper for publication. That paper was
accepted about two weeks ago by The New England Journal of
Medicine, and an edited version was completed last week, Brower
said. The journal deemed the results so important that it released
the paper Friday, posting it on its Web site (www.nejm.org),
although the paper will not formally appear until the issue dated
May 4.
</P>
<P>
   One of the treatment strategies was to push large volumes of air
into patients' lungs, at high pressure. The advantage was that
sufficient oxygen got into patients' blood. But the concern was
that the high pressures would damage the fragile lung tissue,
slowing healing or making it impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The second strategy was for the respirators to provide less
oxygen, even though many patients would become ``air hungry'' _
wanting more breath. In addition, Brower said, with less oxygen
going into the lungs, carbon dioxide can build up in the blood,
causing its own problems and making patients feel worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If carbon dioxide accumulates, it contributes to the distress
the patient feels,'' Brower said. ``It can make the heart beat
faster, sometimes fast enough to make it a concern.'' Frantic for
breath, with pounding hearts, some patients have to be sedated, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study showed that while nearly 40 percent of the
patients who received large volumes of air died, just 31 percent of
those receiving less air died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is massively important,'' said Dr. Thomas Stewart, the
director of the intensive care unit at Mount Sinai Hospital in
Toronto, who did not participate in the Federal study. Family
members, he said, should be aware ``that the way their physicians
are managing the patients makes a difference to their outcomes.''
They need to be sure that the doctors are setting the respirators
to provide less air and gentler pressure in the lungs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never, ever, had any family member come and talk to me
about that,'' Stewart said. But, he added, ``now they will.''

 &HT;    L.A.: No early contention(s)
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kissimmee, Fla. _ No one is sure about the shortstop, or the
bullpen or even the bottom of the rotation, all of which this
spring seem to be fine. The Los Angeles Dodgers are willing to
exhange all those uncertainties for something far greater, a
commodity missing throughout last year.
</P>
<P>
   Silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on,'' manager Davey Johnson said, ``in a
very quiet spring.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone, whose ``New Sheriff's In Town''
pronouncement last spring rang a battle cry through the NL West, is
almost sullen, guarding his comments in every press encounter.
Outfielder Raul Mondesi, having punctuated his Dodger career with
wishes to be traded, got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green arrived from Toronto to replace him and, having
heard what a snake pit the Dodgers operation had become, says he
has found the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have a really good team,'' Green said.
``People said there were problems in the clubhouse last year but I
don't see them this year. Everything's been real quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Group needed a Maalox dispenser in the boardroom during
its initial foray into baseball ownership. Everything the Dodgers
had cultivated for a half-century in Los Angeles _ pride,
traditionalism, savvy public relations _ collapsed in 1999. A 38-38
second half became a monumental achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Kevin Brown hit Vero Beach last month and declared, ``I
think it's the situation now where it's time to keep your mouth
shut and let's do it all on the field, instead of talking about it
and giving it mouth and lip service.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone and new team CEO Bob Daley had facilitated that process
over the winter by bringing home native Southern Californian Green
and then tying down first baseman Eric Karros to a three-year $24
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But the addition was not as critical as the subtraction.
Mondesi's welcome had become worn. Pitcher Ismael Valdes, who had
once fought in the shower with Karros over his selfishness, and
second baseman Eric Young, who clashed with Johnson, were sent to
the Chicago Cubs. Clubhouse tension was promptly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that (perception) applies to the guys they got rid of,
that's how you've got to take it as _ that Mondesi was an
individual, I was an individual, Valdes was an individual,'' Young
said. ``I just feel like they're still barking up the wrong tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at what 1999 became, Johnson said, ``I didn't know
what to expect. You can read the numbers and look at the players
but you don't really know an organization until you work in it. I
got a better understanding of where our strengths are and where our
weaknesses are, how we fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield had seen enough to threaten to retire last
summer. This spring he said he wants to play until he's 40, meaning
nine more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great to hear, because if he's feeling like that, he's
really locked in and determined to do everything he can for the
Dodgers,'' Malone said. ``I think he has peace of mind, and this
sure makes it sound like that.''
</P>
<P>
   With such a mood swing, the personnel incidentals seem smaller.
Johnson is waiting for Alex Cora to settle in at shortstop, despite
an offseason scare with an irregular heartbeat and a 0-for-9 start
this spring. Eric Gagne, Carlos Perez and Orel Hershiser are
angling for the last two spots in a rotation that includes Brown,
Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   There still might not be enough on the roster to challenge the
Arizona Diamonbacks, which won the West by 14 games, 23 games ahead
of third-place L.A. The Dodgers payroll will exceed $90 million
after third baseman Adrian Beltre's new contract gets worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will not again pay the NL's top payroll for another 1999,
which could cost Malone his job if the Dodgers aren't contending at
the All-Star break. As quick start is almost impossible. Fourteen
of the team's first 20 games are on the road. The Dodgers face
perennial contenders in the Mets, Giants, Braves and Astros 18
times in April.
</P>
<P>
   But this year is already far removed from last.
</P>
<P>
   Said Green, ``I think people aren't expecting as much,'' which
after last summer, can be a beautiful thing.

APPALACHIA'S TREASURES GO ON THE GLOBAL MARKET

<P>
   HONAKER, Va. _ Phyllis Street, of all people, is about to plunge
into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The coal miner's widow, who turned for survival to the quilt
maker's arts that run two centuries deep in her family, will leave
her home here on Big A mountain on Monday for the first airplane
trip of her life. It will be to London, where she will be a star
entry from the suddenly less remote back hills of Appalachia in the
Ideal Home Show, Europe's premier exhibition for the booming crafts
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may turn out to be more than this gal can handle,'' said
Street, a virtuoso of quilting, hardly shying from this creative
breakthrough in which Appalachian planners have begun marketing the
best of their tradition-steeped crafters by way of international
trade shows and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   New networks of backwoods co-op businesses and community craft
makers are taking a giant marketing leap beyond the Appalachian
remoteness that long has frozen local economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving just as spring limns the gritty hill country, Street,
a painstaking maker of one-of-a-kind quilts that have come to be
priced at $1,000 and more in the competitive market, is an eager
pioneer. She relishes the venture for celebrating her flinty,
beautiful home region as much as her careful old way with
techniques like reverse applique, echo quilting, cross hatch
bordering, wire-edged ribboning, tendril embroidering and
``ruching'' _ an Old World word surviving here to describe a
particularly artful puckering of fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   The London show will hardly be another weekend at the flea
market. Committees of local craft masters have set firm product
standards so that there can be no gimcrack stereotyping of
Appalachia's best. Market connoisseurs can tell a hurried knock-off
from a quilt that takes Smith a year or more to create.
</P>
<P>
   The London marketing venture is to be conducted at the weeklong
show from a log-cabin pavilion made by Tennessee crafts people. It
is expected to produce an estimated $25 million in sales for 170
artisans and small businesses in 11 states of Appalachia, extending
from central Alabama to southern New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a watershed event for us, to have some of our
best people under an Appalachia umbrella at that important show,''
said Jesse L. White Jr., the federal co-chairman of the Appalachia
Regional Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is a state and federal venture charged with
nurturing economic and social improvements in the region, which has
been chronically battered by the fading of large-scale mining,
textile and tobacco industries.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the commission has been emphasizing the best hope
in small-business development for the burgeoning export economy.
</P>
<P>
   The London expedition shows once more that Appalachia, too long
prized as a campaign stop for politicians to show off their
empathy, is resilient. It remains pocked with poverty but studded
with master talents in traditional craft making.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the London exhibitors, like Katie McLaughlin, a
``sheep-to-shawl'' weaver and sheep herder from Tazewell, are also
involved as teachers of residents leaving the welfare roles to find
meaningful work. The new marketing for the global economy offers an
enormous window to another cottage-industry exhibitor, Debbie
Pierce and her five children, whom she schools at home in
Jonesville, where they all produce prized wall hangings and table
runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole new thing for me; we'll see what's going to
happen,'' said Smith, a quilter who works in a painterly fashion,
jotting her thoughts in notebooks and snatching together delicate
swatches and tattered scraps and appliques from the palettelike
shelves of her workroom. She produces such deeply personal works as
``Memories of Mother,'' a rich elegy of a quilt dedicated to the
woman who taught her the homespun craft that has become the
daughter's ticket to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the eve of this bit of a breakout for Appalachia,
Phyllis Deel and Jeannie Stanley-Mullins, two organizers from a new
Virginia marketing operation known as PACE (Purely Appalachia Craft
Empowerment), roamed the hill towns. They saw to final details of
the show's entries from 25 contributors chosen in the state's seven
most southwestern coal counties.
</P>
<P>
   The cornucopia includes Larry Counts' handmade brooms, Lee
Osborne's weather vanes rendered from original drawings, the
heirloom needlework of Linda Mullins' infant clothing, plus a score
of other offerings, ranging from traditional slab pottery to
hardwood bowls and rocking horses, and from rag rugs to
apple-butter soap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the rest of the world is going to be very interested
in what we have to offer,'' Deel proudly declared, driving
switchback up Big A mountain.
</P>
<P>
   What the craft masters are marketing to acquisition-hungry
collectors is a tradition of quality rooted in the very back-hollow
remoteness that has been both bane and blessing to Appalachia's
creative people.
</P>
<P>
   ``My very first remembrance of quilting is being just a tiny
little thing and playing in the pile of scraps my mother always
had,'' said Street, who recently sold a quilt for $3,500 to a woman
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother quilted to keep us warm,'' she said, noting how much
even the world of Appalachia is changing. ``I loved that pile. I
just watched her at it; that's how I learned. Use-it-up, we called
that pile.''

COMMENTARY: PESTERED IN PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican Establishment has spent an exhausting winter
luring a pouty W. out of his room. Now it must spend an exhausting
spring luring a pouty John McCain out of his room.
</P>
<P>
   The party elders know they have a dicey task ahead of them. How
can they con the idealistic Arizona senator into believing that
they are riddled with moral anxiety about the impact of money on
American electoral politics, even as W. and Gore begin the biggest
race for money since money was invented?
</P>
<P>
   McAchilles is sulking in his tent. But unless the GOP can get
him to lend his voltage to W., it may have its third presidential
debacle in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The exsurgent has fled on vacation to the South Pacific, to wash
that Bushman right out of his hair. He's eating mahi-mahi in
Bora-Bora, where he can escape Maria Shriver, the Establishment,
the Reform Party, cajoling cell phone calls and placating e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Picture it:
</P>
<P>
   As McCain walks along the beach one morning, a bottle, an old
Viagra vial, washes up with a message: ``John: Bob Dole says suck
it up. There's life after losing. Lucrative commercials, too.
Besides, Junior won't put Elizabeth on the ticket unless you throw
a fit. You owe Bob Dole. Bob Dole sent you a check for your
campaign last fall while Bob Dole's wife was still in the race. Bob
Dole got sent to the woodshed. Bob Dole was sad. Sincerely, Bob
Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, McCain lounges under a palm, sipping a brightly colored
drink with a little umbrella. He looks up to see the wicked Mitch
McConnell flying in a plane, skywriting: ``Surrender, Dorothy!''
</P>
<P>
   John and Cindy head off to a deserted island for a picnic.
Suddenly, they are stunned at the sight of a parachute opening. A
75-year-old man in a flight suit plummets down into their coconut
tarts. ``Third party,'' Poppy says, shaking his head. ``Wouldn't be
prudent. Message: I care about my boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCains make their getaway on a glass-bottom boat. They are
enjoying the exotic fish when a man in a mask and flippers swims
up. With horror, they realize it's none other than W., holding a
hand-lettered sign. ``Don't you judge my heart, Mutiny Man! Got any
more of that reform talk I can use? People seem to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain storms back to the privacy of his thatched hut. But soon
he is disturbed by the rhythm of Polynesian drums. He realizes they
are pounding out a message from the White House switchboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this Senator McCain? We have the vice president for you,
sir,'' the drums say. Then Al Gore comes on the drum. ``John, you
won't be able to beat me like a drum now. Ha! Ha! But don't cave to
those Bush weasels. Don't believe their promises. They will never
let you be secretary of defense. They think you're crazy as a loon.
I've promised Janet Reno her pick of anything in my cabinet. And my
pal Maria Hsia has her heart set on Treasury. That's the least I
can do for those gals. But we'll find a spot for you, Secretary
McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator gives up hiding and goes back out for a sunset
snorkel. He sees some natives paddling up in a catamaran. As they
draw closer, he recognizes his campaign aides Mike Murphy and John
Weaver, wearing grass skirts. Murphy shouts: ``Stay angry!
G-r-r-r-r-r! Remember the phony veteran! Remember Pat Robertson!
Remember the breast cancer ads! We want a third party! Stay bitter!
Indulge those recriminations!''
</P>
<P>
   As McCain splashes away, he is frightened by the sight of a
dorsal fin. But when the fin surfaces, it turns out to be attached
to the head of Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howdy, John. All is forgiven,'' the majority leader says. ``We
don't think you're crazy anymore. Just plucky. Come home to the
Senate and we'll help you pass your bill to get more flights out of
Reagan Airport. We'll call it the `McCain Straight Flight Express
Act.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCain darts behind a sand dune. Flying through the dusk, a
carrier cockatoo with a message strapped to its leg lands on his
head. He unrolls the message. It's on MSNBC stationery, from Chris
Matthews, Brian Williams, Jonathan Alter and Don Imus: ``Get back
on that bus! Don't leave us with those two phony princelings. Our
ratings are dropping. Please help us! Yours adoringly, the
Communist Pinko Trotskyites.''

   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore believes the turning point
in his presidential campaign was his decision last summer to halt
constant calculations about what was best for the Clinton
administration and to start speaking ``straight from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a big change in my priorities,'' Gore said in an
interview Friday night in which he took stock of his campaign for
the Democratic nomination and his general election strategy against
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall campaign, Gore said, he will tout the economic
successes of the Clinton-Gore administration. He said he was
unconcerned about ``Clinton fatigue,'' as pollsters have described
the American public's dismay over President Clinton's personal
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the country shifted many months ago into what you
might call Clinton fatigue fatigue,'' he said with a laugh. ``They
wanted to focus on the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also dismissed suggestions that Sen. John McCain's campaign
against Bush failed because his message had little appeal. ``The
need for reform in our system is demonstrated in part by the
support he did receive,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said that in the general election, ``I'm
certainly going to do my best to raise that banner even higher than
before.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his challenge to Bush to renounce the use of both
unregulated ``soft money'' donations to political parties and ads
bought by independent groups of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gore said, he and Bush should hold two debates a week.
``If he will agree, we can start next week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore compared his commitment to campaign finance reform to
McCain's, saying that like the Arizona senator, ``I bring the
commitment born of personal experience to the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the experience was the ``Keating Five'' scandal, in
which five senators faced an ethics investigation after intervening
on behalf of a savings and loan executive who was a campaign
contributor. For Gore, it was his visit to a fund-raising event at
a California Buddhist temple that led to the conviction of a
longtime Gore fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned from my mistakes,'' he added, and suggested that
Bush has not.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to list Bush's mistakes, he said, ``I think it was a
mistake to raise $70 million outside the campaign finance limits. I
think it was a mistake to have secretly financed special-interest
attack ads come in at the last minute against John McCain in the
key primary. And I think it's a mistake to be opposed to campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the past year, Gore said his political approach
shifted late last summer, when his campaign seemed uninspiring in
contrast to the growing excitement surrounding his Democratic
challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the realization that it's a lot more important to be
a candidate for president than to be the best vice president you
can be to the nth degree,'' Gore said in the interview, conducted
by telephone from Air Force Two. ``That shift in priorities caused
me to understand why my strengths as a vice president had become my
weakness as a presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pausing to reflect for a split second in response to
every question and challenge to ask myself, 'How can I move the
administration's agenda forward, how can I help the Clinton-Gore
administration?' he said. ``I realized that in order to ask the
people of this country for leadership, you have to respond
spontaneously and directly, straight from the heart, and not in any
other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his new approach ``changed everything,'' leading him
to recognize the need to move his campaign headquarters from
Washington to his home state of Tennessee, to shed the trappings of
his office, to begin open meetings with ordinary people, and to
become ``totally immersed in the dialogue with the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, just one week after a clean sweep of 15 states in
the ``Super Tuesday'' primaries, Gore is expected to win the
``Southern Tuesday'' primaries in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. That would give him enough delegates
to win the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Although the South has grown increasingly Republican in
presidential elections, Gore said he is not willing to cede the
South to Bush this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he can win anywhere in the South beyond his home state
of Tennessee and Clinton's home state of Arkansas, Gore cited
Georgia. He corralled 84 percent of the Democratic voters there,
his largest victory margin in any of last week's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a neighbor to Georgia, I was particularly gratified by
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the controversy in Florida over Gov. Jeb Bush's
efforts to end affirmative action gives him a political opening
there, Gore said, `` I think the importance of that issue
transcends politics. What the governor of Florida is trying to do
is just plain wrong. ... Regardless of that issue, I am going to be
working hard in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he does not know Bush personally, having met him only
two or three times. ``I've spent no more than 30 seconds in brief
exchanges,'' he said. ``So I don't really know him other than what
I've seen on television.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also said he had not yet assessed Bush as a
politician. ``I haven't focused on the Republican contest very
much,'' he said. ``I've been focused on my nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said knows enough about the positions Bush has taken on
issues and about his record as governor of Texas to challenge him
on taxes, gun control, abortion rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he plans to attack Bush's proposal for a large tax cut
with an argument similar to the one he made against Bradley's call
for universal health care coverage _ that it will wipe out the
federal budget surplus, shred social safety net programs and
jeopardize the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted McCain's criticism that Bush's tax cuts would
``clearly put Social Security at risk.'' And he charged that the
wealthy contributors to Bush's campaign are the ones who would
benefit the most from Bush's tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Gore, a key foreign policy player in the
Clinton administration, also plans to place a heavy emphasis on
foreign policy, perhaps Bush's biggest political weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to be talking about foreign policy a good bit in
the campaign because I think it should be discussed in a
presidential campaign,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Bush is planning trips abroad to improve his foreign
policy credentials, Gore quipped, ``I hope they're long trips.''

COMMENTARY: THE PONZI PARADIGM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Ponzi wasn't the first to try it, but he has joined Dr.
Bowdler and Captain Boycott among those whose names will forever be
terms of abuse. And the classic scam that bears his name _ using
money from new investors to pay off old investors, creating the
illusion of a successful business _ shows no sign of losing its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shiller's terrific new book, ``Irrational Exuberance,''
contains a brief primer on how to concoct a Ponzi scheme. The first
step is to come up with a plausible-sounding but complicated profit
opportunity, one that is difficult to evaluate. Ponzi's purported
business involved international postage reply coupons. In a more
recent example, Albanian scammers convinced investors that they had
a profitable money-laundering business.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on it's all a matter of timing and publicity. An
initial group of investors must be pulled in, large enough to
attract attention but not too large; then a larger second group,
whose investments can be used to pay off the first, a still larger
third group, and so on. If all goes well, stories about how much
early investors have made will spread, attracting ever more people,
and the continuing success of the company will silence or drown out
the skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, regulators _ who know very well just how
effective such scams often are _ do their best to stop them before
they get started. So you might think that Ponzi schemes are mainly
a historical curiosity. But Shiller is not interested in history
for its own sake; he uses Ponzi schemes as a model for something
much more important.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, just hypothetically, that a new set of technologies _
technologies that are really, truly, deeply fabulous _ has just
emerged. And suppose also that a number of companies have been
created to exploit these new technologies, in the entirely honest _
but very hard to assess _ belief that they will eventually be able
to earn huge profits. For the time being they earn little if any
money; even if they make an accounting profit, they must
continually raise more cash to pay for equipment, acquisitions and
so on. Still, as the evidence for a true technological revolution
mounts, the prices of their stocks keep rising, producing huge
capital gains for early investors. And this attracts ever more
investors, pushing the prices still higher.
</P>
<P>
   If the process goes on long enough _ and there is no reason it
cannot go on for years _ the doubters will start to look like
fools, and the bears will go into hibernation. Everyone (well,
almost everyone) may be completely sincere; nonetheless, in effect
you get a Ponzi scheme without a Ponzi, a scam with no scammer.
</P>
<P>
   Given the title of Shiller's book, you can guess the punch line.
He makes a powerful case that the soaring stock market of recent
years is a huge, accidental Ponzi scheme in progress, one that will
come to a very bad end. The book actually focuses on the market
broadly defined (most numbers are for the S&AMP;P 500), but it reads
even better as a tale of the tech stocks. It's a book that I hope
many people will read; but I doubt that many will be persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   You see, right now bears have an extra credibility problem. Not
long ago many people were skeptical not only about the prospects
for today's technology companies but about the importance of the
technology itself. (I plead guilty.) And every new statistic
showing soaring productivity and earnings growth shows how wrong
they were. As a matter of logic you can concede the reality of a
technological revolution, even while asserting that the valuations
of many technology companies are crazy; but who will listen?
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that savvy investors (at least they seem savvy)
are following the Levi Strauss strategy: Let others get caught up
in the gold rush, we'll sell them the supplies. It is quite
possible that the valuations of companies that sell Internet
infrastructure make sense even if those of the dot-coms do not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as you watch those who missed out on the first few
thousand points of the Nasdaq's rise feverishly try to make up for
lost time, you have to wonder. Will people 80 years from now talk,
without quite knowing where the term comes from, about being
bezosified or qualcommed?

U.S. BEGINS LONELY FIGHT TO CUT BACK ITS U.N. COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A long, hard battle to lower American payments
to the United Nations begins next week, and diplomats from a wide
cross-section of nations say there is no guarantee that the issue
will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, if any, will be crucial to future relations between
the organization and Washington. What hangs in the balance is $926
million in American arrears that has been held up by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get the money released, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright agreed last year with Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and his
ranking Democratic committee member, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
that the United States would seek to decrease its assessments for
both the regular budget and a separate peacekeeping account.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is billed for 25 percent of the regular budget
and wants to lower that to 22 percent; Congress has already passed
a law reducing the American portion of the total peacekeeping bill
to 25 percent from 30.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Helms-Biden agreement created considerable resentment among
member nations, including some of the United States' closest
European allies and Canada, who say that no nation can make demands
on the organization that violate treaty obligations to pay dues on
time, in full and without conditions. Furthermore, many diplomats
say that a reduction in American assessments may not necessarily
unlock funds because critics of the United Nations in Congress have
attached other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Helms-Biden agreement complicates the job of Richard C.
Holbrooke, the American representative, and his full-time budget
negotiator, Donald Hays, as they try to convince 187 other member
nations that they are not delivering an American ultimatum but are
arguing for a long-overdue review of assessments for all nations.
The committee of member nations that decides budget allocations
begins its meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the biggest mess you've ever seen,'' Holbrooke said in
an interview this week. ``But it is solvable. It's solvable if the
nations band together and say: `OK, we're not going to take a
diktat from Washington, but we are going to bring the U.N. budget
process into the 21st century.'''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current assessment scale, which is based on a nation's
portion of the total of all member countries' gross national
products, some countries _ among them Japan, Germany and South
Africa _ are paying more than they should, while others like China,
India, Brazil, Singapore and Kuwait pay less because of complicated
discounts for low per capita income or special exemptions from
peacekeeping bills. The United States share of world GNP is just
over 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has taken his case for an across-the-board review
around the world. He recently visited Portugal, which holds the
presidency of the European Union. On Tuesday he will leave for
Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message I'm taking to all the capitals and, equally
importantly, to dozens and dozens of meetings in New York, is that
the present scale of assessments was established in 1974 and was
based on economic data of that era,'' Holbrooke said. ``There have
been 57 new nations since then, and some countries have gotten
richer and some have gotten poorer _ and, most important, the
U.N.'s role in peacekeeping has dramatically expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 120 members of the U.N. will not have any change in
their assessments, and those are the poorest countries. This is
about the middle-income countries and the countries that are
getting richer.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's representative, Yukio Satoh, said in an interview that
in a recent meeting in Tokyo with about 50 members of the Japanese
Parliament he sensed brewing resentment over Japan's bill. Japan,
with about 17 percent of the world's GNP, pays 20 percent of the
U.N. budget. Leaving aside the United States, the four other
permanent Security Council members _ Britain, China, France and
Russia _ together pay 13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Japan has voluntarily contributed $237 million for
Kosovo and $214 million for East Timor. A world away in Congo,
Japan is paying the $300,000 needed to support the office of an
African mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are questioning why we have to pay this much,'' Satoh
said of the Japanese politicians. They have been frustrated, he
said, by the country's inability to secure a permanent Security
Council seat, a campaign bogged down hopelessly in stalled efforts
to reform the council.
</P>
<P>
   Satoh said that Japan expects to take an active role in the
coming budget negotiations, which he said are complicated by ``188
countries with different interests and different perspectives
trying to look at the same issue.''

SWISS VOTING ON RESIDENCY RAISES FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ This weekend, in what some view as a worrying trend
that may fan right-wing xenophobia in Switzerland and neighboring
Austria, voters in an industrial suburb of scenic Lucerne will get
to decide in the most personal way who should be a Swiss citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Every eligible voter in Emmen, population 27,000, has received a
booklet containing family photographs and intensely personal data
on tax status, salary, background and hobbies for each of the 56
people in the town who are seeking naturalization.
</P>
<P>
   Small though Emmen is, its vote on future citizens is in some
ways casting a larger shadow than other referendums in Switzerland
on Sunday on issues like introducing quotas to ensure that there
will be more women in top political posts, and stiffening the
already strict Swiss laws against artificial reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are alarmed that the process, which had a test run last
fall when a Yugoslav family of four was rejected by Emmen voters,
appears to be gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the far larger cities of Zurich and Bern, the local branches
of the right-wing and anti-immigrant Swiss People's Party are
proposing a popular vote on citizenship. Their message carries
distinct echoes of the Austrian right-winger Joerg Haider and his
Freedom Party, which entered government in Vienna last month to
widespread disgust and dismay in the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swiss people feel danger because there are always more and
more strangers here,'' said Urs Ischi, a member of the increasingly
popular People's Party and an Emmen-based wholesaler who pushed the
town to adopt its system for reviewing citizenship applications.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Grundberg, head of Switzerland's SOS Racism, countered:
``It's a terrible thing that's happening in Emmen. It's been a real
tradition to vote in the villages, where people know each other.
It's another thing to do it in a city.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Emmen reflects Switzerland's struggle with one of
Europe's highest percentages of foreigners. Of its 7 million
residents, some 1.4 million, or 20 percent, are from other
countries, particularly workers from Italy, Portugal, Spain and the
countries that once made up the larger Yugoslavia. They were
recruited mostly during labor shortages in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Now that these workers have been here for decades, many would
like to adopt Switzerland as their country, but they are running up
against resistance, especially in German-speaking central and
eastern Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have a real identity,'' said Gonne Ganejaj, 21, who
along with her twin, Lily, has been rejected three times for
citizenship by local authorities in Beromunster, a town north of
Lucerne. ``I feel Swiss, but I can't prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, who were born in Switzerland after their father
migrated from Kosovo and met the 12-year residency requirement,
were given no reason for the refusal. They are part of the 30
percent non-Swiss population of the canton _ or state _ of Lucerne,
bolstered by the influx of foreign workers filling numerous
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign workers' children have been born here, but they are
not automatically citizens. A nationwide effort several years ago
to make it easier for them to obtain Swiss passports failed.
</P>
<P>
   Citizenship is not a right but a touchy political decision,
because it has to do with the autonomy of individual communities,
which enjoy almost hallowed status in Switzerland, said Doris
Angst, head of the federal commission against racism. Each
community has a say at the beginning of the three-step citizenship
process. Its approval is followed by review at the cantonal and
federal levels.
</P>
<P>
   In Emmen and its sister suburb, Emmenbrucke, which are
administered together, voters agreed last June that becoming Swiss
would be decided by popular ballot. Voters received applicants'
photographs and personal information down to the number of children
in each family and the amount of individual savings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right,'' Mileva Cvitic-Vikalo said of the
display of these details. Her family moved from Croatia 30 years
ago, and her sons, 18 and 14, were born in Emmen.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at their page in the booklet for voters reveals that
her husband, Janko, earns $45,000 a year at the town's central
heating plant, likes to play soccer in his spare time and has no
savings. Her older son has his own page because after age 18 a
decision on citizenship must be made separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also foreigners in Croatia now,'' Cvitic-Vikalo said
when asked why her family was seeking Swiss nationality. She seemed
resigned to rejection, saying, ``I'm not sure if we will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds are against her family, because they are from one of
the countries that used to be part of Yugoslavia, whose citizens
are widely blamed for increased crime and drug dealing in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Central European mentality is OK with the Swiss mentality,
but some mentalities aren't _ the people from the Balkans are too
far from our thinking,'' Ischi said, apparently differentiating
between Czechs, who settled in Switzerland in large numbers after
the Soviets invaded their country in 1968, and former Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   But Ischi denied that the Yugoslav family was rejected last fall
because of their origin, even though Italian and Spanish candidates
succeeded. The family members ``weren't integrated'' and did not
speak Swiss-German after 18 years in Switzerland, he maintained.
The family could not be located for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odious system and it will allow racism to spread,''
Nils de Dardel, a Socialist Party lawmaker from Geneva, said of
Emmen's system. ``If you're French or Italian, it's fine, but if
you're Yugoslav, you don't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   De Dardel and others point to a recent vote in the upscale town
of Baar, in a nearby canton, where 14 of 26 applicants for
citizenship were rejected. Eleven were from the Yugoslavia cluster
and three were from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Baar, down-at-the-heels Emmen is struggling with the loss
of 5,000 jobs at its textile and steel factories in recent years.
Last year its 8 percent unemployment was more than double the
national level. Today it is around 4 percent, still higher than the
Swiss average.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are feeling insecure in a very new globalized world,
and they have a feeling that being isolated makes them more
secure,'' said Rosemarie Simmen, director of the Swiss foreigners
commission, which is starting a study of the naturalization
process. ``But you can't make a decision like this with 30,000
people who don't even know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ischi, the popular vote ``gives gives back the right to the
people to give out a Swiss passport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here,'' he said, ``have the right to the last
word.''

CITIZENS IN WEST TRY TO PUT GUN INITIATIVES ON BALLOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Utah, Ore.)  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Frustrated by their legislatures' unwillingness to pass
new gun-control measures, citizen groups in three Western states
are collecting signatures to put the issues before voters this fall
as ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the groups _ in Colorado, Utah and Oregon _ say
popular support for their efforts is growing, a trend that reflects
a significant change in attitudes about gun rights in areas of the
country where guns have always been part of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado and Oregon, the ballot initiatives would close the
so-called gun show loophole by requiring criminal background checks
for people who buy guns from private dealers at weekend gun shows,
where a quarter of all vendors are not licensed, according to a
1999 report by the Treasury and Justice Departments and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah effort is aimed at denying people who have permits to
carry concealed weapons from taking their guns into churches or
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   All three states have Republican-led legislatures that have
acted with apparent disregard to the shift in public sentiment. Yet
each has a governor who backs the ballot measures, including two
who are Republican, Bill Owens of Colorado and Michael O. Leavitt
of Utah. Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon is a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, the Columbine tragedy has impacted people's
views,'' said Arnold Grossman, a Denver political media consultant
and founder of the Colorado group collecting signatures, explaining
why polls in all three states have shown strong popular support for
the measures. ``As the population shifts in the West, with more
people coming in from California and the East, attitudes shift.
We're moving away from the frontier mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatal shootings of 12 students and a teacher last year at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., were carried out with
guns bought through nonlicensed sales at the Tanner Gun Show in
Denver. The shootings prompted lawmakers in several states, and in
Congress, to introduce measures that would make private gun dealers
conduct the same kind of background checks that licensed dealers
require of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   None of the bills have passed, leaving Florida as the only state
where private dealers are required to conduct background checks,
the result of a 1998 measure that gave counties there the
discretion to enforce the law. A survey by Handgun Control Inc., a
private group that supports tighter gun laws, said only 10 of
Florida's 67 counties are doing so.
</P>
<P>
   After similar bills failed this year in Colorado and Oregon,
citizen groups emerged to press ahead with ballot initiatives, and
organizers in both states say groups in other states are watching
their efforts closely to plan their own strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is an increasing frustration across the
country with the way Congress and state legislatures have handed a
basic public safety issue,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New
Jersey, a Democrat whose amendment to a 1999 bill that failed in
the House would have closed the gun show loophole. He added that as
long as lawmakers are influenced by gun lobbyists, ``Americans will
try anything, including ballot initiatives, to protect themselves
from gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups are
fighting each of the ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon and Colorado, they oppose the measures for the same
reason they lobbied against Lautenberg's amendment: that a
background check that could take three days would effectively put
private dealers out of business because most gun shows last only a
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon initiative, similar to an unsuccessful bill sponsored
by state Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, has the burden of
competing against another initiative that Burdick said was intended
to confuse voters.
</P>
<P>
   A group called Oregon Gun Owners, which objects to elements of
the Burdick measure, including the penalties, is collecting
signatures for an initiative that would have lighter sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have clouded this terribly,'' Burdick said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hellen, administrator of the gun owners group, disagreed.
But he conceded that having two choices before voters ``might be
beneficial to us'' in that his initiative also reflects concerns
about lax prosecutions of gun crimes by recommending minimum
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The effort in Colorado, where the Columbine shootings have added
layers of emotion to every gun debate, also follows the failure of
a loophole bill. It was part of a package of measures supported by
Owens, who has vowed to campaign for the ballot initiative and
predicted that it would pass by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, an effort to ban guns from schools and churches was a
centerpiece of Leavitt's legislative agenda this year. After it
failed, a coalition of groups, led by the Utah Parent-Teachers
Association, organized to collect signatures to place an initiative
on the ballot in November.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Taylor, president of the association, conceded that in a
state as conservative as Utah, collecting signatures from 10
percent of the registered voters in 20 of Utah's 29 counties, the
minimum needed to get the initiative on the ballot, could be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Leavitt, who is not expected to encounter any
problems winning election to a third term this year, is taking no
chances, letting others take the lead in campaigning for the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better for the issue,'' he said. ``This ought to be about
guns in our schools, not Governor Leavitt's or the Legislature's
position.''

SOUTH AFRICA, ONCE OUTCAST, SEEKS SOCCER'S PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ South Africa kicked off a campaign
last week to hold the most important sporting contest in the
country's history when it welcomed a delegation of international
soccer officials who will decide on the country's bid for the 2006
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Banned from international competition for many years because of
its apartheid policies, South Africa is making its first
application for the soccer showcase, which is staged every four
years and is arguably the world's pre-eminent sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, Britain, Germany and Morocco are also in the running.
But Africa is the only continent where the tournament has never
been held, and South Africa's supporters say it is time for that to
change.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is one of only a few countries on the continent
that has the resources and facilities for the World Cup, which
draws hundreds of thousands of fans, players and journalists and
makes enormous demands on the host country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can host this event,'' said Irvin Khoza, the
chairman of the country's campaign, in welcoming the committee from
FIFA, soccer's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco, one of the few other African nations with the resources
even to consider seeking the tournament, is making its third try.
And so far, it has ignored pleas to withdraw its application and
support South Africa's.
</P>
<P>
   The other three nations have experience in their favor, each
having held a World Cup tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The six-day stop in South Africa, which began Thursday, is the
inspection team's last in a series of visits to the bidding
nations. In July, after reviewing the findings of the inspections,
FIFA will decide which country should hold the event.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa was the site of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, the 1996
African Cup of Nations soccer tournament and the 1999 All-Africa
Games, but the World Cup dwarfs them all in the challenges it would
present here.
</P>
<P>
   Safety tops the list. South Africa has one of the highest rates
of violent crime in the world, and its beleaguered national police
force would almost certainly be pushed to its limits in protecting
the thousands of international visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation is another big question because South Africa's
cities have limited public bus and rail systems, and the country
would have to build, virtually from scratch, suitable networks for
moving visitors around the host cities.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the state of soccer in South Africa. Popular
as ever, the sport has nonetheless been racked by a string of
problems in the past several months. Joe Ndhlela, the chief
executive of the leading league, was suspended after being indicted
on fraud charges, several teams are being investigated for tax
evasion, and accusations of match-fixing have been leveled by a top
referee.
</P>
<P>
   The key figures in the sport, along with the minister of sport,
have been under pressure to correct any irregularities, and FIFA
will almost certainly be trying to judge the commitment to that
effort.
</P>
<P>
   As important as all of those questions will be, the inspection
team is looking hardest at the intangibles as it tours the country,
takes in a match and talks to fans, said Alan Rothenberg, an
American heading the six-member inspection committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we want to do is really get a feel for the
people's support, that this is not a top-down bid but is something
that everyone is committed to,'' said Rothenberg, who was the chief
organizer of the 1994 World Cup, the first staged in the United
States.

ROBERT E. LEE'S CHILDHOOD HOME IS SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (jw) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ Unable to pay for the upkeep of a museum, a
Civil War historical preservation group has sold the house where
Gen. Robert E. Lee grew up to a couple who intend to turn it into
their own home.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners, Mark Kington, a managing director at a venture
capital firm, and his wife, Ann, quietly acquired the dignified
brick town house with white trimming for $2.5 million from the
nonprofit Lee-Jackson Foundation. But the attorney general of
Virginia, Mark L. Earley, has asked that no money from the sale be
disbursed and no renovations on the house be made until his office
has reviewed the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   There were no competing bids on the house, and the deal was
never brought to the attention of the public real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the house is
characteristic of the Federal and Georgian architectural styles.
Robert E. Lee, the Confederate leader, lived there with his father,
Henry Lee III, a Revolutionary War cavalryman known as Light-Horse
Harry for his adroit horsemanship, and his mother, Ann, from the
time he was 5 until he entered West Point in 1825.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this Washington suburb and Civil War historians
said they were surprised by the sale, which was prompted by the
foundation's inability to finance the 205-year-old house's
structural repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a loss to our community,'' said Kristen Miller, the
director of the Lee-Fendall Museum, across the street from Robert
E. Lee's boyhood home. Miller was notified of the sale on the
afternoon of March 3, the day the Lee-Jackson Foundation and the
Kingtons signed a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were absolutely astonished,'' said Col. Thomas Taylor, the
director of Stratford Hall, the 1,600-acre plantation in Montross,
Va., where Lee was born.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he had received a letter from the Lee-Jackson
foundation saying the sale was in the ``best interest of the
preservation of the house'' because the Kingtons would care for it
well.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the sale will go toward the Lee-Jackson
Foundation's college scholarship fund for Virginia high school
students.

BEIRUT SEEKS TO USE PULLOUT BY ISRAELIS AS LEVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ After 22 years of having Israeli troops
occupying part of its territory, Lebanon is only four months away
from the deadline Israel has set for withdrawing the troops. But
instead of celebrating the prospect of regaining 10 percent of its
territory, Lebanon has balked, setting terms of its own for the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese position is part of a wider strategy that has been
closely coordinated with Syria, its much larger neighbor, which
exercises an effective overlordship in Lebanon through the 35,000
troops it has stationed here. In effect, diplomats say, Lebanon and
Syria see the Israeli commitment to withdraw as a chance to exact
additional concessions from Israel on other long-running issues.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, anticipating these demands, has said it is prepared to
complete its withdrawal without prior commitments to Israel's
future security, although it has said that it would prefer to have
agreements in place with its two neighbors before the pullout. The
issue was given added urgency when the Israeli cabinet endorsed the
July withdrawal last Sunday, making an official government policy
of what had previously been an election pledge by Ehud Barak,
Israel's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from assuaging domestic political pressures, Barak sees
the withdrawal as a means of stripping Syria of a bargaining chip
in the negotiations over the Golan Heights, the strategic territory
seized by Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The Lebanese and
Syrian demands for additional concessions amount to an attempt to
trump Barak, by warning that a unilateral withdrawal _ without
prior negotiations with Beirut and Damascus _ could lead to a new
conflict, with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon using the vacated
territory as a springboard for attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Israeli unilateral withdrawal will not work,'' Lebanon's
president, Emile Lahoud, said in an interview published Saturday in
Al-Hayat, a London-based newspaper. ``It will lead to another
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats see it as no coincidence that Lebanon and Syria have
pushed their demands before this weekend's biannual summit meeting
of Arab foreign ministers. The meeting, which began here Saturday,
has been billed as an occasion for the 22-member Arab League to
show a rare common front on the Middle East peace talks, and to
underline its backing of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the demands on Israel concerns Syria's insistence
on the return of the Golan. In January, Syria's demand for a prior
Israeli commitment to the handover of the territory led to the
suspension of Israeli-Syrian peace talks. Now, diplomats say, Syria
sees Israel's interest in completing its withdrawal without threat
of attack by the Lebanese guerrillas of Hezbollah as a means of
pressuring Israel over the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Lebanon appears determined to use the Israeli
withdrawal to press its longstanding demand for Israel to accept
the repatriation of the Palestinian refugees who migrated to
Lebanon during the wars of 1948 and 1967. The Lebanese government
numbers these refugees at 360,000, but some experts say that
migration since the battles of the 1980s has reduced the population
to no more than 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the figure, Lebanon has refused to accept the
Palestinians as citizens, and has confined most of them to pitiable
refugee camps. Now, Lebanon is demanding that Israel and the United
States, as the prime mover in the Middle East peace effort, accept
the right of the Palestinians to return, which in many cases would
mean moving to what is now Israel, or to the West Bank. The United
States has said the question should be settled separately.
</P>
<P>
   The demand is one that Israel, as well as Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian authority, has rejected. But after a telephone
conversation last week with Syria's president, Hafez el-Assad,
Lahoud, put it on the table as a condition for Israel's demand for
security guarantees after its pullout from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud then raised the stakes by warning of a possible
resumption of attacks on Israel by the Lebanon-based Palestinians,
the issue that precipitated Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1978.
``How would it be possible to guarantee Israel's borders when
thousands of armed refugees are present in the Palestinians camps,
demanding the right to return amid a total absence of any answers
about their fate and future?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that Lebanon could raise with Israel involves the
border between the two countries. Some Lebanese politicians have
said that they will not accept an Israeli withdrawal to the
frontier that existed before the 1978 invasion, but only to what
they call ``the internationally recognized border.'' These
politicians claim that a pullout back to the 1978 frontier would
involve Israel annexing about 46 square miles of land that was
Lebanon's before 1948.

ALSATIAN MAN ENDS WALK CROSS PACIFIC

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The journey of an Alsatian man who intended to
walk across the Pacific Ocean from Los Angeles to Sydney,
Australia, came to a rapid end about 30 miles off the coast of Los
Angeles this week, when his sleeping quarters were destroyed by
debris in a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Remy Bricka, 50, intended to spend six months crossing the
Pacific on pontoonlike skis while towing a catamaran behind him
with food and sleeping quarters, but the adventure lasted less than
a day. Bricka said in an interview on Friday that he hit stormy
weather and 18-foot swells early Sunday in the first night of his
journey.
</P>
<P>
   The catamaran, which was being towed by friends on a boat who
had agreed to see him through the first 100 miles, was hit by wood
debris in the storm, and the capsule where Bricka slept and kept
computer, electronic and communication equipment was filled with
water.
</P>
<P>
   The boat that was towing him then blew out an engine, and the
U.S. Coast Guard had to rescue the party.
</P>
<P>
   Bricka said he hoped to replace his equipment at a cost of as
much as $40,000 and try again in April.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A band of wet snow will linger Sunday morning from western
Pennsylvania to northern parts of New York and New England as
breezes from the north draw chilly air into a developing storm
system. Locally heavy snow and sleet will occur in the mountains of
northern New England. Rain will fall elsewhere in New England as
the low-pressure center moves across these regions. Rain will taper
to drizzle during midday and afternoon in southern New England, but
rain and some snow in northern sections will persist in Maine for
most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will turn breezy and cooler. A few showers will
dampen areas near the Carolina coast early Sunday, but ample
sunshine will cover most of the region by midday. Most of Florida
will be cooler than recent days; however, scattered thundershowers
will occur in the warmer air near the southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   A broken area of light snow and flurries will occur in the
chilly air north of a weak low-pressure area as it moves from the
central Dakotas to the northern Mississippi Valley. Farther south,
plentiful sunshine over the central and southern Plains will mix
with patchy clouds later in the day. Afternoon temperatures will be
a bit above the seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Western states will be dry. Abundant sunshine will
boost temperatures above normal from the deserts of the Southwest
to the southern California coast. In the Northwest, a few rain
showers will brush the Olympic peninsula while scattered snow
showers occur in the Bitterroot Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Spring Floods
</P>
<P>
   Spring is a time of heightened concern about floods. In a
typical year, melting snow can conspire with increased rainfall to
make river flooding a threat. Sometimes, in northern areas, ice
jams exacerbate the floods on swollen rivers. This year spring
flooding will be much less than normal. The exceptionally mild
conditions in the Northern states mean that water locked in the
remaining snow cover is scant. The flood risk is so low in the Red
River Valley of the Dakotas that the National Weather Service has
canceled the flood outlooks that are normally issued at this time
of year.

FUNERAL HELD FOR SLAIN MEMPHIS FIREFIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (jw)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS _ As funerals began Saturday for the victims of a
shooting rampage in which a firefighter is accused, law-enforcement
authorities said they had not yet learned what prompted the
slayings of the firefighter's wife, a deputy sheriff and two fellow
firefighters who came to his home to put out the blaze he is
accused of setting.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Williams, 41, was charged with four counts of
first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of
arson.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Williams confessed to the killings from his hospital
bed in an hourlong interview with officers on Thursday. He is
recovering from a broken leg caused by bullets police fired to
subdue him during his rampage, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The police director, Walter Crews, said Williams had given no
reason for his actions in his confession but had clarified for
investigators how events unfolded on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, Williams told police officers that
he used a shotgun in his suburban home to kill his wife, Stacey
Williams, 32, a letter carrier, at about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, just
after she got home from work. The couple had been married only
three weeks before, on Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to the police report, Williams, who had called
in sick to the fire department that morning, said he had set a
bedroom on fire and left the house. Outside, using the same gun, he
fired one shot at Rupert Peete, 45, a deputy sheriff sitting in his
squad car.
</P>
<P>
   Peete, who had been on his way to another call when a neighbor
of Williams' had diverted him to the Williams home, died instantly
and his car crashed into a fence.
</P>
<P>
   The same shot also injured, but did not kill, Deborah Gatewood,
the neighbor who had alerted Peete that Williams was wielding a gun
outside the burning home.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to the report, Williams fired at, but did not
hit, neighbors who tried to come to Gatewood's aid.
</P>
<P>
   Two fire engines arrived, and one firefighter, Javier Lerma, 41,
got out to take a look at the fire. Williams told the police he
then shot Lerma in the head, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is also charged with shooting and killing William
Blakemore, 48, another firefighter, who was inside one of the fire
trucks. Crews, the police director, said that Blakemore had been on
duty substituting for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrived at the scene and shot Williams in the leg and
arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears as though this is a culmination of a domestic
violence situation that erupted into a violent rage for anyone
around, which included people he worked with,'' Crews said. ``
Blakemore had been detailed to the engine house where this man
worked to take his place on the job that day. It just compounds the
tragedy of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings have left the Memphis Fire Department and many
others in the city stunned, and funds have been set up for the
families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Lerma was buried Saturday after a funeral at St. Francis of
Assisi Catholic Church in Memphis. Firefighters, police officers,
friends and church members paid their respects. For the Lerma
family, the funeral was a familiar rite. Lerma's father, also a
firefighter, had died while fighting a fire in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services for Blakemore and Peete were scheduled for
Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Information on Williams' funeral has not been released.

PUTIN, IN MEETING WITH BLAIR, DOES NOT YIELD ON CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ At his first meeting with a Western leader since he
became Russian head of state, Acting President Vladimir Putin told
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain on Saturday that he was
willing to give human rights organizations more access to the war
zone in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But with Russian troops fighting some of the bloodiest battles
of the five-month war, Putin, the certain favorite in Russia's
March 26 presidential elections, gave no ground as Blair pressed
for peace talks with Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, both lawyers by training, both of the same
generation, met in the imperial splendor of Petrodvorets, the
seaside palace built by Peter the Great, the czar whose portrait
hangs in Putin's office in homage to his role as state builder and
Westernizer.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who was accompanied by his wife, Cherie, was later given
a whirlwind cultural tour of the old imperial capital, which also
happens to be Putin's hometown. The setting added symbolism to a
visit that Putin clearly hopes will set the tone for relations with
his Western counterparts as he establishes his identity in the club
of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Segodnya on Saturday recalled Boris Yeltsin's
penchant for no-tie get-togethers and his habit of meeting world
leaders in sweaters and slacks, commenting that Putin prefers a
more imperial style.
</P>
<P>
   Facing down criticism at home for meeting a leader responsible
for a war notable for its brutality, Blair seemed set Saturday to
establish a working relationship with Russia's new leader, and to
keep the dialogue with Moscow open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say how much I enjoyed the dialogue, which was a
very good omen for the future,'' Blair said after his first meeting
with the Russian acting president, in a comment that seemed to take
for granted Putin's victory in the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   Putin acknowledged Blair's concerns about the Russian military
campaign, which has been repeatedly criticized in the West for its
violence, particularly against the civilian population. Putin said,
``The Russian leadership, and I personally, must understand what
lies behind this position'' of Blair. ``I must admit that Russia is
making adjustments after such meetings. Russia is paying particular
attention to the opinion of its foreign partners, especially such
esteemed politicians as Tony Blair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Prikhodko, a top Kremlin foreign policy adviser,
described the meetings between Blair and Putin as a very energetic
and open conversation between two very energetic and open leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Putin gave Blair a tour of the Hermitage, the fine arts
museum housed in the czars' Winter Palace, and in the evening, both
men and their wives, as well as James Wolfensohn, chairman of the
World Bank, attended a gala premiere of ``War and Peace,'' an opera
by Sergei Prokofiev.
</P>
<P>
   In his role as presidential host, Putin set a sharp contrast
with Yeltsin, who in his last years in office often stumbled at
public ceremonies, or made gaffes that made Russians wince in
shame.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the year before he became the Soviet Communist Party's
general secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev, then a member of the
Politburo, traveled to Britain with his wife, Raisa, for an
informal meeting with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher
afterward proclaimed Gorbachev to be a man she could do business
with, a comment that set the tone for the new Soviet leader's
reception abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen war and Putin's past as a KGB agent have raised
concerns both in the West and among members of Russia's small
liberal elite about his commitments to a free press, political
pluralism and other democratic standards.
</P>
<P>
   A Council of Europe parliamentary delegation flew to Grozny,
Chechnya's devastated capital, on Saturday to investigate reports
of atrocities and rights abuses by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Putin's administration has sent mixed signals. On
Saturday, a top military official, meeting with representatives of
Human Rights Watch, an organization that has documented cases of
atrocities committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, did not dispute
their facts and agreed that the mentality of the Russian military
must be changed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Russia's top military prosecutor told the
press Saturday that the crime rate among troops fighting in
Chechnya was only one-fourth of that among troops posted elsewhere,
because soldiers were too busy fighting to commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In Chechnya on Saturday, battles raged in the villages in the
foothills of the Caucasus mountains, as Russian troops fought to
push out rebel guerrillas who have held on to their positions,
defying Russian predictions of victory. Russian officials
acknowledged Friday that 156 servicemen had been killed in the past
week, one of the bloodiest of the war.

   NEW YORK _ Who is Erick Barkley playing for? This is the
million-dollar question that the wiry St. John's point guard will
contemplate for the next three weeks as March Madness _ the men's
and women's college basketball tournaments _ begins.
</P>
<P>
   Is Barkley playing for himself and his family? For his
teammates? Is he playing for St. John's University?
</P>
<P>
   Barkley made a short-term decision around midnight Friday.
Somewhere in the fever pitch of the Red Storm's Big East tournament
semifinal game against Miami at Madison Square Garden, Barkley
decided that he had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Weakened by a stomach virus, scarred by the news that the
National Collegiate Athletic Association was extending its
investigation into his academic life at Maine Central Institute and
possibly upset by tension within the team, Barkley said he wasn't
playing for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   After the exhilarating one-point victory, Barkley, dejected and
near tears, told reporters he was taking a leave of absence. Leave
of absence? On the eve of the Big East championship game? Had
Barkley taken leave of his senses?
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as a shock to everyone. Coach Mike Jarvis,
who was initially caught off guard by Barkley's independent act,
put his point guard's decision in a larger context.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things sometime that are bigger than wins,'' Jarvis
said, ``and it's time for people to understand that. We're talking
about dealing with a young man who is first of all a very proud
human being, who has a great mother and family and who has been
through a tremendous amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis left the door wide open for his star point guard to
return. ``He's entitled to whatever thoughts he has at the time,''
Jarvis said, meaning that he would be welcomed back whenever he
decides to play. ``It's all part of being a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the beauty of a sport like basketball _ sports in
general _ is that there are clear-cut winners and losers, goats,
heroes and heroines.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of St. John's and Erick Barkley vs. the NCAA, there
are no clear-cut good guys and bad guys, nor a lot of innocent
guys.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA enforcement staff has been criticized, even from
within, for applying narrow interpretations to archaic rules
governing amateurism and extra benefits. In its dispute with St.
John's, the NCAA has locked itself in a combative box from which
there can now be no graceful escape.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's has not been forthcoming with information and has
thrown annoying barriers across the road to keep the NCAA off the
trail. The university continues to hide behind the reputation of
the Riverside Church while refusing to acknowledge that the
church's high-powered basketball program is a de facto feeder
system from which St. John's has richly benefited over the years.
Ernie Lorch, the program's founder, is a St. John's supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is no innocent guy either. Like most star players at
nearly any university, in any sport, Barkley has profited _ even if
the profit was no more than having his prep school tuition paid.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA suspects that there may be more. There may have been an
ingrained system of gifts and perks that violated NCAA regulations.
The rules may be silly, arcane and hypocritical, but these are the
rules of the organization to which St. John's belongs; this is an
affiliation that allows the university to pay Jarvis hefty
compensation to coach.
</P>
<P>
   The team is built on precision, passing and chemistry, and now
that chemistry has been disrupted. There were reports of a
locker-room altercation between Barkley and his teammate Bootsy
Thornton at halftime of Friday's game, with Barkley apparently
injuring his left arm. The NCAA investigation might have
contributed to the tension of the moment, although most members of
the team have cited Barkley's problems with the NCAA as a unifying,
rather than a divisive, factor.
</P>
<P>
   From a basketball perspective, the shame of all this is that
Jarvis has St. John's playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably passing better this year than last year,'' the
junior guard-forward Reggie Jessie said. ``Last year we give it to
him; he sets something up and everything revolves around him. This
year everyone knows their role, and they're playing their role.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, criticized last month for harsh comments comparing the
NCAA to the Gestapo and its investigation to rape, gave a more
tempered criticism Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing you know, they'll want to check his birth
certificate to see if he's a U.S. citizen,'' Jarvis said, ``and if
he's not, maybe they'll deport him.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the NCAA being vindictive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if vindictive is the right word,'' Jarvis said.
``You can probably take a hundred words. But obviously we need to
continue to look at what's going on and we need to continue to ask
the hard questions. We need to maybe start looking at what's going
on the other side of the fence, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis added: ``I marvel at how much he's been able to endure so
far. But I'm still betting on Erick Barkley.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe St. John's has outgrown the need for the NCAA. Maybe the
next step is for a number of players, coaches and administrators to
take Barkley's lead and sit this tournament out, let the networks
televise reruns of tournaments past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to change,'' Jarvis said. ``I hope that a lot of
people will finally get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here we are at tournament season, and the NCAA's shining moment
is tarnished. One young man must determine for whom and for what is
he playing. Erick Barkley is certainly no longer playing for the
good and glory of the NCAA.

 &HT;    Worm deftly pulled

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The notice came over the Internet, which should
surprise no one because Mark Cuban made his billions that way. The
Dallas Mavericks' owner-to-be had tired of Dennis Rodman, and he
gave the Weird One the boot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of letting public relations people handle it, Cuban sent
an e-mail to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some proactive data on the Mavs releasing Dennis,'' is what
Cuban's e-mail said at the top. This is unique, to say the least.
Cuban, who'll shortly be approved by the NBA Board of Governors as
the Mavericks' owner, made the rounds during the NBA All-Star game
in February, shaking as many hands as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the billionaire e-mails a writer, saying he's glad
they met. This, again, is unique, for in the stuffy world of NBA
ownership, getting an owner to return a call is a major chore. To
get an unsolicited greeting and then receive a question-and-answer
e-mail from Cuban (again unsolicited) is unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the Weird Worm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we release him?'' Cuban wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got Dennis for a run at the playoffs. We obviously were not
successful in making that run. Rather than sitting Dennis on the
bench to give the other guys more time on the court, we decided it
would be better to release him. This at least gives him a chance to
get picked up by another team, even though he would not be elgible
to play in the playoffs,'' Cuban answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it for basketball-related reasons, or because of his
recent comments about you and the team?'' Cuban asked, this time
posing a question as if a reporter asked him. Hey, the guy's
creative.
</P>
<P>
   He answered his own question: ``The comments had nothing to do
with it. We all are upset about losing. I would do this all again
and sign Dennis in a heartbeat. It was the right move, we just
didn't get the wins we wanted. I would also tell you that if we
were three games out of a playoff position, we would not be
releasing him. This has to do with creating playing time for the
younger guys and creating continuity for next year. We just didn't
think it would serve Dennis or the Mavs well if we just sat him
down and didn't play him.''
</P>
<P>
   More Cuban interviewing himself:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you still consider him a friend?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. I think the world of Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think he can still play?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it. He is a great competitor and rebounder.
I think any team looking at a run for the playoffs in the Eastern
Conference, or not remaining on our schedule should definitely pick
him up.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not end the missive with a ``So long, Mark.'' But the
feeling was that he'll be heard from again.

lose, it's how you play the market _ the free-agent market or the
renegotiated-contract market. And unless the National Football
League finds a way to soften its salary cap so a franchise can keep
its best players at market prices, that cap will continue to
sabotage the essence of pro football and of any other popular
spectator sport _ the fans' loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   To lessen the movement of ``market-price'' players, let every
team pay its own players above and beyond the NFL salary cap, which
is now as hard as a helmet, especially for players a team has
drafted and developed.
</P>
<P>
   In all the talk about the New York Jets' suddenly shopping
Keyshawn Johnson, the problem isn't so much that he wants to
renegotiate his contract as it is the Jets' inability to fit a new
deal under the $62.172 million cap.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the Jets' success under Bill Parcells, like that of
other successful teams, is that the Jets now have so many quality
players, they can't pay all of them the quality salaries that the
market has set.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets or any other team drafts and develops good players,
it should be rewarded. Instead, it's punished. The salary cap, no
matter how much it increases every year, allows only so much for a
team's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Keyshawn Johnson and his agent, Jerome Stanley, are
blameless. Their complaint is that the two-time Pro Bowl wide
receiver is underpaid in today's market, that he will collect only
$1.74 million in basic salary in the 2000 season. They conveniently
forget that as a rookie he signed a six-year, $15 million deal,
including a $6.5 million bonus, when he had not yet proved he was
worth all that money.
</P>
<P>
   That's the one-way street too many players and agents live on
now. And too often that one-way sign points out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the St. Louis Rams stopped celebrating their Super
Bowl victory, the ``market price'' had eroded their roster of four
players, notably tackle Fred Miller and center Mike Gruttadauria,
just as it had eroded the Super Bowl depth of the 49ers and Cowboys
after the salary cap was created in 1994. Once a quality player is
an unrestricted free agent, another team can always afford to offer
him more money to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the New York Giants lost Chad Bratzke, now a Pro Bowl
defensive end with the Indianapolis Colts. Under the old system,
the Giants would have been set at defensive end for a decade with
Michael Strahan and Bratzke, but under the cap, they could afford
to pay only one of them market price. They preferred Strahan, the
right choice as the better of the two at the time, but Bratzke's
departure depleted the defense as last season's Giants finished
7-9.
</P>
<P>
   Bratzke's departure also depleted some Giants fans' loyalty. He
had been drafted (in the fifth round in 1994) and developed by the
Giants, just as Johnson had been drafted (with the very first
choice in 1996) and developed by the Jets, the way a fan likes to
see it happen. But Bratzke is gone, just as Johnson might be gone.
That's the way it is with every NFL team, where the salary cap is
never enough to afford all of a good team's quality players.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that way in the National Basketball Association; its
salary cap allows a team to pay its own players exorbitant money
that doesn't count against the cap. That's why Michael Jordan never
left the Bulls; that's why Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone, John
Stockton, Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson have played with only
one NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   With so much more movement by quality players in the NFL than
the NBA, more and more pro football fans feel betrayed by
unrequited love. They are reluctant to become devoted because that
quality player isn't likely to be as loyal to the franchise as the
fans are. It's difficult for fans to become attached to a player
when they know that, as soon as he's a free agent, he's likely to
be playing for another team for more money.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate problem is that the NFL is reluctant to soften
its cap. Under its collective bargaining agreement, the players
receive 63 percent of the gross income. Counting benefits, it's
almost 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL were to allow a team to pay its own players a certain
amount above and beyond the cap, that percentage to the players
would increase in direct proportion to the decrease in the owners'
profits. But the NFL needs to come up with something to help a team
keep its own players, especially those whom the team has drafted
and developed.
</P>
<P>
   In the shake-up of the ``Monday Night Football'' telecast,
Howard Katz, the president of ABC Sports, talked about how the
production had developed a ``sameness.'' But maybe that's because
the NFL has developed a sameness, too. Too many players with the
same ``market price'' next to their names.

 &HT;    The power struggle: top teams in the eastern and western
conferences
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. Indiana Pacers. They continue to establish themselves as the
class of the conference. To win at home over Portland without Jalen
Rose showed Larry Bird's group just might be primed to make a title
run.
</P>
<P>
   2. Miami Heat. Almost by default, the Heat land here. Miami has
done nothing to really establish itself lately, which speaks for
the weak competition in the East.
</P>
<P>
   3. Philadelphia 76ers. Toni Kukoc and Allen Iverson are learning
to play together, and with their defense, the Sixers could be real
trouble in the playoffs. They still need one more scorer.
</P>
<P>
   4. Toronto Raptors. With Vince Carter playing on an entirely
different level from most everyone else in the league, the Raptors
are growing immensely. They're winning in close games and on the
road, thanks largely to Carter, which should help in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   5. New York Knicks. Maybe the return of Charlie Ward and pending
return of Marcus Camby can inject some consistent life in this
uneven club. Right now, they are dry.
</P>
<P>
   WESTERN CONFERENCE
</P>
<P>
   1. Los Angeles Lakers. A classic case of a coach making a
difference. Phil Jackson has the team functioning as a team, and
with the talent the Lakers have, that's significant.
</P>
<P>
   2. Portland Trail Blazers. Speaking of talent, Portland has had
much of it playing poorly lately. Steve Smith and Scottie Pippen
have been average, and so the team dropped three in a row for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   3. Utah Jazz. It seems there's nothing that can derail Karl
Malone and John Stockton from getting it done. They continue to
show the value of experience.
</P>
<P>
   4. Phoenix Suns. Penny Hardaway finally has realized the team
needs him to score, and he's getting it done. And the firepower
Rodney Rogers provides has been outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   5. San Antonio Spurs. Tim Duncan's back, and so are the
champions. Soon Sean Elliott will join the club, and if he regains
his old form, they'll be formidable again.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   Toronto forward Vince Carter. He's hotter than a comet. His
confidence is in the stratosphere, which showed big-time on his
buzzer-beating three-pointer to down the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles center Shaquille O'Neal. He's been so good that it
has become routine for him to dominate. No one's better this
season, and O'Neal continues to show it in guiding the Lakers to 17
consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's Mark Jackson. The unselfish point guard never
complains about having his minutes split with Travis Best. And
against Portland on Thursday, Jackson had 23 points, including 10
in overtime, nine assists and no turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   Hawks guard Isaiah Rider. He can't make it to games on time, and
he has made no positive impact in the team's latest slide.
Suspension likely is coming for tardiness.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's Scottie Pippen. He wanted out of Chicago and then
Houston, and now, when the Trail Blazers go through a rough
stretch, Pippen hardly has been the effective player the team
needs.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dumars, the low-key member of the Detroit Pistons'
``Bad-Boys'' championship teams of 1989-90, had his No. 4 jersey
retired by the team Friday. Dumars, a six-time National Basketball
Association All-Star, was the Most Valuable Player of the 1989 NBA
Finals, leading Detroit over the Los Angeles Lakers for the first
of two consecutive titles. During his 14-year career with the team,
Dumars compiled 16,401 points, 4,612 assists and 902 steals. The
36-year-old, who is the team's vice president of player personnel,
is the sixth Pistons player to have his number retired, joining
Dave Bing, Bob Lanier, Vinnie Johnson, Bill Laimbeer and Isiah
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers are moving into elite company with their
17-game winning streak. If they win No. 18 tonight at home against
Sacramento, they will tie three teams (1969 Knicks, 1982 Celtics,
1996 Bulls) with the third-longest streak in NBA history. If they
win Monday at Denver and Thursday at Washington, they will tie the
1971 Bucks with 20 consecutive wins. The record? 33 in a row by the
1972 Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Shandon Anderson was greeted by a chorus of boos during his
return to the Delta Center in Salt Lake City. Anderson, the former
University of Georgia star who played the first three seasons of
his NBA career with the Utah Jazz, left the team in the offseason
and signed with the Houston Rockets. Anderson scored 16 points, but
the Jazz ripped the Rockets 101-82.
</P>
<P>
   George Irvine said he does not want to coach the Detroit
Pistons, and he's not afraid to let anyone know it. After the team
fired Alvin Gentry on Monday, Irvine was moved from assistant to
interim coach. But he wants to remain an assistant, not a full-time
head coach. ``I just don't want to do this,'' Irvine said. ``I just
really don't want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   MAKING HEADLINES
</P>
<P>
   Already established as a supernova, Vince Carter added to his
status with another game-winner, that game-winning three at the
Clippers. More significantly, Toronto ran its streaks to six
consecutive road wins and eight overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks corrected an error by releasing Dennis Rodman the
day after the enigmatic forward publicly criticized owner Mark
Cuban. Rodman lasted 29 days in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Rider of the Hawks was late every home game and was
warned that he'd be suspended for three games if he shows up late
again.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Sean Elliott, the starting small forward on San Antonio's
championship team last year, will make his return to the NBA
Tuesday against the Hawks after undergoing a kidney transplant
seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Nets forward Jayson Williams, out 11 months after
breaking his leg, has received clearance to begin practicing with
the team this week.

THE WINNING TICKETS? AN EARLY LINE  
 WAITING FOR PEROT MAY BE IN VAIN  
 FALWELL'S CRUSADE: VOTER REGISTRATION  
 ONE CANDIDATE'S WAY OF GETTING ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   THE WINNING TICKETS? AN EARLY LINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though it now seems certain that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
will be the Republican presidential nominee and Vice President Al
Gore will be the Democratic nominee, both men insist it is too
early to talk about running mates.
</P>
<P>
   But others are talking, toying with pairings that might win. It
is all pure speculation, but herewith, in no particular order
except by party, are some theoretical pairings, along with the
perceived pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   Caveat emptor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and ...
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona: He could help heal the party rift
left by the primaries and bring in the independents and dissident
Democrats Bush failed to draw. But he insists No. 2 is not for him.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Colin L. Powell: He is still an unusually popular public
figure. But he has already rejected a shot at being No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole: She worked hard for Bush after dropping out of
the race herself and could help close the gender gap. But she is a
so-so stump performer.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania: He is a Bush friend from an
Eastern megastate, a former member of Congress and a good
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki of New York: He helped deliver his megastate
to Bush in the primary, and his presence on the ticket in November
might force Gore to commit extra time and money to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey: She also could help with
the gender gap. But her support of abortion rights poses a major
problem for a ticket with an anti-abortion candidate at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and ...
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey: He could help unify the
party. But his poor performance in the primaries exposed weakness
on the stump. And, anyway, he insists he is not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana: In heavily Republican Indiana, this
popular politician with an easygoing stump style has been elected
both governor and senator. So he has the potential to help the
Democratic ticket in the Midwest. But would the contrast between
his stump style and Gore's be too jarring?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California: She's been mentioned for
years as a possible choice for vice president and could help Gore
hang on to the women's vote nationally. Equally important, she
could help him lock in California.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson: He is Hispanic. And in the
Southwest and three of the biggest states _ California, Texas and
New York _ the Hispanic vote is beginning to make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts: He worked hard for Gore after
deciding not to run himself. He is a Vietnam War hero.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland: She is a long,
long shot. But since she is both a Kennedy and a woman, this
speculation started almost the moment she first signed up to run
for a public office.
</P>
<P>
   WAITING FOR PEROT MAY BE IN VAIN
</P>
<P>
   The drive to draft Ross Perot for a third run for president
seems to be making little headway.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Reform Party members who want him to be their
nominee rather than Pat Buchanan, the hard-right news commentator,
held news conferences in a dozen cities around the country. But the
coverage was minimal, with few reporters or Perot supporters
showing up.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisville, Ky., for example, the news conference turned out
to be a nonevent. Not one reporter showed up, only the state party
chairman, John Longmire. He lamented later that if Perot had
already declared himself a candidate, there would have been plenty
of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In Perot's hometown, Dallas, four supporters showed up and vowed
to continue the draft-Perot effort.
</P>
<P>
   Perot offered them no encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take something of a miracle to get him to run for
office again,'' Russell Verney, Perot's closest political aide,
said at the end of the disappointing day.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: Friends of Buchanan say he is considering moderating
some of his hard-right rhetoric in an effort to broaden his
candidacy and thereby expand his impact on a Gore-Bush contest that
is shaping up as very close.
</P>
<P>
   FALWELL'S CRUSADE: VOTER REGISTRATION
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell is not turning the other cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent days,'' he writes in his latest weekly Falwell
Confidential letter, ``certain elements in both political parties
have made it clear that people of faith are persona non grata in
the American electoral process.''
</P>
<P>
   He then accuses Sen. John McCain of attacking him and says Vice
President Al Gore invented stories about him.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, he goes on, needs to reclaim itself as ``one
nation under God.'' And to help the process, he says, he and other
church leaders who helped him found the Moral Majority 20 years ago
plan to register 10 million new voters over the next seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Come Election Day, he says, those voters will be ``actively''
urged, along with other God-fearing voters, to ``fulfill their
Christian duty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' Falwell writes, ``we will not endorse or oppose
any congressional, presidential or other candidates. This is not
allowed by law. If people of faith pray, God will, without doubt,
lead them in making good decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: ONE CANDIDATE'S WAY OF GETTING ATTENTION
</P>
<P>
   In politics, when nothing else seems to work, why not a gimmick?
</P>
<P>
   So Michael Stafford, a Houston-area Republican facing an uphill
struggle in the Harris County district attorney's race, came up
with one _ a mail pamphlet that features a picture of O.J. Simpson
playing golf and a headline that reads: ``Exclusive! If Michael
Stafford had been the DA, O.J. would be busting rocks, not hitting
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Prominent blacks say it is tasteless at best and racist at
worst, and county Republican leaders question what California
prosecutions have to do with Texas prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford says his point is that he would be a prosecutor who
would win the big ones.

NFL SCOUTS LIKE POWER RUSHING BY PENN STATE'S BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the National Football League's best personnel men was
scouting a Penn State game last season, munching on a candy bar,
trying not to get too much chocolate on his fingers or his fancy
new binoculars, when he saw something that amazed him. The Penn
State defensive lineman Courtney Brown was making an overwhelming
power rush despite being triple-teamed, displaying his raw talent
that has scouts drooling.
</P>
<P>
   After that move, the chocolate bar went careening, decorating
the executive's nice outfit. And he didn't care. He knew he was
watching someone who had a chance to be a great professional
player.
</P>
<P>
   If scouts weren't scribbling on their notepads or picking up the
phones after one of Brown's plays last season, they were sitting in
their seats smiling.
</P>
<P>
   On that particular play, as is often the case, a hulking
offensive lineman, a tight end and a running back were all trying
to contain Brown, a massive 6 feet 5 inches, 270 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Brown busted through them all and actually made running through
three grown men look easy. Thus the lost chocolate bar, thus the
impending possibility that Brown might be taken first over all in
the April 15 draft by the Cleveland Browns. He would overtake Peter
Warrick, the flashy Florida State wide receiver, who many in the
news media thought was a lock to be the first selection. That is no
longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns have a difficult choice. They can pick Warrick, who
would be a great weapon for a young quarterback, Tim Couch. Or,
they could go with Brown, a rarity in that he is a great
pass-rushing defensive end, who is also solid against the run. He
is being called the next Bruce Smith, and if that is not enough
pressure on him, San Francisco 49ers general manager Bill Walsh
called Brown ``a Lawrence Taylor-type of impact player.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has other choices, such as Brown's former Penn State
teammate, linebacker LaVar Arrington, but the Browns are believed
to have narrowed their choice to Warrick or Brown. But they are
still, at least publicly, keeping Arrington in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time it was Peter, Peter, Peter,'' said the Browns
vice president Dwight Clark. ``Now, it's, `Maybe we should look at
these other two guys; they're pretty darn good.' They are just
unbelievable specimens. It's like somebody chiseled them out of
granite.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``other two guys'' to whom Clark was referring are Brown and
Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Warrick's stock is falling. There are scouts who
believe that Warrick is a better pick because he can instantly
change an offense. He has speed, athleticism and game-breaking
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown's stock, right now, is the bluest of the blue chips.
He's Amazon.com. He is a big lineman who can run a 4.53 40-yard
dash. Brown set a school record with 33 career sacks, and last
season, showing that he is also a good run-stopper, Brown had 29
tackles for a loss.
</P>
<P>
   What is also extremely attractive about Brown is his
personality. He is known for his understated nature and pleasant
demeanor. While Warrick became infamous for his shopping habits,
scouts and personnel men say they have discovered nothing in
Brown's past that concerns them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' said one scout, referring to off-field
behavior of prospects, ``but this guy, so far, is clean as a
whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Brown think he will be the first pick?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never tell,'' he said. ``Obviously, yes, you want to
be the first pick. But you never can tell in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   He is right about that _ no one can ever predict what a team
will do. There is even the remote possibility that Cleveland might
trade the pick, maybe to the Jets. But if the draft were this
month, Brown would probably be a Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cleveland goes with Warrick,'' said one general manager,
``they are making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Detours for Johnson
</P>
<P>
   As if the life of the Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson was
not busy enough with the trade rumors around him, another
distraction occurred last week.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has been quietly seeking the advice of its players and
others on how to curb the disturbing images involving professional
football players. With Rae Carruth and Ray Lewis being charged with
murder, the league is asking its players for advice on how to deal
with the issue of making wise choices and choosing friends smartly.
</P>
<P>
   A group of high-profile players, including the Giants' Michael
Strahan, along with National Football League Players Association
executive director Gene Upshaw, met with Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue last week in New York. Johnson was supposed to attend but
had travel difficulties from California. He wanted to participate
via conference call, but in the end it was decided he should simply
skip the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson was dealing with the travel problem, reports began to
surface that the Jets were trying to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   49ers Like Pennington
</P>
<P>
   Now that Dan Marino will most likely retire _ an announcement
might come as early as Monday _ the focus will turn to another
great quarterback who is deciding what to do with his future. Will
San Francisco's Steve Young try to play one more year?
</P>
<P>
   People close to Young maintain that he is still undecided but
are guessing he will retire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 49ers are strongly considering taking the
Marshall quarterback Chad Pennington with the 12th pick in the
draft. The team will need to create more salary-cap room to sign
him or any other first-round pick. That may be why they are looking
to restructure the contract of Jerry Rice, the future Hall of Fame
wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has a salary-cap designation for the 2000 season of $5.49
million. The team wants to cut that in half, giving them breathing
room to sign their rookies and other players. Reworking Rice's deal
would also ensure the receiver would retire a 49er.
</P>
<P>
   A Sleeper Has Scouts Raving
</P>
<P>
   Remember this name because he could end up being one of the
sleepers in the draft: John Milem.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, few have ever heard of him. He is a 6-foot-5-inch,
287-pound sophomore defensive end from Lenoir-Rhyne College, a
Division II team, but his workouts have scouts buzzing. Here's why.
Despite weighing almost 300 pounds, he still ran a 4.7140-yard
dash, had a 35-inch vertical leap and broad jumped 10 feet 2{
inches during the testing for scouts.
</P>
<P>
   There have been dozens of players in the draft's history who
tested well but turned out to be busts. Mike Mamula had a
spectacular combine performance and parlayed it into a first-round
selection by the Philadelphia Eagles and a $8 million contract. But
the Eagles have got just 26 sacks from Mamula in 5 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts think Milem will not fall into that same situation,
mainly because he is said to have a tremendous work ethic and
genuine talent.
</P>
<P>
   Milem still has a long way to go before he is considered even a
midround pick. Teams may not be convinced he can compete in the NFL
after having played against small-college competition. But Milem
has another workout scheduled for teams Monday, and maybe he will
continue to impress.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Woody Allen made a film last month that did not have
the romantic kookiness of ``Annie Hall,'' the tortured family drama
of ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' or the hot '30s jazz of ``Sweet and
Lowdown.'' This film was short _ 2 minutes, 53 seconds _ and went
into what Hollywood types would call extremely limited
distribution: about a dozen copies.
</P>
<P>
   The victim _ because every Woody Allen production has a victim _
is his neighborhood in the East 90s, which also happens to be where
he shot his 1996 musical misadventure ``Everyone Says I Love You.''
The villain is an apartment house: a 16-story tower that a
developer wants to build on top of a one-story bank branch at
Madison Avenue and East 91st Street.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and the opponents of the project, who asked him to lend
his fame to their fight, say the new tower would block their views
and leave their low-rise neighborhood feeling uncomfortably like a
high-rise canyon.
</P>
<P>
   In the famously nebbishy voice heard in critical favorites like
``Radio Days,'' Allen used words like ``huge'' and ``aesthetically
wrong'' as he described his worries about the building and what it
would do to the community.
</P>
<P>
   To the long list of things Allen has done or been _ boyhood
magician; stand-up comedian; clarinetist and band leader; disdainer
of Oscars; neurotic sex symbol _ add historic preservationist.
Allen said the film was the first he had ever made for a cause. The
dozen copies were for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which
has the power to order the apartment building scaled down. The site
is in the Carnegie Hill Historic District.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities have been pleading and marching for historic
preservation projects since before Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
volunteered to help save Grand Central Terminal. In the 1980s, the
television commentator Bill Moyers joined opponents of a 42-story
tower just off Central Park West. More recently, Walter Cronkite
attacked Donald Trump's sixth-of-a-mile-tall tower near the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood named for a VIP of a century ago, it is no
surprise that Allen is not the only high-wattage personality
opposing the apartment building. Sir Howard Stringer, the chairman
of the Sony Corp. of America, has been heard from.
</P>
<P>
   So has a marquee full of names recruited by Jurate Kazickas, who
lives with her husband, former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C.
Altman, a block from the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blythe Danner, you know, Gwyneth Paltrow's mother, used to
live two doors down,'' Kazickas said, explaining that they became
friends during a previous battle over construction in the
neighborhood. ``I call her up and go, `Here we go again.' She gave
me the phone numbers of Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman and Kevin
Kline. Bette Midler I knew. They're concerned citizens as well as
celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   And Allen not only made his film, he also testified before the
landmarks commission at a standing-room-only public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of that kind of celebrity involvement ``is to turn a
hearing into theater,'' said Robert S. Davis, a lawyer for the
developers of the project, on 91st Street. ``When Woody Allen
walked into the hearing room, all eyes turned to the door he walked
in through and away from the historic preservation consultant who
was speaking on our behalf. He talked as if his major concern was
that he films in Carnegie Hill and doesn't want the backdrop for
his movies to be affected. He did not talk much about how he moved
into a property that backed up against it.''
</P>
<P>
   So if this were a film, those who are for the Madison Avenue
building would call it ``Everyone Has a Self-Interest,'' but in an
hourlong interview, Allen did not mention the closeness of his town
house to the building site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This I knew long before I moved there,'' he said in a
follow-up conversation. ``And regardless of what happens, it's fine
for me. If they build a tall building there, it's not a huge
problem for me, not nearly enough to have prevented me from moving
there. If you're in my house, if you look right straight out, you
see something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-interest he talked about had to do with his
professional life _ trying to make movies in a city he worries is
losing the pleasant-looking urban landscapes worth capturing on
film _ ``an older, more human New York,'' he called it. ``A more
charming New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a crime when you have to shoot a scene but can't
move the camera an inch to the right because there's a terrible
poured concrete building,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a film about the Carnegie Hill brouhaha could just as easily
be called ``Dining Rooms with a View'' _ the architect can see the
site from his dining room, as can several of the opponents. Also,
one of the developers lives a couple of blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building anywhere in New York is building in your own backyard
_ in this case, it's mine and Woody's,'' the architect, Charles A.
Platt, said. ``Part of my view will be taken. I think it will be
replaced by something that's wholly appropriate and certainly
reasonable.''  &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a better title for a film about the the building would
be ``A Tale of Two Transactions.'' Both took place within the last
two years. In the first, Citibank sold the developer, the Tamarkin
Co., the right to build above its one-story branch at 1275 Madison
Avenue, a squat brick structure that went up in 1950. The owners of
a town house next door also sold Tamarkin their air rights,
allowing a five-floor increase in the height of the building.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, Allen was buying a six-story Victorian
town house on East 92nd Street. Allen moved there from a penthouse
in the East 70s he said he had outgrown after 30 years. ``I had a
child, I needed more room,'' he said. ``If I didn't have a child, I
never would have moved out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hand of the gods, serendipity, having someone like
him move in,'' said Jane Parshall, a chairwoman of one of the
groups opposing the building, the CitiNeighbors Coalition of
Historic Carnegie Hill. ``It's not just because he bought this very
expensive house and may lose some sunlight on his back, it's that
he's made movies in this neighborhood for years and years and
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Allen, who is often described as reclusive but who has
been anything but reluctant to share his thoughts on the proposed
building and the landmarks commission.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he told opponents that he was willing to speak out
against the building, and they began calling reporters. He told The
New Yorker about the film before he had finished it; in an
interview three weeks later, he made many of the same points _
sometimes in the same words _ and then screened it. Some critics
would probably say the film _ in truth, a video _ is little more
than a simply made commercial with Allen talking and a Rogers and
Hart song playing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against these developers, I just feel they've picked
the exact wrong street to put up a 17-story building,'' he said.
``I don't think the Citibank is any great treasure to look at, but
if they said they want to build a 10-story building, fine. But 17
stories _ and it's a tall 17, it's not a completely kosher 17
because some of those are double-height floors _ would just be
crushing to that neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal developer, Carey Tamarkin, who is 42 and studied
architecture at Harvard, insisted that the building would be 19
feet 6 inches shorter than the 210-foot height allowed in the area
under city zoning regulations. William Coleman, the project
director of the Tamarkin Co., also noted that the red-brick bank _
on top of which the new building will be built _ will get a new
limestone facade to match.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Allen worries that if the building is built as planned,
it will make Carnegie Hill less an oasis for directors scouting
locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had so much affection for the city in my movies over the
years,'' Allen said. ``As far back as `Manhattan,' there was a
scene where I was walking with Diane Keaton. I was saying these
things should be landmarked. I always felt that way. I wrote that
into the script.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986), Allen said, ``We did this
architectural look around New York. The thing that struck me was
this soul-crushing noncontextual architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamarkin, who offered to meet with Allen, called the landmarks
commission hearing last month ``like having my head banged against
a wall for five hours continuously.'' Allen said it was no picnic
for him, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always an effort to perform live or speak before a
group,'' he said. ``I would rather have been at a Knicks game or at
home in my bedroom, writing, but there are certain things there is
no way out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it Allen's first encounter with the commission. The last
time, several years ago, he was cast in the role Tamarkin is
playing now, though on a much smaller scale. Allen wanted to build
a pergola on the terrace outside his penthouse, which was in the
Upper East Side Historic District.
</P>
<P>
   To win approval for the project, his workers had to hold up the
boards they wanted to erect while someone from the commission stood
in Central Park. The idea was to see whether the 15-foot-square
pergola would encroach on the view from the park.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's verdict? ``I had to modify the design,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen called the process a ``pain in the neck.'' But he added;
``My God, somebody's looking out for the city. That's as it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   So he hopes that the commission, which could issue a decision as
early as next month, will send Tamarkin back to the drawing board
to make his tower shorter and less massive. ``It just seems to be
like a no-brainer,'' Allen said. ``If you stop a cab driver in the
street, he'll say, `That's sad, it doesn't belong there, it will be
a monster thing jutting into the sky.' This doesn't require an
architectural genius.''

SPORTS COLUMN: EX-BOXER FIGHTS `FALSE IMPRESSION' OF CARTER MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in time for the Oscars, Denzel Washington rushes across the
ring and punches Joey Giardello silly, pounds his pale face into
raw hamburger. Denzel has the middleweight champion of the world
out on his feet, helpless against the ropes. But what do you expect
from white judges? Denzel loses the decision because he's black,
and you can see the rage and disillusion on his handsome face. It
will be a few more reels before he trusts America again, and then
only because a black teen-ager and his white Canadian friends make
justice prevail.
</P>
<P>
   What about poor Joey? At 69, he finally gets into a movie, and
Hollywood slaps him around as if he were just another pug out of
Brooklyn. He was the champ!
</P>
<P>
   He deserves his own movie. Here's the pitch: Bored with high
school, which he attended occasionally, 15-year-old Chubby Tilelli
goes Airborne using the name of a friend's cousin, Joseph
Giardello. In Army matches, the streetfighter becomes a boxer. In
1948, after his discharge, he moves to Philadelphia and becomes a
middleweight contender. He is arrested on an assault charge,
apparently because he's white; the theory at the time was that the
district attorney needed the black vote to become mayor. As soon as
he wins City Hall, he springs Giardello. Because there are always
rumors of mob involvement and his training regimen includes beer,
macaroni and not much running, Joey never quite gets the respect
that his speed, savvy and superb boxing skills deserve.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 14, 1964, at the Philadelphia Convention Hall, I covered
Giardello's title defense against Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, a
ferociously muscled 27-year-old who had won 20 of his 24 pro
fights, 13 by knockout. Carter had started boxing only three years
earlier. His manager, a deputy warden of the Hudson County (N.J.)
Jail, explained to me, ``He's been in college.'' But for all
Carter's anger at having spent so much of his life in jail, he was
cool, even ingratiating, during the buildup for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   In South Philly's dank and dirty Passyunk Avenue Gym, which was
Giardello territory, fans would call Carter ``monkey'' and ``bad
guy'' as he worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Once, someone yelled out, ``Joey's gonna knock you out,'' and
Carter smiled and said, ``Hope he does it early; hate to go 14
rounds and then get knocked out.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of that training session, locals were muttering that
with such a sense of humor he couldn't really be such a bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel brilliantly captures Carter's intense, edgy charm in
``The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   And mounts a far better attack in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   In the fight that really happened, Carter dominated the early
rounds, moving the quicker Giardello around the ring and landing a
few solid rights to the head that he did not follow up.
</P>
<P>
   Joey was staggered in the fourth and cut over the left eye,
probably from a butt. By the fifth round, however, even while
protecting the eye, Joey began to take control. At 34, with 96
victories in 126 fights over 16 years, Joey was a survivor. I gave
him seven of the next 10 rounds, with one even.
</P>
<P>
   Joey clearly deserved his unanimous decision. Afterward, he said
that Carter ``isn't a bad fighter'' and admitted that Carter had
him confused early and ``never fell for any of my feints.''
Carter's failing was not attacking inside; ``He just kept looking
for that one shot to knock me out,'' Giardello said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter subsequently agreed that he lost by not bringing the
fight to the champion. In ``Lazarus and the Hurricane,'' a book
written by two of the Canadians, Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton,
Carter was quoted as saying that he had consciously held back to
conserve his strength and stamina for the later rounds. The book,
which was one of the basic texts for the movie, had Carter losing
``a controversial split decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Giardello told me last week that he was shocked when he saw the
movie. I had called the Cherry Hill, N.J., phone number he gave me
36 years ago. He was in the same house with the same wife. Life was
good, he said. He talked about one of his sons, Carmine, who is
retarded, with the same rough-edged warmth I remembered; still
living at home, Carmine is ``the unofficial mayor of Cherry Hill.''
Giardello recently retired after 22 years as an inspector in the
state's Department of Weights and Measures.
</P>
<P>
   No hard feelings toward Carter, he said, and then he politely
asked if I would mind continuing the discussion with his lawyer,
George Bochetto of Philadelphia. They are demanding a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a `false-light' suit,''' explained Bochetto. ``The
movie presents as true certain facts that create a false
impression, in this case which demean Giardello and rob him of his
legacy. He is used to further the theme of the movie, that Carter's
life was destroyed because of racial prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Although technically he is not allowed to set forth specific
dollar amounts in the complaint to federal court, Bochetto is
asking for a substantial judgment that smelled like millions over
the phone. Also, he wants attached to the movie and to any video a
clear explanation of what really happened, including scenes from
the real fight.
</P>
<P>
   The nonboxing inaccuracies in the film, which maintains that a
racist system railroaded Carter into prison for a triple murder,
have been commented on at length; among them, the Canadians
apparently received credit that should have gone to the dogged
investigators, reporters and lawyers. The boxing inaccuracies would
seem minor by comparison, except for their key to Carter's
motivation: If the Giardello decision really ended any dream of
justice, it would then not be so far-fetched to believe that
Carter, in a racist rage, gunned down three whites.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does ``The Hurricane'' distort history, it also loses
control of its own contrived story.

<P>
   Sean Elliott has a decent chance of stepping onto the court of
the Alamodome in San Antonio on Tuesday night, marking his first
appearance this season. Becoming the first professional athlete
known to resume his career after a kidney transplant, the Spurs'
32-year-old swingman will most likely receive a prolonged,
emotional ovation.
</P>
<P>
   But after that endearing moment, Elliott and the defending
National Basketball Association champions will have to negotiate
the rest of their turbulent season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just tried to be as objective and observant of Sean's
situation as I can possibly be, because I don't know what's going
to take place,'' Coach Gregg Popovich said by telephone on Friday.
``I don't know what certain players are going to think, how certain
players are going to react, what it's going to do to our flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or what it's going to do to the consistency we have going,
which, in my opinion, isn't much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs face the Knicks Sunday in Madison Square Garden for
the first time since the finals; the two teams met in San Antonio
in January, and the Spurs won easily, 96-83.
</P>
<P>
   Last June when they last walked off the Garden floor, the Spurs
did so triumphantly _ carrying home the Lawrence O'Brien
championship trophy to San Antonio. Tim Duncan and his teammates
not only gave their city its first title by beating the Knicks in
five games; they gave the post-Jordan NBA a dignified and
professional bunch of torch-carriers.
</P>
<P>
   How their world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, San Antonio is trailing a proud, aging Utah
team in the Midwest Division. Almost unanimous preseason favorites
to repeat, the Spurs (40-22) are struggling to find cohesiveness as
the Lakers and the Trail Blazers vie for home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who was making a legitimate claim as the game's dominant
player, is having another superlative season. But the maturing of
Shaquille O'Neal and the explosion of Vince Carter have taken up
more of the viewing public's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Elie and Jerome Kersey, who is starting at small forward,
have had major trouble adjusting to the new,
no-grabbing-and-chucking defensive rules. Minor dissension off the
floor and major discussion of roles and minutes on the floor have
also tested the chemistry of a team without turmoil a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of that is my doing,'' Popovich said, referring to the
different rotations he has used, ``and part of it is the fact that
we haven't found anybody to step up consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began with the loss of Elliott. Unknown to his teammates,
Elliott, who had kidney problems earlier in his career, suffered
from worsening renal function during much of last season. Without a
transplant, doctors said he was bound for dialysis treatments.
Elliott's brother, Noel, became a donor and underwent surgery with
Sean last September.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott began the long road back. He was hospitalized in
December after complaining of fatigue, and has admitted that
recovery has been much slower than he had thought. Despite the
struggle to build up his cardiovascular strength, he began
practicing with the team regularly in February.
</P>
<P>
   His brother's kidney was surgically inserted behind Sean's
pelvic bone on his right side, meaning the organ has a
much-stronger natural shield than his abdomen would provide. He has
already signed a waiver exonerating the Spurs from any medical
liability should a kidney-related injury occur.
</P>
<P>
   Many coaches walk a fine line with players rehabilitating
injuries. On one hand, their regard for the player as a person
forces them to consider the ramifications of a comeback. On the
other, they need victories. In Elliott's case, Popovich said the
latter has not entered his thought process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even an iota,'' he said. ``I could care less. We're going
to finish wherever we finish. I would not be bringing him back if I
thought there was a chance of danger. I've been very adamant about
that. It's taken all this time to get me to where the doctors have
convinced me they don't see any more risk in him than anybody else
out on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``After watching him for the last month, I tend to agree. He's
got no pads. Nobody gives him any quarter. He just goes out there
and does what everybody else does. It's just a matter that maybe
his body can't compete for as long a time as everybody else's body.
But he's in a lot better condition and shape _ medically and
physically _ than he was last year during the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich gets rueful when he thinks about what's happened since
his team won a title. ``I think we're a very good basketball team,
but we're definitely not as talented without Sean,'' he said. ``And
it is a shame that they were not able to continue on a roll and
come back and defend as the same team. I feel badly that these guys
were not able to do that. Having said that, tough. Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has to be as good as they can possibly be. We're
still very confident that we can give anybody a lot of trouble and
do well. Now bringing Sean back, I think it exacerbates the
situation. Who knows what kind of rotation we're going to have? I'd
be blowing smoke to say, `Well, having consistency in the rotation
for playoff time doesn't mean anything.' We're going to have be
much more fortunate than we were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they repeat or not, he is happy for Elliott. ``He's
really challenge-oriented,'' Popovich said. ``I think everyone has
forgotten that for two years in a row he could not play because he
had knee operations. It's been like two continuous years of rehab.
And he played a year and now another season of rehab. So this guy
has been through an awful lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``These challenges are something he's accepted. Because of who
he is, he's decided he wants to overcome them. Frankly, I don't
think he's concerned with whether he plays 10 minutes a game or 30
minutes a game. He wants to be able to say, `I came back, I did it,
I beat it and I contributed to my team.'''

<P>
   The Marketing of Carter
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's association with David Falk was mainly
responsible for Falk's reputation's as the NBA's best-known agent.
Though he only charges his clients hourly, Lon Babby's stature grew
significantly when Grant Hill and Tim Duncan hired the
Washington-based attorney to negotiate their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter, the game's next great economic force, is planning
on searching for a new representative this summer, and whomever he
chooses may significantly alter the league's landscape and a
certain agent's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has suspended ties with his current agent, Tank Black,
pending the outcome of Black's criminal trial. The agent has been
charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with allegedly
defrauding National Football League clients out of millions of
dollars and also mishandling Carter's accounts. The players
association last week prohibited Black from representing any NBA
players during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although other representatives of Black's firm have continued to
pursue endorsement deals for Carter _ including a possible contract
with Ford Motor Co.'s Canadian outlet, according to Bloomberg News
_ the Toronto Raptors forward has indicated he will talk to
potential suitors after Aug. 1. About to sever ties with Puma,
Carter will most likely sign a new shoe contract in the next year
with either Nike, Adidas or Reebok.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever agent he chooses will assume the role of immediate
power broker in sports-business circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd certainly be an exciting person to represent,'' Babby
said. ``I saw that he doesn't want to talk to anyone before Aug. 1.
Whether I'm foolish or not by adhering to that, I don't know. There
are runners and go-betweens at all levels. But I won't approach him
until then.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill continues to stick to his original premise regarding
free agency. He'll decide after the season. But after Coach Alvin
Gentry's firing last week, more and more signs point to Hill
leaving the Pistons if Detroit cannot turn its fortunes around
quickly. Hill will almost certainly exercise an option to become a
free agent in his contract this summer. While he can sign on for a
single season in Detroit and receive a deal in the neighborhood of
$80 million next summer based on his seven-year experience level,
Hill can also ask the Pistons to field offers for him and exercise
a sign-and-trade deal this summer. Unless the franchise can lure a
high-profile coach to Detroit and solve its problems at point guard
and center _ or at least give the appearance of a championship
contender _ Hill will be gone by 2001 at the latest. ... John
Starks, sent home by the Chicago Bulls until his request to become
a free agent is presented to a grievance arbitrator, will have his
case heard on Tuesday. The feeling among several observers is that
Starks may be declared a free agent, but that the arbitrator will
probably not make the decision retroactive to March 1 _ the day a
player must be on a team's roster to compete in the playoffs. In
short, Starks may get his wish to leave Chicago but probably won't
be able to play in the playoffs this season.

INQUIRY CREATES AURA OF DOUBT AROUND DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To his supporters, Dr. Ehud Arbit is a brilliant
surgeon and a humanitarian, the one who takes on the hardest cases
when hope has been lost. To the New York State Health Department,
he is dangerously incompetent, working in operating rooms where
careless errors go unchecked and patients face grave risks.
</P>
<P>
   The state received complaints that Arbit, the chief of
neurosurgery at Staten Island University Hospital, had operated in
January on the wrong side of a patient's brain _ for the second
time in five years _ and learned of other accusations that his
mistakes had left patients maimed or paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, state officials forced him to surrender his license
last month, pending an investigation, and fined the hospital
$80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit, who lost his post as chief of neurosurgery at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1995 after he was accused of
operating on the wrong side of a patient's brain, contends that he
has been unfairly haunted by the earlier case and victimized this
time by a conspiracy led by his colleagues. But he conceded that he
could not identify those who had complained to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malicious remarks have been made to hospital administrators
and the Department of Health about me that are completely false,''
Arbit said in a recent interview. His view is echoed by dozens of
his colleagues at the hospital, who have sprung to his defense in
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Staten Island hospital are defending Arbit's
practice and have accused the state Health Department of passing
judgment before thoroughly investigating. But state health
officials say their inquiry has involved many interviews and has
led investigators to conclude that the doctor's patients are
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arbit's case is one of the clearest examples of the state
Health Department's ambition to spotlight cases for disciplining
doctors at a time when President Clinton is urging more disclosure
of medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's swift action is a striking departure from what has
traditionally been viewed as a lumbering, cautious investigative
process that some say leans overboard toward the medical
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   And its treatment of Arbit has prompted doctors and medical
officials to question whether the state health commissioner, Dr.
Antonia C. Novello, is on a crusade that might have overlooked the
internal disputes now becoming apparent at the Staten Island
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The state's continuing investigation may well uncover answers
that bridge the wide disparity between those who question Arbit's
surgical expertise and those who paint him as the victim of an
out-of-control professional rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   But his case also carries broader implications, for it has
damaged the credibility of the hospital, which is 10 years into an
aggressive, multimillion-dollar effort to stop the growing
population of Staten Island from defecting to Manhattan for complex
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community's confidence in this institution has been
undermined,'' Rick J. Varone, hospital president, said. Morale
among the staff members has plummeted, he said, and the doctor whom
Arbit blames for his downfall now says he will no longer take his
cases to the hospital, which sees about 28,000 patients a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Health's intentions were 100 percent pure,''
Varone said of its initial inquiries, adding that before the state
became involved, the hospital had investigated Arbit's record and
decided that the accusations were unfounded. ``The difference
between me and the state is that I gave him his day in court,''
Varone said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Staten Island University Hospital, like hundreds of other
community hospitals around the country, has tried mightily to rise
to the level of a large, academic medical center. It has begun
clinical programs that a decade ago were unheard of in a hospital
its size _ a burn center and a microsurgery unit _ and it soon will
have a major heart center. It has built up existing programs like
cancer care and neurosurgery, hiring prestigious specialists and
investing heavily in equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To many health experts, these expansions pose daunting risks for
smaller hospitals. Support services for sophisticated new programs
in areas like cancer care and heart surgery might be substandard,
and existing doctors and other medical staff might lack the
experience and credentials of the department heads recruited to
supervise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To reach the level of top-level hospitals, you can't just
bring in one big name and expect that all will go with it,'' said
Robert I. Field, the director of the graduate program on health
policy at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. ``The
trend now is to concentrate high-tech services into centers of
excellence and leave community hospitals in their appropriate
niche. So I think this is a risky strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In an extensive interview, Varone tried to put the hospital's
history and growth into perspective. He said he became president in
1989, when the hospital was struggling to compete with others in
Manhattan and New Jersey. After a merger with Richmond Memorial
Hospital, Varone set into motion a plan to build programs to keep
Staten Island patients from seeking treatment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Government reimbursement levels for patient care have dropped
ominously, partly because of managed care, so the hospital embarked
on an obvious course to find money sources, and surgery specialties
generate income. Further, Varone said, he was upset that 22 percent
of the patients there were traipsing to Manhattan for procedures he
thought should be offered by the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Buying equipment was easy. Attracting high-profile doctors was a
problem. ``Getting physicians here is difficult,'' Varone said.
``They tended not to want to be at the community level. They wanted
to be in an academic center.''
</P>
<P>
   So he offered doctors fat compensation packages and the chance
to build departments from scratch. He recruited a new head of
surgery from New York Hospital, who brought in a chief for plastic
surgery. Cancer and radiology experts came as well. ``Plastic
surgery cases were up 82 percent last year,'' said Dr. Arman
Kasabian, the new chief of the department. ``Everything they have
promised me they gave me.''
</P>
<P>
   Neurosurgery _ a small, lucrative field where the brightest
stars attract a huge percentage of the patients _ was trickier. The
existing department could not compete with departments like those
at New York University or Mount Sinai, Varone said.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, Varone received and acted on an attractive offer.
Rabbi Jacob Spitzer of Brooklyn, who has been a health care
advocate for Orthodox Jews and often gives them health care advice
and referrals, introduced him to Arbit after he had been dismissed
at Sloan-Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Rabbi Spitzer recommended him was the only way
Dr. Arbit got through the door,'' said Varone, whose hospital has
cared for an large number of Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi also cornered the state Health Department's deputy
commissioner at a breakfast meeting in Manhattan and urged him to
be thorough in his investigation of Arbit's conduct. Spitzer also
sent a letter of support for Arbit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer had helped other displaced doctors at Staten Island. Dr.
Steven Swersky and his partner, Dr. Robert Klinger, both
obstetricians disciplined by the state and fired from Beth Israel
Medical Center in Manhattan, had a strong patient base in Brooklyn,
and Spitzer said he lobbied for them.
</P>
<P>
   Varone conceded that the timing of Spitzer's recommendation for
Arbit caused him trepidation. The brain surgery mistake at
Sloan-Kettering had been front page news. The state had mildly
disciplined Arbit, placing him on a year's probation. Others at
Staten Island had reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time talking, and I admired him greatly,''
Varone said. ``He was tarnished by Memorial and he can't walk away
from that, but I went through months of evaluating him. He was
someone worthy of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and as a human being he
was terrific. It was an agonizing process. And one looks back and
wonders if this Memorial thing follows him forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Varone said he decided to hire Arbit in 1995. By 1998, Varone
replaced Dr. Victor Ho with Arbit as head of the neurosurgery
department. By Varone's account, those of other doctors and Arbit,
the hospital staff did not welcome Arbit. His promotion, by many
accounts, worsened an uneasy situation.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit recalled one of his first operations at the hospital, in
which he placed the patient in a position that colleagues in the
operating room found unfamiliar. With the patient unconscious and
the doctor scrubbed and ready to go, the anesthesiologist halted
the procedure, Arbit said, arguing that the position was dangerous.
Arbit said he had to go to administrators to get clearance as the
surgical team stood by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done multiple operations in this position,'' he said.
``I had to convince them this was sound.''
</P>
<P>
   By Arbit's account, he was relentlessly badgered by colleagues,
a situation Varone confirmed. ``There was a faction of harmful
people who instigated against him,'' Varone said. ``I can't for the
life of me figure out why. The environment for him was difficult.
He has been undermined by a bitter colleague, but I don't know if
he is the one who created the furor,'' he said, referring to Ho.
</P>
<P>
   The state investigation derives from complaints from various
sources, although Arbit blames Ho's office. About a dozen other
current and former hospital doctors, most of whom would speak only
on the condition of anonymity, said that Ho complained about them
relentlessly to hospital administrators, engaged in petty antics
like refusing them equipment from his operating room, and made life
unpleasant in the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor Ho is very abusive in the OR,'' said Dr. Barbara
Minkowitz, a pediatric orthopedist who once assisted with Ho's
former partners and works in an operating room next to his.
``People tiptoe around him so they don't have to deal with his
personality.'' Another surgeon who left the hospital said, ``I
didn't think my career would be helped working with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho refused to be interviewed. His lawyer, Robert Asher, would
not say whether he had instigated the latest investigation of
Arbit. ``Dr. Ho will categorically deny that he has ever done
anything except for the betterment of patients,'' Asher said.
``People at the hospital don't like him because he is a
perfectionist. And that can be seen by the fact that the department
went downhill after he was replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Responding to accusations that Ho frequently criticized his
colleagues' work, Asher said: ``If he's made complaints, so what?
It is the duty of a physician to inform the state about other
physicians that are not acting appropriately. If he has _ and we
are not conceding he has _ he is on the side of truth, justice and
the American way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nonna Datiashvili, an internist who has admitting privileges
at the hospital, decided to take her husband to Arbit to have a
brain tumor excised. Nurses tried to steer her to Ho, she said.
``The nurses don't like him,'' she said of Arbit. ``I think the
stigma of his past is huge. No one opened their heart to him.''
Asher said that the fact the nurses and anesthesiologists disliked
Arbit underscored the necessity of the Health Department's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the hospital began pushing Ho to be on call for
emergencies, a step he has resisted since he came to the hospital,
and to submit his cases to hospital officials for review, as part
of a hospital agreement with the state to subject all neurosurgery
cases to institutional checks. Ho told hospital officials on
Thursday that he would no longer practice at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Arbit's troubles became a hospital concern in early February,
when Varone ran into another doctor who he said looked concerned.
``I asked him what was wrong and he told me, `We may have a
wrong-side case with Dr. Arbit.' I told him I wanted all the
information on it by the next day and that if what he was telling
me was true, he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbit was called in the next day, Varone said, adding that he
had all intentions of suspending him from practice. Instead, Arbit,
using X-rays and textbooks, demonstrated that the surgery was not
mishandled, Varone said, because the X-rays depicted a tumor that
had grown into both sides of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next allegation by another anesthesiologist was that he
had made someone quadriplegic,'' Varone said. ``We went up to see
the patient, and the patient was walking. I was ready to blow him
out but I let him have his day. I don't know why the allegations
were made, but they may be a reflection on the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But word of the brain surgery and other cases had already made
its way to state officials, although the identities of those who
complained have not been disclosed. By early February, the
Department of Health had begun its investigation, and Arbit
surrendered his license on the 18th. Varone insists that every case
the state accused Arbit of mishandling was investigated internally
by the hospital and found to be without error.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Department disputes Varone's version. Its
spokesman, John Signor, said that 30 interviews conducted by state
investigators corroborated the wrong-side-of-the-brain procedure
and other errors, including that of a patient left partly
paralyzed, another who underwent surgery to have a plate attached
to her spinal cord along the neck and suffered complications
because the plate was installed incorrectly, and others who were,
according to the report, badly injured during surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We interviewed doctors, nurses, quality-assurance staff,
physician assistants, employees relevant to the complaints,''
Signor said. He added that the hospital's investigation, according
to the state's review of records, consisted merely of interviews
with Arbit.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases have marred Staten Island University Hospital's
reputation in the last year. In September, it agreed to reimburse
the state Medicaid program $45 million for improper bills it had
submitted over five years, and to provide $39 million in free care
for indigent patients in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Datiashvili said she believed that Arbit was committed to
improving conditions at the hospital, to raising the quality of
medical care there. Others echo her sentiments, and more than a
dozen of Arbit's patients have described his lifesaving care.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Arbit seems a quiet, pleasant physician mystified by
the new accusations against him. He said he was innocent of every
medical error cited. In the Sloan-Kettering case, for example, the
state found that he operated on the healthy right side of the brain
of Rajeswari Ayyappan, the 59-year-old mother of a famous Indian
film star, Sridevi Ayyappan, instead of her left side where a
cancerous tumor was situated.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Arbit blames ``systems problems,'' adding that the
staff did not bring the right patient's X-rays to the operating
room. In at least one case he is accused of mishandling at Staten
Island, he said, he was only aiding another doctor who was
foundering.
</P>
<P>
   His detractors say he is simply unable to accept his own
shortcomings, which they argue are serious. ``I think that from a
purely technical standpoint, he is thought to be a good surgeon,''
a member of the Sloan-Kettering staff said. ``But there is a whole
judgment piece, a blind spot. He doesn't see the whole patient. He
just sees tumors.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Department has demanded that the Staten Island
hospital present a plan of correction for each of the 40 violations
it has cited, and the hospital said it had taken several steps to
do so. For example, the state said that the hospital used physician
assistants inappropriately in surgery, and for now, they have all
been removed from the neurosurgery operating room. The hospital has
asked outside medical experts to review its care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am prepared to put this institution through greater
scrutiny,'' Varone said. ``This whole process will only make us
stronger. If we are held to an even higher standard, that is OK
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   And as to whether Arbit is a bad doctor out of control or a
victim of a vindictive colleague and overzealous Health Department?
``The truth will come out,'' Varone insisted. ``It is like a plane
accident. It may take time. But it will come out.''

A WHITNEY DROPS MUSEUM SUPPORT OVER NEW SHOW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wyo.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Angry over a planned exhibit at the Whitney Museum
linking Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other political figures to the
Nazis, Marylou Whitney, the widow of Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney,
said Saturday that she had withdrawn her financial support of the
museum and quit its national fund-raising committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney said that a work by Hans Haacke, a German-born New York
artist, planned for the Whitney's 2000 Biennial opening on March
23, would serve to belittle the Holocaust, politicize art and
violate the principles on which the Whitney was founded by her late
mother-in-law, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gertrude would roll over in her grave,'' she said of the
Haacke work _ a wall of garbage cans with speakers blaring the
sound of marching jackboots, a reproduction of the First Amendment
and, in a medieval typescript favored by the Nazis, quotations from
Giuliani and others, including Sen. Jesse Helms, Patrick Buchanan
and the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   News last week of the forthcoming exhibit and the Haacke work,
called ``Sanitation,'' recalled the fury over the First Amendment
issues raised by the ``Sensation'' show at the Brooklyn Museum of
Art last fall, when the mayor attacked some of the art as ``sick''
and tried to withhold city subsidies from the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney, which receives most of its funds from private and
corporate sources, was confronted with harsh criticism from the
Anti-Defamation League, which charged that the Haacke work
trivialized the Holocaust. Giuliani called the Haacke work
offensive, but said that the city would take no action.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Whitney, did not respond
immediately to messages left at the museum Saturday. Haacke, who
lives in Manhattan, was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, in a telephone interview from her home in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., said she had informed Anderson on Friday of her
decision to withdraw her support from the museum, which is on
Madison Avenue at 75th Street.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had told him she was perturbed with the Haacke work
itself, but was even more upset with the museum for what she said
was a violation of the trust Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney had placed
in the institution she founded 70 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gertrude wanted to help American artists,'' Whitney said.
``That's why she called it the Whitney Museum of American Art. It's
not supposed to be for any foreign artists. I'm upset with the
museum for going against Gertrude's principles and I'm terribly
upset with this work. It's in such bad taste. And the museum should
not be used politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, whose family has been a bulwark of support for the
museum, said she planned to donate $1 million to the Whitney this
year but had decided to give it instead to the Whitney Gallery of
Western Art in Cody, Wyo., which was established by her husband on
land donated by his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said she had resigned from the national
committee that raises almost half of the museum's $20 million
budget, a committee she joined more than 35 years ago. While she
refused to give details, she said that many of the committee's 30
members were also upset over the planned exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, who was quoted by The New York Post on Saturday as
saying that the museum's name ought to be changed from the Whitney
to ``The Sensation,'' drew back from that suggestion. ``I didn't
really mean that,'' said the 73-year-old heiress to a $100 million
fortune built on railroads and oil.
</P>
<P>
   From its founding in 1930, the Whitney was financed almost
entirely by the family _ first by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who
left it $2.5 million of her $11 million estate, and after her death
in 1942 by her daughter, Flora Whitney Miller. Since the 1960s,
much of the museum's financing has come from earned income and from
private and corporate donations and grants from foundations, the
National Endowment of the Arts and the state and city of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney said she was aware that her criticisms of the Haacke
work might ``turn him into a martyr,'' and ``cause people to line
up for six blocks to see this trash.'' Because of the controversy,
huge crowds turned out to see Chris Ofili's work at the Brooklyn
Museum, which included a rendering of the Virgin Mary that used
pornographic cutouts and elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitney said she had no choice. ``I just feel you have to
stand up for what you believe,'' she said. ``I believe that
Gertrude wanted this museum to be something wonderful and
educational, but when they put up things you wouldn't want your
children or grandchildren to see. ...''

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The baseball season began for Derek Jeter inside
Zudema Gymnasium, where he fielded ground balls that skidded across
the hardwood floor, and took batting practice against the pitching
machine at Kalamazoo Central High School.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's cold lingers in Michigan and Jeter played 20 to 30
games in the spring, then more in summer leagues, but not nearly as
many as youngsters from the South or the West Coast or the
countries of Latin America _ where most of his professional peers
began playing baseball. In spite of the experience lost to the
Midwest climate, he has established himself as one of the game's
finest players, and others feel that with additional experience he
will inevitably improve even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before his career is over, he's going to be recognized as one
of the best who ever played the game _ I really believe that,''
said Tim Raines, who has played 21 seasons in the big leagues.
``You're talking about a guy who batted .349. It's hard to believe
he can get better, but I really believe he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines and others who have watched Jeter, the Yankees shortstop,
play daily in recent years believe there are very specific
adjustments he can make to his hitting, his fielding, his base
running.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is an aggressive hitter, sometimes with an elementary
approach: He makes up his mind about swinging before a pitch is
thrown. ``Regardless of where it is,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressiveness has served him well. If the pitcher is intent
on getting ahead in the count and his offering is something Jeter
can handle, then Jeter can do great damage. But if the pitch is
badly out of the strike zone, or if it is a breaking ball that is
moving away from the strike zone, and Jeter does not recognize
either, he can be fooled badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going good, when you're in a groove, it's easy to
lay off of it,'' Jeter said. ``It's not often during the season
that you're that zoned in. You tend to get yourself out. You say to
yourself, `OK, I'm going to jump on the first pitch,' and you end
up swinging at a bad pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, 25, is such a good hitter that even when fooled, he is
capable of hitting a pitch just above his shoes or off the outside
corner and dumping a single into right field. But he is also apt to
swing at a bad pitch and ground out to second base. To Raines,
Jeter should aspire to more than the groundout or the soft single
so early in the count.
</P>
<P>
   Raines believes that what Jeter will eventually do is look for
one particular type of pitch in one particular part of the strike
zone early in the count, and look to drive it. And if he does not
get that one pitch, then he should let it pass, whether it's a ball
or a strike. ``Look for location and do damage,'' Raines said, in
summation. ``The difference between he and Nomar Garciaparra'' _
the Boston shortstop _ ``is that Garciaparra goes to the plate
looking for a pitch in a certain area and he takes advantage of it.
Jeter will make contact, but he won't do the type of damage he
could.''
</P>
<P>
   The patient approach Raines advocates may be dangerous for a
hitter who does not do well when he is behind in the count, someone
who is overmatched when he has two strikes against him. But Jeter
ranks among the better hitters in baseball when he is behind in the
count. According to numbers compiled by Stats Inc., he hit .314
last year in that situation, compared with the American League
composite average of .216. He has the ability to support a patient
approach.
</P>
<P>
   And Jeter's aptitude would also allow him to be more patient. He
is not susceptible to the same pattern of pitching once he falls
behind in the count, as many hitters are. A pitcher cannot get
ahead in the count and then retire him by merely throwing breaking
balls, or by jamming him with inside fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into a series against the Yankees with a plan to pitch
to Jeter,'' said Brad Ausmus, the Detroit catcher, ``and you might
get him out in that first game pitching to that hole you think
you've seen. But by the last game of the series, that hole isn't
there anymore because he will make the adjustments.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Jeter frets about his high number of strikeouts, his former
teammate Luis Sojo said _ ``He'll say, `Dang, I've got to be
leading the league.''' But Raines, the hitting coach Chris
Chambliss and manager Joe Torre do not want him to sacrifice his
aggressiveness at the plate merely to decrease his strikeout total.
He is undoubtedly improving as a hitter, his average increasing
from .314 in his rookie year to .349 last year, his slugging
percentage rising 122 points in that time. Chambliss sees him
checking his swing more often, recognizing bad pitches more
readily.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Randolph, the Yankees' infield coach, believes Jeter is a
good shortstop. He remembers the staff meetings when Jeter was on
the verge of breaking into the major leagues, and the doubts others
expressed about how long it would take for Jeter to develop
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeter has committed only 23 errors over the last two seasons
and he has made dramatic progress on fielding balls to his backhand
side and charging balls hit in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing that I haven't seen in baseball in all my
years,'' said Sojo, mentioning Jeter's ability to field a ball hit
in front of him and throw to first on the run. ``This guy is so
tall, but he charges the ball with two hands and throws the guy
out. Two hands _ you don't know how hard that is, and he does it so
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph thinks that Jeter could anticipate better on defense,
understand better where a hitter is most likely to hit the ball.
``And that comes with time, and in knowing the hitters,'' Randolph
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter has made a spectacular play in the shortstop hole several
times, fielding the ball to his backhand side, then leaping and
throwing and cutting down the runner at first. Randolph calls it
the Y.A. Tittle play, in honor of the former Giants quarterback,
and most of the time, Randolph and Sojo believe Jeter will be
better off just planting his right foot, setting his body and
throwing, rather than going airborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great arm,'' Sojo said. ``I'd say to him: `C'mon,
you've got to use your arm. Throw the ball.' When he jumps on that
play in the hole and the guy going to first is a good runner,
you're not going to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jeter joined the Yankees, his fundamentals were ingrained
so deeply in his defense that he often tried to reach everything
with two hands, including balls hit to his right, and he would
reach awkwardly. Randolph does not want him to stop moving his feet
and try to reach everything with one hand, but he does think Jeter
can trust his hands more than he does, and be a little more fluid,
like a Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had just 19 stolen bases last season, sometimes refraining
from running in order to keep the first-base hole open _ the first
baseman had to hold Jeter _ for the left-handed-hitting Paul
O'Neill. Torre would like to see Jeter run more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could steal 40, 50 bases, I think,'' Torre said. ``But he
plays so much, and that wears you out. In that regard, I'm not
going to push him to do that, but I certainly want him to not be
afraid to make a mistake on the bases. That's one area he's not
really as comfortable and confident as I think he should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter said: ``Base stealing is often the same as defense _
you've got to get into a groove, and once you get into a groove,
it's a lot easier. One year in the minors, I got into a groove
early on and I kept going and going and going.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jeter amassed another 15 seasons at his current rate of
success, he would approach 4,000 hits and 2,000 runs scored. But
there is room for improvement.

STAR FRENCH CHEF IS HEADING TO MANHATTAN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alain Ducasse, the celebrated French chef who has
restaurants bearing his name and three Michelin stars in Paris and
Monte Carlo, is about to open his first restaurant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse's restaurant, Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, will
replace Les Celebrites, a small but luxurious Art Deco dining room
in the Essex House hotel on Central Park South, which has been
closed for nearly two years. During that time, there were almost as
many rumors rippling through the food world about the fate of the
room as about Ducasse's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse, who arrived Friday in New York, said he expected the
restaurant to open before June 21 after about $1.5 million in
renovations. Ducasse said he would expand the kitchen and make
cosmetic changes in the 60-seat dining room to make it lighter,
fresher and more contemporary. The paintings by celebrities like
Elke Sommer, Phyllis Diller and Pierce Brosnan, for which the room
was famous, are being removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be colorful and very high-fashion but not as serious
or stiffly classic as Paris,'' Ducasse said. He said that a famous
designer, whom he would not name, was creating uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   As is the practice at many top restaurants in Paris _ but not in
New York _ Alain Ducasse at the Essex House will be open Monday
through Friday only, with just one seating for dinner, making it
likely to become the city's most exclusive restaurant. Lunch will
be served two days a week. Ducasse is also planning to offer
cooking seminars, in a kind of club, on weekday mornings when the
restaurant does not serve lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an argument that says you want all the richest talent
here in New York,'' said Drew Nieporent, who owns and manages
several New York restaurants. ``There's a saturation of restaurants
in New York now, but Ducasse is not going to do huge volume so I
think he'll pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse said the chef would be Didier Elena, a 31-year-old who
has worked with him for 12 years. His wine director, Gerard
Margeon, will oversee a list of what Ducasse called the ``great
wines of the world.'' Another 13 members of his staff will also
come to New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, just after Ducasse, who was based in Monte Carlo, took
over what had been Joel Robuchon's restaurant in Paris, skeptics
wondered how he would manage to juggle the responsibilities of
running two top caliber restaurants nearly 600 miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   He skillfully put any doubts to rest, and since then has added a
growing list of projects. Like Paul Bocuse, one of the first modern
celebrity chefs, whose renown Ducasse's now rivals, he is not
daunted by running a big inventory of restaurants, despite a
constant rumble of criticism from those who insist he has spread
himself too thin.
</P>
<P>
   He opened Spoon Food &AMP; Wine, a stylish but informal place in
Paris, which now has a branch in Mauritius and is to soon have
others in Tokyo and in Ian Schrager's new Sanderson Hotel in
London. For now, he is discounting rumors that there will be a
Spoon at the Royalton in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His Bar et Boeuf, a kind of surf and turf restaurant in Monte
Carlo, just received a Michelin star, and Il Cortile, an Italian
restaurant in Paris for which he is the consultant, also has a
Michelin star. He has two country inns in Provence, La Bastide de
Moustiers and L'Hostellerie de l'Abbaye de la Celle. He decided not
to pursue a restaurant in Las Vegas, in a small version of the
Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   So why did he finally decide to add a trans-Atlantic commute?
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy answer is that I wanted to give it a try,'' he said,
adding that he regarded New York as one of the Everests of his
profession because, like Paris, it is the most spectacular
restaurant city with the most discriminating public in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Essex House restaurant would be the last one named
Alain Ducasse.
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse is not the first Michelin three-star chef to set up shop
in New York. Alain Senderens and Louis Outhier preceded him. But
the restaurants run by these chefs, also in hotels but on a
consulting basis, did not bear their names and the chefs eventually
severed their ties with them. Ducasse's arrangement is different,
more long-term and with greater involvement.
</P>
<P>
   While he has not set a schedule, he said he would be in New York
``as often as necessary.'' New Yorkers can certainly expect to see
him in August, when the Paris restaurant closes for vacation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the food he is planning, he said it would be extremely
high-end but different from both the luxuriously classic fare
served in Paris and the more Mediterranean cooking featured in
Monte Carlo. Like other chefs with multiple restaurant projects,
including Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who is based in New York, he
has managed to devise a distinctive cuisine for each property.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to show off American-grown products, which impress
him so much that he spent Saturday morning in the Greenmarket in
Union Square and is working on a book about American ingredients,
``Harvesting Excellence,'' with a French writer, Jean-Christian
Agid.
</P>
<P>
   The menu has not been worked out. ``The actual menu is the last
thing I think of,'' he said. New York restaurant goers who would
like to book a table, regardless of what's on the menu, may call
(212) 265-7300 starting Wednesday. Reservations are not being
taken, but a list of those interested is being assembled.

OUTSIDE THE BRONX, A PLACE ON THE FIELD

<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ He's a utility player; he can't play every day.
</P>
<P>
   With those words, heard so often in baseball, a player can be
doomed to a career of backup duty. The label is especially damaging
when it is applied early in a player's career, preventing him from
ever getting a chance to prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had passed that point already,'' Homer Bush said the
other day. ``There were a lot of people out there saying I couldn't
play every day. I think pretty much 90 percent of the people
figured I couldn't play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years older than Bush, Randy Velarde had endured a similar
experience as a major-league infielder. He was good enough to back
up at second base, shortstop and third, even play a little
outfield, but he was not a candidate for a regular job.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde and Bush both served in that utility role for the
Yankees. Both also left the Yankees and discovered there was life
after _ as starters, no less, both at second base. Bush had no
choice in his departure; the Yankees traded him to Toronto. Velarde
left as a free agent, lured by the California Angels' promise of a
steady job.
</P>
<P>
   The utility infielders, however, departed with one difference:
Bush had already earned a World Series ring; Velarde left just
before he could have had one, if not more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the past, but yeah, it did hurt,'' Velarde said
recently at the Oakland Athletics' camp in Phoenix. ``The first
year after I left, they won the world championship. There were a
lot of tears of joy and tears of sadness. I wasn't there to be part
of it after spending so much of my career there, but at the same
time I was happy for all the guys who were able to be part of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde, acquired as a minor-leaguer in a 1987 trade, played for
the Yankees for parts of the next three seasons, then for full
seasons from '90 through '95. In only three of those seasons did he
play 100 or more games. Bush, an extra in the trade that brought
Hideki Irabu to New York in 1997, played in a total of 55 games for
the Yankees in '97 and '98, and appeared in the 1998 World Series.
He wasn't around for last year's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed but satisfied at the same time,'' said
Bush, 27, who went to Toronto with David Wells for Roger Clemens.
``Disappointed because it's like, man, I could be there, satisfied
because I got the opportunity to play every day. I knew I had to
give up something to get this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the choice between the World Series and a regular job
poses a dilemma, Bush acknowledged, then added: ``But you really
can't make a living being a utility player. I have a wife, a
daughter, a mom who I want to do something for, and I just couldn't
do it being a utility player. When I think about all that, I accept
what has happened. I wish them the best. I know they wish me the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde, despite his ability to overcome a series of disabling
injuries and become a regular, still appears to have some regrets
about his decision to leave the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offered more money to stay there, but it was as a
utility player,'' he said. ``I had been doing that for nine years.
If hindsight was what it was, I would have stayed there because the
next year they won the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever inclination he might have had to stay was eroded by
the departures of Buck Showalter as manager, Don Mattingly to
retirement and Mike Stanley to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were going to be decent, but not world
championship caliber,'' said Velarde, who at 33 years old did not
have long to gain credibility as a starter. ``To Mr. Steinbrenner's
credit, he went out and got players who made them world champions.
I wanted to go back, but here was a three-year offer on the table
from the Angels to be their second baseman. I saw it as an
opportunity of a lifetime, to be able to go out there and establish
myself as an everyday player, to prove I could play every day. I
was never given that opportunity in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde still doesn't have a World Series ring, but his career
has taken a remarkable turn. A .268 career hitter, he played the
most he ever has (156 games) last season, amassed 200 hits and
batted .317 with the Angels and the Athletics. The Athletics say it
was his arrival that solidified their lineup and kept them in the
division race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, starting 127 games for the Blue Jays, had a remarkable
season in his own right, batting .320 and stealing 32 bases.
Interestingly, though, he said the statistics were deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt that I really didn't play as well as my numbers
showed,'' Bush said. ``I felt I got a lot of breaks on infield
hits. I feel there's a lot of room for improvement, like with my
on-base percentage. A .320 batting average is pretty good for a guy
in his first year as a regular, but I don't think I hit a solid
.320. I think I basically ran .280 and hit 40 points.'' Bush's
on-base percentage was .353.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Blue Jays and the Athletics do not appear to be
World Series candidates this year, their second basemen eagerly
await their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consummate professional, you put on this uniform for one
reason _ to be a world champion,'' Velarde said. ``If you go for
anything else, you're in it for the wrong reason.'' But he added:
``Would I change my plans? I don't think so. I'm where I wanted to
be. I'm playing everyday. It's taken this long.''

 &HT;    What did they see the night of the Buckhead slayings?
 &HT;    By Staff Writers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Todd Whitehead was at Cobalt, partying with a friends,
and left around closing time.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said he and a woman began walking towards Jelly Rolls,
a club just east of Cobalt, when they saw some men arguing and
shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized one person in the group, Ray lewis. Lewis was
clearly acting as a peacemaker with the individuals who were
arguing. All the individuals were shorter than Ray. I easily
recognized him, but not the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the argument escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continued down the street near a light pole past the Rose
and Crown Club and I stopped there to talk to this lady,''
Whitehead said. ``From this point I observed the same group next to
the back of the Navigator limousine, which was parked on the street
near some apartments. At that time I saw Ray Lewis restrain one of
the men and was attempting to get everyone from his group into the
limo.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw Lewis ``restraining an individual who I describe
as a shorter, fair-skinned black male. At no time did I see Ray
Lewis hurt or strike anyone. He only acted as a peacemaker in
restraining people from fighting. He tried to get people back into
the limo.''
</P>
<P>
   A second fight broke out on the street corner in front of the
limo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I then left the area and walked back towards the club where my
car was parked,'' Whitehead said. ``I was afraid of possible
gunfire since a previous murder had occurred in that vicinity the
prior Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Ponder, who shot a video of celebrities at Cobalt that
night, described Lewis as a ``peacemaker'' who pulled a friend away
from an argument. Ponder, however, left the area before the two
victims were stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was not involved in the argument but merely stepped over
to pull away a friend, Ponder said. ``He had one friend by the arm
and they went around to the back of the limo and got in the back,''
Ponder testified at Lewis's bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ponder himself also stepped in to urge the participants to knock
it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll change the adjective, but I asked them to, `Let that mess
go, you guys. I just saw a kid last couple of weeks ago die across
the street from the same type stuff,' '' Ponder said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Richard Lollar and Jacinth Baker _ who moments later
were stabbed to death _ were verbally aggressive. ``They wouldn't
back down; they were yelling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said one was about 5-foot-5 and the other shorter. (Baker was
5-foot-3, Lollar was 6-foot-3.)
</P>
<P>
   Ponder drove off before the stabbings. Seconds later, he heard
gun shots.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Keeler lives in a second-floor East Paces Ferry Road
apartment, her bedroom window looking down on the crime scene. She
was startled awake in the middle of the night Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard glass shattering and people screaming and yelling,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed aside her curtain and called 911. The scene unfolded
quickly and was lit by a street light and several business signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two gentleman, the victims, who were getting beaten
up,'' she said. There were four or five men on them, and the
assailants were larger men, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I looked out the window, they were at least
trying to fight back,'' she said, ``and by the time the police get
there, they were already down.''
</P>
<P>
   As the police arrived, the men who had beaten the victims fled
on foot, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She saw a man trying to help one of the victims. Then a handful
of gunshots rang out and the crowd scattered, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ozonu pulled his cab into the intersection of East Paces
Ferry Road and Grandview Avenue and was stunned by what he saw. One
man was being pummeled, another was down and bleeding on the
pavement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was six guys beating up a guy,'' he said. ``There
was a commotion. That means it could have been more people. More
than six.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of the guys started running away (down East Paces Ferry
Road). A body was lying in the street, and a guy was pointing at
him. Talking, talking. His legs were spread, shoulder wide. He was
pointing, `I was warning you. I was warning you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guy kept grabbing him, (saying) `Come on, come on _
let's go.' He was pulling him, (saying) `Let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man standing over the body and pointing was about 6 feet
tall and looked like a weight-lifter, Ozonu said.
</P>
<P>
   Ozonu, who moved to Atlanta from Nigeria 20 years ago, was
interviewed by police at the scene and met again later that morning
with homicide detectives. He has returned to the crime scene with
district attorney's investigators; an investigator stopped at his
apartment to interview him recently while a reporter was there.
</P>
<P>
   Ozonu said he probably couldn't identify the participants, other
than to give a general description. One of those involved in the
beating was so fat he could barely run, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he drove down the block to seek help from a police
officer when he heard shots being fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those people who left in the limo was involved in
this,'' Ozonu said. ``To me, if you weren't involved, why would you
run away?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw many people on the street, but only one who tried
to help.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' high school buddy, Kwame King met his friend in
Charlotte, N.C., en route to Atlanta. He rode with Lewis in the
Lincoln Navigator limousine and stayed with the football star at
the Georgian Terrace Hotel in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   King accompanied Lewis to the Sports Authority store in nearby
Duluth the day before the Super Bowl while Lewis signed autographs
for about two hours. King said another man went along with them _
supposedly Joseph ``Shorty'' Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, King said, he went to a Super Bowl party with Lewis
at the home of one of the football star's friends. They returned to
the Georgian Terrace Hotel in downtown Atlanta at midnight. A short
time later, Lewis, King, two women and two other men piled into the
limousine Lewis had rented and headed to Cobalt.
</P>
<P>
   About 3:30 a.m., the music was turned off and King, Lewis and
their party headed back toward the limo, parked about a block and a
half away.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached the first intersection, King said two men
started to follow them closely. Another man with braids ran up
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Jaye Roberts (who also goes by the name Jessica
Robertson) were getting into the limo with a few other women. Once
inside, King said, he heard a crash, as if someone had been hit
with a bottle or other object. He did not see it happen, however. A
big scuffle started on the limo's passenger side. Lewis then tried
to help Sweeting get into the limo.
</P>
<P>
   King said he saw Lewis at all times and that Lewis continually
tried to get his group back into the limo. He said Lewis never
punched or stabbed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   King said there was still fighting outside the limo as they sped
off. Seconds later, they heard shots being fired at the vehicle and
everyone inside the limo ducked their heads. The right tire of the
limo was shot, so the driver of the limo pulled into a Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   From there the limo passengers took taxis back to The Georgian
Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Fassett, who often drove for Lewis, told police he saw
Lewis involved in an altercation with one of the victims in front
of the limo at the intersection where the stabbings occurred?.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said Lewis was walking back to the limo in a group of at
least three women and six men when one of Lewis' group started
arguing with another group of men.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis tried to shepherd Oakley, who Fassett knew as ``Derby,''
into the limo, and others from Lewis's group also got inside.
Fassett said three men from the second group approached the front
of the limo, intensifying the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the men inside of the limo then poured out of the
vehicle and started fighting with the men, Fassett said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lewis was fighting with one of the victims, as were
``Shorty'' (Sweeting) and Oakley, two men he often picked up at
Lewis's Baltimore home. The altercation ended and members of
Lewis's group rushed back into the limo and the vehicle sped away
as someone fired shots.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said he drove to a nearby Holiday Inn. He told police
Oakley was bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Police said ``a substantial amount'' of blood was found inside
the passenger compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Occupants from the limo were seen cleaning up in a hotel
bathroom, before leaving in various cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Robertson, a Houston resident who met Lewis during Super
Bowl week, told prosecutors that she, Lewis and several others left
Cobalt about 3:30 a.m. and were followed by six men as they walked
toward the limo. She also gave prosecutors nine garment bags of
Lewis's clothing that she said he had asked her to hold for him.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson told police that she, Lewis and the others climbed
into the limo when two men jumped on Sweeting and started fighting
with him near the front of the vehicle. She said Lewis walked over
and pulled the men off Sweeting and tried to get him back into the
limo.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson later said she thought the men were trying to rob
other members of her group because her companions were wearing a
lot of jewelry that night.
</P>
<P>
   In one statement she said a fair-skinned man hit Oakley on the
side of the head with a bottle. She said the assailant wore a blue
Cousey sweater and a black knit cap. In another statement, that
description is omitted.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lewis continued trying to get people into the limo and
she did not see him strike anyone. She said Lewis did not have a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   There were 13 people in the limousine and Lewis sat in the back
with Robertson next to him. He took off his mink coat and put it on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's attorney, Akil Secret, said Robertson described the
limo ride from the stabbing scene as ``pure pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were screaming at (the driver) Duane Fassett to `drive!
Drive!' It seemed like he froze,'' Secret said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said Sweeting sat in the seat next to the driver's
partition. Police said there was a ``substantial amount'' of blood
in the limo. But Robertson said no one talked of a stabbing while
in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   As they drove off, she saw a large black man over 6 feet tall
with braids standing near a parked Honda with a gun in his hand. He
started shooting at the limo as it drove off.
</P>
<P>
   She said that later, back at Lewis' room at the Georgian Terrace
Hotel, Lewis, she and one of his co-defendants saw an early-morning
TV report saying two men had been shot or stabbed in Buckhead.
``You didn't stab anyone, did you?'' Lewis supposedly asked the
co-defendant (whom Secret would not name.)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Shinholster, 28, came to Atlanta from Akron, Ohio, to
party in the Super Bowl atmosphere and went to the Cobalt, where he
met his two hometown buddies who had moved to the area. Shinholster
said he saw no fight inside the club, but left moments before
Lollar and Baker came out of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he walked past Lewis's stretch limousine, but
turned back when he heard Lollar and Baker arguing with Lewis's
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make peace,'' Shinholster said.
</P>
<P>
   He saw one of his friends hit Reginald Oakley over the head with
a Moet champagne bottle. A fight broke out and he turned to Lewis
to ask him to intervene, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you get your boy?'' Shinholster asked Lewis. He said
Lewis was just standing there. Shinholster said he did not see
Lewis holding a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Lollar yelled, ``I've been cut!''
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he did not see the stabber. He has repeatedly
told his story to Atlanta police. ``I've been down to Atlanta three
times already. I'm tired of being interviewed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see who killed them,'' he said. ``I didn't see Ray
Lewis with no knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were my two dudes who died,'' he said. ``I knew them all
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gwen, 25, is a rapper known as Chino Nino. He who came to
Atlanta for the Super Bowl parties and met his friends, Lollar and
Baker, at Cobalt.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen said he was walking on the sidewalk with them when the
fight with Ray Lewis's entourage erupted. Gwen, who is 6-feet-2 and
weighs 160 pounds, said he joined the fight to protect his friends,
who were smaller and outnumbered. He told police Lewis punched his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwen said he fled when he saw an opponent brandish a knife.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Gwen saw his friends lying bleeding in the
street. He ran back and cradled Lollar, crying, ``Wake up! Wake
up!,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy I've got to deal with the rest of my life,''
Gwen said. He would not say who brandished the knives or who
stabbed his friends.
</P>
<P>
   He has, however, told police and prosecutors what he knows. The
next time he tells the entire story will be in court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were my friends. Justice is gonna be served,'' Gwen
said.

 &HT;    What did they see the night of the Buckhead slayings?
 &HT;    By Staff Writers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Todd Whitehead was at Cobalt, partying with a friends,
and left around closing time.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said he and a woman began walking towards Jelly Rolls,
a club just east of Cobalt, when they saw some men arguing and
shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized one person in the group, Ray lewis. Lewis was
clearly acting as a peacemaker with the individuals who were
arguing. All the individuals were shorter than Ray. I easily
recognized him, but not the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the argument escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continued down the street near a light pole past the Rose
and Crown Club and I stopped there to talk to this lady,''
Whitehead said. ``From this point I observed the same group next to
the back of the Navigator limousine, which was parked on the street
near some apartments. At that time I saw Ray Lewis restrain one of
the men and was attempting to get everyone from his group into the
limo.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw Lewis ``restraining an individual who I describe
as a shorter, fair-skinned black male. At no time did I see Ray
Lewis hurt or strike anyone. He only acted as a peacemaker in
restraining people from fighting. He tried to get people back into
the limo.''
</P>
<P>
   A second fight broke out on the street corner in front of the
limo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I then left the area and walked back towards the club where my
car was parked,'' Whitehead said. ``I was afraid of possible
gunfire since a previous murder had occurred in that vicinity the
prior Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Ponder, who shot a video of celebrities at Cobalt that
night, described Lewis as a ``peacemaker'' who pulled a friend away
from an argument. Ponder, however, left the area before the two
victims were stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was not involved in the argument but merely stepped over
to pull away a friend, Ponder said. ``He had one friend by the arm
and they went around to the back of the limo and got in the back,''
Ponder testified at Lewis's bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ponder himself also stepped in to urge the participants to knock
it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll change the adjective, but I asked them to, `Let that mess
go, you guys. I just saw a kid last couple of weeks ago die across
the street from the same type stuff,' '' Ponder said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Richard Lollar and Jacinth Baker _ who moments later
were stabbed to death _ were verbally aggressive. ``They wouldn't
back down; they were yelling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said one was about 5-foot-5 and the other shorter. (Baker was
5-foot-3, Lollar was 6-foot-3.)
</P>
<P>
   Ponder drove off before the stabbings. Seconds later, he heard
gun shots.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Keeler lives in a second-floor East Paces Ferry Road
apartment, her bedroom window looking down on the crime scene. She
was startled awake in the middle of the night Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard glass shattering and people screaming and yelling,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed aside her curtain and called 911. The scene unfolded
quickly and was lit by a street light and several business signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two gentleman, the victims, who were getting beaten
up,'' she said. There were four or five men on them, and the
assailants were larger men, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I looked out the window, they were at least
trying to fight back,'' she said, ``and by the time the police get
there, they were already down.''
</P>
<P>
   As the police arrived, the men who had beaten the victims fled
on foot, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She saw a man trying to help one of the victims. Then a handful
of gunshots rang out and the crowd scattered, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ozonu pulled his cab into the intersection of East Paces
Ferry Road and Grandview Avenue and was stunned by what he saw. One
man was being pummeled, another was down and bleeding on the
pavement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was six guys beating up a guy,'' he said. ``There
was a commotion. That means it could have been more people. More
than six.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of the guys started running away (down East Paces Ferry
Road). A body was lying in the street, and a guy was pointing at
him. Talking, talking. His legs were spread, shoulder wide. He was
pointing, `I was warning you. I was warning you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guy kept grabbing him, (saying) `Come on, come on _
let's go.' He was pulling him, (saying) `Let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man standing over the body and pointing was about 6 feet
tall and looked like a weight-lifter, Ozonu said.
</P>
<P>
   Ozonu, who moved to Atlanta from Nigeria 20 years ago, was
interviewed by police at the scene and met again later that morning
with homicide detectives. He has returned to the crime scene with
district attorney's investigators; an investigator stopped at his
apartment to interview him recently while a reporter was there.
</P>
<P>
   Ozonu said he probably couldn't identify the participants, other
than to give a general description. One of those involved in the
beating was so fat he could barely run, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he drove down the block to seek help from a police
officer when he heard shots being fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those people who left in the limo was involved in
this,'' Ozonu said. ``To me, if you weren't involved, why would you
run away?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw many people on the street, but only one who tried
to help.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' high school buddy, Kwame King met his friend in
Charlotte, N.C., en route to Atlanta. He rode with Lewis in the
Lincoln Navigator limousine and stayed with the football star at
the Georgian Terrace Hotel in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   King accompanied Lewis to the Sports Authority store in nearby
Duluth the day before the Super Bowl while Lewis signed autographs
for about two hours. King said another man went along with them _
supposedly Joseph ``Shorty'' Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, King said, he went to a Super Bowl party with Lewis
at the home of one of the football star's friends. They returned to
the Georgian Terrace Hotel in downtown Atlanta at midnight. A short
time later, Lewis, King, two women and two other men piled into the
limousine Lewis had rented and headed to Cobalt.
</P>
<P>
   About 3:30 a.m., the music was turned off and King, Lewis and
their party headed back toward the limo, parked about a block and a
half away.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached the first intersection, King said two men
started to follow them closely. Another man with braids ran up
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Jaye Roberts (who also goes by the name Jessica
Robertson) were getting into the limo with a few other women. Once
inside, King said, he heard a crash, as if someone had been hit
with a bottle or other object. He did not see it happen, however. A
big scuffle started on the limo's passenger side. Lewis then tried
to help Sweeting get into the limo.
</P>
<P>
   King said he saw Lewis at all times and that Lewis continually
tried to get his group back into the limo. He said Lewis never
punched or stabbed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   King said there was still fighting outside the limo as they sped
off. Seconds later, they heard shots being fired at the vehicle and
everyone inside the limo ducked their heads. The right tire of the
limo was shot, so the driver of the limo pulled into a Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   From there the limo passengers took taxis back to The Georgian
Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Fassett, who often drove for Lewis, told police he saw
Lewis involved in an altercation with one of the victims in front
of the limo at the intersection where the stabbings occurred?.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said Lewis was walking back to the limo in a group of at
least three women and six men when one of Lewis' group started
arguing with another group of men.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis tried to shepherd Oakley, who Fassett knew as ``Derby,''
into the limo, and others from Lewis's group also got inside.
Fassett said three men from the second group approached the front
of the limo, intensifying the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the men inside of the limo then poured out of the
vehicle and started fighting with the men, Fassett said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lewis was fighting with one of the victims, as were
``Shorty'' (Sweeting) and Oakley, two men he often picked up at
Lewis's Baltimore home. The altercation ended and members of
Lewis's group rushed back into the limo and the vehicle sped away
as someone fired shots.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said he drove to a nearby Holiday Inn. He told police
Oakley was bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Police said ``a substantial amount'' of blood was found inside
the passenger compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Occupants from the limo were seen cleaning up in a hotel
bathroom, before leaving in various cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Robertson, a Houston resident who met Lewis during Super
Bowl week, told prosecutors that she, Lewis and several others left
Cobalt about 3:30 a.m. and were followed by six men as they walked
toward the limo. She also gave prosecutors nine garment bags of
Lewis's clothing that she said he had asked her to hold for him.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson told police that she, Lewis and the others climbed
into the limo when two men jumped on Sweeting and started fighting
with him near the front of the vehicle. She said Lewis walked over
and pulled the men off Sweeting and tried to get him back into the
limo.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson later said she thought the men were trying to rob
other members of her group because her companions were wearing a
lot of jewelry that night.
</P>
<P>
   In one statement she said a fair-skinned man hit Oakley on the
side of the head with a bottle. She said the assailant wore a blue
Cousey sweater and a black knit cap. In another statement, that
description is omitted.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lewis continued trying to get people into the limo and
she did not see him strike anyone. She said Lewis did not have a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   There were 13 people in the limousine and Lewis sat in the back
with Robertson next to him. He took off his mink coat and put it on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's attorney, Akil Secret, said Robertson described the
limo ride from the stabbing scene as ``pure pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were screaming at (the driver) Duane Fassett to `drive!
Drive!' It seemed like he froze,'' Secret said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said Sweeting sat in the seat next to the driver's
partition. Police said there was a ``substantial amount'' of blood
in the limo. But Robertson said no one talked of a stabbing while
in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   As they drove off, she saw a large black man over 6 feet tall
with braids standing near a parked Honda with a gun in his hand. He
started shooting at the limo as it drove off.
</P>
<P>
   She said that later, back at Lewis' room at the Georgian Terrace
Hotel, Lewis, she and one of his co-defendants saw an early-morning
TV report saying two men had been shot or stabbed in Buckhead.
``You didn't stab anyone, did you?'' Lewis supposedly asked the
co-defendant (whom Secret would not name.)

FOR METS' BELL, NUMBERS HAVEN'T MATCHED HIS POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ They called him a monster, because that
is what boys call boys who look like grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   He was 12 years old, 5 foot 9, and his feet kept outgrowing his
spikes. His coach had to carry his birth certificate at Little
League games, just to prove that Derek Nathaniel Bell was, in fact,
a kid.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden grew up two houses away in Tampa, and his cousin,
Gary Sheffield, was Bell's teammate. Gooden laughs hard when he
pictures the young Bell. ``He did have a beard and mustache,''
Gooden said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was known for the mustache, Sheffield said. That and the
home runs. Nobody hit them like Bell, who batted fourth for the
1980 Tampa Little League All-Stars, right behind Sheffield. It was
nothing special for the two to combine for five homers in a game.
They were local celebrities, with some games broadcast on radio and
the championship game on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when Bell was playing outfield for the Houston
Astros, he was in his hotel room when the phone started ringing. He
was on television, his teammates told him, and Bell first thought,
so what? It turned out a cable network was showing a Little League
World Series title game, and Bell was pitching for the USA. His
teammates couldn't get enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had that long face, those baggy eyes _ we gave him a hard
time,'' said Astros infielder Bill Spiers. ``It was funny. If you
would have seen it, you'd have been like, `Oh my God, he looks
exactly the same as he does now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bell laughed, but the Mets' new right fielder still wonders how
his team lost. He remembers having to start his swing before the
Taiwanese pitcher released the ball, and that when the pitcher
threw curveballs, there was no way to stop swinging. Bell's team
lost twice in the final game, in 1980 and '81, and both times he
wept. The monster cared.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a crucial game, if they lost, he would be the only one
crying at the end of the game,'' said Bell's mother, Chestine. ``I
would try to console him and say, `It's OK,' but he was just so
hurt and upset. That's when I knew he was serious about baseball
and he was going to go all the way. I knew he wanted to get
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell got to the majors with Toronto in 1991, the same season
Baseball America named him the minor-league player of the year. A
year later he was a reserve as the Blue Jays won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But the next year, Bell was traded to San Diego, because some in
the Blue Jays organization questioned whether he had the instincts
and the personality to stick in the major leagues. Two years later,
San Diego sent him to Houston. Last December, Houston shipped him
to the Mets in the deal that brought pitcher Mike Hampton to New
York. The Mets wanted Hampton; taking Bell got the deal done
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to hit with more power than he has,''
said Pat Gillick, the former Blue Jays general manager now with
Seattle. ``I thought he would be a 30-homer guy every year. I
really liked him. I thought he was a good player, a good person. He
was just a little different. He's not a bad guy, he just marches to
a different tune.''
</P>
<P>
   The words to that tune, the Mets have found out, are yo, yo and
yo. If Bell is not hollering ``Yo, yo, yo!'' in the clubhouse,
someone is saluting him by saying it. When he bounds in each
morning, General Manager Steve Phillips said, it is like a
hurricane blowing through. Bell has worn a different sports jersey
every day of camp, and before he enters the locker room _ as Steve
McNair or Chris Childs or whoever he is that day _ Bell gives the
coaches a fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just me,'' said Bell, 31. ``There ain't no walls
nowhere. When I'm on a team, the coaches, the players, everything
has got to be out in the open. There should be no walls nowhere
around here, except for the home run wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run wall cannot often contain Bell, who has always had
exceptionally quick wrists. As a Little Leaguer, he would hit balls
over the fence and across the street. For fun, Bell and Sheffield
would practice on a Senior League field, with major-league
dimensions. Sheffield barely reached the warning track. Bell
cleared the walls. ``That's stuff you've never seen,'' said
Sheffield, who now plays for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much different now. Matter of factly, Bell lists all
the places he has reached with home runs: the third deck in
Houston, over the pavilion in Los Angeles, the second deck in San
Diego, the Big Mac sign in St. Louis. Sheffield said the only
difference between Mark McGwire's batting practice and Bell's is
that McGwire hits long home runs more consistently. For sheer
distance, nobody hits them farther than Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not strong at all,'' said Jeff Bagwell of the Astros,
``but he can kill a ball with a baseball bat. He's special.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield has urged Bell to use his power to become a home run
hitter. Bell has never hit more than 22 homers in a season, and
last season he hit only 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek has the most potential of anybody in the game,''
Sheffield said. ``I always try to push Derek to go for home runs.
He has the ability to hit home runs if he wants to, but Derek wants
to be an all-around player, and if home runs come, they come.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell does not consider the 1999 season a bad year _ the Astros
won their division, he said, and his job was to help the team win.
Bell missed his hitting coach, Tom McCraw, who was away for much of
the year after prostate cancer surgery, but his numbers were still
shocking. Bell, who spent some time on the disabled list with a
groin pull, batted .236, the lowest average in the National League
among regulars, and he struck out a career-high 129 times. Even Rey
Ordonez had a higher slugging percentage against right-handed
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Though benched in the playoffs, Bell supported his teammates,
offering cash rewards for victories, saves and game-winning runs
batted in. Bagwell was in New York when Bell was traded to the
Mets, and was bothered by radio talk about the ``baggage'' Bell was
bringing. ``I wanted to call and say Derek is one of the nicest
guys and has one of the biggest hearts in the game,'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there were problems in Houston. Larry Dierker, who managed
Bell the last three years, called him an enigma. Dierker said Bell
brooded over being mentioned in trade rumors for Roger Clemens last
spring, and his performance suffered. Bell wanted to bat second,
not sixth, and criticized Dierker the day the manager returned from
brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' manager, Bobby Valentine, has not decided on his
regular lineup. But Bell sees himself batting second, with Edgardo
Alfonzo third and Mike Piazza fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I'm hitting .299 with 29 home runs and 99
RBIs,'' Bell said. ``If there's a man on second base, no outs, last
game of the season, last at-bat, and I can get the guy over to
third base for Alfonzo, Piazza, and those guys to tie the game or
win the game, I'm going to give myself up, because numbers don't
mean that much to me. I care about winning. I'm a team player, and
I want my teammates to know it.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all managers like to play for one run, especially in
today's game, Dierker said. Dierker did not want Bell to hit that
way, because, like Gillick and Sheffield, he thought Bell was
capable of more. But Bell wanted to be selfless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something about who he thinks he is,'' Dierker said.
``Bagwell is not a selfish player _ he wants to win as much as
anybody. But he doesn't try to get the guy over, he tries to get
the guy in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't ask Derek to get the guy over, either, but that's
the way he wanted to play. And that's OK; he was hitting second in
our lineup a lot, and that was his job a lot. But if he was hitting
fifth or sixth, which to me is what his talent suggests, he's a guy
who could drive in 100 runs.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the most out of Bell, said Gooden, who now plays for the
Astros, a manager must continually affirm that he needs him.
``Derek wants to be liked by everybody,'' Gooden said. ``He's an
easygoing guy, easy to get along with, but he's very sensitive. He
needs to know the team is behind him all the way. He's one of those
guys that needs to hear that constantly, especially when he's
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell is vowing to stay positive this year, whatever happens. He
can handle New York, he said, because he simply will not talk about
negative things.
</P>
<P>
   When something goes wrong, on the field or in life, Bell will
follow the same routine: retire to his home or hotel room and play
video games. The off-field troubles that have haunted others from
his neighborhood _ including Gooden, who has battled drug
addiction, and Sheffield, who has been shot _ have largely avoided
Bell. Gooden credits Bell's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time he was an only child, and I kept him
shielded,'' said Chestine Bell, whose next oldest child is nine
years younger. ``Just go to school, play baseball and come home. I
would take him to practice, and I would be right there to pick him
up from practice. I'd be there at the games; nobody had to take him
there and bring him home. Being a single mom and raising a boy,
it's a little rough. You've got to try to keep him on the straight
and narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's mother is proud of him, and he is proud of himself. It is
up to others to wait for the monster talent to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he's living up to his expectations,'' Sheffield
said, ``that's all that matters.''

KILLING STUNS HOUSING PROJECT IN FAR ROCKAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Residents of a Far Rockaway housing project are reeling from the
shooting death Friday night of one of their tenant patrol
volunteers, who was killed by a stray bullet when two groups opened
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Medina, 45, a resident of the Redfern Houses, had been
helping a friend on duty at the front desk when she was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Contreras, 46, said that although Medina had strep
throat and had not been scheduled for front desk duty, she
volunteered to sit with Contreras, who was alone at the front desk,
until she was to be relieved, around 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   When the shots broke out soon after, Contreras started crawling
toward the elevator. ``She turned to me and said, `Margie, Margie,
I'm shot, I'm shot,''' Contreras said. ``We picked her up by the
legs, and put her on the elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   Medina's younger daughter, Stacey, 11, rode in the elevator with
them to the fourth floor, where Contreras lives. Stacey's
godmother, Shirleen Green, 40, was also on the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I held her in the elevator,'' Green said. ``I can't get that
image out of my mind. I kept telling her `Hold on, baby.'''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers were posted in the stairwells at every floor of
the six-story building on Saturday. At first, police thought the
shooter was still in the building, but said Saturday that they no
longer thought so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently several shots were exchanged between two groups
outside,'' said Sgt. Rafael Andalia. ``Some of the shots, stray
rounds, entered the lobby.'' Ten to 15 shots were fired, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the tenant patrol reported seeing four men
running away, but no one had been arrested by Saturday afternoon,
and the police were still looking for suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ruling anything out,'' Andalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Medina, who had three children, started working on the tenant
patrol about two months ago, two or three times a week.

PARALEGALS' OCCUPATION IS NEAR TOP IN GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The news that first-year associates at major New York
law firms may soon be paid as much as $160,000 a year can only make
Anthony Griffith feel a little more secure in his job.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, 30, is a legal assistant, commonly called a paralegal,
a kind of paramedic for lawyers. He cannot try a case or counsel a
client. But he can do legal research, draw up court papers and
double-check the accuracy of briefs filed by the partners and
associates he works for. And because he can perform these and other
important tasks at a fraction of the fee a lawyer commands, he is
vital to his firm. Not to mention the clients and their checkbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith and his paralegal colleagues at Goodkind, Labaton,
Rudoff &AMP; Sucharow, a medium-size Manhattan firm, are members of one
of the fastest growing job categories in the country at a time when
law firms of all sizes have been forced to become more cost
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, law firms used law students, junior lawyers,
secretaries and clerks to do tasks now assigned to paralegals. But
in the 1960s, when the civil rights and voting rights movements
sought to make legal services more available to the poor,
nonlawyers were trained to perform tasks that did not require a law
license. Soon, private firms and government agencies began seeing
the benefits of training people for this new job category.
</P>
<P>
   Mark S. Arisohn of Goodkind, Labaton, one of the partners to
whom Griffith is assigned, said a paralegal's time was generally
billed at $90 to $125 an hour at the firms he was familiar with,
while ``lawyers are typically $200 and north,'' reaching $500 an
hour in some partners' billings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to have a $300 an hour lawyer doing work that
can be done at $100 an hour,'' Arisohn said. Still, others in the
legal business noted, some firms that make heavy use of paralegals
retain the practice of having first-year associates handle all
legal research, even elementary tasks.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical morning recently, Griffith was hunched over his
desk at the Midtown Manhattan offices of Goodkind, Labaton
preparing for a day of multiple tasks. One of the five lawyers he
is assigned to had asked him to tap into the Internet to dig up
articles written by an expert witness in a case. Another needed the
American Arbitration Association rules for resolving employment
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   File cabinets and boxes nearby included more extensive
assignments he had recently completed: summaries of long deposition
testimony from which he had extracted the most germane parts,
copies of summonses and subpoenas he had prepared and lawyers'
court papers he had vetted to assure that the decisions they cited
were still valid as precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out in high school liking the law,'' said Griffith,
a Brooklyn resident who received a bachelor of science degree in
legal assistance studies at New York City Technical College in
Brooklyn. He has been working as a paralegal for seven years, the
last six months at Goodkind, Labaton. The work, he said, has
strengthened his interest in becoming a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I've seen has discouraged me,'' he said. ``To see that
what you're doing is really helping someone'' has impressed him as
a rewarding part of being a lawyer, he said, adding that when his
personal life permits, probably in two or three years, he will
apply to law school.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith is among 136,000 people across the country who,
government economists say, filled the paralegal ranks in 1998, the
latest year for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has figures.
This is four times the number the agency estimated in 1980, and it
projects that the ranks will swell to 220,000 by 2008. That is the
swiftest growth rate the bureau foresees for any occupation outside
the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Paralegals are also expected to keep increasing in New York,
where an estimated 13,000 work today _ two-thirds of them in New
York City _ and where nearly 16,000 are projected six years from
now, according to the State Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the occupation's surging growth since it emerged as a
discrete employment category in the 1970s, Julie Sisti, who
oversees the paralegal studies program at New York University,
said, ``We've become a more complex society, with the need to make
legal services more accessible to the average person.'' Paralegals,
with their lower-cost time, help attain this, she said.y
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be no shortages of candidates to fill the
openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids coming out of college don't necessarily want to go to law
school but want to work in the profession, and being a paralegal is
interesting work with pretty good pay,'' Arisohn said. His firm has
10 paralegals to assist its 52 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's paralegal manager, Angela L. Pariselli, would not say
what Goodkind, Labaton pays its legal assistants. But she said
that, generally, in the city the entry-level pay in the occupation
was about $25,000 a year, and was $40,000 and up for those with
more than four years' experience.
</P>
<P>
   Besides those who decide on paralegal work as a career, many in
the job are college graduates who, like Griffith, entered the
occupation because they were considering becoming lawyers and
decided to put in some time as legal assistants to test their
affinity for the profession.
</P>
<P>
   Sisti similarly spoke of the many who enrolled in NYU's
paralegal course because they saw a stint as a legal assistant as
``a cheaper way than law school to find out if they really like the
law or have a talent for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others taking the 12-credit course, which is offered by the
university's School of Continuing and Professional Studies, are
looking to make paralegal work a career, she said, while still
others are already employed as legal assistants but have had only
on-the-job training and want to enhance their skills and
advancement opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities for formal training continue to grow. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics says that more than 800 programs across the
country, from four-year bachelor's degree programs to certificate
courses running only a few months, are offered by universities,
community colleges and proprietary business schools.
</P>
<P>
   No state requires paralegals to be licensed, though some have
adopted voluntary standards, said Marge Dover, executive director
of the National Association of Legal Assistants, based in Tulsa,
Okla. She said that paralegals might perform any tasks the lawyers
they work for assign to them, except that they could not give legal
advice, set fees or present cases in court.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Elizabeth Bellmar, 27, another Goodkind,
Labaton paralegal, who has decided after testing the waters by
working as a legal assistant that a lawyer's life is not for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to write the papers, I like to fix them up,'' she
said. ``I don't want to stand up in court. It's not my nature. I
like being in the background.''

GORE TO EMBRACE AN OVERHAUL OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
 (EDS: This is an added started on page 1.)  
(mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Boldly moving to turn one of his greatest
vulnerabilities into an asset, Vice President Al Gore said Saturday
that he would make overhauling the campaign finance system a
central theme of his presidential bid. He brushed aside fresh
questions about his own conduct in raising money, insisting that he
had learned from his mistakes and therefore had become passionate
about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made it clear that he viewed his heightened zeal for
campaign finance not only as a draw for the independent voters who
had flocked to Sen. John McCain of Arizona but as an organizing
principle for his campaign against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. He
contended that Bush had proposed an unworkable and perhaps ruinous
economic plan because he was beholden to the special interests _
including the chemical industry and assorted ``fat cats'' _ who
have financed his campaign and expect a break on their corporate
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In his first substantive interview since effectively securing
the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, Gore on Saturday
offered one of his bluntest condemnations of Bush. Signaling that
he was ready to dive into a months-long battle with the two-term
governor, Gore said repeatedly that Bush lacked the experience to
be president. He said this was evident in the governor's failure to
put forth a ``presidential-class'' economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder, does George W. Bush have the experience to
be president?'' Gore asked in an interview in his cabin aboard Air
Force II as he flew here from Minneapolis. ``I think that these two
issues are closely related. The people of this country
overwhelmingly reject this risky tax scheme that would put Social
Security and Medicare at risk and threaten our prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why is he proposing it, even though the numbers don't add
up? Because the vast majority of the soft-money donors have this
risky tax scheme as their personal top priority. The agenda of the
special-interest donors supporting Governor Bush is completely
different from the agenda of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had adopted the passion of a convert on campaign
finance in part because of the ``pain'' he experienced following
revelations of his role in aggressively collecting money for his
and President Clinton's re-election in 1996. People close to Gore
said that he was particularly stung because he had always prided
himself on his image of being above reproach. As part of his new
offensive Saturday, Gore did something he rarely does _ he uttered
the words ``Buddhist temple,'' a phrase he had been careful to
avoid. Now that one of his longtime fund-raisers has been convicted
of excesses in connection with a fund-raising event at a Buddhist
temple, and fresh video has been released of him with the
Buddhists, he seemed to have less trouble saying the words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake going to that Buddhist temple; I made a
mistake in making telephone calls from my office,'' he said. ``And
I have learned from those mistakes.'' Leaning forward in a folding
chair for emphasis, Gore added: ``I have a passion for campaign
finance reform that is fueled in part because of the pain of those
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to try to embrace campaign finance as an issue
is striking, given his own history, and he is clearly employing the
axiom that the best defense is a strong offense. He has apparently
decided that emphasizing the issue might be his best hope for
attracting McCain's supporters and for inoculating himself against
the Bush campaign's drive to continually try to link the vice
president to campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Bush has ridiculed Gore for calling on him to
reject unregulated soft money in the campaigns this year while at
the same time the vice president has been aggressively raising such
funds. Saying that he was no hypocrite, Gore pointed to his
appearance Saturday morning in Minneapolis with Gov. Jesse Ventura,
the independent who is a champion of campaign reform. Gore sought
to validate his own position by saying of Ventura: ``He's probably
the best-known advocate of reform among the independents of this
nation. And he makes the obvious point: That there's no
inconsistency whatsoever in calling for a ban on soft money and
playing by the rules as they currently exist. It's the same thing
as arms control _ you can be for arms control without being for
unilateral disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is so eager to raise questions about the vice
president's character that in his victory speech Tuesday night,
Bush reminded people of Gore's early explanation that his
fund-raising practices were acceptable in the 1996 campaign because
there was ``no controlling legal authority.'' And the matter shows
no signs of going away. On Saturday, The New York Times reported
that senior Justice Department officials twice urged Attorney
General Janet Reno to appoint an independent counsel to investigate
Gore for his role in fund-raising, and at one point came closer
than had been known to persuading her to appoint one.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he seemed newly repentant and energized about this
crusade, Gore at times was dismissive toward the subject. For
example, he brushed off questions about the new reports, in which
Leon Panetta, the former White House chief of staff, recalled the
vice president ``listening attentively'' to discussions about
making calls to raise hard money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's old news,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed again on the questions, he said, ``This was all reviewed
three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He immediately turned to what he called questions about Bush's
campaign-finance practices. He condemned Bush for turning down
federal money for his campaign so that he did not have to accept
limits to how much he can spend. He also criticized what he called
secretly financed sneak-attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, responded: ``Al Gore can't
escape the ethical cloud he's under by raining on Governor Bush.
The vice president is under fire for his misrepresentations of his
fund-raising actions and the FBI's conclusion that he may have
given false testimony to investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gore's accusation that the governor was tied to
special interests, Fleischer added, ``Al Gore is the one who has
rewarded his special interest contributors with overnight stays in
the Lincoln Bedroom, with seats on trade missions as a quid pro quo
_ and this phony charge is more evidence of how Al Gore will say
anything, do anything, twist anything for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sensitive question of how aggressively he will advocate
to fellow Democrats that they support the administration's plan for
normalizing trade relations with China, Gore asserted that he would
be a strong advocate, even at the risk of alienating organized
labor, which opposes the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be aggressive and forward-leaning in urging
Congress to pass the China/WTO legislation,'' he said, referring to
the World Trade Organization. Asked about reverberations among
unions, he replied: ``Some of them have not yet endorsed me because
of the fact that I'm in favor of this legislation. Others have
endorsed me in spite of our disagreement on this legislation
because I agree with them on 90 percent of the issues. And George
Bush disagrees with them on 100 percent of the issues. I think it's
the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, on the campaign trail, Gore hardly mentions the trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Gore laid out issues on which he expected to
engage Bush in the coming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said of Bush: ``He has called for a set of changes that would
severely damage Social Security. I do not favor raising the
retirement age; he has opened the door to that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the primary against former Sen. Bill Bradley, the Gore
campaign quickly lit into a suggestion that Bradley wanted to raise
the retirement age, a proposal that brings swift condemnation from
older Americans, whose votes Gore will be battling Bush for,
especially in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that Bradley bowed out of the Democratic race calling
on Gore to ``run a better campaign'' in the fall, Gore said in
response to a question that he had no regrets about his tactics or
how he had handled himself. Rather than acknowledge Bradley's
criticism that Gore had distorted his positions, Gore said only,
``I appreciated his statement of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning the topic to health care, Gore said, ``I think it's
shocking that under his governorship, Texas has become 50th out of
50 in health insurance for women and 49th out of 49 in health
insurance for children. In light of that, how can he oppose a
health care patients' bill of rights at the national level that is
real? How can he fail to put forward any program whatsoever for
expanding access to health insurance? He said yesterday or the day
before yesterday, that it's OK, because people can go to the
emergency room. Well, it's not OK, requiring people to fall back on
the kindness of strangers by showing up at the emergency room
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore refused to be drawn into a discussion of how strong a
competitor Bush would be. Asked how Bush would stack up against him
in a debate, he replied: ``I have no idea. I have no idea.'' He
said he had not watched any of the Republican debates.

ASYLUM POLICY IS PIECEMEAL IN CASES OF GENDER ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young Moroccan woman, now 21 and living in Queens,
won asylum in the United States in August after fleeing North
Africa and her father, a fundamentalist Muslim who beat her, locked
her in her room and denied her an education. The case continues to
frustrate lawyers for immigrant women fleeing abuse, even though it
was a victory on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   In granting her asylum, the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals
defined her plight as religious persecution rather than domestic
abuse. That means the ruling offered no greater hope for women
seeking asylum based on abuse at the hands of fathers and brothers,
husbands and boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not long after her case, the board refused asylum to a
Guatemalan woman who had suffered similar abuse but whose abuser
had no political or religious affiliations that the board found
important.
</P>
<P>
   The two decisions reflect the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's latest, often confusing attempts to reckon with one of
the thorniest issues it faces: how to deal consistently and fairly
with the thousands of women who, in one form or another, seek
asylum because of what is termed gender abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hardest question in refugee law right now,'' said
Bo Cooper, agency counsel. ``We are trying to figure out how the
international definition of a refugee, written half a century ago,
should be applied to novel kinds of cases such as domestic
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Under that definition, Cooper said, to be considered a refugee,
a person must have a well-founded fear of persecution based on
race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social
group or political opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Membership in a particular social group is the hardest to
understand, the least well defined and the one that is typically at
issue in domestic violence cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the practices involved in such cases include genital
mutilation, bride burning, rape, mass rape, sexual abuse, spousal
abuse, infanticide, forced marriage, child marriage, slavery,
forced abortion and forced pregnancy. And even when the agency
determines that a woman has a compelling case, there are a range of
options the agency must weigh before granting asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example,'' Cooper said, ``can she turn to the government
for help? Can she safely move to another part of the country? Can
she leave the marriage?'' Those requirements keep the system from
being swamped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Moroccan woman said she fled her home with the help of her
mother and a friend who gave her a forged green card. She said she
twice tried to kill herself before deciding to flee. She arrived in
New York in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told me that to be a good Muslim woman meant that I
would never be educated,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``And
when I protested, I was beaten, one time being burned with the
heated blade of a knife on my thigh. I still have the scar.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service first tried to address the question of
granting asylum to women based on charges of domestic abuse in
1995, by distributing a document to its inspectors called Gender
Guidelines Recognition. While the guidelines did not change refugee
law, they set out procedures for interviewing claimants. For
example, they allowed women to speak apart from their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   But the guidelines did not say whether domestic violence victims
were to be considered members of a distinct and deserving social
group, as defined in the law. Not surprisingly, then, domestic
abuse cases have been settled in a patchwork of decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, for example, the immigration service granted asylum to
a Haitian woman who had been raped while active in the church led
by Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the former president of Haiti. Human
rights advocates hoped that it would presage a wider recognition of
gender abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling only caused confusion. The agency granted her
asylum because of political persecution, saying that she was
sexually abused because of her beliefs, and, as it has seemed to do
since, it avoided the issue of whether the rape by itself was
sufficient grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the board ruled that a woman from Togo, in West Africa,
could be granted asylum based on her fear that if she returned
there, she would be forced to undergo genital mutilation, but again
avoided the broader issue of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration advocates, like Nancy Kelly of the Harvard
Immigration and Refugee Clinic, called the last decade of rulings
``confusing and inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, have chosen to interpret the differing decisions
as a sign that the agency is inching awkwardly, but steadily,
closer to acknowledging that gender abuse is a legitimate basis for
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these cases indicate that this area of gender asylum
law is alive and well, that it is possible to win cases based on
domestic abuse,'' said Deborah Anker, director of the Harvard
Immigration and Refugee Clinic. But the board's rulings have been
inconsistent, she said.

   GRAFTON, N.Y. _ Like a stern father, Peter J. Dubacher stands
back warily as a pair of sandhill cranes caw invitingly and flutter
their velvety gray feathers. The harder they try to catch his
attention, the more he resists. The din turns deafening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing with us. If you go over there, they'll nail
you,'' he said, glancing ruefully at a scar on his hand left by the
territorial cranes. ``It's a defense mechanism for them. If you put
yourself in a compromising position, it's your fault. You have to
respect these creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubacher has grown wise to his feathered charges in the 26 years
since he turned his parents' 20-acre farm, nestled on the edge of
the Berkshires, into a sanctuary for injured and unwanted birds. By
his count, he cares for 1,700 birds _ including 15 eagles, two
peregrine falcons and 19 emus _ in a maze of greenhouses and wooden
pens.
</P>
<P>
   New York City dwellers drive four hours to hand-deliver pigeons
crippled by a careless driver or a cruelly aimed stone. Wildlife
officials across the country entrust him with their casualties,
from an eagle mauled by a bear in Alaska to cranes left over from a
breeding program in Maryland. Last month, Belmont Park Racetrack
sent over 475 chickens that instead of calming the horses in their
stalls, overran the barn.
</P>
<P>
   Dubacher, 51, makes room for them all because he cannot bear the
thought of what would happen otherwise. ``It's not that I want
another eagle; I just want to save his life,'' he said. ``I'm not a
religious person, but I do believe, as humans, we all have a
responsibility, whether it's taking care of birds or taking care of
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   These efforts have earned him a national conservation award from
the Daughters of the American Revolution, and letters of praise
from President Clinton and Gov. George Pataki, among others.
Thousands of schoolchildren from upstate New York, Massachusetts
and Vermont visit the sanctuary every year on field trips. Albany
natives know him simply as ``the birdman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the Mother Teresa of the wild-bird world,'' said Ward
Stone, the wildlife pathologist for the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, who has sent injured Canada geese and
ducks to the sanctuary. ``Peter is often the last resort for birds
if they can't be released to the wild, and he keeps them going for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary, which costs $40,000 a year to run, is a
rough-hewn place pieced together largely from donations. Visitors
never come empty-handed; they bring timber and wire, cash and
checks. The Environmental Conservation Department sends road kill
to feed the falcons. And the U.S. Postal Service has flown injured
eagles from Alaska to the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Dubacher, a gregarious, ruddy-faced man, seems an unlikely
savior of birds, having no degree in ornithology or zoology or
formal training in wildlife care. He was never particularly fond of
birds while growing up in a home full of cats and dogs, he said.
What he knows about wild birds he learned by reading and rescuing.
</P>
<P>
   Dubacher, whose father was an executive chef for United
Airlines, lived with his family in San Francisco and Honolulu
before moving to Maplewood, N.J., and then to West Hempstead, on
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, he became an Army chef, cooking for generals
on a military base in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that he was drawn to exotic birds, which were
crammed into squalid cages and offered for sale by children on the
streets. With $5 a week he would buy as many as he could, just to
set them free. ``It's a haunting thing when you see them like
that,'' he said. ``You come to a feeling that you want to make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Army, Dubacher was a cook in Switzerland before
returning in 1971 to his parents' summer home in Grafton. He worked
his way up to head chef at a local restaurant, but it did not bring
him the kind of fulfillment he found he needed.
</P>
<P>
   So he filled the back yard with chickens and geese and built
pens and greenhouses to shield parrots and other tropical birds
from snow. The neighbors began bringing him strays and unwanted
pets _ and not just birds. Thirty-five deer, a mustang and a goat
now roam the pens.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, who still live on the farm, were skeptical but did
not object. ``We taught our children to be kind and decent to
animals,'' said his mother, Christina Dubacher, a German immigrant.
``We helped. A few nights we had to catch the birds when they broke
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubacher eventually gave up his job to tend the birds full time,
but the decision has not come without sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   He eats out just twice a year, almost never goes to the movies,
and took his last vacation 16 years ago. His met his wife of seven
years, Betty Ann, 42, a physical therapist, only because she drove
past the turnoff for Grafton Lake and ended up at the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very different than how I used to live,'' Betty Ann
Dubacher said. ``I'm much less selfish and more peaceful, I think.
When there are so many animals that need to be taken care of, it
takes the focus off me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dubachers have tried to teach these values to their
5-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and share their love of birds with
the community. Peter Dubacher has taken emu eggs to his daughter's
school, and bald eagles to local Boy Scout meetings. The volunteers
at the sanctuary have become their extended family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live meagerly, but at the same time we are blessed in many
ways,'' Dubacher said. ``How many people can say they have bald
eagles in their back yard?''

point in his presidential campaign was his decision last summer to
halt his constant calculations about what was best for the Clinton
administration and to start speaking ``straight from the heart.''

in this month's presidential elections, many experts warn that none
of his efforts will matter unless he does what his predecessor
Boris Yeltsin failed to do: rein in Russia's oligarchs. Reform or
no reform, they say that Russia's woes will continue while the
robber barons retain their power. But while Putin would certainly
win about 100 percent of the vote if he did crack down on these
moneyed plutocrats, he would lose their financial backing _ crucial

doesn't believe in God, all they need to do is look at these
mountains.'' But by the next Sunday, church members were wondering
why God would allow three generations of the Phillips family to be

drunk and in a panic-stricken frenzy to outrun the law after having

   STARGAZERS _ GREEN BANK, W. Va. _ In isolated Deer Creek Valley,
where folks traditionally rely upon moonshine and timber for their

gigantic radio telescope with an ``ear'' bigger a football field.
Weighing 17 million pounds and rolling on a 25-foot-thick
foundation of reinforced concrete, the Green Bank telescope will be
``one of the largest moving things on Earth,'' its builders
promise. Since 1958, an astronomy observatory has been located at
Green Bank precisely because it is so remote and surrounded by
mountains that block out all radio interference. About 130
scientists and engineers live near the rural community of Green
Bank, which is 100 miles from the nearest town. The scant populace
is an interesting mix of brainy stargazers and their down-to-earth
backwoods neighbors. (Dart, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

and racism in America, which was a shock at first. I also heard the

   US-TAIWAN _ WASHINGTON _ (Tentative). Since the United States

potentially fiery situation between China and Taiwan _ and show our
support for the latter _ the Clinton administration has
incrementally backed away from its iron-glove handling of relations
with the mainland. So much so, that many Asia observers are now
asking ``Would the United States wage a war a world away to save
Taipei from an aggressive Beijing seeking to re-unify China _ at
all costs? We poll the administration, as well as the presidential
candidates. (Deans, Cox News Service).

question is only rhetorical, of course. It has to be because the

   MURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ I was coming out of a cafe the
other morning when a fellow came up out of nowhere, introduced
himself and, allowing that he was a conservative and knowing I was
a liberal, proceeded to tell me how he felt about gun control.
Truth is, I am not so much a liberal on all subjects. I am very

   LAPIDUS-PROFILE _ MIAMI BEACH _ Profile of Miami architect
Morris Lapidus. When he retired in 1982, Lapidus was so bitter
about his rejection by critics and peers that he threw away most of
his drawings and blueprints. He was widely ridiculed for his
kitschy resort hotels; one wit said they gave her ``the
Fountainblues.'' Well, she's dead and he ain't. At 97, Lapidus is
back in vogue, his curvy, voluptuous designs all over the place.
And he's working again; a restaurant of his design just opened in
South Beach. We visit him there, in Lapidusland, and tour the
fantasy world he created as we look back on a life that began in
Russian poverty and came to embody American pizazz. (Auchmutey,

   STARGAZERS _ GREEN BANK, W. Va. _ In isolated Deer Creek Valley,
where folks traditionally rely upon moonshine and timber for their

gigantic radio telescope with an ``ear'' bigger a football field.
Weighing 17 million pounds and rolling on a 25-foot-thick
foundation of reinforced concrete, the Green Bank telescope will be
``one of the largest moving things on Earth,'' its builders
promise. Since 1958, an astronomy observatory has been located at
Green Bank precisely because it is so remote and surrounded by
mountains that block out all radio interference. About 130
scientists and engineers live near the rural community of Green
Bank, which is 100 miles from the nearest town. The scant populace
is an interesting mix of brainy stargazers and their down-to-earth
backwoods neighbors. (Dart, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

ANSWERING A CALL FOR ETIQUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE BROOK, N.Y. _ ``The next trick we're going to learn,'' Mrs.
Herbert Christopher Hoover Jr. told the 27 girls around the table,
``is how to use the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they knew something about telephones, just as they
knew how to walk straight, sip soup and hold a conversation. But
Manners 2000, The Etiquette Advantage _ a one-day total-immersion
finishing school _ teaches the proper way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``Who may I say is calling?'' is preferable to the
teen-age grunt. And if parents are not home or waving wildly to
signal that they don't want to talk, Hoover suggested saying
something like, ``My father is having a business conference and my
mother is entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents, hearing a child utter that sentence, might think
about having her deprogrammed. But the manners makeover at the Rye
Town Hilton last weekend specialized in such unnatural acts: girls
sitting straight-backed, walking with rib cages erect, saying
quaintly, ``May I please be excused to go to the powder room?''
</P>
<P>
   Manners are making a comeback, appropriately understated, of
course, which may explain why you haven't noticed it at your dinner
table. In the booming economy, people are eager to not only be well
off, but also to appear so.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hoover, a former Mrs. Philadelphia with long years as a
model and image consultant, and Mrs. Robert Stith-Williams, a
longtime impresario of society balls in New York and Europe. (They
use their husbands' names.) Theirs is a tiny industry promoting
renewed appreciation of the fish fork, polite children and social
courtesies now mostly seen in colorized movies.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that proper conduct counts, and those who know
will know whether you know, and if you don't, will identify you as
the social equivalent of slurped soup.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover had helpful hints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never blow our nose at the table. We excuse ourself and
leave the room if we have to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should not talk about yourself for more than a minute and
a half without throwing the conversation to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoover (her late husband was a distant cousin of the president)
said manners and grace, which she wears naturally, give people
self-confidence, freeing them to focus on others and making them
more likely to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Stith-Williams declared America an etiquette disaster area. ``I
see bad things,'' she said. ``When I see a top CEO stabbing his
steak in a private club and sawing it in half, things are bad.''
</P>
<P>
   They have come to the rescue of executives, a restaurant staff
and mothers fed up with children's reducing conversation to two
expressions _ ``like'' and ``ya know.'' The mother of a girl
approaching her bat mitzvah has asked them to teach the girl ``how
to introduce herself to her relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's session cost $250 a girl, and included a
three-course luncheon to teach the sixth-, seventh- and
eighth-graders proper table etiquette. Sip soup from the side of
the spoon, they were told, and wait for your hostess to put her
napkin in her lap before doing so yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Between courses, one eighth-grader, sitting erect, muttered,
``My grandmother would have loved this.''
</P>
<P>
   Others found it relevant. ``My dad has lots of dinner parties
because he's the boss,'' said a sixth-grader named Mary. ``He had
to dine with the queen of Sweden. He thinks that will come up in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria, another sixth-grader, said, ``My grandparents are
having a 50th anniversary party in April at a really fancy place,
so my mother thought it would be good to know how to do
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Stith-Williams said language and manners went haywire 30 or 40
years ago. ``That's all from _ what's that thing they had in
upstate New York? _ Woodstock,'' she said. She hopes that the
popularity of her seminars means that people want the next
generation set straight. But frankly, she's not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``America used to be a consomme,'' she said. ``Now we're a
bouillabaisse. And once you're a bouillabaisse, you'll never go
back to being a consomme.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least we can use the right spoon.  &QL;

TAKING TWO YEARS TO FIND JUST THE RIGHT CONDO
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some people look at apartments the way they check out
melons in the supermarket. They might buy something, someday, but
if the feel isn't exactly right, they'll pass.
</P>
<P>
   Good brokers can usually tell which shoppers are seriously in
need of a new place and which ones are not. Figuring that their
time in this market is too valuable to waste, the brokers usually
find some way to give browsers the slip. Jill Meilus, a broker with
the Corcoran Group, always believed that Elizabeth Bibb and Michael
Yamashita would buy something. She just didn't know when. And so
for almost two years, she showed them places, probably 40 in all,
trying to fulfill their desire for a condo rather than a co-op, two
real bedrooms and good light, all for about $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bibb and Yamashita live in a colonial house in Mendham, N.J., in
Morris County, but like to keep a second place in the city. Bibb, a
former magazine editor now studying playwriting, and Yamashita, a
photographer for National Geographic, come to the city for work and
for fun, sometimes with their daughter, Maggie, 4.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, they decided to sell their one-bedroom
duplex on West 15th Street, which they had bought four years
earlier for $175,000. It didn't have a bedroom for their daughter,
and they figured it was the perfect time to sell. ``We thought we
had hit the height of the market,'' Yamashita said.
</P>
<P>
   Their apartment sold quickly for $390,000, then a building
record for one-bedrooms. Yamashita said that, encouraged by his
investment-banker brother, who believed the financial crisis in
Asia would provoke a similar one here, he expected that prices
would fall and that taking their time to buy would be prudent.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be wrong, and as the real estate market
simply continued to rise, rising 20 percent in 12 months in
neighborhoods like Greenwich Village and Chelsea, they found
themselves looking for something bigger even as prices kept
outpacing their budget.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, they wanted to restrict their search to Chelsea or
the Village, but their broker convinced them they had to look
elsewhere to find what they wanted. They were close to buying one
place, but they had to act quickly to get the requisite papers
together, and with a business trip to Europe that couldn't be
canceled, they didn't have time.
</P>
<P>
   A loft in TriBeCa seemed perfect, but they passed on it because
of strict subletting rules. Since they sometimes travel on business
for months, they want to be able to sublet easily.
</P>
<P>
   As the prices rose, they became increasingly concerned that if
they didn't buy, they would be forever priced out. But in early
December, with the holidays coming and the uncertainty about Y2K,
Bibb decided to suspend the search. ``I had just talked to Jill and
said we had given up on the hunt,'' Bibb said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she couldn't really stop looking. ``Because of my real
estate addiction,'' she said, ``I went to the Internet, and a thing
popped up in our price range. I said, `This must be a typo.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her broker checked and found that there was a contract out but
that it hadn't been signed, so they went to look at the place, a
two-bedroom condo with a wood-burning fireplace on East 31st Street
between Second and Third Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in here, the first thing I saw were those
windows,'' Yamashita said. ``They look Japanese.'' The shape of the
windows, with walls jutting out at either end, will make them
perfect for the window seats and shoji screens they plan to
install. The windows look out on the church and its courtyard,
hardly the dramatic view that had been one of their nonnegotiable
demands. But the screens will create a translucent, pearlized light
that in its way is just as evocative as the World Trade Center view
from their old apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Bibb felt instantly at home. ``It had a very good vibe about
it,'' she said. ``There is something very cosmic about how one
chooses where to live. It felt like it could be home.'' The asking
price was $460,000, but to outbid the other interested party, they
offered $470,000, lured partly by what they considered manageable
monthly carrying costs of $730 and monthly taxes of $375. They
closed on Jan. 14, using the cash they had kept ready from the sale
of their old place.
</P>
<P>
   Although their place has the clean lines of a postwar apartment
building, it was actually constructed in 1902 as a school that was
part of the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd next door. An
addition was built in the 1960s after the school was sold and
turned into apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Their apartment's modernity is a pleasing contrast to their
18th-century house in New Jersey, Bibb said, with its three
bedrooms, barn, gazebo and 5{ acres. Yamashita has lived since 1982
in Mendham, a town he discovered when he was taking photographs for
an article on New Jersey. A native of Montclair, he was entranced
by the horse farms and rolling hills, which remind Bibb of her
Kentucky childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment perfectly holds their more modern pieces, like a
chair by George Nakashima, the Japanese-American artist. Their new
living room is already decorated with some photographs by
Yamashita, including one of the moss garden at Kyoto taken in the
rain, and an aerial view of Mount Fuji. A specialist on Asia,
Yamashita took the photographs for ``In the Japanese Garden,''
published by Fulcrum; his wife wrote the text.
</P>
<P>
   Although they hadn't wanted to live so far east in Manhattan,
their block has turned out to be a ``weird little haven,'' Bibb
said, with church bells ringing, pigeons cooing and every food they
could want around the corner at Todaro's, a miniature Balducci's.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yamashita jokes that his wife, who did most of the
looking, was ``the client from hell'' for their broker, Meilus said
she always believed they would buy when they found the right thing.
Maybe the broker's confidence came from the fact that she had known
Bibb since they were college students spending a semester at the
London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Meilus said, she has had some clients who have taken
even longer. ``I have one who's 3{ years,'' she said. ``I'm seeing
her this afternoon.''

SPORTS COLUMN: RETRO TRADITION GOES ON DISPLAY IN AMERICA EAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Jay Wright was a highly impressionable 12
years of age when he learned a valuable lesson of life: Sometimes _
no matter how hard you work _ you just get shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Back when he was a child in the Philadelphia area, two great
Atlantic Coast Conference teams, North Carolina State and Maryland,
met for the single available spot in the national tournament. He
remembers the delicious agony, as a neutral fan. This time he was
very much involved.
</P>
<P>
   Wright is now the 38-year-old coach at Hofstra University, which
on Saturday finally overcame the inherent terror of an
all-or-nothing game. Hofstra beat Delaware, 76-69, in the America
East Conference title game to qualify for the automatic bid to the
Great Big National Silliness, which commences later this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand ancient tradition of conference tournaments, only
one team was going anywhere important. Wright had tried to downplay
the momentousness of this game, held at the extremely bizarre hour
of 11:30 a.m. to accommodate ESPN, which had discovered Hofstra
basketball at the same time as the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my staff all season that what we did in the regular
season was important,'' Wright said. ``I don't judge us on the
postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a reasonable approach. Everybody knew Delaware had enough
skill and character to come up to Hofstra's sparkling new arena and
win this shootout. Both teams knew enough to not count on an
at-large bid for the loser. That's just the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra has not been on this path in a long time. In 1976 it
lost to Connecticut in the first round, and in 1977 it lost to
Notre Dame in the first round. In the commotion after Saturday's
victory, a longtime Hofstra fan named Rich Weksberg from Brooklyn
was displaying his ticket stub from that 1977 loss in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   One can only wonder what kind of low-seeding horror show the
NCAA tournament has in store for Hofstra at some distant site this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not in the minds and hearts of the jubilant Hofstra
players, who had heard Wright's rationale for not treating this day
as the only two hours that might matter in their lives. ``I can't
speak for my teammates,'' said Norman Richardson, who scored 20 of
his 26 points in the second half. ``But my brother, Derrick Brown,
played for Providence in 1997, when they lost to Arizona in the
Elite Eight. He told me how great it was. He told me how you feel
like a celebrity all week. I wanted to feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hofstra will go somewhere and play somebody. ``Don't care,''
Richardson said. ``Send me anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   This was also the attitude of Speedy Claxton, who had stayed in
his home town to play although he had credentials to go elsewhere.
Claxton went to Christ the King High in Queens, where he was a
teammate of the now-beleaguered Erick Barkley at equally
beleaguered St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   With Barkley's future at St. John's very much in doubt, Claxton
said he had not talked to his friend in the last tumultuous days,
and knew nothing about the mounting troubles at St. John's.
Saturday was Hofstra's day.
</P>
<P>
   In his sixth year, Jay Wright has survived a shootout comparable
to the one he watched as a young fan. ``I can remember they showed
the ACC tournament on Raycom or some network like that,'' Wright
said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, the national tournament was open only to
conference champions, plus select independents. Thus, when Maryland
met North Carolina State in the ACC finals, one was going to get
royally shunted to the nether world.
</P>
<P>
   Wright can recall sitting in front of the tube in 1974 and
watching State with Dave Thompson prevail over Maryland with John
Lucas, 103-100. People in the ACC still call it ``the greatest game
ever.'' Oh, yes, State won the national title, too. Beat
Providence. Beat Pitt. Beat Coach Wooden himself. Beat Marquette by
12 in the final.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, they changed the rules. Conferences were allowed
a second team, just for openers, leading to the eventual glut in
which dozens of ACC and Big East and Big Ten coaches manipulate and
maneuver and flat-out beg for a berth, the way downhill North
Carolina is bargaining this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The little conferences, however, are still back in 1974, but at
least the NCAA shows a note of sanity in allowing the smallest
conferences an automatic bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not OK, but it's something we have to deal with,''
Claxton had said.
</P>
<P>
   For Delaware, the only real possibility now is a bid to the
National Invitational Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `The Big Dance is everything,''' Wright had
said. ``I understand, but I'm going to make sure they don't feel
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright has been around. He played at Bucknell without qualifying
and he reached the tournament as an assistant to Rollie Massimino
for five years at Villanova, before losing to Oklahoma in the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Long before that, Wright perched in front of a television set,
watching Maryland and North Carolina State battle for one spot.
Saturday, Hofstra survived that grisly retro tradition. The game
was desperate, the celebration sweet.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, March 12:
</P>
<P>
   And so it has come to pass that after a short but electrifying
primary election campaign, the choice for president in the year
2000 is between two attractive, earnest men of privilege who went
into the family business of politics, and who probably first
shouted at each other in the 1960s across a football stadium at a
Yale-Harvard game. Voters yearning for someone who did not claw his
way up like Bill Clinton should be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that for all their similarities and their shared
desire to command the center, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore are waging a contest between two contrasting
visions long familiar in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech last week, Bush portrayed himself as the
tribune of honor and the individual. He wants lower taxes, more
money for the military and tough standards for schools combined
with greater choice for parents. He would use some of the surplus
to shore up Social Security, but replace it in part with a system
of investment accounts. He portrays Gore as a loyal defender of the
state for the solution to every problem, stifling freedom in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president sees Bush, on the other hand, as a servant of
the affluent and a candidate who would peel the state back from its
proper role in securing the environment, schools and health. The
state, for Gore, is not the enemy of the individual. It is there to
nurture, protect and ensure that Americans are treated fairly,
especially in their earliest years and old age.
</P>
<P>
   These terms should be familiar by now. With their tailored suits
and cowboy boots, the candidates may look alike and even talk
alike. But as a couple, Bush is from Mars and Gore from Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Of course in marriage as in politics, especially in good times,
Americans find some appeal in both visions. Bush is right that the
individual and the entrepreneur are at the center of the American
success story. But Gore is correct that the surpluses lying ahead
offer an extraordinary opportunity to pay down the debt and soften
the harsh inequities dealt by the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The polls show the race to be close. But at the moment they show
Gore as having the edge on the issues, especially on Social
Security, health, schools and the environment. That means that Bush
will have to flesh out what he means by the phrase ``compassionate
conservative'' with more programmatic detail.
</P>
<P>
   On taxes, the governor is surely right to say that the $1
trillion surplus projected for the next 10 years belongs to the
American taxpayers. But so does the $5.5 trillion federal debt, and
the obligation to provide for basic social needs. Bush's speech
after his big primary victories last Tuesday was notable for not
mentioning anything about health care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also dwelled at length about honor, which he said
had been ``exiled'' from the White House for nearly eight years.
There was a theme of restoration about his address that will be
appealing to many Americans after the years of scandals. It cannot
help Gore to be reminded, as he was by recent news stories, of the
failure of the Justice Department to investigate the campaign
fund-raising abuses of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But honor is a tricky issue. Sen. John McCain drew voters to his
cause because he had a record that no one could dismiss. Bush must
overcome deep skepticism over whether the honor he stands for is
deserved, especially after a campaign of scurrilous attacks and his
own unrestrained fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   From their divergent positions, Bush and Gore will be looking
for ways to portray themselves as men of the center and their
opponents as from the fringes of this debate. Their records show
them both to be more nuanced in their approach to government than
the oratory suggests _ Gore as a fiscal conservative and
budget-balancer, Bush as an advocate for more spending on education
and poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the voters will probably decide which basic
impulse about government makes the most sense for a nation that is
prosperous and complacent, put forward by two men with backgrounds
more similar than not.

 &HT;    What did they see the night of the Buckhead slayings?
 &HT;    By Staff Writers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At least nine people have stepped forward to say what
they saw on the night after the Super Bowl, when a fight in
Buckhead led to a pair of fatal stabbings. Baltimore Ravens
football star Ray Lewis and two other men facing murder charges.
Here are the witnesses' statements, drawn from various sources.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Whitehead was at Cobalt, partying with a friends, and left
around closing time.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said he and a woman began walking towards Jelly Rolls,
a club just east of Cobalt, when they saw some men arguing and
shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognized one person in the group, Ray lewis. Lewis was
clearly acting as a peacemaker with the individuals who were
arguing. All the individuals were shorter than Ray. I easily
recognized him, but not the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the argument escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continued down the street near a light pole past the Rose
and Crown Club and I stopped there to talk to this lady,''
Whitehead said. ``From this point I observed the same group next to
the back of the Navigator limousine, which was parked on the street
near some apartments. At that time I saw Ray Lewis restrain one of
the men and was attempting to get everyone from his group into the
limo.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw Lewis ``restraining an individual who I describe
as a shorter, fair-skinned black male. At no time did I see Ray
Lewis hurt or strike anyone. He only acted as a peacemaker in
restraining people from fighting. He tried to get people back into
the limo.''
</P>
<P>
   A second fight broke out on the street corner in front of the
limo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I then left the area and walked back towards the club where my
car was parked,'' Whitehead said. ``I was afraid of possible
gunfire since a previous murder had occurred in that vicinity the
prior Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Ponder, who shot a video of celebrities at Cobalt that
night, described Lewis as a ``peacemaker'' who pulled a friend away
from an argument. Ponder, however, left the area before the two
victims were stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was not involved in the argument but merely stepped over
to pull away a friend, Ponder said. ``He had one friend by the arm
and they went around to the back of the limo and got in the back,''
Ponder testified at Lewis's bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ponder himself also stepped in to urge the participants to knock
it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll change the adjective, but I asked them to, `Let that mess
go, you guys. I just saw a kid last couple of weeks ago die across
the street from the same type stuff,' '' Ponder said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Richard Lollar and Jacinth Baker _ who moments later
were stabbed to death _ were verbally aggressive. ``They wouldn't
back down; they were yelling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said one was about 5-foot-5 and the other shorter. (Baker was
5-foot-3, Lollar was 6-foot-3.)
</P>
<P>
   Ponder drove off before the stabbings. Seconds later, he heard
gun shots.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Keeler lives in a second-floor East Paces Ferry Road
apartment, her bedroom window looking down on the crime scene. She
was startled awake in the middle of the night Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard glass shattering and people screaming and yelling,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed aside her curtain and called 911. The scene unfolded
quickly and was lit by a street light and several business signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two gentleman, the victims, who were getting beaten
up,'' she said. There were four or five men on them, and the
assailants were larger men, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I looked out the window, they were at least
trying to fight back,'' she said, ``and by the time the police get
there, they were already down.''
</P>
<P>
   As the police arrived, the men who had beaten the victims fled
on foot, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She saw a man trying to help one of the victims. Then a handful
of gunshots rang out and the crowd scattered, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ozonu pulled his cab into the intersection of East Paces
Ferry Road and Grandview Avenue and was stunned by what he saw. One
man was being pummeled, another was down and bleeding on the
pavement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was six guys beating up a guy,'' he said. ``There
was a commotion. That means it could have been more people. More
than six.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of the guys started running away (down East Paces Ferry
Road). A body was lying in the street, and a guy was pointing at
him. Talking, talking. His legs were spread, shoulder wide. He was
pointing, `I was warning you. I was warning you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guy kept grabbing him, (saying) `Come on, come on _
let's go.' He was pulling him, (saying) `Let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man standing over the body and pointing was about 6 feet
tall and looked like a weight-lifter, Ozonu said.
</P>
<P>
   Ozonu, who moved to Atlanta from Nigeria 20 years ago, was
interviewed by police at the scene and met again later that morning
with homicide detectives. He has returned to the crime scene with
district attorney's investigators; an investigator stopped at his
apartment to interview him recently while a reporter was there.
</P>
<P>
   Ozonu said he probably couldn't identify the participants, other
than to give a general description. One of those involved in the
beating was so fat he could barely run, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he drove down the block to seek help from a police
officer when he heard shots being fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those people who left in the limo was involved in
this,'' Ozonu said. ``To me, if you weren't involved, why would you
run away?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw many people on the street, but only one who tried
to help.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' high school buddy, Kwame King met his friend in
Charlotte, N.C., en route to Atlanta. He rode with Lewis in the
Lincoln Navigator limousine and stayed with the football star at
the Georgian Terrace Hotel in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   King accompanied Lewis to the Sports Authority store in nearby
Duluth the day before the Super Bowl while Lewis signed autographs
for about two hours. King said another man went along with them _
supposedly Joseph ``Shorty'' Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, King said, he went to a Super Bowl party with Lewis
at the home of one of the football star's friends. They returned to
the Georgian Terrace Hotel in downtown Atlanta at midnight. A short
time later, Lewis, King, two women and two other men piled into the
limousine Lewis had rented and headed to Cobalt.
</P>
<P>
   About 3:30 a.m., the music was turned off and King, Lewis and
their party headed back toward the limo, parked about a block and a
half away.
</P>
<P>
   As they approached the first intersection, King said two men
started to follow them closely. Another man with braids ran up
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Jaye Roberts (who also goes by the name Jessica
Robertson) were getting into the limo with a few other women. Once
inside, King said, he heard a crash, as if someone had been hit
with a bottle or other object. He did not see it happen, however. A
big scuffle started on the limo's passenger side. Lewis then tried
to help Sweeting get into the limo.
</P>
<P>
   King said he saw Lewis at all times and that Lewis continually
tried to get his group back into the limo. He said Lewis never
punched or stabbed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   King said there was still fighting outside the limo as they sped
off. Seconds later, they heard shots being fired at the vehicle and
everyone inside the limo ducked their heads. The right tire of the
limo was shot, so the driver of the limo pulled into a Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   From there the limo passengers took taxis back to The Georgian
Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Fassett, who often drove for Lewis, told police he saw
Lewis involved in an altercation with one of the victims in front
of the limo at the intersection where the stabbings occurred?.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said Lewis was walking back to the limo in a group of at
least three women and six men when one of Lewis' group started
arguing with another group of men.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis tried to shepherd Oakley, who Fassett knew as ``Derby,''
into the limo, and others from Lewis's group also got inside.
Fassett said three men from the second group approached the front
of the limo, intensifying the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the men inside of the limo then poured out of the
vehicle and started fighting with the men, Fassett said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lewis was fighting with one of the victims, as were
``Shorty'' (Sweeting) and Oakley, two men he often picked up at
Lewis's Baltimore home. The altercation ended and members of
Lewis's group rushed back into the limo and the vehicle sped away
as someone fired shots.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said he drove to a nearby Holiday Inn. He told police
Oakley was bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Police said ``a substantial amount'' of blood was found inside
the passenger compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Occupants from the limo were seen cleaning up in a hotel
bathroom, before leaving in various cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Robertson, a Houston resident who met Lewis during Super
Bowl week, told prosecutors that she, Lewis and several others left
Cobalt about 3:30 a.m. and were followed by six men as they walked
toward the limo. She also gave prosecutors nine garment bags of
Lewis's clothing that she said he had asked her o hold for him.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson told police that she, Lewis and the others climbed
into the limo when two men jumped on Sweeting and started fighting
with him near the front of the vehicle. She said Lewis walked over
and pulled the men off Sweeting and tried to get him back into the
limo.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson later said she thought the men were trying to rob
other members of her group because her companions were wearing a
lot of jewelry that night.
</P>
<P>
   In one statement she said a fair-skinned man hit Oakley on the
side of the head with a bottle. She said the assailant wore a blue
Cousey sweater and a black knit cap. In another statement, that
description is omitted.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lewis continued trying to get people into the limo and
she did not see him strike anyone. She said Lewis did not have a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   There were 13 people in the limousine and Lewis sat in the back
with Robertson next to him. He took off his mink coat and put it on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's attorney, Akil Secret, said Robertson described the
limo ride from the stabbing scene as ``pure pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were screaming at (the driver) Duane Fassett to `drive!
Drive!' It seemed like he froze,'' Secret said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said Sweeting sat in the seat next to the driver's
partition. Police said there was a ``substantial amount'' of blood
in the limo. But Robertson said no one talked of a stabbing while
in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   As they drove off, she saw a large black man over 6 feet tall
with braids standing near a parked Honda with a gun in his hand. He
started shooting at the limo as it drove off.
</P>
<P>
   She said that later, back at Lewis' room at the Georgian Terrace
Hotel, Lewis, she and one of his co-defendants saw an early-morning
TV report saying two men had been shot or stabbed in Buckhead.
``You didn't stab anyone, did you?'' Lewis supposedly asked the
co-defendant (whom Secret would not name.)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Shinholster, 28, came to Atlanta from Akron, Ohio, to
party in the Super Bowl atmosphere and went to the Cobalt, where he
met his two hometown buddies who had moved to the area. Shinholster
said he saw no fight inside the club, but left moments before
Lollar and Baker came out of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he walked past Lewis's stretch limousine, but
turned back when he heard Lollar and Baker arguing with Lewis's
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make peace,'' Shinholster said.
</P>
<P>
   He saw one of his friends hit Reginald Oakley over the head with
a Moet champagne bottle. A fight broke out and he turned to Lewis
to ask him to intervene, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you get your boy?'' Shinholster asked Lewis. He said
Lewis was just standing there. Shinholster said he did not see
Lewis holding a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Lollar yelled, ``I've been cut!''
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he did not see the stabber. He has repeatedly
told his story to Atlanta police. ``I've been down to Atlanta three
times already. I'm tired of being interviewed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see who killed them,'' he said. ``I didn't see Ray
Lewis with no knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were my two dudes who died,'' he said. ``I knew them all
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gwen, 25, is a rapper known as Chino Nino. He who came to
Atlanta for the Super Bowl parties and met his friends, Lollar and
Baker, at Cobalt.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen said he was walking on the sidewalk with them when the
fight with Ray Lewis's entourage erupted. Gwen, who is 6-feet-2 and
weighs 160 pounds, said he joined the fight to protect his friends,
who were smaller and outnumbered. He told police Lewis punched his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwen said he fled when he saw an opponent brandish a knife.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Gwen saw his friends lying bleeding in the
street. He ran back and cradled Lollar, crying, ``Wake up! Wake
up!,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy I've got to deal with the rest of my life,''
Gwen said. He would not say who brandished the knives or who
stabbed his friends.
</P>
<P>
   He has, however, told police and prosecutors what he knows. The
next time he tells the entire story will be in court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were my friends. Justice is gonna be served,'' Gwen
said.

   ATLANTA _ At least nine people have stepped forward to say what
they saw on the night after the Super Bowl, when a fight in

big scuffle started on the limo's passenger side. Lewis then tried
to help Sweeting get into the limo.
</P>
<P>
   King said he saw Lewis at all times and that Lewis continually
tried to get his group back into the limo. He said Lewis never
punched or stabbed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   King said there was still fighting outside the limo as they sped
off. Seconds later, they heard shots being fired at the vehicle and
everyone inside the limo ducked their heads. The right tire of the
limo was shot, so the driver of the limo pulled into a Holiday Inn.
</P>
<P>
   From there the limo passengers took taxis back to The Georgian
Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Fassett, who often drove for Lewis, told police he saw
Lewis involved in an altercation with one of the victims in front
of the limo at the intersection where the stabbings occurred?.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said Lewis was walking back to the limo in a group of at
least three women and six men when one of Lewis' group started
arguing with another group of men.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis tried to shepherd Oakley, who Fassett knew as ``Derby,''
into the limo, and others from Lewis's group also got inside.
Fassett said three men from the second group approached the front
of the limo, intensifying the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the men inside of the limo then poured out of the
vehicle and started fighting with the men, Fassett said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lewis was fighting with one of the victims, as were
``Shorty'' (Sweeting) and Oakley, two men he often picked up at
Lewis's Baltimore home. The altercation ended and members of
Lewis's group rushed back into the limo and the vehicle sped away
as someone fired shots.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said he drove to a nearby Holiday Inn. He told police
Oakley was bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Police said ``a substantial amount'' of blood was found inside
the passenger compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Occupants from the limo were seen cleaning up in a hotel
bathroom, before leaving in various cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Robertson, a Houston resident who met Lewis during Super
Bowl week, told prosecutors that she, Lewis and several others left
Cobalt about 3:30 a.m. and were followed by six men as they walked
toward the limo. She also gave prosecutors nine garment bags of
Lewis's clothing that she said he had asked her to hold for him.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson told police that she, Lewis and the others climbed
into the limo when two men jumped on Sweeting and started fighting
with him near the front of the vehicle. She said Lewis walked over
and pulled the men off Sweeting and tried to get him back into the
limo.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson later said she thought the men were trying to rob
other members of her group because her companions were wearing a
lot of jewelry that night.
</P>
<P>
   In one statement she said a fair-skinned man hit Oakley on the
side of the head with a bottle. She said the assailant wore a blue
Cousey sweater and a black knit cap. In another statement, that
description is omitted.
</P>
<P>
   She said Lewis continued trying to get people into the limo and
she did not see him strike anyone. She said Lewis did not have a
knife.
</P>
<P>
   There were 13 people in the limousine and Lewis sat in the back
with Robertson next to him. He took off his mink coat and put it on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's attorney, Akil Secret, said Robertson described the
limo ride from the stabbing scene as ``pure pandemonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were screaming at (the driver) Duane Fassett to `drive!
Drive!' It seemed like he froze,'' Secret said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said Sweeting sat in the seat next to the driver's
partition. Police said there was a ``substantial amount'' of blood
in the limo. But Robertson said no one talked of a stabbing while
in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   As they drove off, she saw a large black man over 6 feet tall
with braids standing near a parked Honda with a gun in his hand. He
started shooting at the limo as it drove off.
</P>
<P>
   She said that later, back at Lewis' room at the Georgian Terrace
Hotel, Lewis, she and one of his co-defendants saw an early-morning
TV report saying two men had been shot or stabbed in Buckhead.
``You didn't stab anyone, did you?'' Lewis supposedly asked the
co-defendant (whom Secret would not name.)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Shinholster, 28, came to Atlanta from Akron, Ohio, to
party in the Super Bowl atmosphere and went to the Cobalt, where he
met his two hometown buddies who had moved to the area. Shinholster
said he saw no fight inside the club, but left moments before
Lollar and Baker came out of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he walked past Lewis's stretch limousine, but
turned back when he heard Lollar and Baker arguing with Lewis's
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make peace,'' Shinholster said.
</P>
<P>
   He saw one of his friends hit Reginald Oakley over the head with
a Moet champagne bottle. A fight broke out and he turned to Lewis
to ask him to intervene, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you get your boy?'' Shinholster asked Lewis. He said
Lewis was just standing there. Shinholster said he did not see
Lewis holding a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Lollar yelled, ``I've been cut!''
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he did not see the stabber. He has repeatedly
told his story to Atlanta police. ``I've been down to Atlanta three
times already. I'm tired of being interviewed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see who killed them,'' he said. ``I didn't see Ray
Lewis with no knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were my two dudes who died,'' he said. ``I knew them all
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gwen, 25, is a rapper known as Chino Nino. He who came to
Atlanta for the Super Bowl parties and met his friends, Lollar and
Baker, at Cobalt.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen said he was walking on the sidewalk with them when the
fight with Ray Lewis's entourage erupted. Gwen, who is 6-feet-2 and
weighs 160 pounds, said he joined the fight to protect his friends,
who were smaller and outnumbered. He told police Lewis punched his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Gwen said he fled when he saw an opponent brandish a knife.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Gwen saw his friends lying bleeding in the
street. He ran back and cradled Lollar, crying, ``Wake up! Wake
up!,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy I've got to deal with the rest of my life,''
Gwen said. He would not say who brandished the knives or who
stabbed his friends.
</P>
<P>
   He has, however, told police and prosecutors what he knows. The
next time he tells the entire story will be in court, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were my friends. Justice is gonna be served,'' Gwen
said.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: HOW A BLACK MAN'S WALLET BECOMES A `GUN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my fiancee's teen-age son pleaded for a cell phone, his
mother and I came back with an emphatic ``no.'' Like most people
raising children, we want him to spend less time on the phone and
more on his studies.
</P>
<P>
   But we also reminded him that he is a black teen-ager in New
York City, where people of his description _ 6 feet 2, 200 pounds,
with braids and the currently fashionable baggy pants _ attract
disproportionate attention from wary citizens and the police.
</P>
<P>
   We do not want him mistaken for a drug dealer in the marginal
neighborhoods he passes through in his travels around Brooklyn. Nor
do we want him reaching into his pocket at some inopportune moment
for an implement that in the bad lighting of a subway entrance
might be mistaken for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Call it paranoid if you like. But the safety issues surrounding
young black males in any big city are many and complex _ and
include the inevitable worries about disastrous encounters with the
police. These worries have risen sharply of late, given the
convergence in the press of three unnerving cases involving police
misconduct and brutality, all of whose victims are black and
Latino.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the scene of the latest scandal, about 70
officers are under investigation for perjury, evidence tampering
and, in a few cases, attempting to murder suspects. New York has
just witnessed the conclusions of two sensational police trials,
one focused on the police torture of the Haitian immigrant Abner
Louima, the second involving the shooting death of an unarmed
African immigrant named Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Black parents have always told their children to shut up, keep
still and keep their hands in plain view when approached by the
police. But as an immigrant from Africa, Diallo had received no
such preparation. When the police approached, he reached for his
wallet _ perhaps in an attempt to identify himself _ which turned
out to be the last move he made.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the officers were acquitted of murder,
demonstrators in New York have waved billfolds in the air, chanting
``It's a wallet, not a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ most recently New Republic
magazine _ attributed Diallo's death to unequal enforcement of the
law through the city's ``stop and frisk'' program, in which
plainclothes officers sweep through minority neighborhoods,
rousting people whom they find ``suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``stop and frisk'' has faults was illustrated in a striking
report last December by New York state's attorney general that
showed that blacks were more than twice as likely to be stopped as
whites _ even when taking into account higher crime rates in
minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of the reports filed by the officers after each stop
found that less than a third of those black people fit the
description of the suspect being sought. This suggests very
strongly that the officers were stopping black people at random,
based on race alone.
</P>
<P>
   Such disparities are clearly unacceptable. But it is just as
clearly true that fatal shootings of minority citizens were a
problem _ and an explosive political issue _ in New York long
before ``stop and frisk'' was instituted. In addition, this problem
has historically transcended localities, administrations and
schools of policing.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the problem is the tendency of white police officers
_ and white Americans generally _ to associate blackness with
criminality in the absence of any substantiating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologist Gordon Allport first showed this effect 50
years ago in his studies on ethnic prejudice. In a particularly
clever experiment, Allport would begin his lecture showing his
undergraduate class two pictures, one of a black man unarmed and
one of a white man holding a knife. At the end of the hour he asked
students to recall what they had seen. Often the knife had migrated
from the white man to the black man, driven by stereotypes that
connect race with criminality.
</P>
<P>
   The point was that racial categories are freighted with negative
meanings that sometimes make us view people as threatening without
cause and that sometimes get us to see things that do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, for example, appears merely to have been standing in the
vestibule of his apartment building. One of the police officers
testified that he was ``slinking'' around that vestibule and said
that he was ``peering'' suspiciously out of the doorway as though
to avoid being seen. It was a short mental step from this sinister
view to seeing the wallet that Diallo pulled from his vest pocket
as a gun.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a crime to have preconceptions based on race. But to
paraphrase the Bronx district attorney, Robert Johnson, they can
indeed kill in the right circumstances. The way out of this problem
is to ensure that officers who police a community actually live in
that community, so that they can tell the difference between the
criminal and the innocent _ and one black person from another.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, those of us with black teen-agers to raise will
continue with our paranoid precautions _ understanding that we are
not really paranoid at all.

THESE DAYS YOU CAN CALL IT REAL E-STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just five years ago, Internet sites relating to real
estate _ to the extent that such sites existed at all _ generally
contained small numbers of property listings, crude search
capabilities and, if the site was truly innovative, links to
mortgage lenders and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are hundreds of thousands of real estate sites on the
Internet, at least one with more than 1.3 million property
listings. Most sites can be searched and culled in myriad ways, and
many large sites also offer a cornucopia of added features,
including links to lenders, credit-reporting agencies, house
inspectors and surveyors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the online loan calculators; appraisal reports;
sale-price histories; school-district statistics; crime reports;
tips for buying, selling and borrowing; and even social and
historical data on neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a simple tool for buyers has evolved into a
whole toolbox. But care must be taken. For instance, the best way
to search for a home may vary from site to site, and using the
wrong search strategy can limit the number of ``hits.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible that by responding to an online listing and
establishing a relationship with the listing broker, you may not be
able to use a different broker to negotiate for you if you decide
you want to buy. And applying for a mortgage online through several
mortgage brokers or lenders, whether out of curiosity or just
because it's easy, can have a negative effect on your credit
rating.
</P>
<P>
   For home buyers, though, the Internet is a powerful tool.
``Imagine being able to search for a home that is within 20 minutes
of your job and that has three bedrooms, two bathrooms and whatever
other amenities you prefer,'' said Nick Karris, a real estate
analyst for Gomez Advisors, an Internet research firm in Lincoln,
Mass. ``Well, you can go to any one of a number of sites on the
Internet and find every house that meets your criteria just by
pushing a button.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two or three years, Karris said, a staggering amount
of real-estate-related information has become accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, consumers who were looking to buy real estate
would get almost all of their information from brokers and from
classified ads,'' he said. ``But now they can get as much
information as they want before they ever even meet with an
agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Inman, the founder of Inman News Features, a real estate
news syndication service in Emeryville, Calif., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until fairly recently, most of the properties that were for
sale in most areas of the country were contained in databases owned
by Multiple Listing Services,'' Inman said. ``And in most cases,
the Realtors hugged their databases so closely that their customers
couldn't even get a peek inside.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet has leveled the playing field, Inman said.
Buyers can electronically cull the listings of most of the houses
for sale in a given area, and it's a rare real estate Web site that
does not also make it possible for buyers to get up-to-the-minute
mortgage rates, calculate mortgage payments for varying amounts at
various rates and then visit an online mortgage broker or lender to
get an application.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of consumers' feeling frustrated and powerless,
the Internet has cracked open the box and let consumers look
inside,'' Inman said, explaining that today, most large Multiple
Listing Services either have their own site or have agreements with
at least one Internet listing site. And many brokerage concerns
also have sites that contain listings that may not be included in a
Multiple Listing Service because the broker has an ``exclusive'' on
the listing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, a broker can't afford not to have an Internet
presence,'' Inman said, ``because the first thing a seller would
say is, `Hey, how come my house isn't listed on the Web?'''
</P>
<P>
   That's why listings are the mainstays of most Internet real
estate sites. By all accounts, the site with the greatest number of
listings is homestore.com, the flagship of a family of
real-estate-related sites that include realtor.com, the official
site of the National Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the biggest database by far,'' said Stuart Wolff, the
chairman of Homestore.com, which operates the realtor.com site with
1.3 million listings and the National Association of Home Builders
site, homebuilder.com, with a listing of about 130,000 new houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also one of the most visited networks in the world,''
Wolff said, explaining that during January alone more than
2,563,000 different users paid a visit to a homestore.com site.
</P>
<P>
   But having lots of listings provides no guarantee that the site
has all listings in a particular area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of areas of the country that are a little
out of whack,'' Wolff said. ``And New York is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff explained that most of the listings on homestore.com are
derived from Multiple Listing Services affiliated with the National
Association of Realtors, so that areas that do not have such pools
of listings from a number of brokers _ notably Manhattan _ may not
be fully represented on the site. Moreover, he said, since
different Multiple Listing Services use different categories, the
success of a search for a particular type of house will vary.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a search for all available single-family houses in
Rutherford, N.J., yielded 21 hits when the search used the
realtor.com's series of increasingly specific area maps. A second
search conducted using only the site's town and state fields
resulted in only three hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to search our site is to use the maps,'' Wolff
said, explaining that because the local Multiple Listing Service
frequently uses the name of the region or a ZIP code rather than
the town name, using the maps will result in the greatest number of
listings. In fact, he said, many buyers prefer to search by
neighborhood rather than by town name anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, the neighborhood is more important than the
house,'' he said. And that is why one of the more popular services
on the site is its ``Find a Neighborhood'' service, which allows
buyers to focus on the type of neighborhood they want to live in by
comparing and weighing factors like the quality of the schools, the
age of the population, social and cultural services and the number
of families with children living nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service is particularly good for first-time buyers,''
Wolff said. ``They can find the kind of neighborhood they want to
live in, they can look for homes in that neighborhood, and then
they can find a professional to show them the homes they like.''

 NEW YORK: they like.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In fact, like other sites that use listings provided by a
Multiple Listing Service, realtor.com generally tries to steer
business to a professional, typically, the listing broker. The site
provides only the brokers' telephone numbers and the MLS numbers
online, but not the addresses of the houses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that poses a problem for buyers who don't want to go
through the listing broker to see the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough for a buyer to play hardball in a seller's
market,'' said Ilyce R. Glink, the author of the newly revised
``100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer Should Ask'' (Times
Business Books). ``But it's even harder when the agent you're
dealing with is the listing broker.''
</P>
<P>
   Glink explained that since most people who are interested in an
Internet listing call or e-mail the listing broker, that could make
it difficult for buyer to later negotiate for the property through
another broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you e-mail five different listing brokers and establish
business relationships with them, you could be setting up five
different `dual agency' situations,'' she said, explaining that a
dual-agency situation occurs when a broker or agent represents both
the buyer and the seller in the same transaction. And that, Glink
said, can end up being a disadvantage for a buyer because the
broker cannot be an advocate for either party.
</P>
<P>
   So she advises prospective buyers to use their own brokers, who
will represent only their interests, instead of calling or
e-mailing listing brokers, and certainly before agreeing to being
taken to see a property by a listing broker.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lessa, a broker at Irwin S. Balch &AMP; Associates Realty in
Mamaroneck, exclusively a buyers-only agency, said that it would be
unusual for a traditional broker to provide buyers with the address
of an Internet listing without having them come into the office
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because they want to be the one to show you the
property,'' Lessa said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out, however, that since most brokers in a given area
are probably members of the same Multiple Listing Service, a broker
representing the buyer can usually provide clients with the address
of an Internet listing from the MLS number usually included with
the listing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can then drive by the house to see whether or not it's
right for them,'' Lessa said, ``and if it is, we can get them in to
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the clearest benefits of the Internet is not for
buyers, but for brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Corcoran, the chairwoman of Corcoran Group, the
Manhattan brokerage company, said that she has been tracking
Internet sales by her agents and brokers since the company first
started using the Internet in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is that a traditional buyer sees about 22
different apartments before making an offer,'' she said. ``But a
buyer who comes to us from the Internet only needs to see about six
apartments before making up his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Corcoran said, buyers who come into her office after
first culling properties on the Internet now account for one in six
of her sales. ``What happens is, most people first go to your Web
site as Peeping Toms, just to look around,'' Corcoran said. ``Then
they start sending you e-mail, and before you know it, they're your
pen pal. And once someone becomes a pen pal, they're probably going
to end up a client.''
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no Multiple Listing Service in Manhattan, and
since the only way to see most apartments, even with your own
broker, is to go through the listing broker, many Manhattan
brokerages will include whatever information they have on a
particular Internet listing, including, in some cases, the address.
</P>
<P>
   ``With most of my properties we give you the address, a
description of the property, floor plans, a photo of the building
itself, multiple photos of the interior, and even the views out the
windows,'' Corcoran said. ``And we've learned that customers find
having all that information very alluring.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since the absence of a Multiple Listing Service in
Manhattan makes it difficult for Internet ``super sites'' to get
listings, buyers in Manhattan have to visit individual broker's Web
sites for listings or browse through the classified advertisements
in the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But even searching the classifieds can now be done online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have between 3,000 and 4,000 listings on our site every
day,'' said Jason R. Krebs, a vice president and the general
manager of nytoday.com, an Internet site owned by Times Company
Digital, a division of The New York Times Co. ``We have all the
listings from the newspaper as well as the direct feeds of the
inventory available from most of the major brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   Krebs explained that prospective buyers who use the nytoday site
can enter search criteria to find apartments of a certain size,
type, price or location.
</P>
<P>
   When the search is submitted, he said, the site searches through
not only the classified ads currently running in The New York Times
newspaper but also through the databases of many of New York's
largest brokerage companies, including Bellmarc, Brown Harris
Stevens, the Corcoran Group, Douglas Elliman, Charles H. Greenthal,
Halstead and Stribling. The brokerage concerns' individual listings
can also be reached directly through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other newspapers that have classified ads online include The
Daily News, Newsday, The New York Post and The Village Voice.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, nyrealty.com offers detailed profiles of about
500 co-op and condominium buildings, as well as maps, details about
recent sales and information about specific neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of listings that will often not appear on sites
that depend on Multiple Listing Services for their inventory are
``For Sale by Owner'' listings, known as FSBO (pronounced fizz-BO)
listings. But that does not mean that such listings cannot be found
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, we have about 20,000 FSBO listings
nationwide,'' said Hans Koch, the chief executive of Owners.com, a
San Francisco company. Sellers who pay $99 can submit a listing and
five photographs. For sellers who buy the $289 Premier Package, a
professional photographer will take pictures of the house, both
inside and out, and the photos are then posted on the Web site,
along with the listing, to provide buyers with an online ``virtual
tour'' of the property.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the owners.com site that is useful to buyers who
choose not to use an agent is its ``Get Prequalified'' section,
which links buyers to online lenders. Once on a lender's site, Koch
said, a buyer can get an estimate of how much money they can
borrow. (The names and Web addresses of a number of sites offering
mortgages and financial services appear in the accompanying
listing.)
</P>
<P>
   But submitting prequalification applications to a number of
online mortgage sites can be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't realize that playing around on the
Internet can have an effect on their credit rating,'' said Stanley
Simon, a real estate lawyer and a partner in Allen, Morris, Troisi
&AMP; Simon in Manhattan. Simon explained that every time a person
applies for credit, whether for a loan, for an increase in a line
of credit or for a mortgage, the lender makes an inquiry about
credit worthiness with at least one of the major credit-reporting
bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Those inquiries, he said, are then noted on the prospective
borrower's credit report. And since the reporting bureaus make a
record of each inquiry, but do not indicate whether credit was
ultimately extended, having a large number of inquiries may lower a
person's overall credit rating, Simon said. So it can be risky to
apply for lots of mortgages simply out of curiosity and because
it's easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to clients is to think twice before clicking that
`Submit' button,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how useful a tool the Internet is or eventually
becomes, it may never completely take over the role traditionally
performed by flesh-and-blood brokers and sales agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at hundreds of listings on the Internet and spent a
lot of time sorting through junk,'' said Mauro Calcano, a Manhattan
executive who with his wife, Isabel, recently searched online for
houses in the New York City area while they were still in London,
where they had lived for five years. ``My wife was diligent about
finding a place with the best school system possible. She was at it
for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Calcano said, the couple stumbled upon Web site for
Irwin S. Balch, the buyers' agency in Mamaroneck that Lessa works
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We e-mailed back and forth maybe 20 or 30 times a week,''
Calcano said, explaining that over a period of about a month the
agency had lined up a couple of dozen houses for them to see in
Westchester County, in and near Rye. But when the couple flew over
and and started looking at the houses, nothing clicked. That's when
Lessa's associate, Laurie Bell, decided to take the Calcanos to see
some new houses being built in Ridgefield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at a set of plans, we looked at the development, and
that was all we needed,'' Calcano said, The couple are now under
contract to buy a five-bedroom house scheduled to be completed in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing missing from the Internet is the human factor,''
Calcano said. ``Without those guys, we never would have found what
we were looking for.''

FINANCING A HOME FOR ZERO DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)  (jw) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As many aspiring home buyers know, to their regret, the biggest
obstacle to ownership can often be the down payment. And while the
percentage needed for a mortgage has dropped in the last 20 years
from the traditional 20 percent to 10, 5 and in some cases even 3
percent, the prices of homes have doubled, tripled and even
quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   Now some large lenders have started to offer zero down payment
mortgages that also allow financing of the closing costs. Some
lenders even make it possible for new owners to leave the closing
with more cash than they had when they walked in _ at the price of
course, of more debt.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Reddam, chief executive officer of DiTech.com, a mortgage
lender in Costa Mesa, Calif., says that what his company calls a
Dream Loan allows home buyers to obtain mortgages for up to 125
percent of the purchase prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This loan is for people who have good credit and strong income
but who have never been able to save enough for a down payment,''
he said. ``It's also for people who feel they have a better use for
their money than tying it up in their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Reddam said that good credit generally referred to a credit
score of 660 or above. The credit score is calculated using factors
like the payment history on other loans, the number of open credit
lines and the type and amount of a person's indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A borrower with sterling credit would have a score above 700,
and a `B' borrower would have a score below 620,'' Reddam said.
``So a person with a score of 660 is in the middle of the range.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having a good credit score, he said, a borrower
seeking a Dream Loan needs a somewhat better income-to-debt ratio
than normally required. In most cases, Reddam said, for a borrower
to qualify for a mortgage, total monthly expenses _ including all
recurring debt payments and the payment on the mortgage being
applied for _ cannot exceed about 38 percent of gross monthly
income. For Dream Loans, however, notwithstanding the
income-to-debt ratio, the borrower must have at least $2,000 a
month left after all bills are paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no application fee, and the actual cost of the loan
depends on the person's credit score and how much over 100 percent
they want to borrow,'' he said, adding that the interest rate also
depends on the amount of the loan, with the current rate for a 125
percent mortgage around 11 percent. The rate for a conventional
mortgage from DiTech, he said, averages around 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another company aggressively marketing zero-equity loans is
Countrywide Home Loans in Calabasas, Calif. ``We give you a
choice,'' said Stephen Brandt, the company's senior vice president.
``You can get either a Zero Down Plus with PMI or an 80/20 No Down,
No PMI.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt said that the Zero Down Plus mortgage is a 103 percent
first mortgage that requires private mortgage insurance. The 80/20
mortgage, he said, is actually two loans _ an 80 percent first
mortgage plus a 20 percent home equity loan.
</P>
<P>
   With the Zero Down Plus mortgage, he said, the extra 3 percent
usually covers the borrower's closing costs. Private mortgage
insurance, typically referred to as PMI, is required on first
mortgages for more than 80 percent of a home's value. The insurance
_ paid for by the borrower as part of the monthly mortgage costs _
provides the additional security needed for lenders to be able to
sell such loans to institutional investors on the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt said that the principal and interest payments on a
$250,000 Zero Down Plus mortgage for 30 years at 8.875 percent _
the current rate _ would be $1,989 a month. Private mortgage
insurance on the part of the mortgage that exceeds 80 percent of
the home's value, he said, would add $203 a month, making the total
payment $2,192.
</P>
<P>
   The company's other zero-down offering works differently. Since
the 80 percent first mortgage is considered a conforming loan,
meaning that it conforms to the standards set by Fannie Mae and
others who buy the loans from the issuers, then repackage them in
pools of securities for purchase by investors, there is no
requirement for PMI. But while the interest rate charged on the
first mortgage is still 8.875 percent, the interest rate charged on
the second mortgage _ in essence, a home equity loan _ is 12.875
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The first mortgage, for $200,000 at 8.875 percent, would require
monthly payments of $1,591; the home equity loan, for $50,000 at
12.875 percent, would cost $559 a month. The total, $2,150 a month,
is $42 a month less than the mortgage that requires PMI.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt said that while the Zero Down Plus loan allows financing
of the closing costs, the PMI portion of the monthly payment was
not tax deductible. On the other hand, he said, with the 80/20
loan, in most cases the interest on both the first and second
mortgages would be deductible.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the catch?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these loans can be extremely risky,'' said Gerri
Detweiler, education adviser for Credit Counselors of America and a
co-author with Marc Eisenson of ``Slash Your Debt'' (The Financial
Literacy Center, Kalamazoo, Mich., 1999). ``If the value of your
house drops, or even if it just doesn't increase, you could be in
big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Detweiler said that since only a small portion of the monthly
payment is applied to the principal in the early years of a
mortgage, a homeowner could end up having to sell a house for less
than the outstanding balance on the loan. That could easily happen
with a home that has a 125 percent mortgage, she said, and is even
possible for a home with a 100 percent mortgage when the costs of
the sale are considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything happens to your income stream, or you have to move
unexpectedly, you're stuck,'' Detweiler said. ``You have no
breathing room. You may never get out from under.''

 &HT;    Bush campaign expected to expand for the fall
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush, shifting into general-election
gear, is exploring ways to expand his Austin campaign operation
even as he prepares to install a loyalist at the Republican
National Committee in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Bush aide said Friday that the campaign will install a,
``general chairman type, obviously somebody senior and somebody
close to the governor,'' at the RNC, before turning its attention
to the Austin staff. The aide said such a move is customary for the
presumptive nominee, but declined to say whom who the RNC pick will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Bush will ``expand the circle of advisers,
bringing in new people to fill new slots,'' the aide said. Changes
will include hiring one or more staffers to do formal, senior-level
outreach to coalitions across the country. The 1992 campaign of
Bush's father and Dan Quayle had a division devoted to reaching out
to teachers and other constituencies. That campaign also had a
congressional liaison, a position now unfilled on the Bush staff.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, losses in New Hampshire, Michigan and Arizona
prompted speculation about more substantial changes, specifically
about how campaign manager Joe Allbaugh, communications director
Karen Hughes and key political strategist Karl Rove would fare
after the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   The three stalwarts have formed Bush's inner circle since he
first ran for governor in 1994. Bush's recent victories vindicated
Rove's strategy of spending deeply, establishing campaign
operations in every state and never deviating from a deep tax cut
message reminiscent of the Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   But victory came at a price. Anticipating trouble on the right
from millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, the campaign missed the
threat posed by Arizona Sen. John McCain, whose success with
moderates and Democrats posed the real challenge. McCain exploited
Bush's speech at Bob Jones University, an evangelical institution
with an anti-Catholic philosophy, drowning out his compassionate
conservative message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has won the thing but he has won at a very high price,''
said Paul Begala, a former aide to President Clinton. ``He has
tacked much too far to the radical right. ... You will be seeing
television ads featuring Jerry Falwell praising Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain challenge also forced the Bush campaign to spend most
of its $70 million. Bush will soon turn his attention to a series
of scheduled fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath, the Republican National Committee member from New
Hampshire, said he expects the campaign to broaden its base of
advisers but does not anticipate ``a fundamental reshaping of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have always planned that this is going to be a
very, very close general election,'' Rath said. ``There is relative
prosperity in this country, peace abroad nationally. These make for
tough times to be the change agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala said he believes the campaign will have to rethink its
strategy as it goes up against Gore, a fierce competitor who ``went
through a very painful, wrenching period of change,'' and emerged
with ``one clear strategy designed to win the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bush has reinvented himself and placed himself in
the hands of whatever local there was in each state and let them
define him ...'' Begala said. ``You can't keep doing this.
</P>
<P>
   But Rath defends the results: ``Let's not forget that these guys
won. At the end of the day, that's what matters.''

TV SPORTS: SEEKING INSIGHT, NOT AN INTRUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world did not end in 1997 when Fox Sports inadvertently let
the world hear Yankees Manager Joe Torre curse on national
television. It was the second season that Fox equipped managers and
coaches with miniature microphones, and a technician let the taped
comment slip onto the air.
</P>
<P>
   Torre felt betrayed _ he was told he wouldn't be embarrassed _
but after Fox's apology, he consented to be wired again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Almost exactly a year later, in a Yankee game against Boston,
Fox caught Torre narrating a Mo Vaughn fly ball: ``I don't think he
got all of it. I'm sure he didn't get all of it.'' When the ball
landed in the right field bleachers, he lightheartedly said, ``I'm
wrong, he got all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The miking of players, coaches and officials has never been like
the National Security Agency listening in on private telephone
conversations. If there have ever been shocking remarks, I've never
heard them. Sometimes they illuminate, like demystifying the
manager-pitcher-catcher mound chats.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they're ``ear candy,'' said Ed Goren, executive producer
of Fox Sports, like a first-base coach reminding a base runner not
to be picked off.
</P>
<P>
   So it's strange to hear National Basketball Association coaches
and players whine, as if they fear being subject to an illegal
search and seizure, about new league requirements that coaches wear
tiny microphones and that cameras show team locker rooms at
half-time on NBC and Turner Sports' telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it negatively impacts the coach, because you now have
to really monitor what you say,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, these rules are turning into labor issues about
working conditions. Lighten up, guys. Keep your shorts on.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and Turner started wiring coaches and lead officials earlier
in the season on a voluntary basis, and not for every game. Some
coaches have resisted, including one who removed his mike during
the second half of a Turner broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever has been said is used only on tape, and nothing
with profanity or strategy is heard. That doesn't leave a lot for
delicate flowers to complain about or create grounds to change how
one speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little window dressing and an inside look or listen,''
said Mike Pearl, executive producer of Turner Sports. ``When we go
to commercial and can show the locker room, it tells fans things
are still going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty five years ago, Pearl, then at CBS Sports, said the
network's hand-held cameras boldly joined NBA huddles during
timeouts. ``We got away with it for a while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has so far wired coaches and referees for seven
regular-season games and the All-Star Game. Miraculously, the
league hasn't folded.
</P>
<P>
   During a Houston game, NBC's microphone on Rudy Tomjanovich
caught the Rockets' coach uttering something that sounded like
``Kapoya,'' his exuberant reaction to a three-point shot.
</P>
<P>
   But what began as an experiment in rightly enhancing telecasts
has gone too far. Starting Sunday, the league will require that
both coaches wear the microphones and will levy fines of at least
$100,000 if they refuse.
</P>
<P>
   The two-coach mandate is excessive and the fine ridiculous.
Baseball requires that team managers or coaches be wired for sound.
Those managers who don't want to be wired can hand the obligation
over to a coach who has nothing to say. Simple. Fines up to
$100,000 can be levied if everyone refuses.
</P>
<P>
   In wiring game participants, the networks understand the need
for propriety. If they don't use the taped sound bites carefully,
they can lose access.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to a level of trust with the league that we'll
be judicious,'' said Jed Drake, ESPN's vice president of remote
production.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than have a rigid policy on miking, the National Hockey
League works to accommodate the networks' requests to wire players,
coaches or officials.
</P>
<P>
   To hear an NHL linesman caution a goalie on ESPN, ``Watch that
stick or the next time, we'll call a penalty,'' is instructive.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League is far more restrictive. No coaches
or players can be wired _ a privilege reserved for NFL Films
productions _ but one player on each team can be wired during
warm-ups, with the team's permission. Fox, CBS, ABC and ESPN are
also allowed into locker rooms before games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grab a little footage and we're out in a few minutes,''
Goren said, ``just so you get a little feel for the atmosphere in a
locker room before a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of the access have been minimal and far from
revealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind-the-scene shots in the locker room are interesting, but
not particularly insightful,'' Drake said. ``But they show the
ordinary preparations leading up to a game.'' And they're recorded
without sound.
</P>
<P>
   Goren said he'd love to tape conversations between head coaches
and offensive coordinators to show how a play worked, or to tape
the coaches' booth to hear what a coordinator says after he has
called a play for a touchdown. ``There's got to be some emotion up
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drake said that wiring NFL players in warm-ups has yielded
insightful or amusing bits from Minnesota's John Randle and San
Francisco's Steve Young. On Fox, Goren recalls Darrell Green,
Washington's veteran cornerback, giving a pregame pep talk to a
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   So it's time for folks like Jeff Van Gundy to relax. Only
wealthy courtside denizens can really hear what you're saying. And
they don't have microphones.

REAL ESTATE: USING WEB PAGES TO WEAVE AN INFORMATION NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In pressing to adapt their operating methods to the
opportunities presented by the Internet, real estate services
companies are finding themselves making use of some of the
techniques of the dot-com companies that have become their
important customers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, technologies that seemed advanced just a few
years ago, such as e-mail, are being displaced by systems that
place on a World Wide Web site all the information needed to manage
property, describe available space or process transactions, with
passwords providing a hierarchy of access.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Internet companies we deal with would laugh at us if
we wanted to fax a document,'' said Matthew P. Barlow, an executive
managing director at Julien J. Studley, a company that specializes
in representing office tenants. ``The pace of deals is faster
today, and we don't want to miss opportunities because of our
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are using their Internet capabilities as a
marketing tool. Insignia/ESG, a large commercial-services company
that also manages 65,000 condominium and co-op apartments in New
York, recently launched EdificeRex.com, a portal to Web pages. The
site enables residents of the apartments to access services that
include reserving tables at popular restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Insignia/ESG said it intends to broaden the portal to include
the commercial side of its business. Andrew I. Farkas, the
company's chairman, said the combination of technology and original
content can give a company a competitive advantage in businesses
like property management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology itself is not necessarily the driving factor,'' he
said. ``The driving factor is combining technology with content to
create e-business models in every place where you are operating
traditional business models.'' He said developing the features of
EdificeRex was ``orders of magnitude'' more difficult than applying
it to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Technology can be a marvelous filing cabinet. Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield, which manages 35 million square feet of property,
recently formed a joint venture with Business Integration Group of
Tempe, Ariz., to offer its clients a Web-based property management
service it is calling ``e-real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Santora, Cushman &AMP; Wakefield's executive managing
director for asset services, said the system is intended to reduce
confusion and duplication by placing all the information regarding
the company's management portfolio on one central database.
</P>
<P>
   Other people have packages to do preventive maintenance,
computer drawings and lease abstracts, he said, but ``none of them
talk to each other.'' Another problem, he said, was that local
offices measure things in different ways, so the data they produce
is often difficult to compare with the results from other
locations.
</P>
<P>
   The communications abilities of the Web permit all this data to
be stored in powerful computers called servers that can be accessed
from almost anywhere. ``You don't need any special programs, you
just go to the Internet and you are in,'' Santora said. ``Clients
in hotel rooms worldwide can get access to their information.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some clients might get uneasy knowing their
confidential financial information is in the same place as their
competitors', Ron Savage, the chief executive of the Business
Integration Group, said the company's fire-wall and password system
means that only authorized people have access. ``We have had two
audits and we work with the security people of the companies that
use the system,'' he said. ``It's like online banking.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a well-organized central database connected to the Web
allows brokers and other executives to concentrate on getting deals
done without having to keep track of paper or electronic files,
said Michael A. Cohen, director of leasing for Williams Real Estate
Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have an assignment to dispose of 100 properties from a
company that wants to get them off its balance sheet,'' he said.
``With a central repository, you have a separate folder for each
transaction, with photos of the property, floor plans, financial
analysis and so on. That information is available to the client and
the broker on the case anytime, anywhere in the world via the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage, he said, is that the systems can be designed
to keep track of documents and the sequence in which they have been
generated and how they have been altered. ``It can tell me if I
have a copy of the most recent offer on a property, which is
important if you are doing 50 to 100 transactions a year,'' he
said. ``And I don't have to ask for information. It's there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is a tool that makes things work better,'' said
Heather Shively, chief executive of Capital Thinking, a New
York-based company that matches owners and brokers with mortgage
lenders through the Web. But she said that the heart of the
30-person company, which started operating this month, is real
estate professionals who know how to structure proposals in a way
that meets the underwriting standards established by lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is not there to replace people,'' she said.
``We understand lenders and we have relationship managers who work
with them. We want them to see nice clean deals coming from us.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Executives at Studley have established a three-level electronic
communications system. One is an Intranet for internal company use;
another, called the Ultranet, is for use by brokers and clients;
the third is a public Web page to be used as a sales tool by
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The public Web page, still in development, will feature
time-sensitive graphics, among other things. Someone visiting the
site in the middle of the night will see a home page that has a
nighttime sky with stars. Visitors at 6 a.m. will see dawn, those
at 6 p.m. will see dusk.
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than fancy graphics. The site will list property
for sale or lease and the space needs of clients. And it will be an
automated tip service for brokers. ``The Web site will be a
marketing tool for brokers,'' said Jeffrey D. Hipschman, chief
information officer for the company. ``It will send notification
back to the broker if a client visits the site looking for
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Hipschman said the company uses its Intranet to keep track of
employees, and as a way of storing an inventory of their skills.
``If we need an expert on land assembly, we can find one quickly
using the system,'' he said. He said the site contains information
on recent deals so brokers and executives can keep track of the
state of the markets in the cities where Studley has offices.
</P>
<P>
   But he said there has been an effort to keep the approach
light-handed to make the net attractive to people not weaned on
technology. One page is devoted to competitor information, often a
euphemism for rumors. ``People can post the latest rumor,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A central repository for information, he said, is a step up from
e-mail, and is likely to replace it. ``This way everyone involved
can share information, rather than sending point-to-point
e-mails,'' he said. ``With this system, everybody is working off
the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   And having all the data on properties organized in files makes
it easier to find obscure but essential documents with a few clicks
of a mouse, said Santora of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield. ``I can drill into
a rent file to find the underlying legal documents,'' he said. ``In
New York a lease can run to 500 or 600 pages. I can click on rent
and go right to the lease file.''
</P>
<P>
   With information on space availability becoming much more
readily available, and with companies popping up offering to match
landlords with prospective tenants, some of the information that
has been jealously guarded by brokers seems to be slipping into the
public domain.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen of Williams said brokers would not be replaced by
computers. Instead, he said, their role will change. ``More
information will be available, but it will not take out the need
for someone to negotiate a transaction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think brokers will become more like consultants than people
whose job it is to find space,'' he said. ``They will help
companies plan their real estate strategies, the way lawyers and
accountants advise them now.''

 &HT;    Realignment consensus not near
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kissimmee, Fla. _ For all the happy talk, commissioner Bud Selig
has some appeasing to do before his radical realignment plan comes
up for consideration next month.
</P>
<P>
   There is cronyism in the air as well as some short-sightedness.
Selig is returning some calls but not others. This issue hasn't
been settled easily in the past. It is worthwhile to remember that
the last time baseball re-sorted itself, Selig finally threw his
team, the Milwaukee Brewers, into the fire, jumping leagues just to
effect the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are several plans under consideration, in brief,
Tampa Bay would jump to the National League while Arizona would
move to the American. This would enable the Texas Rangers to move
into the geographically preferable AL Central. The NL's refitting
for four divisions would eliminate the wild card, somewhat odd
after MLB swooned over its effectiveness the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves would leave the NL East _ and the New York Mets _ for
a Southeast Division that might include Florida, Tampa Bay and
perhaps St. Louis. And here, things break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming it's a typo,'' Cardinals president Mark Lamping
griped. ``If you believe the thinking that regional rivalries are
important, how can you possibly separate the Cardinals and the
Cubs? You just don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig agreed and let the Cards know in a phone call, intimating
that the Cardinals, Cubs and Brewers would remain in the same
division. USA Today, which printed the new alignments, mistakenly
reversed Cincinnati with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Colangelo is still watching his phone. The Arizona
Diamondbacks general managing partner, Colangelo is working hard to
prevent his club from being uprooted, primarily because Phoenix
likes things the way they are. An Arizona poll of season ticket
holders and single-ticket buyers shows that between 65 to 85
percent of people attending Diamondbacks games want the team to
remain in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo, who counts Selig as a friend, has heard nothing from
the commissioner, hardly the best way to build consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support it and I particularly support it because it does
away with the wild card in the NL,'' Cincinnati general manager Jim
Bowden said, whose club lost a one-game playoff to New York. ``Last
year we had the problem that if you tie, you don't know where
you'll play the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one team would make it and one wouldn't for various
reasons. Some nuances I didn't like. It's just better if a team has
to win the division to get into the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like it's every team for itself, except for the expansion
franchises, which can be moved without their permission. The vote
comes up at baseball's quarterly meeting April 18 in Houston. A
simple majority in both leagues is required for passage, that being
the solution's only simple part.
</P>
<P>
   THE PHILLIES' BIG QUESTION
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia second baseman Marlon Anderson (.252, 11 errors)
has become the biggest question mark in the Phillies daily lineup.
Although management says he is the second baseman of the future
until proved otherwise, Anderson's every play is being scrutinized
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his opinion, third base coach John Vukovich recalled an
opinion first issued by former Phillies manager Paul Owens. ``It's
like Pope used to say,'' Vukovich said. ``You can lead a horse to
water. But you can't make him float on his back.''
</P>
<P>
   JIMYWOCKY
</P>
<P>
   Then there is this from Boston manager Jimy Williams, after
observing that Japanese pitcher Tomo Okha was rushing his delivery
last week when he gave up six hits and six runs while retiring just
one hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had 45 seconds in his minute,'' Williams said. ``Kind of
like a New York minute, but he's from Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME
</P>
<P>
   New Indians owner Larry Dolan observed Cuban defector Danys Baez
at Cleveland's Winter Haven camp and could see for himself that his
$14.5 million investment is hardly ready for the majors. The
22-year-old might open the season at Class AA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danys is just getting broken in,'' said Indians manager
Charlie Manuel, having returned to the team after colon surgery.
``This is a great experience for him. He has a lot of potential,
but he's going to have to develop more consistency with all his
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI AGENDA
</P>
<P>
   Reds captain Barry Larkin, who a year ago was asking to be
traded, has already seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a matter of whether we will win the division,'' he
said. ``It is a matter of by how many games.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Former Braves left-hander Kent Mercker arrived in Anaheim to
find himself a savior. He is the only Angels starter with a winning
1999 record (8-5). The rest of the projected rotation _ Ken Hill,
Tom Candiotti, Ramon Ortiz and Jerrod Washburn _ was a combined
22-30.... Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall has been so impressive in his
comeback from a shattered ankle that manager Gene Lamont ditched
his plan to play him every other day in the early stages of camp.
He started three games in a row last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' Omar Daal might be the only man to find a
benefit from the December flooding in his native Venezuela. Limited
to one inning of winter ball because of the disaster, Daal hit camp
with a very fresh arm. ``As soon as I threw in the bullpen three
times, I feel more power in my body and more relaxed,'' he said....
In the Rangers camp, Tom Evans is beating out prized prospect Mike
Lamb in the scramble for Todd Zeile's vacated spot at third
base....
</P>
<P>
   Cubs management has all but conceded that right-hander Kerry
Wood will open the season on the disabled list. He began throwing a
curve only last Monday (50 feet, flat ground) and his first spring
start has been delayed to next weekend. Target comeback date: April
18-20 in Montreal.... The New York Mets expect to get third baseman
Robin Ventura back on the field late this week but progress from
shoulder surgery is slow. Ventura has been used thus far strictly
as a DH.

DUKE HITS LONG NOTES TO REACH THE FINAL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARRY JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Duke built one of modern college basketball's
most successful programs on the strength of its defense. But
Saturday afternoon it was a 3-point shooting barrage in the second
half that carried the Blue Devils to a hard-fought 82-73 victory
over Wake Forest in the semifinals of the 47th annual Atlantic
Coast Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Blue Devils, who improved to 26-4, made 13 field
goals in the second half, nine of them 3-pointers, as they held off
repeated challenges by fifth-seeded Wake Forest, which fell to
17-14.
</P>
<P>
   The victory put Duke into Sunday's 1 p.m. championship game,
where it will face the winner of Saturday's second semifinal
between North Carolina State and Maryland, the only ACC team to
defeat the Blue Devils in the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest held a 41-36 lead with 18 minutes 50 seconds to go
on a layup by guard Robert O'Kelley. But Duke, sluggish and
frequently short on its shots, came alive offensively and took
control for keeps.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils mounted a 14-2 run, culminating in a 50-43 lead
on a free throw by the all-conference forward Chris Carrawell with
12 minutes 15 seconds to go. Wake Forest, which began forcing
shots, was still within 55-51 midway through the half when Duke
again erupted.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Devils pushed their edge to 63-53, their largest
of the game, on a 3-pointer by forward Nate James, who had 14
points and played tenacious defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest responded with 5 unanswered points, closing to 63-58
on a 3-pointer by guard Josh Howard with 7:34 left. But the Duke
barrage continued, as five of its players scored in double figures,
including guard Jason Williams, who had 16 points and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest, winner of three straight, showed uncommon poise
against the Blue Devils, and led by 37-36 at halftime. Duke had
previously been 3-3 when trailing at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Deacons quickly took the lead as all five starters scored in
the opening four minutes, and kept the Blue Devils off balance with
rugged defensive play inside. Forced to the perimeter, Duke, the
ACC's most accurate 3-point shooting club, missed five of its first
six attempts from long range. For the half, the Blue Devils made
only 37.1 percent from the floor, while Wake Forest hit 53.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duke remained within a basket for the game's first six
minutes. Then Wake Forest went on a tear, scoring on seven of its
next 11 possessions, capped by a penetrating jumper by Howard to
push the lead to 28-20 with 7:29 remaining in the first half. That
matched the Deacons' biggest lead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils responded by turning to guard Mike Dunleavy and
forward Shane Battier, who led his team with 18 points. With each
scoring inside and out, Duke went on a 12-2 run. The burst was
capped by a Dunleavy layup at the 4:44 mark, giving the nation's
second-ranked team a 32-30 advantage, its first since the game's
opening basket.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy, a freshman reserve who returned to action on Thursday
after missing four games because of mononucleosis, led all scorers
with a dozen points in the half.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike in its first two meetings with the Blue Devils, which
it lost by an average margin of 16 points, Wake Forest took the
blow, kept its composure and regained the lead, 37-34, on a
3-pointer by Howard with 1:38 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Duke finished first outright in the conference during the
regular season for the fourth consecutive year, a feat matched only
once in ACC history _ by Vic Bubas' Blue Devils of 1963-66, led by
Art Heyman, Jeff Mullins, Jack Marin and Bob Verga.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Krzyzewski's Blue Devils also won the ACC tournament
last season. Not since David Thompson and Tom Burleson starred for
North Carolina State in 1973 and 1974 has a program won the
regular-season race and the league tournament two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing first earned Duke a day's rest under the format
adopted by the ACC in 1998. On Thursday, the Blue Devils defeated
ninth-seeded Clemson, 94-63, setting a tournament record by hitting
17 of 29 attempts from 3-point range.

AFTER ANOTHER OPERATION, ANOTHER COMEBACK FOR CANSECO
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Ask Jose Canseco about home runs, and he
talks about health. Ask him about his place in the batting order,
and he talks about health. Ask him about the weather, and he talks
about health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be healthy and play every day,'' said Canseco,
35. ``I don't think about numbers. I think about staying healthy.
I'm healthy. That's my main concern.''
</P>
<P>
   For good reason. Injuries have wreaked havoc on Canseco's
career. He has hit 431 home runs, but he has missed 30 percent of
his teams' games the past 11 seasons, since he was the American
League's most valuable player in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is a little mathematics,'' Canseco said.
``I'd have about 550 home runs right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canseco, now Tampa Bay's designated hitter, immediately put
his projection in perspective. ``There are a lot of players in
history probably that would have had more stats if they hadn't been
injured,'' he said. ``But injuries are part of the game, and part
of this game is if you have the talent and ability, you have to
stay injury free. You have to be in the lineup every day and pile
up those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco had 31 home runs when he had to undergo back surgery in
the middle of last season. Sammy Sosa had 32 home runs at the time,
Ken Griffey Jr. had 28, Mark McGwire had 27. Canseco could have
been right with them in pursuit of McGwire's record, but he does
not lament his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was hard for me to accept,'' he said, discussing his
injuries, ``I wouldn't be able to bounce back the way I bounce back
or have the urge to play the way I play. I'm just happy I have the
ability to come back as I have and to have been able to put these
numbers together as I have. If I get 500 or 600 home runs, I'll
probably go down with the most home runs compared to the most
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco is the opposite of Cal Ripken Jr. ``I can't fathom Cal
Ripken Jr., who's my size and who plays a position that's so
demanding,'' he said. ``I can't imagine that streak he had. To me,
that's impossible. That's not of this planet. I have enough trouble
staying healthy for one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Canseco thought of his former brother in bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe if Mark McGwire were healthy, he'd hit a
thousand,'' he said. McGwire has had his own run of injuries.
Without them, he, too, would have many more home runs, as if 522
isn't an impressive number itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be one of the superstars in the game,'' Canseco said, ``I
think one criteria has to be health. McGwire's probably one of the
few who have ever overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   What About Quinn?
</P>
<P>
   Sign of an improving team: Mark Quinn cannot break into the
Kansas City Royals' outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn is a 25-year-old rookie who won minor league batting
titles each of the past two seasons, then staged a spectacular
three-week performance with the Royals last September. After
hitting .360 for Omaha of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, Quinn
batted .333 in the major leagues, hitting six home runs in 60
at-bats and producing an astronomical .733 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Royals' outfield is filled with Jermaine Dye in right,
Carlos Beltran in center and Johnny Damon in left. What to do with
Quinn?
</P>
<P>
   ``Quinny would have to make the club as a designated hitter or
part-time designated hitter,'' Manager Tony Muser said. ``I'm not
in favor of sitting Quinny on the big league level. I think he's
still on the development side. He's hit everywhere he's been. He
had a nice September with us last year. I want him to keep working
hard, push his way into that outfield defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Muser said he was reluctant to have a player as young as Quinn
be the DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labels are funny in this game,'' he said. ``All of a sudden,
boom, you're a designated hitter. I've seen Mark improve his
defense dramatically over the last two years. If he DH's and
doesn't play much in the outfield, that progress is probably going
to come to a halt. We'll have to see how this plays out. We know we
have a talented offensive guy there.''
</P>
<P>
   What about first base? The Royals do not have a natural first
baseman. Why not teach Quinn that position?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thought about that,'' Muser said. ``I told him to bring
a first baseman's glove to spring training. But we've got one
project under way right now with Sweeney. For right now, two
projects would be a little too much for us to handle. I'm not
saying he couldn't do it. I'm just saying we've made a commitment
to Michael and we'll stay with that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney had been a part-time catcher for the Royals until
they decided they had seen enough of him behind the plate and made
him a first baseman for the last four months of last season. He
solidified his presence there by batting .322 and driving in 102
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' Lament
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds lost the wild-card spot in last year's
National League playoffs in a 5-0 loss to the Mets in a playoff
game. Or did they? Jack McKeon, the Reds manager, cited not the
last game of their season but the first series of the season as the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that opening series against the Giants, we had the lead
every game,'' McKeon recalled. ``One game it was a six-run lead and
our bullpen couldn't hold it. They walked everybody. Here we had a
bunch of young kids who had performed a little bit the year before.
But now opening day they go out and they don't want to get hit.
They're afraid and they walk everybody and blow the leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look back and say if we had won just one of those games we
would have been in the playoffs. Now those same guys have the
experience. Opening series this year, you won't see us walk those
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moving Would Be No Bargain
</P>
<P>
   If a realignment plan under consideration is adopted, there
would be good news and bad news for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. They
would be leaving the American League, meaning they wouldn't have to
play their division-mate Yankees 18 times (good news), but (bad
news) they would go to the National League, be in the same division
with the Atlanta Braves and play them 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be one of the better teams in baseball, you're
going to have to beat teams like that.'' Larry Rothschild, the
Devil Rays' manager, said. ``When I was with the Marlins in '97, we
beat the Braves. It's the way the game is. That's the way it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy to Oblige
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, the Minnesota Twins manager, said that managers
received a memo earlier in the spring from Sandy Alderson, the
chief of baseball operations in the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us to make sure that when we had road games we took
enough regulars,'' Kelly related. ``I was going to send him an
e-mail telling him if he would tell me who my regulars are I'd be
happy to take enough of them for each game.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials Investigate Conflict
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office is looking into a potential conflict
that would arise with a pair of pending acquisitions by Clear
Channel Communications. The conflict centers on Tom Hicks, owner of
the Texas Rangers, and his role as vice chairman of a company that
represents players, including about half a dozen of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some concerns about it,'' a baseball official said.
</P>
<P>
   The players association also has concerns. ``It raises some
interesting questions,'' Donald Fehr, head of the association,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, who also owns the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey
League, said he would address baseball's concerns. ``I can see the
potential for conflict,'' he said, ``but we'll set it up where
there is no conflict.'' He also noted that no conflict currently
exists because neither deal has closed.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel, which owns and operates radio stations and
outdoor advertising properties, is acquiring SFX Entertainment and
AMFM Inc. As chairman and chief executive officer of AMFM, Hicks
will become vice chairman of Clear Channel.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months preceding its agreement with Clear Channel,
SFX purchased three agencies that represent baseball players:
Speakers of Sport (Jim Bronner and Bob Gilhooley), Hendricks
Management (Alan and Randy Hendricks) and Tellem &AMP; Associates (Arn
Tellem).
</P>
<P>
   The agents, who for years have been competitors, gathered in
Phoenix last week for their first ``team'' meeting. An unexpected
topic of discussion was the Hicks matter. One person involved with
the group said the agents had made known their concerns to SFX
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The agents represent Rafael Palmeiro, Royce Clayton and Justin
Thompson, among other Rangers. They also represent Juan Gonzalez,
Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez, Mike Mussina, Kerry Wood, Albert
Belle, Mariano Rivera, Moises Alou, Vladimir Guerrero, John Rocker,
Al Leiter, Nomar Garciaparra, Ben Grieve and Mike Lieberthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming our deal closes and the SFX deal closes sometime this
summer,'' Hicks said, ``our firm would be the largest shareholder
and I'd be a director and own two teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said the agent part of Clear Channel's business represents
about 1 percent of the company's total business, about $25 million
out of $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Gary Bettman the other day,'' Hicks said,
referring to the National Hockey League commissioner, ``and I said,
if need be I'd recuse myself from any board actions relating to
that 1 percent line of business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not spoken to anyone in the baseball
commissioner's office but said he would make the same pledge,
including having nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of
the sports agency business. ``I think it's a nonevent,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   However, an agent who has no link to SFX said it was not a minor
matter. ``There are a lot of things that have been in a gray
zone,'' he said, ``but there's nothing gray about that.'' &QL;

WEARY KNICKS ARE INSPIRED BY SPURS REMATCH
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shot arched from Latrell Sprewell's fingertips like a
desperate flare that quickly fizzled and faded as it plunged short
of the rim. At that instant, the San Antonio Spurs began dancing
around as unified as a string of paper dolls, using the pinwheel
ceiling of Madison Square Garden as the backdrop for their
championship celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the chaos on that June evening, Patrick Ewing loped away in
a suit while a dilapidated Larry Johnson shuffled numbly to the
locker room. At the point of his playoff injury in the semifinals,
Ewing had asked of his team, ``Get me my ring.'' In his effort to
deliver, Johnson pushed through pain and conjured up a 4-point
magic potion against Indiana during a surreal playoff journey.
</P>
<P>
   They were so close to punctuating spectacular careers. But it's
clear that neither aging superstar has many more opportunities left
in their bodies. While Ewing can still summon the star power out of
his 37-year-old frame at times, the legs are not there for every
occasion now. While Johnson is two days short of his 31st birthday,
his chronic disc pain will likely force him to have minor back
surgery over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Their bodies are like scrap metal, their time is short. It's
about now for Ewing and Johnson. What better measure of their hope
than to face down their demons Sunday at the Garden. In their first
appearance in town since they hoisted the trophy on the Knicks'
stage, the Spurs will seek to put their opponents in their place _
again. Last June, they won the title four games to one. In January,
a month into Ewing's return from his Achilles' injury, Tim Duncan
crushed the Knicks' spirits as an encore to the finals, 96-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kicked our butt the last time we were out there,'' Ewing
said. ``We'll be ready for them Sunday. David Robinson is a great
player. Tim Duncan is a great player. Naturally, when you play
against people who are good, you want to go out and perform your
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing sounded just like the stubbornly proud star of yesteryear.
He did not play in the finals, and let it be known that the outcome
might have been different if he had.
</P>
<P>
   Those thoughts were only reinforced Friday night when he
delivered a game-winning shot in Philadelphia to give the Knicks
only its second victory on the road in 10 games. One good victory,
and the Knicks were oozing the confidence of a team bound for
another finals clash with the Spurs, Lakers or whomever stands in
their way. One good victory, and the Knicks seemed refocused on the
task at hand. Have they snapped out of it? Or will the Spurs send
them spiraling into another funk?
</P>
<P>
   ``San Antonio is coming into the house knowing what happened
last year,'' Johnson said. ``We can't have no letdowns against
anyone. When we play good teams, you see a different ball club.
Being veterans, we should see that and know that's not the way
you're supposed to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chicago won all those titles, they went out and destroyed
teams from the get go. They just put it on them from the start.
They destroyed the other team's confidence and then cruised from
there. We tend to try to wait and see how hard we need to play to
win. There should be one way we play all the time. We have to get
over the mental block.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way we've been struggling on the road, this game
on Sunday isn't about how we played in the finals last year. Hey,
we've got teams nipping at our heels in our own division. We have
to play hard every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the comparisons with how we played them in the
finals last year is definitely going to be there,'' Johnson said,
referring to the Spurs. ``We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   They know the Spurs uncovered the Knicks' weaknesses last year.
Maybe Ewing would have put a roadblock in the paint that Robinson
and Duncan lorded over in the finals. Maybe a healthy Johnson could
have helped slow the duos runaway dominance. In January, neither
backed up that theory, as both struggled to score 12 points a piece
while Duncan came up with 33.
</P>
<P>
   What could have possibly changed since then? If Ewing had not
hit the shot to beat the 76ers on Friday night, if Johnson had not
come through with 6 straight points in the fourth quarter, they
might not have been emotionally prepared for the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Patrick and Larry played great,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. ``Too often, everyone will judge Patrick on shooting. That's
always the talk _ the kind of shots, the number of shots _ but
Patrick means a lot more to us than that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, he and Johnson meant the difference as younger
stars like Allan Houston and Sprewell floundered around them. Out
of that effort, the Knicks have hope _ whether foolish or founded _
that they can overcome both the daunting task of returning to the
finals and taking down giants like the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   `'We're ready for that one,'' Chris Childs said. ``We need to
let San Antonio know that last year was last year, and this year
it's going to be a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Houston and Sprewell are called upon to carry the
burden, Johnson and Ewing will have a lot to say about how the
story ends for their careers as Knicks.

FOR A BRITISH WOMAN, AT 23, THE WORLD IS NEXT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suspended in space some eight stories above an America's Cup
waterfront scene in Auckland, New Zealand, that for the last
several months had been home to some of the world's top sailors,
the elfin British solo skipper Ellen MacArthur took in a much more
commanding view than her 5-foot-2 frame normally affords.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur was harnessed to the carbon-fiber masthead of her
striking new Open 60, Kingfisher, performing a routine rig
inspection before the boat's inaugural overnight sail. Having taken
delivery of the yacht from a local builder just days earlier,
MacArthur was beginning to forge some imperative bonds with the
vessel aboard which, later this year, she will hitch her dream to
race alone around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Back on deck after a rapid descent, she offered a technical
observation to a helper in fluent French _ a handy skill for an
offshore single-handed sailor, whose discipline is dominated by
Frenchmen _ and then returned to her native tongue for a broader
take on the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this boat and I ask myself if this is really
happening to me,'' she said. ``It sometimes feels too good to be
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Her twinkling eyes in contrast to the flat light of a drizzly,
calm Auckland morning, MacArthur looked even younger than her
remarkable 23 years. But it was a morning for dichotomies, for
MacArthur's youthful appearance belied her vast experience, and the
still harbor gave no indication of the violent gales and stormy
seas that await on the multistaged, self-appointed mission ahead of
her.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur's ultimate goal with the 60-foot Kingfisher _ named
after the European retail giant that proffered 2 million pounds for
title sponsorship of the campaign _ is to compete in this
November's fourth running of the quadrennial Vendee Globe race, a
solo, nonstop sprint around the planet and whose signature
masochistic allure is a death-defying charge across the frigid
Southern Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's daunting, but it's something I've wanted to do for a long
time,'' MacArthur said. ``A lot of the sailing decisions in my life
have almost been subconscious. It's like they were meant to be. And
the Vendee was meant to be now.''
</P>
<P>
   Though MacArthur's march to the sea in hindsight seems
inevitable, in reality her nautical fate was far from
predetermined. Raised by her school-teacher parents far from the
water in the only-in-Britain village of Whatstandwell, she was
introduced to sailing by an aunt at the age of 8, and almost
immediately realized she had discovered a life-long pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Funneling her lunch money into a secret boat-buying fund, she
purchased her first dinghy at 13 and traded up twice by 17, at
which time she refit and sailed her latest acquisition, a husky
21-footer, on a five-and-a-half-month solo cruise around Britain.
</P>
<P>
   She parlayed that experience into jobs working on boats and
teaching sailing, and into a pair of crewed trans-Atlantic
crossings. But she began to make a name for herself when, at 20 and
the youngest of 56 competitors, she finished 17th in the wild Mini
Transat race, a solo transAtlantic contest aboard radical,
stripped-out 21-foot rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The experience led to the unavoidable questions about age and
gender, to which MacArthur replied, ``I can't describe how it feels
to be the youngest sailor and a girl. It's like asking me how it
feels to be a 40-year-old bloke. I'm just an ocean sailor, like
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but not many ocean sailors have enjoyed the run
MacArthur is currently on. She followed the Mini Transat with a
class triumph in the double-handed Round Britain and Ireland Race.
Then, she made her true breakthrough in the 1998 solo Route du
Rhum, yet another French torture test in which she again won her
class, for 50-footers, while vanquishing many of the 60-foot
skippers in the process.
</P>
<P>
   For the British, who in recent years have not managed to scrap
together an America's Cup effort nor been able to beat the French
in the solo offshore game, which they essentially invented, the
MacArthur package was too good to be true. The marketing people at
Kingfisher agreed, and opened their coffers.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, MacArthur continues to do it her way. She built
her boat in New Zealand, rather than Europe, so she could shake it
down on a homeward delivery via the Southern Ocean and accrue her
first crucial high-latitude Southern Hemisphere miles. In June, she
will compete in the solo trans-Atlantic race from England to
Newport, R.I., as a further shakedown.
</P>
<P>
   The big test will come in the fall. For MacArthur, it is just
another tipped domino in a reeling procession of events. ``You
don't have to have massive goals, just steady ones,'' she said.
``You knock one off and you go from there.''

<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ The sidelines had started to feel like a
prison for Boston College forward Becky Gottstein as she spent six
weeks on the bench nursing a stress fracture in her right ankle.
So, understandably, she felt liberated when she returned to the
lineup, just in time for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Out of action since Jan. 18, Gottstein, a 6-foot-1 sophomore,
took the floor once again last weekend for the Big East tournament
opener against West Virginia. It was a relatively quiet return for
Gottstein, who scored 7 points and grabbed 9 rebounds in a 70-53
victory. But she was elated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to play so bad,'' Gottstein said. ``I was hoping
the rust would fall off quick. I was just excited to get here and
have a uniform on again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottstein averaged 16.9 in the Big East Tournament, propelling
Boston College (25-8, 12-4 conference), to its first appearance in
the semifinals since 1990. In the quarterfinal victory over
Georgetown, she shot 6-11 from the field for 18 points, and
followed with 19 points and seven rebounds in a 79-54 loss to
UConn.
</P>
<P>
   Gottstein's return not only injected renewed hope and confidence
into the Boston College coaching staff and her teammates, her
presence also makes the No. 17 Eagles a legitimate dark horse in
the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament picture.
The women's draw takes place Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College got off to a flying start at the beginning of the
season with a 15-4 record, including a 12-game winning streak. With
a starting lineup of Gottstein, the senior guard Cal Bouchard, the
sophomore guard Brianne Stepherson, the senior forward Alissa
Murphy and the junior center Jamie Cournoyer, the Eagles had a
solid blend of experience and youth.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gottstein was hurt, the picture looked bleak. Boston
College Coach Cathy Inglese juggled her personnel, fielding six
different starting lineups during Gottstein's absence, and the
Eagles managed to finish out the regular season 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese said that the production of the 6-3 Cournoyer,
especially while Gottstein was out, was crucial to Boston College's
success during the critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Cournoyer has started every game, averaging 11.7 points and 5.9
rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been feeling more and more confident in what I am
doing,'' Cournoyer said. ``With Becky out, I felt I had to do more
and play a bigger role.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally at full strength again, Boston College awaits word
Sunday night as to its seeding, bracket and first-round opponent in
the NCAA Tournament, which begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Inglese is hoping the selection committee, after taking into
account Boston College's strong overall record and impressive Big
East conference record, rewards the Eagles with a first-round home
game at Conte Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles qualified for the tournament for the first time last
year, defeating Ohio State, 72-59 in the first round and losing to
Tennessee in the second round, 89-62.
</P>
<P>
   This season Boston College was only 1-4 in the regular season
against teams now ranked in the top 25, and detractors contend that
the Eagles seem to fall to earth against upper-echelon opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But three of those four losses occurred during Gottstein's
absence: 84-77 at No. 1 UConn (28-1) on Jan. 26, 72-59 at No. 5
Notre Dame (25-3) on Feb. 5, 73-51 at No. 8 Rutgers (21-6) on
Feb.23.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing to the Final Four may or may not be a realistic goal
for the Eagles, but Inglese believes her team, with a healthy
Gottstein, is ready to attain national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been very pleased with our team because we have been
playing better and doing more good things,'' Inglese said. ``I
think we are taking very good shots, and I am pleased with our
execution. We have shown a lot of growth in the last few games. We
have just got to keep it up.''

YEARS LATER, MAKER OF A LANDMARK FILM STILL STANDS UP FOR TITLE IX
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Martha Ackmann is a writer and a women's studies professor at
Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The contrast couldn't have been more stark. At the very moment
50 women contestants paraded across television screens recently in
the sleazy spectacle ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?,''
15-year-old Allison Bransfield was flexing her muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Allison was not among the hordes of viewers who tuned into the
``smile-strut-and-win-a-man'' sideshow on Feb. 15. Instead, she was
with her classmates at the Emma Willard School in Troy, N.Y.,
listening to the filmmaker Mary Mazzio talk about ``A Hero for
Daisy,'' her new documentary about the Yale female rowers' protest
in 1976 that sparked Title IX compliance action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for making a film about girls and muscles,'' Allison
told Mazzio at a reception that evening. Then they posed for a
snapshot _ Allison, her school pals, and Mazzio _ shoulder to
shoulder, arm muscles tensed, grinning proudly for all the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzio, a 38-year-old former Olympic rower who is now a Boston
lawyer and filmmaker, came to the Emma Willard School to screen her
film, which is as much about creating healthy images for young
girls as it is about gender equity in sports. The film tells the
story of Chris Ernst, a two-time Olympian who led her rowing team
in a protest against Yale's lack of athletic facilities for women.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst and 18 teammates silently marched into Yale's athletic
office, read a statement, and stripped to the waist _ exposing the
words ``Title IX,'' which had been drawn in blue marker on each
woman's back and breasts. A New York Times reporter stood behind
the women observing the event; the story appeared in the paper the
next day, March 4, 1976, and set off an international reaction. A
photograph of the history-making event also ran in The Yale Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour of the protest, Yale administrators recognized
they had a problem. Within two weeks, the female rowers had new
locker rooms. Across the country, educators snapped to attention
and began viewing Title IX _ which had become law four years
earlier _ as legislation that required compliance.
</P>
<P>
   In Mazzio's film, the Massachusetts senator and Yale alumnus
John Kerry talks about the protest's profound social significance.
``What Chris Ernst did,'' Kerry said, ``is nothing short of
spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernst, who now owns a plumbing company in Brookline, Mass., is
not without a sense of humor about what she's doing nearly 25 years
after the Yale action. Friends, she observes in the film, have
pointed out that she has gone from protesting the lack of showers
to fixing them.
</P>
<P>
   Her Yale crewmate Jennie Kiesling, now a history professor at
West Point and the Army men's varsity rowing coach, believes that
Ernst is as unforgettable now as she was in 1976. ``I have seen the
film twice,'' Kiesling said. ``Seeing myself on film trying to
describe Chris brought home how ineffably impressive she is.''
</P>
<P>
   For Emma Willard's athletic director, Judy Bridges, the film
brought back memories of the days before Title IX. ``I remember as
a girl waking up every morning just so eager to play softball and
how wonderful it was when I found other girls who enjoyed the
competition as much as I did,'' she recalled. But opportunities for
girls to play were slim then. Thinking back on that time fills
Bridges not so much with regret as it does, she said, ``with
what-ifs?''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzio said the film touches different generations in different
ways. For women, like Bridges who remember the days before Title
IX, the documentary strikes an emotional chord. For girls, like the
audience at Emma Willard _ many of whom did not know exactly what
Title IX represented or when it came about _ the documentary is
about speaking your mind, standing up, and the right to be strong,
physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were women who were not letting their own inhibitions or
the barriers others imposed stop them from doing what they wanted
to do,'' said Julia Kinkel, a senior at the school. ``A women is
not supposed to be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating images of strong women was the primary motivation
behind Mazzio's decision to make the film. In 1998, pregnant and
two weeks overdue with her daughter, Daisy, Mazzio was
channel-surfing at home and happened upon a Victoria's Secret
commercial. The images of smiling, banal, blond and leggy women
striking sexual poses to sell products was more than she could
take. ``What is our daughter going to see?'' she recalls asking her
husband. ``There's nothing out there for Daisy.'`
</P>
<P>
   Writing, producing and directing the film with a new infant at
home was ``an act of lunacy,'' Mazzio said with a laugh. The film
played to sold-out audiences in Boston at the Museum of Fine Arts;
fathers of daughters, Mazzio notes, have been especially vocal in
recognizing the film's importance.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, ``A Hero for Daisy'' is without a national
theatrical distributor. However, the film, in 16-millimeter format,
is being shown at museums, a few independent theatres, as well as
independent schools, colleges and universities that can foot the
bill for its screening. Mazzio would like the film to be shown in
every public high school in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, girls like Emma Willard's Naveen Shakir are
glad they have seen ``Daisy.'' Naveen waited until most of the
students had filed out of a classroom and then told Mazzio how much
the documentary meant to her. The film, she said, ``helped me
realize that if you focus on one thing, you can really develop as a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Naveen said, she wakes up thinking about pitching.

REAL ESTATE: DISPLACING THE GHOSTS OF STUDENTS AND SAILORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md.)  (jw) 
 By MAUREEN MILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT DEPOSIT, Md. _ Perched on steep cliffs above this curious
little riverside town, which is just a mile long and 500 feet deep,
is a ghostly granite-and-limestone group of buildings that have
preoccupied residents for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The former Tome School for Boys, with its sweeping views of the
Susquehanna River, was considered one of the most beautiful
boarding-school campuses on the East Coast at its peak in the
1920s. Named for Jacob Tome (the last name rhymes with home), a
Port Deposit lumberman and banker and Cecil County's first
millionaire, the beaux-arts campus was designed by the New York
firm of Boring &AMP; Tilton, which also designed the main building on
Ellis Island and the Heights Casino in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the school has become a symbol of the town's past,
particularly its heyday a century ago as a ``port of deposit'' for
goods moving by boat and rail between the Susquehanna Valley and
the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the school became part of the Bainbridge Naval Training
Center, etched in the memories of tens of thousands men and women
who served there, from 1942 until its closing in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by the river to the west and cliffs to the east, Port
Deposit, in the northeast corner of Maryland, about 35 miles from
Baltimore, has a population of about 800.
</P>
<P>
   Main Street recalls the town's commercial prominence in the 19th
century with Georgian, Greek Revival, Federal, Victorian and
Italianate structures built well above street level to avoid damage
from floods, which are usually controlled by Conowingo Dam six
miles upstream. The entire town is on the National Register of
Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy did little to alter the symmetry of the Tome School
campus. The dozen buildings that lined the quadrangle in a
century-old drawing _ the gymnasium, dormitories, classroom
buildings, dining hall and headmaster's house _ are completely
recognizable today. The row of two-story clapboard houses built for
teachers, the heating plant, sidewalks, roads, drinking fountains
and even street signs give the impression of a town deserted very
suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Only deterioration of the buildings and the untrimmed grounds,
including an overgrown terraced garden and a nine-hole golf course,
provide clues that the last class graduated from the Tome School in
1941 and that the Navy closed the base in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the weedy 1,200-acre tract is facing a new life as
development plans, sponsored by the state of Maryland, get under
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shadow of our history is up there,'' said Erika Quesenbery,
a curator at the Paw Paw Museum, named for bushes that once graced
the museum entrance. ``People feel an amazing sense of pride about
it _ and an amazing sense of loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The school was built in 1900 with about $1 million of the $3
million bequeathed by Tome. The trustees in charge of the bequest
set about creating an exclusive preparatory school, but its
prestige was short-lived, and during the Depression, the school
fell on hard times financially.
</P>
<P>
   Robert T. Jones Jr., 77, a retired funeral director who lives in
Newark, Del., went to the school in the late 1930s, and he
remembers how he liked to stand on the bluff and watch storms
whipping up on the Susquehanna.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, he recalled, the boys would troop into town to
church, descending the steep cliffside steps they called ``Jacob
Tome's ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outbreak of World War II, the Navy came looking for
recruit training sites, and the school was sold to the government
for $900,000. The entire campus was incorporated into the new naval
base, and since 1942, the property has been off limits to most
civilians, although drivers crossing the Susquehanna on Interstate
95 can glimpse the elegant headmaster's house and the clock tower
of the main classroom building.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Navy closed the base, residents of Cecil County worked
for years to reclaim the property. In 1991, the 125-acre Tome
School section was annexed by Port Deposit. Then last year, the
Navy agreed to transfer the entire site to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In a military ceremony last month, attended by Tome graduates,
former sailors and local officials, the Navy formally transferred
the parcel to the Bainbridge Development Corp., an agency set up by
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people can understand what the significance of
that day was to us,'' said Mayor Wayne L. Tome Sr., a
great-great-great-nephew of Jacob Tome. ``We've been sitting there
looking at that site. It's been a thorn in our sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The development corporation, whose board is made of area
residents, is charged with developing and marketing the property.
Possible uses for the Tome campus include a conference center,
retirement community or university extension campus, and the rest
of the site could be devoted to recreation, home sites, office
buildings or light industry. Development is expected to take place
over the next 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business is to create a master plan for the
entire parcel, said Harland Graef, a retired DuPont executive who
is the development corporation's chairman. A study is also under
way to determine the best way to establish a modern water and waste
treatment system, and the corporation is now applying for grants to
pay for necessary repairs to keep the historic Tome buildings from
deteriorating further.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to restoring the buildings, the development
corporation will have its work cut out for it. Vandals made off
with much of the ornamentation on the Tome buildings, inside and
out. Even the weather vane on the clock tower of Memorial Hall was
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was demolition by neglect,'' Tome said. ``Vandals stripped
out plumbing for the copper and chipped out the marble steps.''

SEA-FARMING INDUSTRY IN PERIL FROM INFECTIOUS VIRAL DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PETE BODO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As little as a decade ago, the nascent but rapidly growing
aquaculture industry was hailed by most conservationists and
recreational anglers as the magic bullet in the battle to halt the
precipitous decline of the wild Atlantic Salmon. But today, the
brief history of salmon aquaculture is best read as a cautionary
tale about the hazards of tampering with the natural order.
</P>
<P>
   This message was reinforced most recently by the discovery of a
previously unknown viral disease, infectious salmon anemia, which
is ravaging the salmon aquaculture industry, and appears to be
present in wild salmon as well.
</P>
<P>
   The disease causes hemorrhages in the kidneys, spleen, and other
organs, eventually leading to death, according the Dr. Fred
Whoriskey, vice president of research and environment for the
Atlantic Salmon Federation. There is no known cure or antidote for
the salmon anemia, and it is not considered a threat to humans. But
if the salmon anemia spreads significantly among wild fish, it will
further imperil a threatened and severely depleted species, and
make aquaculture appear to be more of a Trojan horse than a magic
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aquaculture is not the main reason for the decline of wild
salmon,'' said Bill Taylor, president of the Atlantic Salmon
Federation, the organization leading the battle to save the wild
fish. ``But it has proven to be a real problem wherever large
numbers of sea cages are present. On the Bay of Fundy off Canada,
which has the highest concentration of salmon farms in the world,
and in the Gulf of Maine, aquaculture is having a major, negative
impact on wild fish. The irony in this is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Aquaculture, or sea-farming, has in the span of a single
generation burgeoned into a worldwide, $45 billion industry. Sea
farms produce, among other things, seaweed, shrimp, catfish and
salmon. Most consumers probably aren't even aware that the vast
bulk of salmon they eat is fish raised en masse in coastal pens,
genetically as different from their wild cousins as a Butterball
turkey is from a wild bird.
</P>
<P>
   The only telltale sign of a farm-raised fish is the distinct,
white lines of fat in the cross-section of a typical salmon steak,
markings that suggest rich feed, rapid growth and lack of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Before sea-farming, wild salmon were a gourmet delicacy that
often fetched more than $7 a pound. Aquaculture promised a win-win
situation: if salmon were ``farmed'' in large quantities, at a cost
with which the gear and labor-intensive high-seas fishing fleets
could not compete, consumers would be satisfied for a better price
and the overfished wild salmon populations would rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon federation itself was so intrigued that it made an
alliance with the budding industry and developed strains of salmon
suitable for fish-farming. But while the price of salmon has
plummeted to just over $2 a pound, aquaculture has created a host
of problems _ even before the salmon anemia outbreak _ including
pollution and the genetic threat to wild stocks posed by the
unexpectedly large numbers of salmon that escape from the cages.
</P>
<P>
   The escapees behave much like wild salmon, seeking out rivers in
which to spawn. But they are not genetically designed for life in
the wild, and by breeding with wild fish they corrupt the gene
pool. The first serious signs of the failing marriage between
aquaculture and the conservation establishment emerged when large
numbers of escapees began turning up in rivers that held indigenous
populations of wild fish. And then came the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Whoriskey and other biologists believe that the inevitable
stress inflicted on fish held in cages in large numbers either
created the disease, or helped it grow exponentially. Additionally,
outbreaks of the disease appear to be triggered by the cold water
(50 to 60 degrees) that is considered ideal for salmon-farming.
</P>
<P>
   When fish become infected with the salmon anemia, they shed
viral particles that are then spread to other fish in their
proximity, or borne on ocean currents. Thus, infected fish farms
are de facto virus factories: in just six years from its first
appearance in Norway in 1984, the salmon anemia spread to a total
of 101 fish farms there. The disease appeared on this side of the
Atlantic in 1996. Just two years later, more than one million
infected aquaculture fish were destroyed by the government of
Canada, at a cost of more than $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The most disturbing news of all emerged from the Magaguadavic
River in southern New Brunswick, where Whoriskey and other
scientists regularly conduct field studies on wild fish and
aquaculture escapees. Every year since 1992, the number of escapees
from nearby Bay of Fundy sea-farms has eclipsed the number of wild
fish, whose numbers have declined in reverse proportion. In 1999,
the salmon anemia was present in 14 percent of the escapees found
in the Magaguadavic and, most alarmingly, almost 75 percent of the
wild fish captured by biologists.
</P>
<P>
   In response, researchers have developed new, closed-loop
technologies that replace crude, unreliable sea cages with large
bags that are much more effective in preventing escapees, catching
effluents that currently pollute the ocean floor beneath sea cages,
and may also lessen the spread of diseases like salmon anemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Responsible, environmentally acceptable aquaculture is not
rocket science, but it's a more expensive proposition than sea
cages,'' said Taylor, whose salmon federation office is situated in
Charlotte County, New Brunswick, where one in every four jobs is in
aquaculture. ``We have to pursue that vigorously, because it's
clearly too late to put the genie back in the bottle.'' &QL;

Elliott has a decent chance of stepping onto the court of the
Alamodome in San Antonio on Tuesday night, marking his first
appearance this season. Becoming the first professional athlete
known to resume his career after a kidney transplant, the Spurs'
32-year-old swingman will most likely receive a prolonged,
emotional ovation. Elliott had his blood pressure checked Saturday
by Joe Gutzwiller, the Spurs' assistant trainer. (Vincent

J. Dubacher runs a sanctuary at his parents' farm in Grafton for
birds that have been injured or are no longer wanted. ``I'm not a
religious person, but I do believe, as humans, we all have a
responsibility'' said Dubacher, 51, who makes room for them all
because he cannot bear the thought of what would happen otherwise.

   (NYT15) GRAFTON, N.Y. -- March 11, 2000 -- NY-BIRDMAN-1 -- In
the last quarter century, Peter J. Dubacher, shown handling an
American bald eagle, has run a sanctuary at his parents' farm in
Grafton for birds that have been injured or are no longer wanted.
By his count, Dubacher, 51, cares for 1,700 birds - including 15
eagles, 2 peregrine falcons, and 19 emus - in a maze of greenhouses
and wooden pens. (David Jennings/The New York Times)

Derek Jeter, the Yankees 25-year-old shortstop, is such a good
hitter that even when fooled, he is capable of hitting a pitch just
above his shoes or off the outside corner and dumping a single into
right field. But he is also apt to swing at a bad pitch and ground
out to second base. If Jeter amassed another 15 seasons at his
current rate of success, he would approach 4,000 hits and 2,000
runs scored. But there is room for improvement. (Barton

Woody Allen has made a short film for the Landmarks Preservation
Commission to oppose a new tower in Carnegie Hill, saying it would
ruin the character of the neighborhood, which he has used as a

who asked him to lend his fame to their fight, say the tower would
leave their low-rise neighborhood feeling uncomfortably like a
high-rise canyon. (Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times)

   (NYT10) SEATTLE -- March 11, 2000 -- MCCAIN-VOTERS -- Beyond
their allegiance to Sen. John McCain and a somewhat vague banner of
reform, there seems to be virtually nothing that amounts to a
common bond in his supporters' political views. ``I'm still kind of
shocked at myself,'' Holly Hamilton, left, a high school teacher,
said about her first-ever Republican vote. Troy Miller, a
purchasing agent, center, said ``If I had to vote right now, I
think I'd write in somebody like Pat Paulsen.'' ``My vote's
completely up in the air,'' said Kris Lenning, a phone company
technician. (Peter Yates/The New York Times)

youths with limited literacy have been coming to the United States

-- With the Mexican presidential election nearing, ``people are
realizing I can win,'' said Vicente Fox, the presidential candidate
of the National Action Party, of recent advances that give him a
better chance at the post than any other opposition figure since
the Mexican revolution. Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who
usually wears cowboy boots, was on the campaign trail in the town
of Zamora in Michoacan State. (Wesley Bocxe/The New York Times)

Cowboys were in town Friday promoting the new Wrangler Pro Rodeo
Tour, which the sport's business sages believe will push calf
roping, steer wrestling, bull riding and barrel racing into the

car racing, arena football and professional wrestling. Last year,
26 million fans attended the Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association's 700 sanctioned events. (Ruby Washington/The New York

   (NYT3) FAIRFIELD, Iowa -- March 11, 2000 --
TRAVELING-HABERDASHER-3 -- Tim DeFord, 43, likes to keep the
customer satisfied, but he has to find him first. So this traveling
haberdasher packs up his station wagon and drives from town to Iowa
town. ``People in my business are better off if they don't have a
memory,'' he said, talking about earlier times, when people dressed
to the nines. ``I could put my inventory on the sidewalk with a
sign that says `free' and half the people in the town would walk
right past it.'' (Rodney White/The New York Times)

   (NYT2) FAIRFIELD, Iowa -- March 11, 2000 --
TRAVELING-HABERDASHER-2 -- As Americans have gone to casual attire,
small-town shops offering options for the well-dressed man have
been closing. Leland Gookin examined swatches of fabric as Tim
DeFord, 43, a traveling haberdasher from Fairfield, Iowa, looked
on, hoping to make a sale. Gookin (46 short) proved an indecisive
customer, and ultimately did not buy a sport coat on this visit.

TRAVELING-HABERDASHER-1 -- Tim DeFord owns Lord's Fine Men's Wear
in Perry, about 30 miles northwest of Des Moines, a store that
would have closed long ago, meeting the fate of so many small-town
shops, if DeFord did not keep his business alive by traveling to
customers in places where men's shops have disappeared. DeFord, 43,
fitted Leland Gookin at his home. (Rodney White/The New York Times)

sign that says `free' and half the people in the town would walk
right past it.'' (Rodney White/The New York Times)

   (NYT2) FAIRFIELD, Iowa -- March 11, 2000 --
TRAVELING-HABERDASHER-2 -- As Americans have gone to casual attire,
small-town shops offering options for the well-dressed man have
been closing. Leland Gookin examined swatches of fabric as Tim
DeFord, 43, a traveling haberdasher from Fairfield, Iowa, looked
on, hoping to make a sale. Gookin (46 short) proved an indecisive
customer, and ultimately did not buy a sport coat on this visit.

TRAVELING-HABERDASHER-1 -- Tim DeFord owns Lord's Fine Men's Wear
in Perry, about 30 miles northwest of Des Moines, a store that
would have closed long ago, meeting the fate of so many small-town
shops, if DeFord did not keep his business alive by traveling to
customers in places where men's shops have disappeared. DeFord, 43,
fitted Leland Gookin at his home. (Rodney White/The New York Times)

   Personal and political issues abound in Florida primary
</P>
<P>
   By Brian E. Crowley
</P>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ In a corner office in suite 417, Jillian
Inmon is working with walking pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible,'' she says in between answering the
constantly ringing phone. Going home is out of the question because
nothing right now is more important to Inmon than making sure that
Texas Gov. George W. Bush wins Florida's 25 electoral votes in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Like her partner in this endeavor, Brett Doster, she is a
political workaholic who worked on Jeb Bush's 1998 campaign for
governor. Doster has been with Bush even longer, cutting his young
political teeth as Bush's personal assistant in 1994 and again in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the idea of losing Florida to Vice President Al Gore
would be almost the same as losing a family member. If it is true,
and it is, that it is virtually impossible for Bush to lose his
home state of Texas, then it is equally true that for his younger
brother there could be no more dreaded political and personal
defeat than for Gore to win Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Inmon, 31, and Doster, 28 , are the vanguard of the effort here.
They occupy the same offices they used in Jeb Bush's successful
governor's race. On Inmon's desk is a bright yellow folder, with
``JEB'' scrawled across it, standing in the midst of less colorful
folders. Inside, are the constant requests from national news
organizations for interviews with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the coming campaign is intense, and Gore is letting
it be known he believes he can embarrass the Florida Bush brigade
by winning the Sunshine State. Just to prove his point, Gore won't
spend primary night at home in Tennessee, he's going to be in
Tallahassee Tuesday under the glare of Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is being guided here by Attorney General Bob Butterworth,
who has become more than the usual token big name state chairman.
He's working it like a field director, said one top Gore official.
</P>
<P>
   Among those working with Butterworth is Karl Koch, a veteran
Democratic strategist who worked for the late Gov. Lawton Chiles
and former Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely believe we can win Florida,'' said Koch. ``The
campaign would not spend the time it has if that weren't true.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 months, Gore has been to Florida five times, and
Bush has been here three. Gore's count will go up to seven this
week when he comes to Miami tonight, leaves Florida Monday
afternoon and then returns Tuesday evening for a rally in
Tallahassee. While in Miami, Gore is tentatively scheduled to visit
Jackson Memorial Hospital. Bush will make his fourth visit with a
stop today in Plant City to attend the Strawberry Festival.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign unfolds in Florida, Democrats are going to
portray Bush as a lightweight governor too willing to pander to
extremists in his party when it is politically expedient.
Republicans will tag Gore with the Clinton scandals, suggesting
voters should be weary of the Clinton-Gore show.
</P>
<P>
   While there are abundant political issues that separate the two
candidates, the question of character could be the turning point
for Florida's 1.3 million independent voters who make up 15 percent
of the state's more than 8 million voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you belong to a party, you tend to identify with the
issues that are important to that party,'' said Tre Evers, a
Republican strategist. ``The independents and the undecided voters
are aware of the issues, but in that group you can find people who
are pro-gun and anti-gun who support the same candidate. They seem
to lean more toward the question of character.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case in 1992, when 20 percent of Florida voters
backed Ross Perot who in the beginning of the campaign was viewed
as a solid, honest, patriotic businessman. As that view unraveled,
Perot's support dropped to 9 percent of the vote in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Independent voters in other state primaries were very supportive
of Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Bill
Bradley. Polls have suggested the character issue was a major
reason independents supported them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are voters who usually don't make up their mind until
the final weeks of a campaign,'' said Jim Kane, a political analyst
for the independent Florida Voter, which studies voting trends.
``These also are the voters who help decide elections.''
</P>
<P>
   There are host of other intangibles that will affect the
outcome, from debate performances to excitement that would be
generated if Gore picked U.S. Sen. Bob Graham as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida has 25 electoral votes, and Al Gore is not going to
just give them to George Bush,'' Koch said. ``Bush will have to
fight for them.''
</P>
<P>
   After finally seeing a doctor, Inmon is feeling a little better,
although she refuses to get the bed rest she was told she needed.
Gore is going to be in Tallahassee, and Inmon vows not to rest
until she is sure that the only trips Gore will be making to
Florida next year will be as a tourist.

NEW LEADER ASSUMES POWER IN CHILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Pledging to improve the free-market economy
while helping the poor, Ricardo Lagos took power Saturday as
Chile's third democratically elected leader since the end of
military rule, and as the first socialist president since Salvador
Allende was overthrown in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos made his name opposing General Augusto Pinochet's military
dictatorship. He faces decisions on whether to curb the influence
of the armed forces and on whether to support efforts to try
Pinochet on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos was handed the presidential red, white, and blue sash by
outgoing President Eduardo Frei in the Pacific port of Valparaiso.
Lagos, an economist who studied at Duke University, then swore in
his Cabinet, which includes several Ivy League-educated
technocrats.
</P>
<P>
   Chile is ranked among Latin America's top economies, but it has
struggled recently because of financial crises in Asia and Latin
America. Much of Lagos's economic platform seeks to continue
Chile's free-market path.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has also vowed to assist Chile's poor, who make up about
20 percent of the country's 15 million residents _ a low figure for
Latin America, but a sore spot for Chileans who feel left out of
the economic growth during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Among several inaugural activities, Lagos made a campaign-like
stop in the city of Concepcion and took a ride around working-class
neighborhoods of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chile has made great strides during the last 15 years to
expand development, telephones, roads and airports, but now we have
to reach even further,'' Lagos said to cheers at the University of
Concepcion. ``Our first objective . . . must be to integrate every
region of Chile to the rest of South America and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from more than 50 countries attended the inauguration,
including a US delegation led by Attorney General Janet Reno. US
officials said they welcomed the new administration as another
healthy sign of consolidating democracy in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos's narrow victory in a January runoff against a rightist
candidate, Joaquin Lavin, was a milestone. Not since Allende had a
socialist candidate been elected president in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a decade of democratic politics since the end of
military rule, Chile is still struggling to shake off the memories
of its 17 years under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Allende, daughter of the late president, attended the
inauguration. ``Obviously, I'm reminded of my father, but I'm
convinced that this will be a very good government and that Chile
will finally strengthen its democracy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos was an apprentice of Allende's and a fierce opponent of
the military government, which is believed to have abducted,
tortured, or killed several thousand people. In the late 1980s,
Lagos became a leader of a national campaign to remove Pinochet
from office and return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts expect Lagos to be a moderate leader, balancing
economic and social needs while being firm but diplomatic with the
country's armed forces, whose leaders remain loyal to Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the attention on Lagos's new term was stolen with the
return March 4 of Pinochet, who flew home after 16 months of house
arrest in Britain. The former general was allowed to leave Britain
after authorities there declared him unfit on health grounds to
stand trial in Spain for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the inaugural was Pinochet, who secured the title of
senator for life, and with it, immunity from prosecution, as he
prepared to leave office. The general spent the day on a family
estate in the Andean countryside. An appellate judge recommended
last week that Pinochet's immunity be revoked. If it were, he might
face more than 70 lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focus on the Pinochet controversy, some Chileans
said Saturday that they preferred to look ahead to the Lagos
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is coming into a very complicated situation,'' said Lucia
Boyens, a 28-year-old art gallery worker in the Providencia section
of the capital. ``I wish him well, but the people are going to
demand a lot from him.''

GORE MEETS VENTURA, TALKS OF FUNDING SHIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Al Gore, making a pitch Saturday to reform-minded
supporters of Bill Bradley and John McCain, praised Jesse Ventura,
the Minnesota governor, as ``an important national voice'' on
campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong meeting of Gore and Ventura, just as the vice
president faced questions over his possible role in the 1996 White
House fund-raising scandal, ended without an endorsement from
Ventura. And Gore said he had not asked for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I purposely didn't because I thought it was way too early,''
Gore said. ``We just talked about issues. We talked about campaign
finance reform. We talked about political reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who recently left the Reform Party, said:
``Endorsements can come later. There's a long time between now and
November.'' He said he had met with Gore ``to voice my concerns
with the potential president of the United States'' on behalf of
Minnesota's citizens, just as he would do with George W. Bush, the
likely Republican nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore initiated the meeting in a phone call Friday as he flew
from Albany, N.Y., to Minneapolis, where he picked up endorsements
from former Vice President Walter Mondale, and Senator Paul
Wellstone, who had supported Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore marched in Chicago's St. Patrick's Day parade, and then
traveled to Houston. He moved closer toward mathematically wrapping
up the Democratic nomination by winning Michigan caucuses, and he
was a likely winner in the Arizona primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's meeting with Ventura followed an article in the Los
Angeles Times on Friday that cited questionable actions by Gore,
President Clinton, and Hillary Rodham Clinton in raising funds for
the president's reelection in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The article was based on a report, prepared by Charles G.
LaBella, a former Justice Department investigator, that had been
kept secret for two years. It suggested that Gore, Bill Clinton,
and Hillary Clinton had engaged ``in a pattern of conduct worthy of
investigation by an independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore came under scrutiny after a fund-raiser in April 1996 at a
Buddhist temple in California, and after reports that he had placed
fund-raising calls from his White House office. Attorney General
Janet Reno ultimately decided not to seek an independent counsel, a
decision that Republicans have criticized as showing favoritism
toward top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seized on the article Friday, calling on Gore to ``clear up
what role he played in raising money from the White House,'' and
saying the report ``raises troubling questions about whether the
vice president misled federal investigators by testifying he did
not recall fund-raising meetings, even though new evidence now
shows he actively participated in those meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has not directly responded to the leaked LaBella
report, tried Saturday to seize the offensive on campaign finance
reform. McCain and Bradley used the issue to some effect before
they dropped out of the presidential race on Thursday. And Bush and
Gore now are trying to attract their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Ventura, Gore accused Bush of being the only
one of the four major candidates not to support campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insisted that he had talked about campaign finances
throughout the primary campaign, but that his views had been
drowned out by McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he now wants to ``raise that banner higher, not only
because of the obvious political reason that I want to give a home
for those voters who were strongly supporting Senator McCain and
Senator Bradley because of that issue _ I acknowledge that's part
of what's going on here _ but also because I believe in it, and
because I was advocating it before they dropped out of the race,
and because I advocated it 23 years ago in my very first term in
the United States Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura arrived for the breakfast meeting in Gore's 24th-floor
suite saying his only expectation was ``food.'' He left after
coming to the vice president's defense on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that it was unfair to criticize Gore for 1996
lapses when he was playing by the rules, which he said needed to be
changed. ``You got to play the game _ the old cliche _ the hands
you're dealt and play within the game that everybody can play in,''
he said.

EXCERPTS FROM GORE INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-INTERVIEW) 
(mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from an interview Saturday with Vice
President Al Gore aboard Air Force II, as recorded by The New York
Times:
</P>
<P>
   Q. How are you going to contrast yourself with Governor Bush?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are so many contrasts that will come out in this
campaign. One is the issue I discussed with Governor Ventura this
morning _ the need for campaign finance reform. I'm still waiting
for Governor Bush's answer on my call to eliminate soft money from
this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You know he's not going to do that.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's the conventional wisdom. But I think some people are
underestimating how strongly John McCain feels about that and
underestimating the fact that the Republican Party at the
grassroots level doesn't necessarily support Governor Bush's
position on this. The support Senator McCain attracted was in part
fueled by a grassroots desire to get rid of soft money, and it
comes from Republicans as well as independents and Democrats....
</P>
<P>
   Experience is one of the biggest issues in this campaign. And,
frankly, if you look at Governor Bush's economic plan, you have to
wonder whether he has the experience to be president. I mean, you
really have to wonder. He would spend more than a trillion dollars
in excess of the non-Social Security surplus. Not only the entire
surplus, but a trillion dollars more than the surplus. And in John
McCain's words, put the Social Security program at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Now when you see a proposal like that, you have to wonder: Does
Governor Bush have the experience to be president? When you look at
the fact that his tax scheme is much larger than the one that was
proposed by the congressional Republican leadership that was
overwhelmingly rejected by the country. Again you have to wonder,
does George Bush have the experience to be president?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why not refuse to be part of those soft-money fund-raisers,
just as a symbolic move, if nothing else?
</P>
<P>
   A. I am not going to unilaterally disarm, and I don't think that
anybody who thinks about it for more than two seconds has a problem
understanding that. All he has to do to ban soft money is to say
yes. One syllable, three letters, one word. It's not complicated:
yes, Y-E-S. And then soft money is completely eliminated from this
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I have learned from my mistakes. Like John McCain, I bring the
passion that comes from personal experience to the battle for
campaign finance reform. And he has not given me any evidence that
he has learned from his mistakes. I think it's a mistake to be
against banning soft money. I think it's a mistake to allow
billionaires to funnel special-interest, secretly funded attack ads
into the last days of the primary election and embrace the message
of those so-called independent expenditures. I think it's a mistake
to bust out of the traditional campaign finance law and raise $70
million with more to come.
</P>
<P>
   And again, that is the reason why he is putting forward this
risky tax scheme that is rejected by the American people but is
strongly supported by his own special-interest, soft-money donors.
If you look at that group _ here's the striking contrast. You talk
to that group, that is their No. 1 priority. You talk to the
American people, that is their lowest priority. In fact, they want
to keep the prosperity going and they don't want to put Social
Security at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What specifically were your mistakes?
</P>
<P>
   A. The '96 campaign, where both parties pushed the limits. I
made a mistake going to that Buddhist temple. I made a mistake in
making telephone calls from my office. And I have learned from
those mistakes. And I am passionate about the need for campaign
finance reform, because so long as there is this current system,
you're going to see the kind of thing that George Bush did in the
New York and Ohio and California primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any credibility on this issue? The Republicans
are already raising your ``no controlling legal authority.'' You
can see the ads already. How do you overcome that? And new reports
in the last few days....
</P>
<P>
   A. That's old news.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's still a political problem.
</P>
<P>
   A. I have acknowledged my mistakes, I have learned from my
mistakes. I have a passion for campaign-finance reform that is
fueled in part because of the pain of those mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Like John McCain, I took from my personal experience a deeper
commitment to the battle for campaign finance reform, and I think
this is the year it's going to happen. They've been writing it off
from the very start, but it is intricately linked to this Bush
risky tax scheme, which would devastate funding for education and
environment and health care. It is closely linked to Bush's record
of creating the worst pollution in America, in the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you think that he has made the decisions that lead Texas
to be No. 1 in air pollution, No. 1 in water pollution and No. 1 in
land pollution? It's because of his ties to this old-politics,
special-interest campaign funding.
</P>
<P>
   He would be better off if he made a clean break from it and
joined me in making this campaign the first in American history
where there was no soft money. He would be freer to break from his
past of doing what the polluters want, doing what the fat cats
want, and he would be freer to join in debates and joint town-hall
meetings and start responding to what the American people want.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about Leon Panetta saying you listened attentively,
there are photographs _ does this trigger your memory?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know what is in that particular paper and I can't
comment on something that hasn't been publicly released that I
haven't seen. But I've said previously that I made a mistake in
pressing the limits in '96. I think that we need campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When there were lingering questions about Whitewater,
President Clinton called for an independent counsel. Given the
lingering questions about your involvement in the fund-raising
problems, is there any conceivable way you would call for an
independent investigation on this, to reassure the public?
</P>
<P>
   A. (Laughs) This was all reviewed three years ago. You'll have
to decide what he says. But what does he say about the present?
What does he say about the soft money right now? What does he say
about evading the campaign-finance limit, with $70 million, right
now? What does he say about the Wyly secretly financed attack ads
against John McCain?
</P>
<P>
   Q. But he's raising questions about you.
</P>
<P>
   A. I have acknowledged my mistakes in the past, and I am
applying the lessons of those mistakes to a call for change now, so
that this campaign and all future campaigns will be conducted
differently. What is his response to my call for eliminating soft
money from his campaign? What is his response to my call for
eliminating the 30-second and 60-second ads and debating twice a
week? What is his response to my call to join me in joint town hall
meetings before undecided voters?
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're talking with the passion of a convert....
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, that's right.
</P>
<P>
   Q. ...and usually a convert has had some kind of epiphany or
experience that prompts the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   A. The pain of making the mistake in '96. Bear in mind, in my
first term in Congress, I called for full public financing of all
federal elections. I sponsored or co-sponsored a dozen campaign
finance reform bills over my career. I supported the
McCain-Feingold bill in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   I had a passion for this before, but the passion became stronger
in the wake of the '96 campaign, when both parties pushed the
limits. I don't want to see any other campaigns conducted like
that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the ``pain'' that you felt?
</P>
<P>
   A. Making mistakes and acknowledging them. When you acknowledge
a mistake, that is an opportunity for learning and growth. And that
is what I experienced.

POPE'S LENTEN MESSAGE TO SET TONE FOR MIDEAST PILGRIMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II will deliver Sunday what Vatican
officials say will be a dramatic and sweeping apology for a long
list of Roman Catholic sins that are as ancient as the Crusades and
as modern as the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   This Lenten message of repentance comes a week before the pope
makes a historic pilgrimage to the Holy Land, a personal journey
intended as the culmination of his papacy and his drive for
dialogue and reconciliation among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
The message will have many here listening intently to see whether
he goes beyond previous apologies for the individual actions of
Catholics to address the institutional role of the church.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's journey, threading through modern-day Jordan, the
West Bank, and Israel, will follow the path of the historical Jesus
from his birth in Bethlehem, to his childhood in Nazareth, his
ministry in Galilee, and his crucifixion in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But along this path, the pope will also walk a land where
Crusader armies slaughtered Muslims, Jews, and Eastern Orthodox
Christians, pillaging their communities in the name of reclaiming
the Holy Land for the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul will be the first pope in 36 years to set foot in
Israel, a nation founded on the ashes of the Nazi Holocaust, and to
meet with people who survived its horrors. One of them will be
Israel's chief rabbi, Yisrael Lau, who was interned in a forced
labor camp and who lost most of his family in death camps.
</P>
<P>
   The two men share an intimate bond to a terrible past. Both were
born in villages near Krakow, Poland, where about 1 million Jews
were killed in the Nazi camps. After World War II, Karol Wojtyla
became the bishop of Krakow, who was made pope.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has chosen the powerful and haunting setting of Yad
Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial, to deliver a speech for the
March 20-26 trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is his initiative to deliver a speech at Yad Vashem, to
speak of forgiveness'' Lau said. ``It is the appropriate place and
time for a man who faced the Holocaust with his very own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau has repeatedly praised the pontiff's efforts at
Jewish-Catholic reconciliation and his statements that Judaism is
the ``elder brother'' of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with reporters, Lau said this pope and Pope John
XXIII, who launched a reexamination of Roman Catholic doctrine in
the early 1960s, ``sympathize with the tragedy of the Jewish people
during the Holocaust more than any other leader in Europe, at least
in the last century.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Catholic officials call Nazism a ``pagan ideology,''
the church has expressed regret for Catholic teachings that may
have influenced ``anti-Jewish prejudices embedded in some Christian
minds and hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lau said, the pope's repeated expressions of sorrow for
the acts of individual Catholics _ prominently in the landmark 1998
document ``We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah'' _ fall well
short of a full recognition of the church's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Lau and others have said, the church must examine
the role played by Pope Pius XII, who has been criticized by some
historians for his near silence, some say complicity, in the
Holocaust. That history, and the possibility that Pius XII may be
canonized, have caused outrage in Israel and deep divisions in the
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to correct a crime of the past without any
mention, for example, of Pius XII when he stood on the blood of the
victims and did not say a word,'' Lau said.
</P>
<P>
   It is with these thoughts in mind that Lau and others will
listen Sunday as the frail, 79-year-old pontiff, if all goes as
expected, drops to his knees at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome for
the Day of Pardon Mass. In his homily, he is expected to pray for
20 centuries of Catholics' ``faults of the past,'' including
silence on slavery, oppression of women, doctrinal antipathy to
Jews, and inhumanity toward those tortured and killed during the
Inquisition's search for heretics.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the homily had not been released as of Saturday, but
its outline, Vatican officials said, was laid out in a 32-page
document prepared by an international group of Catholic theologians
and released last week in Paris to mark the beginning of Lent.
</P>
<P>
   Lent, the 40-day period of contemplation and repentance leading
to the celebration of Christ's resurrection at Easter, began
Wednesday. But the pope has said this entire ``Jubilee Year,''
which also marks 2,000 years of Christianity, should be devoted to
reflection on the past and a sense of where the church will go as
it begins its third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael McGarry, a Paulist priest and head of the
Vatican's Tantur Ecumenical Institute in Jerusalem, said the pope
is continuing the process begun by the Second Vatican Council
convened by Pope John XXIII, when ``the church set out to change
the direction of how it saw itself and how we see others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic doctrine until then _ that Jews were responsible
for the death of Jesus _ was ``the linchpin of anti-Semitism,''
McGarry noted.
</P>
<P>
   Building on that step, he said, John Paul II has undertaken a
revolutionary transformation of the relationship between Catholics
and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pope has done more for Catholic-Jewish relations than the
church had done in the previous 2,000 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he stressed that the pope's trip to the Holy Land is a
spiritual pilgrimage, McGarry said that it is also a culmination of
John Paul II's work to heal the wounds between Catholicism and
Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, director of the Anti-Defamation League in
Jerusalem and a theologian who has met with the pope to shape the
emerging dialogue between the two faiths, agreed. ``This creates a
new era, a new paradigm shift in the way the Catholic Church views
Judaism,'' the rabbi said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's efforts to come to terms with past sins began at
least five years ago when he announced his intention to make the
pilgrimage that begins March 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like five years of Yom Kippur,'' said Ron Kronish,
director of the Interreligious Coordinating Council in Jerusalem,
referring to the Jewish day of atonement. ``This is a very
significant development in Catholic-Jewish relations. It is a
genuine spirit of repentance.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll commissioned by Kronish's council found that more
than 60 percent of Israeli adults view the trip positively and only
12 percent see it negatively.
</P>
<P>
   Some extremist elements in the ultraorthodox Jewish community
have publicly protested the visit, however, and in some quarters of
Jerusalem there are posters calling the pope an ``enemy of the
Jews.'' Many other Israelis seem largely indifferent to the event
but view it as an opportunity to promote interfaith dialogue and
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of European Jews who came to Israel out of the
context of the Holocaust will have a hard time with it,'' Kronish
said. ``But the majority of Israel and Jews worldwide can and
should accept the church's efforts and say, `Hey, this is something
good, and a good way to move forward.' ''

   EDISON-SCHOOLS: KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City school
Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. wants the private sector to take

</P>
<P>
   If the school board approves, the move would push the district
further into one of the most controversial trends in education.
Proponents believe that private-management companies, compelled by
competition and a sharp focus on the bottom line, will bring to
public schools the efficiencies of free markets. By squeezing
administrative costs and using economies of scale, they say they
can spend more in the classroom and still pocket a profit. &QL;

GORE DISCUSSES REFORM WITH VENTURA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GORE-INTERVIEW)

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They looked like twins, in their blue jeans,
cowboy boots and black shirts. But Vice President Al Gore pointed
out the big difference between them _ Gov. Jesse Ventura's boots
were tan ostrich and Gore's were black leather. The governor said
the ostrich camouflaged the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``That makes them cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another difference, too. Ventura is widely perceived
as a legitimate critic of the campaign finance system, one that has
embroiled the vice president in controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wanted to meet with the famously independent
governor not to seek his endorsement but to talk about how to
overhaul the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   And he was no doubt hoping that some of the luster that Ventura
_ as well as Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former Sen. Bill
Bradley _ brought to the issue would rub off on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to raise that banner higher,'' Gore told reporters.
``Not only because of the obvious political reason that I want to
give a home for those voters who were strongly supporting Senator
McCain and Senator Bradley because of that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I acknowledge that's part of what's going on here. But also
because I believe in it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the Minnesota governor said he would give a pass
to the vice president on the issue, even though Gore narrowly
escaped being the subject of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play within the game,'' Ventura said. ``You
can't really criticize someone for playing within the set of rules
that you got to play the game within.''

HOFSTRA WINS SPOT IN NCAA TOURNEY BY BEATING DELAWARE, 76-69 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ They began the game as tense as an archery
bow. They loosened up when the pressure was at its greatest. And
then the Flying Dutchmen of Hofstra celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   It was just your usual, every-23-years event. Hofstra (24-6)
earned an automatic bid to the NCAA men's basketball tournament
Saturday by holding off Delaware, 76-69, in the America East
tournament championship game before 5,124 screaming fans at a
packed Hofstra Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Students rushing the court nearly engulfed the Dutchmen as the
buzzer sounded. And the player most responsible for getting them
there, Speedy Claxton, who was named the tournament's outstanding
player, stood on top of the scorer's table to take in the
adulation.
</P>
<P>
   Claxton earned it. He had 24 points, eight assists and seven
rebounds. He carried the cold-shooting Dutchmen on his
5-foot-11-inch frame in the first half, then nurtured them through
an 8-point deficit early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect way to go out,'' Claxton said. ``I've had
a great career here. I can leave here happy, knowing I've
accomplished what I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Claxton was not alone, though. Norman Richardson, the silky
forward who has so often turned in big performances in big games,
overcame his own early cold shooting to notch 26 points _ 20 in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   The offense stalled for one agonizing stretch before Hofstra's
coach, Jay Wright, commanded his team to get Richardson the ball.
Richardson lighted up with confidence as the feeds started coming
and the net began rippling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't imagine it would be this exciting,'' Richardson said.
``This is the best feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Gittens put Hofstra ahead for good, 67-66, with a free
throw at the 3-minute 32-second mark. Gittens' burst to the basket
drew a fifth foul from Delaware's best player, Mike Pegues, who
scored 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gittens already had done his most important work on defense,
limiting Pegues to one measly left-handed scoop shot during the
Dutchmen's comeback from a 49-41 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to to stay in front of him and outwork him,''
Gittens said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson scored 7 points and Claxton 5 points in a 12-2 surge
that vaulted Hofstra in front, 64-59. Delaware (24-7) tied the
score at 66-66 on Billy Wells' 3-pointer before the Dutchmen went
ahead for good to end Delaware's two-year reign as the conference's
representative in the NCAA field of 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better team won today,'' Pegues said.
</P>
<P>
   Without Pegues, the Blue Hens did not have the firepower to
catch Hofstra in the final minutes. They closed to within a point
once on a free throw by Wells (13 points), but Claxton responded
with a darting layup and then flicked a pass to Danny Walker for an
easier layup to put Hofstra up, 72-67, with 46 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   As the final seconds ticked off, Claxton thought, ``Finally.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who has built Hofstra from an also-ran into a contender
in six years, said he felt relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that if we didn't win this game, people would say we
can't win the big game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd, which had seen Hofstra win 25 straight less
significant games on its home floor, truly enjoyed No. 26.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a made-for-TV celebration. Students and alumni had
a lot of time to make up for, being followers of the little school
that couldn't. Now that the little school could, folks were seizing
the moment. Fans lingered on the court for more than a half-hour
with players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, at the start of the game, the Flying Dutchmen had
oozed tension, especially when they were shooting. Hofstra made
only four of its first 12 field-goal attempts. At times they stood
around on offense, waiting for Claxton to beat his man off the
dribble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried,'' Claxton said. ``It was a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the jubilant Dutchmen were cutting down the net,
and Claxton got the last loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream,'' Wright said. ``I know Speedy Claxton would
have been crushed if he had left without going to the tournament.''

   GORE _ WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore believes the turning
point in his presidential campaign was his decision last summer to
halt his constant calculations about what was best for the Clinton
administration and to start speaking ``straight from the heart.''
``I made a big change in my priorities,'' Gore said during an
interview in which he took stock of his bumpy but successful
campaign for the Democratic nomination and his general election

   BUSH-STRATEGY _ WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush, shifting into

Republican National Committee in coming weeks. A senior Bush aide
said Friday that the campaign will install a, ``general chairman
type, obviously somebody senior and somebody close to the
governor,'' at the RNC, before turning its attention to the Austin
staff. The aide said such a move is customary for the presumptive
nominee, but declined to say whom who the RNC pick will be. (Heath,

   RUSSIA-OLIGARCHS _ MOSCOW _ While experts agree that Russia's
popular acting President Vladimir Putin could be the runaway winner
in this month's presidential elections, many experts warn that none
of his efforts will matter unless he does what his predecessor
Boris Yeltsin failed to do: rein in Russia's oligarchs. Reform or
no reform, they say that Russia's woes will continue while the
robber barons retain their power. But while Putin would certainly
win about 100 percent of the vote if he did crack down on these
moneyed plutocrats, he would lose their financial backing _ crucial
to his success. (Coke, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

   STARGAZERS _ GREEN BANK, W. Va. _ In isolated Deer Creek Valley,

gigantic radio telescope with an ``ear'' bigger a football field.
Weighing 17 million pounds and rolling on a 25-foot-thick
foundation of reinforced concrete, the Green Bank telescope will be
``one of the largest moving things on Earth,'' its builders
promise. Since 1958, an astronomy observatory has been located at
Green Bank precisely because it is so remote and surrounded by
mountains that block out all radio interference. About 130
scientists and engineers live near the rural community of Green
Bank, which is 100 miles from the nearest town. The scant populace

   RACE-FIRSTPERSON _ WASHINGTON _ Growing up in Liberia, I was not
aware of the racism that plagued America, even though my country
was founded by freed slaves from the United States. It wasn't until
I came to the United States at age 10 that I learned about slavery
and racism in America, which was a shock at first. I also heard the
word nigger for the first time when I got here. My recent visit to
Selma, Ala., gave me a new perspective on the civil rights movement
and American race relations. (Ismail Turay Jr./Cox News Service).

sent warships into the Taiwans Straits four years ago to quell a

support for the latter _ the Clinton administration has
incrementally backed away from its iron-glove handling of relations
with the mainland. So much so, that many Asia observers are now
asking ``Would the United States wage a war a world away to save
Taipei from an aggressive Beijing seeking to re-unify China _ at
all costs? We poll the administration, as well as the presidential
candidates. (Deans, Cox News Service).

And he's working again; a restaurant of his design just opened in

 &HT;    With a new crew and altered car, Jeff Gordon's results have been
subpar
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The smiles were broad and bright Friday as Jeff Gordon
eased the No. 24 Chevrolet into the garage stall after his
qualifying run at Atlanta Motor Speedway. That sudden breeze was
the collective sigh of his beleaguered race crew.
</P>
<P>
   After two humdrum practice sessions (23rd and 27th fastest), the
mood of Gordon's team changed quickly, like the bright sunshine
that chased away the gray storm clouds an hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it was only qualifying, and Gordon isn't on the pole for
today's Cracker Barrel 500, but his seventh-fastest lap of 191.947
mph puts him close enough to challenge on a track where he's won
two of the past three races.
</P>
<P>
   A new pit crew, new crew chief and new body style on the Chevy
have conspired to rob Gordon of his old results. He's off to an
uncharacteristically dreadful start.
</P>
<P>
   Misfortune has been riding shotgun in the 24. An oil leak early
in the Daytona 500 dropped Gordon four laps down, and he finished
34th. A week later at Rockingham, he lost two laps early and
finished 10th. At Las Vegas last week, Gordon wrecked in practice,
then lost a lap when he made a long pit stop for an adjustment
early in the race and finished 28th.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has gone eight races without a top-five finish, the
longest drought of his 226-race Winston Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take things for granted,'' Gordon said. ``We can't
expect to just go out there and be the best every weekend.
Certainly, the last couple of weeks have been humbling enough to
prove that to us. I think that's going to make us stronger in the
long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pressure is falling on Robbie Loomis, who has
replaced Ray Evernham as Gordon's crew chief. ``I'm not sleeping,''
Loomis said. He learned about pressure working for a bona fide
legend, Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``On days when you weren't getting your job done,'' Loomis said,
``that cowboy hat and sunglasses made him look like he was about
100 feet tall.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, no one in the Cup garage believes the 24 team's best
days are over because of three bad races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be every driver's dream to be in a position where you
lose three races and everybody is starting to ask questions about
`whatever happened to...?''' said Kenny Irwin, driver of the No. 42
Chevy. ``They might be having a little bit of a slump, but it's not
over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old saying _ the sun don't shine on a hound dog all
the time,'' Michael Waltrip said. ``They'll be back. It's like one
of those Halloween movies. You might think the guy is dead, but he
always comes back, usually when you least expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's way too early to declare Gordon dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three races is pretty early, no matter how horrible those
three races are,'' Gordon said. ``Certainly, the way we're looking
at it, we've got some steps to take before we start saying we're
going to win the championship. Finishing races competitively is
what's on our mind right now, not what we've done the last couple
of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said he is leaning on lessons learned in his early racing
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know times when I've struggled. They all
think I've just won races and been competing for a championship
every year. There have been times when I've struggled, when I lost
a ride, when I was wrecking every weekend and wasn't going fast
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened when Gordon was 18, racing sprint cars. And how
would you feel being the guy who fired Gordon, who grew up to be a
three-time Winston Cup champion?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he feels good because I was costing him a lot of
money,'' Gordon said. ``The greatest thing that happened to me is I
started running USAC (midgets) after that and started winning right
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a period of time where I (was thinking), man, I
don't know how to drive this race car. It's me. I went on to do
some pretty great things and realized when the car was right, when
I could tell them to do the right things, that we won races. That's
the thing I've always got to remember: a lot of getting that car
right is a lot of what I say and how I say it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been all communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not happy with the finishes that I've had,''
Gordon said. ``I think we all are a little bit frustrated, some
with where we're finishing, some with this new Monte Carlo. We were
hoping and expecting it to be a lot better than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing we've been lacking is finding the setup,''
Loomis said. ``Stuff has changed a lot with this new body style. We
really haven't found the setups that we need under it. The hard
part right now is we're having to test when we're under the clock.
We've got 10 races in a row. We're doing a lot of our development
from week to week.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Gordon is trying to put on a positive spin. ``I
don't think it's a bad thing to go through what we're going through
right now,'' he said. ``I've had it pretty good, things have gone
really well for us on this team. I think this will truly tell us
what we're really made of. That's not a bad thing.''

KANSAS CITY LOOKS FOR LONG-TERM BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT SOLUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BLAIR KERKHOFF and RANDY COVITZ  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The human history of the Big 12 men's
basketball tournament sits together in Section 106, about halfway
up on the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Four women, the youngest 77 years old, take in every moment of
action at Kemper Arena, even though their favorite team, Kansas
State, lost in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Schletzbaum, Jane Weingart and Jean Householder of
Atchison, Kan., and Mary Harmon of Lawrence, Kan., have attended
all 24 Big Eight or Big 12 tournaments at Kemper. Householder's
days as a spectator date to Big Seven tournaments in Municipal
Auditorium and even NAIA tournaments in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years in Kemper, their seats have been moved from
midcourt to the front row behind the baseline to their current
location, halfway up the end zone. That last shift occurred when
the Big 12 was formed four years ago and it reassigned ticket
holders. Fans who didn't see the women in their familiar seats and
saw them with binoculars made it a point to stop by.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came up and told us they remembered us sitting there and
wondered if they'd see us again this year,'' Schletzbaum said.
``That was nice of them. We wouldn't think of not coming to the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   But the group will have a difficult decision in two years. After
the 2002 men's tournament at Kemper and women's tournament at
Municipal, the events move to Dallas. For the first time since
World War II, Kansas City will be without a tournament that did not
start with ``Big'' and end in ``Six,'' ``Seven,'' ``Eight'' or
``12.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be as if a longstanding relationship is over but the
person still sits next to you in class. Can we still be friends?
</P>
<P>
   That is where Kansas City and the Big 12 tournament find
themselves this weekend. The breakup was one-sided, with the
conference making the announcement last October. The tournament
returns to Kansas City in 2005, but after that, no rotation has
been set. Cities such as Oklahoma City and San Antonio are expected
to make pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is already thinking beyond 2005. Maybe not planning,
but thinking. Renovating Kemper some more, re-inventing the West
Bottoms and getting serious about a new arena are all ideas
expressed by city leaders in this year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a wonderful run with the Big Eight and Big 12,''
said Bill Nelson, retiring president of the Bank of America Kansas
City region and a civic leader. ``We didn't get this by birthright.
We need to compete and earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of basketball's history, Kansas City did not have to
worry about its future as a tournament town. With events that date
to the days of former University of Kansas professor James
Naismith, Kansas City was a major basketball destination.
</P>
<P>
   A world championship was staged in Kansas City in 1905. An
original Olympic qualifying tournament in 1936. And the second NCAA
championship in 1940 financially salvaged what has become the
organization's crown jewel, the NCAA Tournament. Kansas City has
been home to more Final Fours and NCAA Tournament games than any
other city. Kansas City's place in basketball lore is secure.
</P>
<P>
   But a building that has not kept up with the times and an
expanded conference have put an end to what had once seemed an
infinite tournament time line.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper Arena opened in 1974 and sits in the largely undeveloped
West Bottoms. When the men's tournament moves to Dallas, it will
operate in the new American Airlines Arena, complete with the
amenities of most modern structures and located near the city's
trendy West End.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a fan, patron amenities are sometimes more important than
the caliber of play,'' said Chris Plonsky, Texas senior associate
athletic director. ``During the Big Eight days, when the caliber of
play was fantastic, people cared about coming and seeing three days
of great ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed. The discretionary sports fan with his
corporate ticket wants more.''
</P>
<P>
   Things that Kemper does not provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wider concourses, wider seats, cup holders are the type of
amenities people are getting in the major-city new arenas,'' said
Tim Allen, Big 12 associate commissioner. ``If you're a fan intent
on watching basketball, you may overlook them, but those are things
people are starting to take into consideration more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Those amenities are or will be available in Dallas, the new
arena in Oklahoma City and in every other major city in the Big 12
that has an eye on playing host to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to show that kind of progress as this event
goes to Dallas, because the new arena in Dallas will be a
spectacular arena, one that our schools will be impressed with,''
said Kevin Weiberg, Big 12 commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   A new arena for Kansas City is a never-ending subject. But
without a major-league sports tenant, the city struggles with
feasibility and need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kemper is great for now,'' said Nelson, a proponent of
building a new arena. ``But we need to think in terms of our
competition for conventions. We're told over and over again that
major conventions are looking for a major gathering hall and an
arena that would fill that need with a capacity to seat 18,000 to
20,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   But new arenas, at least the ones in NBA cities, cost more than
$100 million, although the new arena in Oklahoma City, expected to
open in 2001, cost $82 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a lot of money and fortitude,'' said Gil
Bourk, chairman of the Kansas City Organizing Committee, which
works with the Big 12 host committee. ``No one has been able to
prove to me that it makes sense.'' (MORE)

 KANSAS CITY, Mo.: that it makes sense.''  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big 12 says it is not forcing the issue. The league,
however, requested and received improvements to Kemper and
Municipal four years ago when the Big 12 was formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conference does not want to be put in a position of
telling Kansas City, `Build a new building or else,''' Allen said.
``That's a decision that the community has to make. The real
question is, can the community afford not to build a new
building?''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gray, president of the Greater Kansas City Sports
Commission, said the city should strengthen its position by looking
beyond any improvements to Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing other communities have is an entertainment
district,'' Gray said. ``There's a lot of land by Kemper.''
</P>
<P>
   And a plan to develop it. Bill Haw, president of National Farms
Inc., owns the Livestock Exchange Building and 25 acres around it
at the West Bottoms. He is talking about major development and
multilevel parking in the area in hopes of being able to ``create a
hospitable, festival atmosphere around the Kemper.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the improvements will not change the notion that the
tournament needs to move around for competitive balance. Travel is
more difficult for the distant Texas schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't discount the people to whom it means the most, the
players and coaches,'' Plonsky said. ``It's a flat-out competitive
issue. That's been lost in the discussion. People point south and
say people don't care about basketball in Texas. That's not true.
It has to be given a chance to be seen in other parts of the
conference. Like football.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, football. Kansas City is losing the basketball events
after 2002, but in 2001 the city will hold the championship
football game and basketball tournaments. The city has little
college football tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the economics of football and all the
benefits to the community...you're talking about 80,000 fans,
national television and all that,'' said Gray. ``If we get into the
position of having football and or basketball every year, that's a
huge victory for this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Big 12 sees cultivating basketball in Texas as being
a big victory for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going to help this conference more than a strong
fan base in our largest state,'' Allen said. ``If Baylor fans go to
the tournament in Dallas and have a good experience, that's a
tremendous marketing tool for them and the entire conference. Right
now, we're marketing our product in one city.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a city, mind you, that many think cannot be topped as a
tournament site. The tournament historically has rivaled others at
the gate, and this year's men's and women's events could be the
best from a competitive standpoint. Six men's teams are hopeful of
NCAA Tournament bids, which would be a league record. The women
also are making a push for six bids, which would tie the number
they got in the conference's first season.
</P>
<P>
   The men sold out in advance for the first time since the
inaugural tournament in 1997, thanks to a new policy that allowed
Chiefs season-ticket holders to buy tickets returned by the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, Iowa State, whose fans traditionally follow the
basketball team in great numbers, has the top-seeded teams in both
tournaments. As many as 5,000 fans have come to Kansas City to see
the Cyclones play. If they had their druthers, they'd play here
every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy the tournament is moving,'' said Bill Fennelly,
Cyclones women's coach. ``People take vacations in Ames (Iowa
State's home) and come to the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Won't they vacation in Dallas or elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   ``They will,'' Fennelly said. ``But we'll have people who jumped
in the car Saturday morning and said, `What the heck, let's go
watch the game (in Kansas City).' You can't say, `What the heck,
let's go watch the game in Dallas.' Not unless you have a private
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   In three years, however, David and Joy Oates, Texas Tech fans
from Brownsfield, Texas, will like the tournament's proximity to
their home.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Oates, while at the women's tournament at Municipal, said:
``Dallas has so many people who graduated from the Texas schools
that they'll support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Support doesn't naturally mean good atmosphere. Missouri coach
Quin Snyder, who played and coached at Duke, remembered an electric
feeling when the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament was in the
hoops-frenzied cities of Charlotte and Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when it moved to Atlanta or Landover, Maryland, the
feeling wasn't the same,'' Snyder said. ``It lost something.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling has never been a problem in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come to Kansas City, you feel like you're coming to a
special event,'' Weiberg said. ``From the time you step out of the
airport _ banners, signs. You get a feeling the city is focused on
the event. That will be a great challenge for a city like Dallas.
(It) doesn't have a history of putting that kind of focus on a
single event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's possible to grow that kind of interest. I look at
the success of the (Dallas Stars' NHL) hockey franchise as an
example of how interest can be generated, something that folks
thought wouldn't draw that much support.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the women in Section 106 go to Dallas?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking about it,'' Householder said. ``We haven't made
up our minds, and we have plenty of time to decide. It is
basketball.''

ANOTHER KANSAS TOWN MEANS ANOTHER BOWLING ALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Larry Woydziak admits he
isn't much of a bowler. A recent score of 87 out of 300 confirms
that.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So why is he a minor celebrity when he rolls into some Kansas
town, walks into the bowling alley and steps up to throw his
occasional gutter ball?
</P>
<P>
   Woydziak, 45, a Lawrence Fire Department captain with 22 years
of service, is on a quixotic quest: He wants to send the ball he
bought for $1.95 at a garage sale spinning down the lane in every
Kansas county that has a bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   So far Woydziak, a member of an outfit called Kansas Explorers,
has concentrated on the northeast part of the state _ around
Hiawatha, Marysville, Atchison. But in the far reaches of Kansas he
has pinpointed other alleys _ St. Francis, Sterling, Caldwell,
Beloit and more, 117 in all, just waiting for the thump of his
mother-of-pearl ball on the lane, the hum of its rotation as it
rolls, and the clatter as the pins go flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus I've heard of a private alley in a church in Kansas City,
Kansas,'' said Woydziak, ``and there's the old Seelye Mansion in
Abilene that had alleys built into it. And I want to look into the
one in a recreation center in Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does sound a little nutty, doesn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Marci Penner, of the Kansas Sampler Foundation in
Inman and who keeps track of such things, says Woydziak, as one of
the group's 1,500 Explorers, is like many members who pick out a
theme for their travels through the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one who plans to jog through every town in Kansas,''
said Penner. ``There another who wants to go to every sale barn in
the state and eat at the sale barn restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have made up their minds to photograph as many grain
elevators as they can; a few are fascinated by silos or that
specific variety of silo that has a tree growing inside; unique
graveyard statuary has grabbed others; a bunch love old barns, both
round and square; old railroad depots have turned a handful into
zealots; and, of course, there are those resolved to visit every
county courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   For an Explorer, said Penner, ``Larry's pretty average.''
</P>
<P>
   Woydziak has never bowled on a regular basis. The $1.95 ball
pretty much sums up his attitude toward equipment. Nor is he a
devotee of bowling shirts. So, why bowling?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to thinking about Rose Hill (Kan.), where my wife,
Connie, and I grew up,'' he said. ``I remember how tough it was for
a small businessman to make it in a place like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I remembered that in my drives through Kansas you'd see
these little bowling alleys in these small towns and you'd think,
`Now that's something, a bowling alley way out here.' And I thought
that bowling alleys might be a way to meet some nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the Internet, telephone books and city directories,
Woydziak located bowling establishments in all but 26 of the 105
counties in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Once in touch with the owners, Woydziak has been delighted to
find himself invited to visit and hear statements like: ``Let us
know when you're coming; we'll open up special, and we'll even have
people for your to bowl with.'' That's country friendliness, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Woydziak expected a dearth of alleys in western Kansas, but he
says he's been surprised at the number of counties in the eastern
part of the state that are bereft of facilities for what is still
America's most popular participant sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest thing is to get a number, call it, and hear that
it's been disconnected,'' he said. ``Right there you know there was
a bowling alley but it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The closures, Woydziak said, signal the slow demise of something
special _ the heyday of the small-town bowling center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the feeling a lot of them are just holding on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, said Mark Jensen of Wichita, director of the American
Bowling Congress in Kansas, bowling lanes in small towns were akin
to community centers.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling then, said Jensen, was the recreation. Oh, there was
snooker down at the beer joint. Or old men playing checkers or
dominoes. Maybe a rodeo in the summer. But aside from church and
the PTA, it was bowling that brought a lot of people together.
</P>
<P>
   He said bowling was something an entrepreneur could get into
fairly cheaply, what with financing deals offered by the big
bowling suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember back in the 1950s and 1960s bowling alleys were so
popular they were open all night and you'd have to actually shoo
people out just to clean up,'' said Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   But then, he said, came cable TV, multiplex movies in nearby,
bigger towns, stock car racing, the Internet, power boats, dirt
bikes, golf, jogging, casino gambling, professional sports teams,
kids' soccer and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Johannes, whose family has been in the bowling business for
decades in Kansas City, said bowling had changed with electronic
scorekeeping, video monitors carrying all sorts of sports, lanes
made of composite materials, keno games, sports bars, restaurants,
kid's play areas and a plethora of other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   With such conveniences, said Johannes, bowling is thriving in
big and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But out in the country, six or eight lanes isn't going to make
it. The cost of all the new stuff is just too high. There aren't
enough people.''
</P>
<P>
   There are enough for Woydziak. Without crowds, he said, you get
to see the little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in this one eight-lane alley, and I was talking to the
proprietor,'' he said. ``And in came this women's league to bowl.
One of the women has a baby, the next thing to newborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she walked over and handed it to the woman I was talking
to. They didn't say a word to each other. But you could tell from
their eyes that there was total trust. The proprietor rocked the
baby and talked to me. The new mother went over and bowled and that
was that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see things like that in big towns or cities. That's
why this is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how long his quest will take or how much it'll cost is
something Woydziak isn't even thinking about. The payoff, if there
is such a thing, will be his journal, detailing every bowling alley
he visits and every proprietor, bowler, and stranger he meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, what we leave behind is mostly just a bunch of
forms,'' said Woydziak. ``I hope someday my kids and grandkids and
their kids can pick this up and enjoy reading about the old man who
went around Kansas with a bowling ball _ crazy as it seems.''

 KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ herself doing payroll.  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, School Futures notified Richey she was removed from
her duties for making unauthorized purchases, exceeding the budget
and failing to recruit enough students. Richey has been put on a
paid leave, but her dream, for now, has been snatched away.
</P>
<P>
   School Futures has declined to discuss Richey.
</P>
<P>
   Others have found the relationship with School Futures more
productive.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Guerrero, education director of Alta Vista Charter
School, said School Futures is providing $120,000 to renovate the
West Side school and help with fund raising, staff training and
student testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's been a good partnership,'' even while dealing
with the financial uncertainties that continue to buffet charter
schools, Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Richey's removal soured some in the charter-school
community on private management firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a role for the management companies, but I would
say we are wary of it,'' said Laura Friedman, who helped draft
Missouri's charter school law and advises many of the schools. ``We
tell prospective operators to ask a lot of questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Morgan, Kansas City teachers union president, said she
wanted to see results before any more district schools were turned
over to private operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real hard for me to accept people making a profit on our
children's education,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bartman, Missouri education commissioner, poses the
pivotal issue for many who have watched the district's students
fall behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that the Kansas City system is not serving its
students well, we all have to be open to new possibilities,''
Bartman said. ``If they can get the job done of educating the kids
and educating them well and they can get a profit, more power to
them. '' Where's the payoff?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pingpong rhetoric over philosophical merits of
private companies educating students, there is an economics problem
yet unciphered. Can they make money running schools? Most of the
companies are private businesses and do not report their financial
performance. The two companies that are publicly traded have had
huge losses and uninspiring stock results.
</P>
<P>
   TesseracT Group of Scottsdale, Ariz., is being restructured
after reporting a $10.6 million loss for the six months that ended
Dec. 31, and the Nasdaq exchange delisted the stock for failing to
meet minimum results.
</P>
<P>
   Edison Schools was founded in 1991 by Whittle, who believed
business had to be able to do a better job than the academic
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Edison, which brought on former Yale University President Benno
Schmidt as chairman, had invested $160 million in its projects as
of last November but reported a $50.4 million loss last year on
$133 million in revenues. It lost $2,068 for each of its 23,900
students and just reported a $14 million loss for the first six
months of this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The company predicts it will be profitable in 2004, when it
projects it will run 400 schools with about 260,000 students and
have $1.8 billion in revenue. It now has 79 schools and 38,000
students. Edison's stock, which was priced at $18 a share when it
went public in November, is now trading around $18.
</P>
<P>
   Whittle said Edison would become profitable as it achieved
economies of scale. Merrill Lynch, which handled Edison's stock
offering, predicts that Edison's administrative costs will drop to
6 percent from about 17 percent and that it eventually will bear a
7 percent return on investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have hundreds and thousands of schools to spread our
costs across,'' Whittle said. ``We are negotiating with a computer
company to buy 250,000 computers. We can do that because we have a
national system.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch touts big potential for school management. Its
research says the country spends about $360 billion a year on
elementary and secondary education, ``but our return on investment
is woefully inadequate.'' According to Merrill Lynch, if Edison
captured a 1 percent share, it would have $3.6 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But some financial analysts say these projections are
misleading. Most of America's schools are performing well, making
them unlikely candidates for privatization.
</P>
<P>
   If there are profits to be had, they are more like McDonald's
than Microsoft _ very small, said Thomas Toch, a Brookings
Institution scholar who is writing a book on the subject. ``They
will have to get very big and then have to operate very
efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Some educators watching the privatization trend say economies of
scale may be trickier to achieve in education than in other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look at education, it doesn't benefit much from economies
of scale. The largest districts and largest schools are the most
inefficient in terms of cost and outcomes,'' said Henry Levin, an
economist and director of the National Center for the Study of
Privatization in Education at Columbia University, which is
evaluating the movement. ``My own view is, the answers are out on
how well they will do, and there are no assurances that they will
be profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City may benefit from hiring Edison while the company is
young and investing heavily in schools in hopes of attracting more
customers, Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edison is probably a good buy for your school district because
Edison is putting in more than they're getting out right now.''

QUESTIONS STILL SURROUND PRIVATELY MANAGED PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER and PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City School
District Superintendent Benjamin Demps Jr. wants the private sector
to take over more of the district's worst-performing schools to
improve achievement and compete with charter schools.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the school board approves, it would push the district further
into one of the most contentious trends in education.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents believe that private management companies, compelled
by competition and a sharp focus on the bottom line, will bring to
public schools the efficiencies of free markets. Supporters say
that by squeezing administrative costs and using economies of
scale, private companies can spend more in the classroom and still
pocket a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Currently a dozen school-management companies operate about 200
schools nationwide with about 100,000 students. Merrill Lynch
analysts estimate that private companies eventually will manage 20
percent to 30 percent of public schools. While school companies
have yet to make much, if any, money, they promise that both
students and investors will profit from their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical educators, however, say there is no evidence that
business brings anything special to the operation of schools.
Pointing to health care, they warn that market incentives bring the
temptation to cut corners and wring larger returns. Academics and
economists studying the movement say there is no assurance of
long-term profitability and wonder what will happen to students in
privately operated schools that fail.
</P>
<P>
   A public debate has erupted over claims by school-management
companies that they have produced significant learning gains.
Education researchers say it is simply too early to tell. Teachers
union leaders and other detractors also express philosophical
reservations about for-profit education and believe any savings
extracted from the system should benefit students and not be paid
to shareholders and owners.
</P>
<P>
   H. Christopher Whittle, chief executive of Edison Schools, the
country's largest school-management company, sums up the debate
this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: How do you run a good school and make a
profit? Critics will say that what we will do is dramatically
decrease what we offer in the classroom. But we don't do less; we
do more. If we didn't, we couldn't stay in business.'' Looking for
options
</P>
<P>
   As test scores of students in districts like Kansas City have
fallen behind national averages, many parents have tired of the
public school monopoly. They have turned to charter schools as an
alternative, and some charter schools have turned to private
enterprise for help. So has the Kansas City district, which
contracts with Edison to operate Woodland Elementary. The New
York-based company also manages two of the city's 15 charter
schools, including one overseen by the district.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are publicly funded but operate free of many
local and state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Longer school days and school years, more teacher training,
proven curriculum and heavy use of computers are ways private
management companies hope to improve on what is done in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene S. Ruffin, president of School Futures Research
Foundation, a San Diego-based nonprofit management firm, said there
were some simple but dynamic differences between privately run
schools and their public counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (charter) law allows you to remove many of the barriers
about what you should teach, when you should teach and how you
should teach,'' Ruffin said. ``It allows you to choose who works
for you, both administrators and teachers. Our teachers are paid
according to the performance of children in their class. They get
bonuses and raises based on performance, not the degrees they have
earned or tenure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin concedes that the first year is chaotic as the staff
adapts to a business model, being accountable for budgets as well
as grades. Banneker Charter Academy of Technology, run by School
Futures, illustrates that poignantly. Broken dreams
</P>
<P>
   Esther Richey, a former Kansas City School District principal,
recruited School Futures when she desperately needed money to fund
her dream of opening a charter school. She persuaded the school's
board to hire the company, and she became an employee.
</P>
<P>
   For 7 percent of the money the school received, School Futures
covered building costs and promised to run the business side of
Banneker, leaving Richey free to oversee education.
</P>
<P>
   The school immediately ran into problems, Richey said.
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms were scattered among three central city buildings,
transportation fell apart, cafeteria costs ran over budget, bills
went unpaid, and Richey found herself doing payroll.

BROTHERS TAKE TWO PATHS IN LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sammy and Danny Batres play on the same worn and
rutty streets of suburban Pacoima. They wear identical toothy
grins, and walk with the same swagger. They share a bunk bed in the
same converted garage.
</P>
<P>
   But the brothers are headed down different paths.
</P>
<P>
   It's as clear as two papers affixed to the family refrigerator:
One is an award 10-year-old Danny got for perfect attendance at
Vaughn Next Century Learning Center, where he was ``student of the
week.''
</P>
<P>
   The other note is a probation report 14-year-old Sammy received
for getting caught with a knife at school.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy is a gang member who already has taken a bullet. Danny is
a good student at a renowned charter school and wants to become a
scientist and study volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that I don't want to get into gangs,'' Danny said.
``I want to go to college, get a job and have a fine wife.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sammy, the world of gangs seems inescapable, even at his
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't straighten out,'' he said. ``This is my life. This is
my world.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Batres brothers are emblematic of families
across the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles who struggle to keep
their children out of gangs. These youths' paths raise a key
question for parents: Why do some children inexorably stray toward
trouble, while others do well in school and excel?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a few stories like this,'' said Steve Martinez,
a former member of a Pacoima gang and now the associate director of
Communities in Schools, a dropout prevention and youth intervention
program in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times we run into older brothers who don't want their
younger brothers to go through what they are going through because
they understand the danger the danger of being shot, of being hurt.
But more than likely, the younger brother follows in the footsteps
of the older brother.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Maritza Hernandez said she feels helpless as she watches her
sons take different paths. Five men in the family uncles and
cousins have joined gangs. One is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Salvadoran said she fears for Sammy's life in
their neighborhood, which police have declared is affected by
gangs. Crime there is down 3.3percent, but still 84 serious crimes
were logged in the small neighborhood hard against the 118 Freeway,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   So out of desperation, Hernandez decided in recent days to send
Sammy to live with his father in Ohio, from whom she is separated.
A short, stocky woman with strands of gray hair covering black,
Hernandez, who earns just $12,000 a year making wooden reeds for
clarinets at a local warehouse, hopes a heavy hand of guidance and
encouragement will keep Danny on the right path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to do,'' she said recently, tears welling.
``I keep telling him, `If this is the way you are, then Danny might
start going in the same path. I want the gang life to stop here.'''
</P>
<P>
   The family lives in a $400-a-month converted garage, divided
into the boys' bedroom and a living room, where their mother sleeps
on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   The only place for Danny to do his homework is on the small
kitchen table, with its Winnie the Pooh place mats and the
occasional cockroach.
</P>
<P>
   In better days, the three used to drive downtown to the Hungry
Bear restaurant every Saturday for barbecue, but then Sammy got
older and began hanging out with friends more. No time for family,
he would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Sammy, I can't sleep,'' she said. ``I keep thinking he is
going to get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether sending Sammy to live with his father will turn him
around, no one knows. Hernandez can only hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boys are my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his experience as a counselor, Martinez worries that it
might be too late for Danny.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good move by taking (Sammy) out of it,'' he said.
``But the fear now is that the image of his older brother might
stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny already feels the allure of gang life. He and his friends
are enamored of graffiti, some of which was scrawled by his big
brother around the neighborhood. They spend countless hours after
school admiring gang tags on walls, on abandoned homes, and in
gutters.
</P>
<P>
   Like many youngsters, Danny doodles on his schoolwork. But
instead of drawing cars or people, Danny practices his tag.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)  &UR;
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Check it out,'' he said. Then he added, ``I tag on paper at
school every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny stays a little closer to home than his brother, but
sometimes strays into the gray haze of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He and his friends say they enjoy throwing rocks, lemons and
eggs at passing cars. Sometimes they tie rocks to the ends of
fishing poles and break car windows. Other times they play with BB
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy wanders a little farther. A popular spot several blocks
away is the ``Backwall,'' a series of large walls cutting an
embankment between the Ronald Reagan Freeway and an industrial
complex along Paxton Street.
</P>
<P>
   This spot is the gangsters' canvas, where they spray-paint their
names and cross off rivals' names in all colors, shapes and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my brother here one time,'' Sammy said as cars could be
heard whizzing by on the freeway above. ``He was like, `Whoa, this
is cool.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The thrill for Danny extends only so far, though.
</P>
<P>
   When his brother came home crying and bleeding from a gunshot
wound to the calf one November night, Danny began to think hard
about where he wanted to go in life.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred when Sammy and some friends had gathered on
the sidewalk in front of a friend's house after a wedding. A car
pulled up to the curb and someone inside shouted, ``Where you fools
from?''
</P>
<P>
   Then someone in the car drew a gun and started firing. Everybody
scattered. A bullet struck Sammy in the calf.
</P>
<P>
   It became his mark of manhood, a badge of courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullet went up into the back of my knee,'' he said
recently, displaying the wound.
</P>
<P>
   But to Danny, the wound was a mark of stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he got shot, I told him, `If you get shot one more time,
you're not going to be my brother anymore,' '' he said. `` `You're
going to be dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy, who spent a week in Juvenile Hall for his
knife-possession offense and is on probation until he is at least
18 in California, does not condone his gangster lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my brother did that,'' Sammy said, ``I'd knock him
around.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one so far has been able to persuade Sammy that the life
of a gangster is no life at all. He brags about what he sees as
perks: girls, for one.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has seven girlfriends, displaying pictures of them
recently at his home. ``These two are sisters,'' he said of two
young, good-looking dark- haired girls.
</P>
<P>
   He hangs with his friends, smoking pot and drinking. ``I like
the high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He claims he gets respect. ``We're known around the Hall''
</P>
<P>
   the Hall being Juvenile Hall.
</P>
<P>
   No one can tell him otherwise, not even Carl Cruz, 26, Sammy's
uncle and a man who has acted as a mentor. A former member of a
Pacoima gang, Cruz blames a big part of the problem on Sammy's lack
of a father figure at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no structure,'' said Cruz, who joined Victory
Outreach, a group working to cut gang violence in the Northeast
Valley. ``There's no discipline. Sammy dominates the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz also knows how easy it is for a younger brother to follow
in his older brother's footsteps. He followed two older cousins
into gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he is doing, you want to do,'' he said. ``It is hard
for a younger brother to detach from that and make his own
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   There might be hope for Sammy, though, Cruz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he wants to change, but the structure at home doesn't
allow that,'' he said. ``He's smart. He has a lot of talent. But he
needs a strong hand on him so he can shape up.'' &UR;

 By RICHARD L. BERKE and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In an audacious attempt to turn one of his greatest
vulnerabilities into an asset, Vice President Al Gore said Saturday
that he would make overhauling the campaign finance system a
central theme of his presidential bid. He brushed aside fresh
questions about his own conduct in raising money, insisting that he
had learned from his mistakes and was seizing the issue with the
passion of a convert.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made it clear that he viewed his heightened zeal for
campaign finance not only as a draw for the independent voters who
had flocked to Sen. John McCain of Arizona but as an organizing
principle for his campaign against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. He
contended that Bush had proposed an unworkable and perhaps ruinous
economic plan because he was beholden to the special interests _
including the chemical industry and assorted ``fat cats'' _ who
have financed his campaign and expect a break on their corporate
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In his first substantive interview since effectively securing
the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, Gore on Saturday
offered one of his bluntest condemnations of Bush. Signaling that
he was ready to dive into a months-long battle with the two-term
governor, Gore said repeatedly that Bush lacked the experience to
be president, stoking questions that swirled in the primaries over
his rival's gravitas. He said this was evident in the governor's
failure to put forth a ``presidential-class'' economic plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder, does George W. Bush have the experience to
be president?'' Gore asked in an interview in his cabin aboard Air
Force II as he flew here from Minneapolis. ``I think that these two
issues are closely related. The people of this country
overwhelmingly reject this risky tax scheme that would put Social
Security and Medicare at risk and threaten our prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``So why is he proposing it, even though the numbers don't add
up? Because the vast majority of the soft-money donors have this
risky tax scheme as their personal top priority. The agenda of the
special-interest donors supporting Governor Bush is completely
different from the agenda of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had adopted the passion of a convert on campaign
finance in part because of the ``pain'' he experienced following
revelations of his role in aggressively collecting money for his
and President Clinton's re-election in 1996. People close to Gore
said that he was particularly stung because he had always prided
himself on his image of being above reproach. As part of his new
offensive Saturday, Gore did something he rarely does _ he uttered
the words ``Buddhist temple,'' a phrase he had been careful to
avoid. Now that one of his longtime fund-raisers has been convicted
of excesses in connection with a fund-raising event at a Buddhist
temple, and fresh video has been released of him with the
Buddhists, he seemed to have less trouble saying the words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake going to that Buddhist temple; I made a
mistake in making telephone calls from my office,'' he said. ``And
I have learned from those mistakes.'' Leaning forward in a folding
chair for emphasis, Gore added: ``I have a passion for campaign
finance reform that is fueled in part because of the pain of those
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to try to embrace campaign finance as an issue
is striking, given his own history _ and the fact that when the
disclosures first surfaced about his fund-raising, he steadfastly
refused to concede any error. He has apparently decided that
emphasizing the issue might be his best hope for attracting
McCain's supporters and for inoculating himself against the Bush
campaign's drive to continually try to link the vice president to
campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Bush has ridiculed Gore for calling on him to
reject unregulated soft money in the campaigns this year while at
the same time the vice president has been aggressively raising such
funds. Saying that he was no hypocrite, Gore pointed to his
appearance Saturday morning in Minneapolis with Gov. Jesse Ventura,
the independent who is a champion of campaign reform. Gore sought
to validate his own position by saying of Ventura: ``He's probably
the best-known advocate of reform among the independents of this
nation. And he makes the obvious point: That there's no
inconsistency whatsoever in calling for a ban on soft money and
playing by the rules as they currently exist. It's the same thing
as arms control _ you can be for arms control without being for
unilateral disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Gore repeatedly invoked the name of McCain
for two reasons: to use the senator's comments against Bush, a
fellow Republican, and to flag to voters that he considers himself
the legitimate heir to McCain's loyalists. He said he too has a
genuine commitment to changing the campaign finance system because,
like McCain, he has acknowledged his involvement in inappropriate
fund-raising practices. ''Like John McCain, I bring the passion
that comes from personal experience to the battle for campaign
finance reform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is so eager to raise questions about the vice
president's character that in his victory speech Tuesday night,
Bush reminded people of Gore's early explanation that his
fund-raising practices were acceptable in the 1996 campaign because
there was ``no controlling legal authority.'' And the matter shows
no signs of going away. On Saturday, The New York Times reported
that senior Justice Department officials twice urged Attorney
General Janet Reno to appoint an independent counsel to investigate
Gore for his role in fund-raising, and at one point came closer
than had been known to persuading her to appoint one.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he seemed newly repentant and energized about this
crusade, Gore at times was dismissive toward the subject. For
example, he brushed off questions about the new reports, in which
Leon Panetta, the former White House chief of staff, recalled the
vice president ``listening attentively'' to discussions about
making calls to raise hard money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's old news,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there should be an independent investigation of
his actions, if for no other reason than to reassure the public
over lingering questions, Gore laughed at the idea, and said,
``This was all reviewed three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He immediately turned to what he called questions about Bush's
campaign-finance practices. He condemned Bush for turning down
federal money for his campaign so that he did not have to accept
limits to how much he can spend. He also criticized what he called
secretly financed sneak-attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, responded: ``Al Gore can't
escape the ethical cloud he's under by raining on Governor Bush.
The vice president is under fire for his misrepresentations of his
fund-raising actions and the FBI's conclusion that he may have
given false testimony to investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gore's accusation that the governor was tied to
special interests, Fleischer added, ``Al Gore is the one who has
rewarded his special interest contributors with overnight stays in
the Lincoln Bedroom, with seats on trade missions as a quid pro quo
_ and this phony charge is more evidence of how Al Gore will say
anything, do anything, twist anything for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sensitive question of how aggressively he will advocate
to fellow Democrats that they support the administration's plan for
normalizing trade relations with China, Gore asserted that he would
be a strong advocate, even at the risk of alienating organized
labor, which opposes the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be aggressive and forward-leaning in urging
Congress to pass the China/WTO legislation,'' he said, referring to
the World Trade Organization. Asked about reverberations among
unions, he replied: ``Some of them have not yet endorsed me because
of the fact that I'm in favor of this legislation. Others have
endorsed me in spite of our disagreement on this legislation
because I agree with them on 90 percent of the issues. And George
Bush disagrees with them on 100 percent of the issues. I think it's
the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, on the campaign trail, Gore hardly mentions the trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, Gore laid out issues on which he expected to
engage Bush in the coming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said of Bush: ``He has called for a set of changes that would
severely damage Social Security. I do not favor raising the
retirement age; he has opened the door to that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the primary against former Sen. Bill Bradley, the Gore
campaign quickly lit into a suggestion that Bradley wanted to raise
the retirement age, a proposal that brings swift condemnation from
older Americans, whose votes Gore will be battling Bush for,
especially in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that Bradley bowed out of the Democratic race calling
on Gore to ``run a better campaign'' in the fall, Gore said in
response to a question that he had no regrets about his tactics or
how he had handled himself. Rather than acknowledge Bradley's
criticism that Gore had distorted his positions, Gore said only,
``I appreciated his statement of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning the topic to health care, Gore said, ``I think it's
shocking that under his governorship, Texas has become 50th out of
50 in health insurance for women and 49th out of 49 in health
insurance for children. In light of that, how can he oppose a
health care patients' bill of rights at the national level that is
real? How can he fail to put forward any program whatsoever for
expanding access to health insurance? He said yesterday or the day
before yesterday, that it's OK, because people can go to the
emergency room. Well, it's not OK, requiring people to fall back on
the kindness of strangers by showing up at the emergency room
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore refused to be drawn into a discussion of how strong a
competitor Bush would be. Asked how Bush would stack up against him
in a debate, he replied: ``I have no idea. I have no idea. I did
not watch any of the debates on the Republican side. I saw
snatches.''

BLAZERS' FUNK IS NO HIT IN PORTLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine a city where there is no pro football, no
pro baseball and no pro hockey. Or, to put it another way, one
where even the Arena Football League team moved to Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Portland, where the Blazers occupy the attention of
the average sports fan about 99.9 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fish-bowl mentality that can be wonderful when things are
going great, but also create a level of scrutiny that few NBA
players endure. Take last week's loss to the Lakers at the Rose
Garden. It was such a devastating defeat, the Blazers lost three
straight this week and four of their past five games.
</P>
<P>
   They are not only losing ground to the Lakers, they could fall
behind Indiana and finish with the third-best record in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Need a scapegoat? Blame L.A. (who else).
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, we're in a funk,'' said guard Greg Anthony.
``We've played very bad basketball since the Lakers game.''
</P>
<P>
   A funk is an understatement. The Blazers went from the
team-most-likely-to-finish-with-the-best-record, to getting
embarrassed in a 19-point home loss to Toronto, and losing to the
New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's a slump,'' said coach Mike Dunleavy. ``I
mean, we haven't played very well at times, so I would consider it
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Damon Stoudamire, who usually is more concerned about
himself than anything else, has become concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on. We need to quit worrying about
who's ahead of us and behind us in the standings and just play our
game,'' Stoudamire said. ``I hate the fact that we're so focused
on, `Did the Lakers win tonight? Who lost?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the mental strain of keeping pace with the big bad
Lakers, the Blazers are also fighting serious injury problems.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grant is bothered by an inflamed fascia in his right foot,
and is beginning to wonder how effective he will be in the playoffs
if he doesn't get better soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the way it's going to be until the end of the
season, then I have to do something,'' Grant said. ``Because if we
hit the playoffs and I'm playing like this, then I'm not going to
help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stoudamire has been slowed by a sore knee he hurt in the
Lakers game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be 100 percent for a while,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, Dunleavy can be grateful that he has
something to worry about besides Rasheed Wallace's next technical
foul, or when Scottie Pippen will experience his next bout of
sullen behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway bashing: Miami point guard Tim Hardaway was bothered by
NBC announcer Bob Costas' comment during last Sunday's Lakers-Heat
telecast that ``You could make a case for Vince Carter replacing
him on the Olympic team,'' because of Hardaway's lack of quickness
due to injuries and advancing age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the team, and there's nothing they can do (about it),''
Hardaway snapped back in response to Costas.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, it shows that Costas may be able to wax poetic
during the 20 seconds he gets to pontificate between pitches on
baseball, but basketball sometimes brings out the worst side of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone loves to berate NBA stars when they talk about taking
the summer off instead of playing for their country. So Hardaway
spent last summer loyally representing Team USA during Olympic
qualifying in Puerto Rico. His reward? Now he's being targeted for
removal by the great Costas.
</P>
<P>
   Draft threat? According to the Vancouver Province, agent Tank
Black told the Grizzlies in 1998 to bypass forward Vince Carter
because a shoe deal with Puma would be nullified if Carter were
drafted by a team in a ``small market.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a relatively moot point, because the Grizzlies were settled
on Mike Bibby with the No. 2 pick, and would have taken Michael
Olowokandi if the Clippers had passed on the unspectacular center.
</P>
<P>
   It's only today that every NBA GM will tell you that Carter was
the top player in the draft, although few had him rated among the
top two or three picks at the time.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Carter's dealings with Black and Puma have both been
shattered this season. He said he would leave Puma a couple months
ago, and suspended his relationship with Black last week. Black is
currently facing fraud and money-laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   In demand: St. John's coach Mike Jarvis has reportedly drawn
interest from the Nets, Pistons, Wizards and Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are expected to fire Don Casey sooner or later, while
the Pistons have an opening and nobody is quite sure what Michael
Jordan's plans are from day to day. As for the Celtics, it seems
Rick Pitino's tirades/bad trades may finally be catching up with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Owner testimonial: Hornets coach Paul Silas, who formerly
coached the Clippers, gave one of the strongest endorsements in
league history on Clippers owner Donald Sterling in an interview
with the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a bad fellow at all. He's a charming guy that I have
a lot of respect for,'' Silas said. ``The only thing I can't
understand is why,with all his resources, won't he step up to the
plate and really make that franchise something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready for work: Now that Sixers assistant John Calipari has
finally taken the Memphis job, former Pistons coach Alvin Gentry
and former Wizards coach Garfield Heard are the top two candidates
to replace him on Larry Brown's staff in Philadelphia.

BOSTON'S CARDINAL ASKS ATONEMENT FOR SINS OF CATHOLICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In an effort to atone for two centuries of sins,
Cardinal Bernard F. Law on Saturday night publicly asked
forgiveness for the anti-Semitism and racism of Boston Catholics
and for the sexual misconduct of parish priests.
</P>
<P>
   Law delivered his expression of public penitence on the eve of
Sunday's much-anticipated ``Day of Request for Pardon'' speech in
Rome by Pope John Paul II, who is expected to mark this Christian
season of Lent by apologizing for aspects of the Crusades, the
Inquisition, and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Law, the Catholic archbishop of Boston, prayed with several
hundred worshippers at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston as
a mix of clergy and lay people read a list of 12 ``failures of the
past,'' including behavior toward blacks, Jews, women, alienated
Catholics, immigrants, and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, in this cathedral, I seek with you God's forgiveness
for the faults of Catholics throughout the history of this
archdiocese,'' Law said in his homily at the special service of
vespers. ``We ourselves have suffered, as a community of faith, the
effects of discrimination and prejudice. All the greater should be
our sorrow, therefore, for our own acts of discrimination and
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Law has said he was inspired by the pope to seize on the theme
of reconciliation that the church has declared for the year 2000 as
a spur to review the history of the Boston Catholic community,
which was created as a diocese in 1808.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and a news conference over the past week, Law had
outlined much of the substance of his plans for Saturday night's
homily, but he had not previously revealed his plans to express
``sorrow for acts of sexual misconduct and other wrongdoing to
others, especially toward minors and women, by priests and
religious (nuns and monks).''
</P>
<P>
   During his homily, Law spoke ruefully of inappropriate conduct
by clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intolerable situations have caused great pain and have
sometimes resulted in alienation from the church,'' he said.
``There are the obvious cases of sexual abuse which have so seared
us all, and the less celebrated cases of harsh words, as well as
rough and unjust treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a session with reporters earlier in the day, Law said he felt
he could not begin to address failings in the history of the
Archdiocese of Boston without mentioning sexual abuse by clergy.
During the last 15 years, there have been at least six highly
publicized lawsuits in which Greater Boston Catholic clergy have
been convicted or the archdiocese has paid settlements for sexual
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to have included that in any general acknowledgment of
faults would have been such a glaring omission in terms of recent
history,'' Law said. ``I know that victims of abuse carry this
memory well beyond the incident or incidents in their life, and
their families do as well, and the pain really is incalculable in
these instances, so how could we go about this and not say
something about that? It would not be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Law said he is pleased with the archdiocese's current handling
of allegations of misconduct, which he called the toughest in the
country. And that claim won support from a lawyer who has
represented victims of clergy sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Roderick MacLeish Jr., who estimates he has represented
300 people allegedly abused by Catholic priests, said he welcomed
Law's apology.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's speech, MacLeish said, is only the latest in a
series of public and private efforts on the part of the Boston
archdiocese to redress the wrongs of the past. ``It's another
message of healing that's consistent with the extraordinary efforts
the archdiocese has taken over the past eight years,'' MacLeish
said. ``A lot of people would say, `Too little, too late.' I'm not
one of them, because they're not just talking the talk, they're
also walking the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Law's other remarks focused on prejudice in various
forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Catholics, we have too often been exclusive in our love and
concern, defining ourselves erroneously by race or language or land
of origin,'' he said. ``The prejudices of others have too easily
invaded our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Law went the furthest in describing Catholic behavior toward
Jews, whom he called ``God's chosen people.'' He said Catholic
behavior toward Jews had at times been ``evil'' and he asked God to
``enlighten us to respect the profound spiritual heritage that is
theirs, a heritage which enriches our own tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Law also said he regretted Catholic conduct toward blacks and
other minorities, asking God to ``strengthen us as instruments for
the freedom of all the oppressed everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other groups who have at times been ill-treated by
Catholics, Law mentioned women, immigrants, and the physically and
psychologically disabled. He did not mention gays and lesbians, and
the pope is not expected to do so either, an omission that has
triggered complaints from Dignity/USA, a group that advocates for
gay Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Law did express sorrow for the church's failure to reach out to
alienated Catholics _ a group he has said includes some gay
Catholics _ and for the church's failure to push for reconciliation
with non-Catholic Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing ongoing issues, Law expressed sorrow for Catholics
not pushing hard enough to help the poor, and for ``not defending
the dignity of every human life from the moment of conception to
the last moment of natural death.'' That language is Catholic code
for the church's opposition to abortion, capital punishment, and
euthanasia.

FOR CARTER, COMPARISONS ARE JUST BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He has the same name as Gomer Pyle's commanding
officer, which is a miserable coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   His hang time is the envy of all above-average bats.
</P>
<P>
   His maneuvers are a bit less flamboyant than Richard Simmons
after a head-on collision with caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems simple enough to define second-year Toronto Raptor
Vince Carter on these remarkable credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But he happens to stand about 6-foot-6, and invested three
seasons in the basketball program at the University of North
Carolina, which is to individuality as the Amish are to tattoo
parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Then he became Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   His sophomore season has not been compromised by jinx. The last
month has been nutty.
</P>
<P>
   After an astonishing effort in the NBA's Slam Dunk Contest,
Carter dropped 51 points on Phoenix, cooked Boston with a 3-pointer
at the buzzer, and duplicated the game-ending heroics last
Wednesday vs. the Clippers at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Such ESPN bait leaves us with the unavoidable comparisons to You
Know Who.
</P>
<P>
   For perspective, we impose upon the wisdom of Clippers assistant
coach Dennis Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was employed by the Boston Celtics when You Know Who
left a couple of permanent creases in his face during a 63-point
playoff performance 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``(You Know Who) has six championships, so it's kind of unfair
to both of them,'' Johnson said of the comparison before digging in
to advance it. ``But he (Carter) would be the only player I would
pay to go watch. I think NBC was wise to add a few Toronto games to
the schedule; the NBA really needed someone like this to come along
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a six-time member of the NBA's first-string,
all-defensive team, said the biggest difference between Carter and
You Know Who can be measured by their comparative ferocity when the
other team has the ball.
</P>
<P>
   You Know Who was a nine-time member of the NBA's all-defensive
crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince is becoming much better defensively,'' Johnson said.
``But when you compare him to (You Know Who), he's lacking just a
little bit. There are times, though, when he shows that swagger,
looks like he wants to lock you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the comparison also is skewed a bit by the
subjective variable of supporting casts.
</P>
<P>
   In You Know Who's first two seasons, his Chicago Bulls teammates
would have had difficulty covering the spread at a Gus Macker
Tournament. While the Raptors aren't exactly threatening an
overflow at Springfield, Mass., Carter does get to play alongside
two talented thugs Charles Oakley, Antonio Davis and gifted kid
cousin Tracy McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince, I'm sure, is going to get there commercially,
financially,'' Johnson said. ``and more importantly ...
basketball-wise. But he has to keep it in the proper order. (You
Know Who) always knew he had to care of business out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is pointing toward the basketball court, a place where
greatness is required before the marketing can fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what set (You Know Who) apart was something more than
desire,'' Johnson said. ``A lot of guys have great desire. But what
(You Know Who) had was the desire to always want the ball when the
game was on the line. He learned early that, along with being a
hero, you have to not be afraid about being the goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm already seeing some of that in Vince. By just saying
that, it means he's surpassed all of the next (You Know Who's)
we've seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Now that garage sales have allowed the Chicago Bulls and Orlando
Magic to become major threats in the free-agent mall, expect the
tactic to be repeated. According to league sources, the next
franchise to throw a few salaries overboard could be Atlanta. The
Hawks, who (as of Saturday) had the league's sixth-worst record,
owe the Clippers two first-round picks. One of those originally
belonged to Toronto and is lottery protected; the Raptors are
playoff-bound, so the Clips will have it this summer. The other
(the Hawks' original pick) is protected though the first nine
selections, but the Hawks may attempt to give it to the Clippers
this year, anyway. Atlanta may be just as bad (or worse) if it
moves salary this off-season, and next year's draft may be much
more tempting. ...
</P>
<P>
   The broken leg of Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin (the projected
first pick) provides enough karma for us to believe the doomed
Clippers will win the lottery. Martin is expected to make a full
recovery, but nobody will be able to work him out before the June
28 draft. And the lottery may be even worse than expected. Chris
Mihm, the 7-foot junior center from Texas, Maryland junior forward
Terence Morris, and LSU sophomore forward Stromile Swift all are
threatening to stay in school. All three are projected top-five
picks. But one scout close to the LSU program said Swift could
change his mind when he discovers just how impressed the NBA is
with his ability to run fast and jump high. The first five rotation
also may be sabotaged by the questionable health of Loren Woods,
the 7-1 Arizona junior center who has back problems. ...
</P>
<P>
   According to several NBA watchdogs, the most talented player in
this draft will be Fresno State shooting guard Courtney Alexander.
He also may be the worst defender. ... A recent Sports Illustrated
story on junior college hotshots did not mention Chris Massie, a
6-8, 250-pound power forward who averaged 19 points per game at
Oxnard. Massie, who didn't even attend high school in his hometown
of Houston, reportedly was impressive enough to inspire a scouting
visit from the Lakers. ... Friends of second-year Laker Tyronn Lue
said the 5-10 point guard loves L.A. and hates not playing enough
to welcome a trade to the Clippers. ...
</P>
<P>
   We'll support attaching microphones to the lapels of NBA coaches
when NBC rolls tape of commissioner David Stern's next chat with
players' union emcee Billy Hunter. ... Rumor has it that Clipper
Tyrone Nesby made an honest mistake in not guard Vince Carter on
Carter's game-winning shot. Clips coaches told Nesby to ``stay on
Carter,'' so Nesby made a beeline toward Butch Carter, the Toronto
coach.

NO DEAL, SO BELTRE'S CONTRACT RENEWED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. - After spending more than $290 million on free
agents and contract extensions since the end of the 1998 season,
the Dodgers apparently decided the stopping point is third baseman
Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   And the sticking point is $2 to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than put an end to the messy situation by signing Beltre
to a multiyear deal, the Dodgers instead renewed his contract
Saturday, the deadline imposed by Major League Baseball. As it
stands, Beltre will make $330,000 this season, though the sides
will continue to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   But neither side is ready to budge in their long-term contract
requests. And because of that, the distraction that's existed for
nearly five months will linger on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The date came up so we had to renew,'' Dodgers managing
general partner and CEO Bob Daly said. ``We're still trying to
figure out a method of coming up with a basis for a three-year
deal. It really comes down to the arbitration year. Adrian, as good
as we think he is, he still hasn't put up the numbers yet to figure
out how to base that arbitration year. I think there's a method of
figuring out how to do it, and that's what we're working on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I think Scott (Boras, Beltre's agent) and I
totally agree upon is the caliber of the player we're dealing
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras and Daly will continue to talk despite passing their own
soft deadline of the contract renewal day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers remain content with offering Beltre $4 to $5
million, baseball officials said. Boras remains fixed on $6 to $7
million, those officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian is having a difficult time understanding why a club who
says he's a superstar isn't willing to compensate him like one,''
Boras said. ``I'm disappointed the Dodgers would renew a player of
his stature and I'm disappointed our continuing efforts to resolve
the matter have not been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day the deal isn't done edges the Dodgers closer to a
possible disaster in a situation that could deteriorate quickly.
Beltre is seeking free agency because he was signed at age 15,
which is against baseball rules. Baseball wants the issue settled
before it reaches an arbitrator, and officials told both sides a
hearing date isn't likely until late April or early May.
</P>
<P>
   Given fan reaction, Beltre is expected to be booed when the club
opens at Dodger Stadium, and the situation could worsen the longer
the issue is unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if the process reaches arbitration, the hearing would be
conducted during the season. Beltre's family would also be brought
into the equation, which could cause irreparable damages to the
relationship between the two sides. Boras also talked about taking
the matter to court, since the Dodgers knowingly altered official
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't do anything in the next seven to 10 days,'' Daly
said, ``then we should cool it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who expressed his anxiety about bringing an end to the
situation, didn't want to talk about the issue. ``Play ball,'' he
said. ``That's all I have to say. Play ball.''

`TRAUMA' TRAINS CAMERA ON ER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Scooter Alpert bopped around the corner of the nurses'
station, his eyes flashing as he removed his surgical cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just in the operating room watching some guy get his
scalp sewn back on,'' he said, sounding like a kid at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert is no ghoul. He's a producer for Trauma: Life in the ER,
the Learning Channel's highest-rated show. He and a couple of
cameramen (one is a woman, actually) are spending March at the
emergency and trauma center at Phoenix's Good Samaritan Regional
Medical Center, filming more than 200 hours of footage for two
one-hour episodes scheduled to air sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake _ a man getting his scalp reattached is good
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Not ER TV, not exactly. Trauma: Life in the ER, now in its
fourth season, is the real McCoy. It's gripping, no matter whether
it's filmed in your local hospital or someplace across the country.
It strips away the romantic entanglements and office politics of ER
_ a show Alpert has never seen, amazingly _ and gives viewers the
bare-bones workings of a trauma center. I love ER, but this is
plenty dramatic enough.
</P>
<P>
   Trauma's cameras go everywhere _ no emergency is off-limits, no
matter how disturbing _ and although they don't ignore the blood
and guts of emergency medicine, they don't flaunt it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to focus on the people who help people, as
opposed to the gore,'' Alpert said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be people such as Robinelle Schroder, a nurse and
trauma coordinator at the Phoenix hospital, who will spend much of
the month with a camera following her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a teaching facility,'' she said. ``We're used to
people watching us.''
</P>
<P>
   Every trauma, in fact, is taped for later review anyway. Of
course, those cameras aren't literally in people's faces. Trauma's
are.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a helicopter flew in a man thrown from a car in an
accident near Buckeye. Alpert and Ed George, one of the cameramen,
met the helicopter on the roof of the hospital, tape rolling.
</P>
<P>
   They followed the victim into the trauma center, side by side
with the paramedics. (They film first and ask for consent from the
patient later. If it's not given, the footage isn't used.)
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, Alpert stepped back; George stood toe to toe with
the doctors and nurses, taking in everything through his lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of intuition, I think, staying out of the way,''
George said of the most obvious danger. ``You sort of assess the
situation, and it allows you to instinctively know where to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through, Liz Tynes began her shift behind the camera. She
and George tag-teamed the trauma from there; George moved back for
wider shots while Tynes moved in close, sometimes quizzing doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I find it really difficult,'' Tynes said of such
close shots. ``To get the good stuff _ to really be there _ you
have to get close. You can't stay back and use the zoom. You need
that immediacy.''
</P>
<P>
   We _ viewers _ do. As for the hospital staff, well . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what I'm doing,'' said Dr. Dustin Reid, a
resident whose easygoing manner gives him a natural TV appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're following me on rounds and we're not doing
anything that important, I totally notice them. And they'll ask me
questions like `What are you doing now?' and I just feel ridiculous
answering the questions with them right on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the middle of traumas, in the operating room, I don't
even notice they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the cameras _ no bigger than the camcorder you film
your child's first steps with _ helps. So does the experience of
the people behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's told me I was in their way yet,'' George said. ``I'm
sure (I have been), but they're very nice about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in each other's way all the time,'' Schroder said. ``It
hasn't been a problem. Nurses, especially, who work in the area,
are very assertive. We have no problem telling someone to get the
hell out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has taken to wearing pancake makeup to work, although
Schroder did wear her ``least-wrinkled scrub,'' she said, and Reid
got a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get traumas at 2 a.m. and you've been asleep for an
hour or two, then you get up. . . . My hair was getting a little
bit long, and it was sticking up all over the place,'' he said.
``So I got it trimmed down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trauma crew has been busy from the get-go _ hours after
setting up shop the first day, six children were brought to the
hospital, victims of a car accident. Filming kids is especially
tough, Tynes said. But much like the doctors, she and George stay
so busy working that they keep an emotional distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking through here,'' George said, pointing to the
camera, ``it doesn't bother me at all, seeing right into somebody.
It's kind of fascinating actually.''
</P>
<P>
   It is. It's a life-or-death dance playing out on camera. Who
could look away?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very eye-opening to see how on the ball these people
are,'' Alpert said. ``If I get sick, I want it to happen here.'' &QL;

RELAUNCH MAY BE SWAN SONG FOR `FREAKS AND GEEKS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - I swear to God this is our last relaunch. That is
because we have only one other option: our funeral.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   When your show's been yanked during consecutive sweeps rat ings
periods, you deserve to be a little fatalistic. In a note to TV
critics, Paul Feig and Judd Apa tow certainly sound like they are,
and who can blame them? Not long after rescheduling their bril
liant-but-low-rated show, Freaks and Geeks, NBC pulled it for the
February rating period - just like it did in November.
</P>
<P>
   The show returns Monday, March 13, instead of sending a preview
tape for just that episode, Feig and Apatow also included the last
epi sode of the season, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we sending this last episode so early?'' they write.
``Because we like it, and if you don't tell people we exist, nobody
will see it but you.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done. (For more along this vein, check out
www.freaksandgeeks.com. Geez, even the Web site is good.)
</P>
<P>
   Monday's episode is, by the way, fantastic, both heartbreak ing
and hilarious. Of course, if you're one of the discriminating TV
types who watches Freaks and Geeks, that's what you ex pect. If
you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and tune in.
</P>
<P>
   And then dash off a letter to Garth Ancier, President, NBC En
tertainment, 3000 W. Alameda Ave., Burbank, CA 91523, beg ging the
network not to cancel the show.
</P>
<P>
   Or don't. But never, ever com plain again that there isn't any
thing good on TV. There is. You just have to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to figure that the seven NBC affiliates around the
country that refused to air God, the Devil and Bob because of its
subject matter did so without seeing it. At least, you've got to
hope that they did.
</P>
<P>
   The animated series, about a Detroit autoworker trying to prove
mankind is worth saving, premiered Thursday and begins its regular
run Tuesday. It won't replace the King James version of the Bible,
but it's thoughtful, funny and, yes, irreverent. Better still, it
actually makes you think. It doesn't present religion in a
traditional way, but what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   Tell people you're a TV critic and their response is always the
same (before reading further, place nose in air):
</P>
<P>
   ``Well. I don't watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that so? According to the Television Bureau of Advertising,
most adults spend 128 minutes a day listening to the radio, 45 min
utes online, 30 minutes reading the newspaper, 19 minutes read ing
magazines - and 253 minutes watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the bureau isn't ex actly a disinterested third party,
but the numbers are convincing enough to lead one to believe that
all the folks who claim to be reading Proust might be squeez ing a
little WWF Smackdown! into their lives, as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for us TV critics, well, it's always nice to feel needed. &QL;

THE DREAM GOES ON FOR AN 88-YEAR-OLD OWNER-TRAINER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The saga of Hal's Hope added a chapter of
storybook drama Saturday when the 3-year-old colt won the Florida
Derby by a head over the favored High Yield, and advanced one
milestone closer to the Kentucky Derby with Harold Rose, his
88-year-old owner, breeder and trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope, who came from a barn filled mainly with claiming
horses and ran second to High Yield in the Fountain of Youth Stakes
three weeks ago, dueled dramatically with High Yield down the
homestretch in their return match, but did not flinch.
</P>
<P>
   They will travel on to the next prep race for the Kentucky Derby
with totally conflicting scenarios: High Yield, a son of Storm Cat,
trained by D. Wayne Lukas, the master trainer who has won the Derby
four times; Hal's Hope, a son of Jolie's Halo, trained by a man who
underwent quadruple heart-bypass surgery last summer and came back
because ``I knew I had a horse in the barn who needed me.''
</P>
<P>
   They shared the stage Saturday with two other stars of racing,
Jerry Bailey, who rode six winners (but finished eighth in the
Florida Derby aboard Elite Mercedes), and Bill Mott, who trained
four of Bailey's winners. The jockey rode in eight of the 13 races
on the program but fell one victory short of his record total of
March 11, 1995, when he rode seven winners but lost the Florida
Derby aboard Suave Prospect by a nose to Thunder Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   The winning jockey in Saturday's landmark race, by contrast, was
Roger Velez, who has never even seen a Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been to the Kentucky Derby,'' Velez said, ``but it
looks like we're going this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, however, has been to the Derby. In 1984 he got there with
Rexson's Hope, who ran 10th. But at 88, Rose is distinguished by
youthful optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I went to the Derby with a long shot,'' he said.
``This time I'm going with a contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope became a contender after winning the Holy Bull Stakes
at Gulfstream at odds of 40-1. Then, at 10-1, he ran second to High
Yield in the Fountain of Youth. And finally, he went off in the
Florida Derby at 6-1, and once more confounded the experts.
</P>
<P>
   He got the jump on High Yield at the start, and held the lead,
but never by more than half a length until they hit the
homestretch. Then Pat Day made his move aboard High Yield,
collaring the leader briefly as they raced down the stretch with
the crowd of 28,033 roaring. But High Yield could not put Hal's
Hope away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's in front,'' Rose said, ``he won't let another horse
pass him. I didn't think they could outrun him. My expectations
have been realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Velez put it, ``The good Lord gave him a horse to keep
him going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope ran the mile and one-eighth in 1:51 2/5, paid $15.80
for a $2 bet to win and earned $450,000 for his biggest payday, and
Harold Rose's. The top pair raced far in front of their eight
rivals: the nearest, Tahkoda Hills, ran third, 10 lengths away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had it entering the stretch when Pat looked
back,'' Lukas said with regret. ``But you have to give it to the
other horse, he ran a tremendous race. It looks like these two
horses are way above the other horses here in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Lukas said: ``This is a kind of happy ending.''

`HISPANIC' SEEMS TO BE GIVING WAY TO `LATINO' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - When Gil Trejo was a kid, everyone just called him
Mexican. Later, he was called a Latin American and Chicano. In the
1970s, the term changed to Hispanic. And now, he says, it seems
he's a Latino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, is it Hispanic now or Latino?'' asks the
73-year-old retired teacher and coach from west Phoenix. ``I don't
know which one everyone is using.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question heard more often as Arizona Latinos, or
Hispanics, search for ways to describe themselves, especially as
more people move here, bringing preferred labels with them.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were Hispanic for years suddenly say they're Latino.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the census will add Latino to the
Hispanic/Spanish category. Hispanic magazine regularly refers to
people as Latino. And recently, the Diablos, Arizona State
University's Hispanic alumni association, switched to the ASU
Latino alumni association.
</P>
<P>
   After all, popular culture has declared a ``Latino Revolution,''
led by Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   Even quepasa.com is taking a poll, with billboards asking,
``Hispanic or Latino?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a healthy debate,'' says Jose Ronstadt, quepasa.com's
senior vice president of content. ``Because in the end, everyone
under the umbrella is of a very rich cultural heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Since November, 5,000 people have voted on quepasa.com, with 37
percent choosing Latino, 31 percent Hispanic and the rest choosing
others, wanting to be called, Mexican, Cuban, or whatever their
national origin.
</P>
<P>
   The labels change in different parts of the country. In
California, it's Chicano or Latino. No one is Hispanic in New York,
they're mostly Cuban or Puerto Rican.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, it seems, is one of the last places to find Hispanics,
experts who study such things say.
</P>
<P>
   Many see the term ``Hispanic'' as a Richard Nixon-government
imposed label.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to name themselves, using a Spanish word,'' says
Everardo Martinez-Inzunza, director of multicultural student
services at the University of Utah, who has followed the debate for
the past few decades. ``If I call myself Latino, I have a longer
history, not one created by a government agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government coined the term ``Hispanic'' in the early
1970s when trying to categorize Spanish-speaking people.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Hispanic is too general or too hiccupy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't tell me anything about a person,'' says Jose
Martinez, 25, who works for the advocacy group Chicanos Por La
Causa. ``It waters down the identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years ago, the federal government decided to create
new ethnic labels.
</P>
<P>
   It took six months of meetings, debates, arguments and surveys,
remembers Grace Flores-Hughes, then a 25-year-old Mexican-American
from Texas who helped lead the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers her committee talking about Latino, but when taken
literally, it could include Italians and others of Latin origin.
She also worried that it sounded too masculine, excluding women.
They also pitched ``Spanish-Americans'' (too limiting) and
``Spanish-speaking Americans'' and ``those with Spanish surnames''
(too encompassing).
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hispanic) just seemed to be the only one that encompassed all
of us,'' says Flores-Hughes, who is credited _ or blamed, depending
on who's talking _ with coining the name.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, Flores-Hughes stands behind the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of it, still loyal to it,'' she says. ``You know,
you still can be Cuban or Mexican or whatever and be Hispanic.
Here's a term to best serve our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Bosque, vice president and general manager for Radio
Unica, also prefers Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day on her Valley Spanish-language station starts with
a Cuban psychologist, then a Dominican discussing telenovelas
(Spanish-language soap operas), followed by a Mexican on an
immigration show, and a Uraguayan and Mexican talking sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're diverse and our audience is diverse. But we're all
Hispanic because we all speak Spanish. Todos somos Hispanos,''
Bosque says. ``We're all Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Cuban, Bosque feels alienated by the term ``Latino,''
saying it seems to include only those from Latin America. She
prefers to say she's ``Hispanic of Cuban-American descent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people also prefer Hispanic as a way to set themselves
apart from new immigrants, says David Gutierrez, a history
professor at the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more hifalutin, high-toned label. People will say it to
mean, `We're not Mexicans, we're Hispanics,' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Herrera, 28, was born in Mexico and came to Arizona when
she was 2. ``I always say Mexican,'' she says. ``I didn't know I
was Hispanic until I started school, then I had to check a box.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, a secretary for the Department of Public Safety, says
her younger sister considers herself a Chicana and her friend, from
Venezuela, always says Latina.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many notice, it's the younger generation embracing Latino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each generation wants to name itself,'' quepasa.com's Ronstadt
says. ``They want to identify themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what many old-timers say, seeing the names change as each
generation labeling itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, I was a Mexican, a Mexicano they called me,'' Trejo
says. ``And then all the others, Chicano, Latin American, or I
can't remember the order. Then, Hispanic, and now they say Latino.
They change the monikers, but I am who I am.'' &QL;

Latino or Hispanic? The question comes more often as people search
for ways to identify themselves. &QL;

PEREZ NOT GREAT, BUT NOT TERRIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. - Dodgers left-hander Carlos Perez threw 73
pitches and allowed four runs - three earned - in three innings
against the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, that's called terrible. In this case, it's
called progress.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Dodgers and Perez - one of baseball's most expensive
works-in-progress given he's owed $12.6 million over the next two
seasons - are looking for any morsel of hope that he could be in
the rotation by opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Orel Hershiser will be the fifth starter, Perez will
likely be in the minors and the Dodgers' bullpen will be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he saw good signs from Perez,
whose velocity on his fastball was consistently 87 to 90 mph. Perez
also threw some good change-ups, but had one crushed 400 feet by
Craig Paquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was missing, but he wasn't missing bad,'' Johnson said.
``He was right around the plate. He's still cutting the fastball a
little more than you'd like to see him do it. He was overthrowing a
little bit, coming open a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, he threw the ball a lot better. He threw (73)
pitches, which tells you that's not the way he pitches. He
(usually) goes after guys. He missed a lot of pitches. He still has
a tendency, I guess from last year, to come flying open a little
bit and trying to make it up with his arm. His rhythm is not there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is Perez never found his rhythm in `99, which is why
every start now is subject to scrutiny. He went 2-10 with a 7.43
ERA last season, and after a winter of work allowed five runs in
his first inning this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm strength is good and my velocity is good,'' said Perez,
who has a 14.40 ERA this spring. ``I had a little trouble with my
fastball away. The homer, it was one of the better pitches I threw.
It was low and away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about what the people are saying. I want to be
consistent, throw fastball, fastball, fastball. Like I said before
and I'll say it all the time, this season isn't going to be like
'99. I feel my mind is clean. Every day I feel more comfortable,
more happy, compared to last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable Cora: After a shaky start in which Alex Cora fought
jitters in the field and had poor at-bats, he's settled down the
last four or five days and played well at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, 24, said he relaxed after talking with his brother, Joey,
a former big-leaguer and now a minor-league coach in the Chicago
Cubs organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning I wasn't playing relaxed,'' Cora said. ``I
thought it was going to be easier. I felt the pressure a little
bit. I learned from it. (Joey) called me and we had a little chat,
about 45 minutes, and he told me to have fun and play hard. That's
all I can control.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Lefty Onan Masaoka pitched a perfect inning of
relief and doesn't appear to be far behind, despite missing two
weeks with a sprained ankle. ``He threw the ball real good,''
Johnson said. &QL;

He pitched three hitless innings in his last outing. St. Louis
counters with righty Darryl Kile, acquired in an offseason trade
with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's result: Dodgers pitchers continued to get hit hard in

YANKEES TAKE INTEREST IN EDMONDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- With left fielder Ricky Ledee struggling at the
plate and the team off to a slow start this spring, the Yankees are
intensifying their efforts to acquire Angels center fielder Jim
Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees apparently are willing to part with Ledee as part of
a package for Edmonds, but so far have been reluctant to give up
either pitcher Ramiro Mendoza or infielder Alfonso Soriano.
However, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner has held numerous staff
meetings lately and could order a deal to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night in Sarasota, Fla., Mendoza pitched against the Reds
in front of Angels scouts, and gave up two runs and five hits in
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees want to keep Soriano because they plan to use him as
bait in their pursuit of Twins starter Brad Radke. And if Mendoza
goes in a deal to the Angels, the Yankees would want to fill that
void in the pitching created by his departure.
</P>
<P>
   If they do acquire Edmonds, the Yankees would consider putting
Edmonds in center and moving Bernie Williams to left, provided
manager Joe Torre could convince the sensitive Williams it would be
best for the team.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees would prefer Edmonds, they also have interest
in Expos outfielder Rondell White.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Scott Schoeneweis and utility player Benji Gil made
strides Saturday in their efforts to make the team out of spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis, competing with numerous pitchers for a spot in the
starting rotation, started Saturday's 7-3 win over the Colorado
Rockies. He gave up one run and four hits in four innings, striking
out two (including Larry Walker) and walking none.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis made the team out of spring training last season as
a reliever, but later was demoted to triple-A Edmonton and sulked
while in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an experience,'' Schoeneweis said. ``Now I know I can
get big league hitters out. When I was sent down I didn't handle
myself very well. Hopefully I won't have that cloud hanging over
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't as long as he continues to pitch like he did Saturday.
Schoeneweis primarily throws a hard sinker and relies on getting
hitters to hit ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   Gil had only one hit Saturday, but that hit was an
inside-the-park grand slam. It was a linedrive to center that
skipped past center fielder Juan Pierre and rolled to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Though his offense will definitely help his cause, winning a
spot as a utility player will be based on defense, and in
particular his ability to play shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me that's my easiest position,'' Gil said. ``I've played
there all my life. I've learned to play second, third and the
outfield the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Benji, shortstop is his natural position, so he feels
comfortable there,'' Scioscia said.

   SATURDAY'S GAME: Starting pitcher Scott Schoeneweis gave up one
run and four hits in four innings, and infielder Benji Gil hit an
inside-the-park grand slam as the Angels improved to 5-4 in Cactus
League play with a 7-3 win over the Rockies.

   VOTES CAST IN ARIZONA; CAUCUSES HELD IN MICHIGAN, MINNESOTA AND
NEVADA
</P>
<P>
   Computer glitches might have frustrated some Arizona voters in
Saturday's Democratic primary, but early numbers still indicated
that a record vote turnout was expected as the party completed the
first binding election for public office using the Internet.
Computers terminals and traditional paper ballots were offered at
most of the state's 124 polling sites Saturday. More than 35,000
people had already cast Internet votes when early computer voting
ended Friday. A total of 270 Democratic delegates were being
selected this weekend in voting, which include the Arizona primary
and party caucuses held in Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada. Results
for the caucuses weren't expected until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   GORE TO FOCUS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said Saturday that he would make
overhauling the campaign finance system a central theme of his
Democratic presidential bid. In an interview with The New York
Times on Saturday, Gore brushed aside questions about his conduct
in raising money, saying that he had learned from past mistakes and
therefore had become passionate about the issue. Gore made it clear
that he viewed his heightened zeal for campaign finance not only as
a draw for the independent voters who had flocked to Sen. John
McCain of Arizona but as an organizing principle for his campaign
against Gov. George W. Bush. He asserted that Bush's economic
proposals are unworkable because of his ties to special interests,
and ``fat cats'' who have financed his campaign, and expect a break
on their corporate taxes. Gore also repeatedly said that Bush lacks
the experience to run the country. ``You
</P>
<P>
   have to wonder, does George W. Bush have the experience to be
president?'' Gore asked as he flew to Minneapolis to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   GORE ELIMINATED BUSH'S LEAD, POLL SHOWS
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by surging support among moderates and independent
voters, Vice President Gore has eliminated Republican Gov. George
W. Bush's lead in the presidential race, a new Washington Post-ABC
News Poll released
</P>
<P>
   Saturday shows. The survey of 1,218 adults interviewed Thursday
through Saturday, found that Gore leads Bush by 48 percent to 45
percent among registered voters _ a statistical tie. The poll has a
3 percentage
</P>
<P>
   points margin of error. Six weeks ago, Bush held a double-digit
advantage over Gore, and in a Post-ABC News poll two weeks ago,
Bush still clung to a 6-point lead. In a hypothetical three-way
race, Gore and Bush are tied at 37 percent, with 23 percent for
John McCain who halted his campaign Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The statistical dead heat appeared duplicated in another poll,
released Saturday by Newsweek, which gave Bush a 47 percent to 44
percent edge over Gore. The poll, based on 803 voters surveyed
Thursday and Friday, had a 4-percentage-point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   GORE'S ELDEST DAUGHTER STUMPS FOR PAPA
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Vice President Al Gore's eldest daughter rolled
across western Tennessee on a bus tour Saturday to get out the vote
for her father three days before Tuesday's Southern primaries.
``He's a visionary, he's a principled fighter, and he's a policy
pioneer. If you need a fourth, hes a really great dad,'' Karenna
Gore Schiff said at a union hall. She ridiculed Republican critics,
who have called Gore the ``Ozone Man'' because of his views on
environmental protection and global warming. He talked about the
environment before it was a ``cool'' thing to do, said Schiff, 26,
a third-year law student who lives with her husband and 8-month-old
son in New York City. Tennessee along with Texas, Florida,
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma hold presidential primaries
Tuesday. Schiff stumped in western Tennessee in place of her
mother, Tipper Gore, who stayed home in Washington, D.C., to tend
to Schiff's younger brother who injured an ankle.
</P>
<P>
   NOWHERE TO PARTY
</P>
<P>
   The popular South by Southwest Music and Media Festival held in
Austin, Texas, in mid-March has forced Republican presidential
contender Gov. George W. Bush to scramble to find a place to
celebrate what is likely to be a smashing victory in Tuesdays
Southern primaries. The music festival, which attracts thousands of
people nationwide, already had reserved most of the city's large
centers and hotels. So Bush was forced to schedule his party for
the gymnasium of the Dell Jewish Community Center located in the
northern Austin suburbs. ``Downtown
</P>
<P>
   options were limited because of South by Southwest,'' said
campaign spokesman Scott McClellan. ``So we looked for a location
that could accommodate a large crowd, and lots of national media
including the satellite trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T WRITE OFF MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. John McCain says he's not ready to ride off into
the sunset just yet, and he won't give up fighting to preserve
Social Security and reform big money politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bitter. I'm not going to indulge in recriminations.
There's no point to it,'' McCain told The New York Times in an
interview published Saturday, two days after he bowed out of the
race, ceding the GOP presidential nomination to George W. Bush.
Still, McCain said he is hesitant to release his block of 247
Republican delegates to the Republican presidential nominating
convention until he can figure out how to push his proposals to
reform campaign financing and use budget surpluses to pay down the
national debt and boost Social Security centerpieces of his
suspended White House bid. ``The main idea is to go slow. There's a
long time until (the) November (general election),'' he said.

TRANSIT BID RIDES ON 62 VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY MARY JO PITZL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - In a city of 1.2 million, Tuesday's, March 14, Phoenix
transit tax comes down to a race for 62 votes.
</P>
<P>
   That's the size of the swing in the city's last transit
election, in 1997, when a proposed transit tax lost by 122 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Proposition 2000 are calling for more bus service
- more frequent buses, longer hours of operation and Sunday service
- and the introduction of electric light-rail commuter trains. They
are wooing voters with appeals to quality of life, projections of
traffic gridlock and a barrage of radio and TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure want to keep swing voters in their
camp, warning that more transit won't make a dent in congestion,
and with promises that there are cheaper ways to curb traffic.
</P>
<P>
   With 1997's debate over a transit tax still fresh for many
voters, the struggle is to capture those who didn't show up last
time to vote, or those who may be waffling.
</P>
<P>
   Both opponents and proponents predict Tuesday's vote will be
close, even if the campaigns being waged are lopsided.
</P>
<P>
   Transit 2000, which backs the tax, has $1.4 million, paid
consultants and the backing of the business establishment as well
as environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The De-Rail the Tax Committee has less than $10,000, street
signs and a scrappy band of volunteers. They also have the easier
sell: no tax.
</P>
<P>
   Transit proponents, despite their apparent muscle, must convince
voters that better transit is worth a 0.4 percent sales tax
increase, or 4 cents for every $10 purchase. The transit expansion
tax would raise the total sales tax in Phoenix to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix officials say they're back with a new proposal, just 30
months after a narrow defeat, because Phoenix's continued growth
will lead to increasingly dire traffic conditions unless commuters
are offered other ways of getting to work.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if voters approve local matching funds now, the federal
government is prepared to pay for at least half of the light-rail
system.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Skip Rimsza calls this a ``just-in-time election,''
suggesting that transit improvements made now may save the city
from gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza says this transit election could be another
transportation breakthrough; as pivotal as the successful 1985 vote
to fund Valley freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Fenger, chairwoman of De-Rail the Tax, calls Proposition
2000 a ``trolley folly'' because of its price. It would cost $1.2
billion to build, plus $454 million to operate. And Fenger predicts
the costs will rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have this white elephant, it needs a hell of a lot of
hay,'' she told a neighborhood group recently.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 2000 would expand Phoenix's bus system across the
city, resume Sunday service for the first time in six decades, and
add more express buses during rush hours.
</P>
<P>
   The bus fleet would grow 50 percent, with 210 new buses added
over 20 years. The cleaner-fuel buses would pile up 22 million
miles a year by 2020, a 140 percent increase over current levels.
Buses would run longer hours, more frequently, and on major streets
where there currently isn't service.
</P>
<P>
   Dial-a-Ride service for the disabled and elderly would double
within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Electric-rail service would come to town, with an initial
12-mile line running from near Chris-Town Mall, down Central
Avenue, and out to Tempe by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the plan are 500 bus pullouts on city streets, 100
miles of new bike lanes and left-turn arrows at every major
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   The transit tax is expected to raise $2.9 billion over 20 years.
Combined with existing local and state revenues, as well as
matching federal funds, the transit plan would cost $4.8 billion
over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The tax would end in 2020. Voter approval would be required to
authorize a renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Transit backers say Phoenix's rail lines would be the start of a
regional system, enabling other Valley cities to fund their own
links and eventually benefit commuters Valley-wide.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 2000 promises to build 24 miles of light rail by
2016. Only the first 17 miles have been defined; the remaining
miles would be picked later, transit planners say, when demand
became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, they envision 64 miles of rail if the system
expands. Those lines would generally follow freeway corridors, with
a spur running on South Central Avenue to Baseline Road. A segment
along Interstate 10, west of Interstate 17, would jog south near
27th Avenue and run past the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The transit debate kicked off with name-calling that got worse
as the campaign progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza and his supporters have belittled the opposition as
``naysayers.'' Last week, they passed out fliers calling the
De-Rail panel CAVE people: Citizens Against Virtually Everything.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents have fired back, calling Rimsza and his crew
``liars'' and labeling their transit plan a ``dirty proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, bus driver Mark Meyer said he's pursued his
drive to close the 122-vote gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to register 122 people to make up for what we lost by
last time,'' Meyer said. ``I got 350.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether those people will vote in a single-issue election
remains to be seen. &QL;

Reach the reporter at MaryJo.Pitzl(at)ArizonaRepublic.com or (602)
444-8963. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The campaign for the Phoenix transit tax has come down to an effort
to sway 62 votes as supporters and opponents argue over whether
more buses and the introduction of rail service will help move
people around town. &QL;

TIME FOR ARIZONA TO MAKE GROWTH PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY SHAUN MCKINNON  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - After gritting their teeth through crowded highways,
dirty air, long lines at the MVD - all the ills of an
ever-expanding population - Arizonans finally can cash in on
growth.
</P>
<P>
   All they have to do is be counted.
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour or less it will take most people to fill out the
2000 census questionnaire will help Arizona collect as much as $20
billion in federal aid over the next decade, win the state probably
two new seats in Congress and provide information to plan future
roads, parks and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake, a lot of money and a lot of essential
city services our residents have come to depend on,'' said
Avondale's Debbie Kohn, one of the dozens of city employees around
the Valley assigned to the census.
</P>
<P>
   Missing just 2.4 percent of the population, the rate reported by
the Census Bureau for 1990, would cost Arizona as much as $200
million in direct federal aid over 10 years, according to a report
released Friday by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Local officials say the total could surpass $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans will receive their census forms by mail this
week. The average form asks six questions of each household member,
with two additional for the head of the household. A longer form,
sent to one in six homes, adds 47 more questions designed to elicit
details about income, energy use, transportation and, yes,
plumbing. &QL; 
FAMILY PORTRAIT &QL; 
The results will paint 21st-century America's first family
portrait. More important, they will determine how the federal
government spends more than $2 trillion from now to 2011, and they
will reshape lawmaking bodies from Congress down to the smallest
town councils.
</P>
<P>
   This high-stakes head count has galvanized cities, counties,
community organizations and special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa Association of Governments estimates that each
person generates at least $350 each year in state and federal
funding for various programs. Phoenix puts the number at a slightly
higher $415. Multiplied by the latest population estimates, that's
as much as $1.2 billion a year in Maricopa County and about $2
billion statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The money is spent on school lunch programs, employment
services, housing assistance, hospital services, programs for the
poor and elderly and more.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every Phoenix area city has created complete count
committees to find as many ways to persuade residents to complete
their forms and return them by April 1, Census Day. &QL; 
MULTIMEDIA CAMPAIGN &QL; 
 &QL; 
Phoenix has created a multimedia campaign and is saturating the
airwaves with public service announcements and in-studio
interviews, with special emphasis on Spanish-speaking radio
stations. Officials also have enlisted the aid of community-based
organizations, who benefit from the federal money and who are often
more trusted on a neighborhood level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those groups know when it comes to dollar allocation, a lot of
funding they receive is from grants,'' said Margie Emmerman, an
aide to Gov. Jane Hull and co-chairwoman of a Phoenix outreach
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The census is used to reapportion the 435 seats in the U.S.
House of Representatives and draw new district boundaries for the
90 seats in the state Legislature and most elected city and county
boards. Arizona's growth almost certainly will earn the state two
new seats in Washington, according to the Washington-based Election
Data Services.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble will come when it's time to redraw congressional
districts, which is why both major parties would like to increase
their influence in the state Legislature, the holders of the
reapportionment pen.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also will adjust the lines of their own districts,
another highly partisan process. Maricopa County is expected to
strengthen its position in the state House and Senate, but Mohave
and Yavapai counties have grown at faster rates and may be able to
wrest power from other parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   State and local agencies rely on census figures to plan schools,
roads, parks, utility lines and, most critically, fire and police
services. Businesses use the data to plot expansion and investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census becomes the base from which we do all our
forecasts,'' said Harry Wolfe, socioeconomic program manager for
the Maricopa Association of Governments. ``Clearly, if the base is
an underestimate, it can have a spiraling effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities and towns worry most about planning for public safety, a
costly chunk of the annual budget. An undercount could leave newer
neighborhoods less protected.
</P>
<P>
   This year as never before, minorities and special-interest
groups are looking for ways to take advantage of the census. Black,
Hispanic and Native American organizations are flooding their
communities with promotional materials, talking up not only the
money involved, but the potential to flex political muscle with
bigger numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were definitely undercounted last time,'' said Pete Garcia,
president of Chicanos Por La Causa, a statewide Hispanic advocacy
group. ``We are working hard this time to allay people's fears of
being counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicanos Por La Causa has joined with the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund to educate Latinos about the census.
</P>
<P>
   Several lesbian and gay groups are trying to further push the
census envelope by encouraging gay couples to check the ``unmarried
partner'' box when asked to describe their relationship. Though the
information would be unofficial, the groups hope to use it just as
others do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not counted, we lose out on federal funding for
research, funding for community services and passage and
implementation of laws that benefit our community,'' said Paula
Ettelbrick, family policy director for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force. &QL; 
THE COMMON ENEMY
</P>
<P>
   Lurking behind the campaigns is a common enemy: the undercount.
The U.S. Census Bureau acknowledged missing more than 4 million
people in 1990, 1.6 percent of the population. Some non-government
census experts say the numbers are higher.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the undercount was 2.4 percent; a lower 1.8 percent
in Maricopa County, a considerably higher 10 percent in Apache
County. Minorities fared the worst: The census missed more than
32,000 Hispanic Arizonans, 4.5 percent of the total, and 22,000
Native Americans, or nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the uncounted Native Americans were under age 18,
which alarms family groups who fear children on Indian reservations
will be shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau concedes Native Americans mistrust the federal
government. To try to allay fears, the agency will not mail census
questionnaires to most reservation homes, but will instead deliver
them in person.
</P>
<P>
   Fear and mistrust also undermines the count among
Spanish-speaking immigrants, legal and otherwise. In that
community, the federal government often means only one thing: La
Migra, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, we know we are speaking sometimes to an
undocumented population,'' Emmerman said. ``We have to make sure
the message is for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Arizona has one of the nation's fastest-growing Hispanic
populations, an undercount of even 3 or 4 percent could create
funding shortfalls that multiply as each year progresses.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they narrow the message, officials say the core idea
is the same for everyone:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one time when every person should be counted,
regardless of residency or documentation status,'' Emmerman said.
``For now, they shift from `citizen' or `resident' to just
`person.' '' &QL;

(602) 444-7116. &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's time for all the talk about how we've grown to end and the
counting to begin. With the receipt of census forms this week,
Arizonans will participate in a process that will earn the state
billions of dollars in federal money, two more seats in Congress
and official bragging rights as the 20th largest state in the
union. &QL;

PAST IS ALIVE FOREVER ON A BIT OF TAPE

 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - Ten years ago today, I did a terrible thing. I secretly
recorded a telephone con versation with my parents.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know. I can hear my mother now. ``Eddie, really?''
</P>
<P>
   It began innocently enough. I'd been doing an interview with a
man who supported a baseball program for kids by selling con
cessions at spring training games. When the interview ended, I
forgot to turn off the tape machine.
</P>
<P>
   The next call I made was to my parents in Pittsburgh. It was
their 46th wedding anniversary and my father's 69th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual about the call is that it's been frozen
in time, like a piece of wedding cake. I spoke with my parents
often. Even special occasions were filled with small talk, though
it doesn't seem so small these days.
</P>
<P>
   As always, my mother an swered the telephone, and we talked for
a few minutes before my dad got on the other line. He'd say hello,
then listen while the two of us talked.
</P>
<P>
   They were having a quiet day, my mother said. They'd been to
church and then went out for lunch. Now, she was cooking spaghetti
and had some clothes in the washer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, I'm cooking and doing laundry on my anniver sary,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly what anyone who knew her would have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The previous day, they'd taken one of my aunts to a new shopping
mall across the state line in Ohio. They wandered around for 4{
hours, my mother said.
</P>
<P>
   By now, I had realized the tape machine was still record ing. I
could have reached down and switched it off. I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   My mother told me one of my cousins had a friend in Phoenix who
mailed one of my ``write-ups'' back to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her which one,'' my mother said, ``and she told me, `I
don't know which one, but it was good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I made a wisecrack about calling the fire department to douse
all the candles on my dad's cake. He said this birth day didn't
bother him much but the next one would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you hit 70 you go downhill,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   I could have turned the tape off any time. The button was right
there in front of me.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I let the machine re cord them telling me about a
grandson's upcoming confirma tion; about how excited they were to
have my family visit them the following summer; about how some of
my cousins had visited my father while he worked at the St. Titus
Church weekly fish-fry.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, I listened to the tape for the first time since re
cording it. It was a week or so after my father's funeral, a year
or so after my mother's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   I'd kept the tape in a desk drawer through all the anniver
saries and birthdays in be tween, not noticing how my parents'
laughter gradually lost its fullness, or how conversa tions about
the neighbor's dog or my brother's family or the miniature Easter
baskets my dad made for my daughter's grade school class slowly
turned into talk of test results and medications and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, I stopped getting Pittsburgh Stee ler
critiques and gnocchi reci pes and even weather reports.
</P>
<P>
   So, today, on what would have been my parents' 56th wedding
anniversary and my father's 79th birthday, I'll do a terrible thing
_ again. I'll eavesdrop on a conversation I should not have
recorded in the first place. Something I never told my par ents
about. And never erased. And never will.
</P>
<P>
   I know.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear my mother now.

KINGS CAN BE TOUGH ON LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Only one Western Conference team has a winning
regular-season record against the Lakers over the last two seasons.
It's not the Spurs, the Jazz or the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   It's the pesky, freewheeling Sacramento Kings, who roll into
town today and perhaps have a better chance than anyone of stopping
the Lakers' 17-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have beaten the Lakers in three of the last four
meetings a feat no other Western foe can claim.
</P>
<P>
   For added intrigue, these teams are currently matched up for a
first-round playoff series, and play one another three times in the
next four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more of a mindfulness when we're playing against this
team ... because you know that you might face them in the
playoffs,'' said Kobe Bryant. ``You kind of have to try to get a
grasp of what they like to do, what kind of rhythm they play with,
just in case you do play them in the playoffs, you'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams have met just once this season, a 103-91 Kings victory
at Sacramento in December that ended the Lakers' seven-game winning
streak. But that was Bryant's first game in the starting lineup
after returning from a broken hand, and the Lakers have come a long
way since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that game's kind of like eons ago,'' he said, ``because
we were such a different team. We were just getting started with
(coach Phil Jackson's) system, with the players, everybody kind of
finding their own little niche. So the team that they're going to
face (today) is going to be very different from the team that they
faced.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings present unique challenges that have given the
Lakers fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play at a different pace than everybody else that we've
played so far. They just run the ball down your throat,'' Bryant
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said it's a benefit that the Lakers will see the Kings
three times between now and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that presents the type of challenges that (are
tough),'' he said. ``An outside-shooting center (Vlade Divac), a
screen-roll game, small guards (Jason Williams, Darrick Martin)
that can break your defense down, 3-point shooters ... I think that
(Chris) Webber creates a problem, is a matchup problem for us,
outside-inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive: The Lakers are holding opponents to a league-best
.410 field-goal percentage and threatening to break the franchise
record of .432 - set by the 1971-72 team that won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson noted the Lakers force teams to take low-percentage
shots, but he also credited their cavernous new home, the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's an easy place to shoot,'' he said. ``I
think if you took our home (statistics) versus our road, we
probably have a lower percentage at home than we do on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Laker opponents are shooting .397 at Staples, .427
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>

TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net; KLAC-AM (570) Lakers (51-11) update: They

UCLA BUILDS MOMENTUM WITH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last time this happened, Ed O'Bannon kissed
the court. The last time the UCLA Bruins finished their season in
such impressive fashion, they were ranked No.1 and steaming towards
the NCAA title.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say these Bruins will duplicate the 1995
tournament charge. (They weren't guaranteed a bid until this week,
after all.) But Saturday's performance surely did more for
confidence and momentum than the four previous season finales - two
narrow victories over Washington State and two losses to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ending like this definitely gives us momentum for the
tournament,'' guard Earl Watson said after UCLA's 90-64 victory
over Washington in front of 10,305 at Pauley Pavilion. ``But we
can't use that momentum as arrogance, or we'll get beat in the
first round. We still have a lot to prove. We don't want to lose in
the first round and have people say we shouldn't have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' case for a tournament berth is now airtight. They've
won six consecutive games. They've beaten a tournament-bound team
at home (Oregon). They've beaten the No.1 team on the road
(Stanford). All their weapons are healthy and eligible, and their
closing argument Saturday was devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what you always talk about - they played their way
in,'' Washington coach Bob Bender said. ``They're a tournament
team, and I wouldn't want to play them coming in on a roll like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the Bruins haven't established is consistency.
They were brilliant at Stanford, then sluggish and sloppy in a
close call Thursday against last-place Washington State. But they
didn't practice Friday, and by tipoff their legs had returned.
Everything looked easy. Everyone looked fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Watson had six assists against three turnovers. Senior Sean
Farnham got a basket in his home finale. Dan Gadzuric and Jerome
Moiso dominated despite limited minutes. Reserve forward Matt
Barnes played well for the third consecutive game. And freshman
forward Jason Kapono, who doesn't usually have much spring,
elevated for his first dunk of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our legs back under us,'' said forward JaRon Rush,
who scored 15 points in 15 minutes. ``Thank God we had a day off.
It showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush typified UCLA's inconsistent weekend. He made 2 of 5 shots
Thursday night and was too tired to dunk. Saturday, he
singlehandedly changed the game with 11 points in four minutes
midway through the first half. His final basket, a 3-pointer from
the left wing, gave the Bruins a 27-20 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Moiso and Kapono combined for 11 consecutive
points as the advantage expanded to 39-20.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop: Selection Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to try to win five of six games (to get in the
tournament),'' Lavin said. ``It's nice to win six of six, and seven
of 10. If you eliminate the blitzkriegs in the desert (losses to
the Arizona schools), it's been eight solid games.''

DE LA HOYA-MOSLEY FIGHT APPEARS CERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oscar De La Hoya will fight Shane Mosley at
Staples Center on June 17 barring any unexpected glitches, promoter
Bob Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters have yet to formally agree to the welterweight bout
but are expected to come to terms, possibly as soon as early next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of going over the contracts and making sure
everything is all right. If they are, my feeling is the fight will
take place at the Staples Center,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes were the biggest obstacle to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Arum and Staples officials have asked government officials
whether it's possible to cap the state's share of the live gate at
$50,000 - as opposed to 5 percent - but were given no promises.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing changes, Staples apparently will pay a tax bill that
could beas high as $400,000, assuming an $8 million gate. That
doesn't include a city tax of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The arena already is paying $5 million-$6 million for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, the former welterweight champion from East L.A.,
reportedly will earn $7 million, Mosley, the former lightweight
champ from Pomona, $3 million, although Arum said those figures are
too high.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley has a viable option should he decide not to fight De La
Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF's No. 2-ranked contender has been asked to face No. 3
Vernon Forrest in an elimination bout for Felix Trinidad's vacated
title. The winner would then fight No. 1 Raul Frank for the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   However, it would be difficult for Mosley to pass up the big
payday against De La Hoya.

TEMPLE BUILDS CASE FOR A NO. 1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ During the first half of the championship game of
the Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament Saturday night, Temple,
which had not won the title since 1990, left little doubt as to
whether its drought would last another year.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first half was drawing to a close, about the
only thing in doubt was whether St. Bonaventure would manage double
figures before halftime. St. Bonaventure guards David
Messiah-Capers and Tim Winn answered that question when they hit
back-to-back 3-pointers to make the score 34-12 with 3 minutes 33
seconds remaining. Temple then took a 37-12 lead into the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some sloppy play in the second half, Temple (26-5)
rolled to a 65-44 victory over St. Bonaventure (21-9) to win the
conference tournament at the First Union Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't talk to them much like I really do and make them
nervous,'' Temple Coach John Chaney said. ``I let them stay out
there for 30 minutes and warm up and I didn't talk to them that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Chaney is onto something heading into the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament next week.
</P>
<P>
   Temple, ranked No. 6 in the nation, could be a No. 1-seeded team
in the national tournament, but Chaney said he was not worried
about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we've earned one of 64,'' he said. ``I would much
rather play a top team and lose and come back home. I'm not
interested in playing a lowly team. I'm not concerned about seeds.
I'm not even sure how it works. Maybe being in a region where you
don't run into Duke is where you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Temple came out in the first half Saturday, it appears
the Owls are ready for almost anything. Entering this game, St.
Bonaventure had won seven of its last eight games. It held Dayton
to 36 percent shooting from the field in the semifinal game here
Friday night. Saturday night it was a different story. The Bonnies
were completely steamrolled by Temple. Temple's defense held St.
Bonaventure to just 17.9 percent shooting from the field in the
first half. The 12-point total was a record low for an Atlantic 10
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Temple was outstanding tonight,'' St. Bonaventure
Coach Jim Baron said. ``They played like a Final Four team. They're
terrific. They have so many guys who can step up, particularly on
the perimeter, and they're tough inside. It seems like they've been
waiting for this one for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Owls jumped out to a 23-2 lead before St. Bonaventure could
break a sweat. Quincy Wadley, who was the tournament's most
valuable player, had 11 points at the midway point of the first
half. He finished the game with 16 points and was 4 of 5 from
3-point range.

   ``It's a good feeling as a shooter knowing I have teammates
around me who will get me the ball when I'm shooting like that,''
Wadley said. ``I know any time I find a crack and get open that
Pepe will get me the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepe Sanchez is Temple's point guard. He had six assists and did
a good job of breaking down St. Bonaventure's press when the
Bonnies tried to slow down Temple's offense. It didn't help. The
Owls shot 50 percent from the field in the first half (46.9 percent
for the game) and pulled down 31 defensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure center Caswell Cyrus, who averages 12.5 points
and 6.3 rebounds a game, was limited because of a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could barely walk this morning,'' Winn said. ``I didn't
even think he could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus played 30 minutes, but he was not a force inside. He was 1
of 6 from the field and had just three rebounds. Maybe if Cyrus had
been healthy, things would have been different in the one-sided
first half.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure managed to climb back into the game in the
second half, pulling to within 50-36 on a 3-point basket by J.R.
Bremer with 6:08 to play. But that was as close as the Bonnies got.
</P>
<P>
   The game that Temple played against St. Bonaventure will give
some teams in the NCAA tournament something to think about wherever
the Owls are seeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we played to the best of our ability,'' Wadley said.
``If we're granted the No. 1 seed, so be it. Our objective is to
put ourselves in the best position, and that would be the No. 1
seed.''

HILLARY CLINTON ASSAILS NEW YORK MAYOR ON SCHOOLS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seizing on what she said was the prime issue in the
race for U.S. Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton assailed Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's stewardship of public education in New York Saturday,
asserting that he had resorted to ``gimmicks'' to rescue a school
system that she portrayed as on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In her sharpest attack yet on what Clinton's aides believe is
one of the mayor's biggest political liabilities, Clinton mocked
Giuliani's education initiatives, including a proposal to give
parents vouchers to pay private-school tuition and a plan to sell
the Board of Education's headquarters in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second day in a row, Clinton linked Giuliani to
George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee for president,
as she asserted that Republican policies would harm the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to education, we do have real problems that
demand action, not political posturing,'' the first lady said in a
speech to teachers' union members at the New York Hilton in Midtown
Manhattan. ``We must ask our leaders what kind of solutions do they
offer? Will you spend more time firing people or fixing our
schools? Will you sell off the school board building, or invest in
our children's education? Will you resort to teacher bashing, or
engage in problem solving? Because real leadership means rolling up
your sleeves and getting to work _ not pointing your fingers or
clenching your fists.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's choice of where to speak _ a United Federation of
Teachers convention for teachers' aides _ underscored her
increasingly deep ties to the powerful union, which has regularly
battled with Giuliani and has emerged as one of her most prominent
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, through a spokeswoman, would not comment on either
Clinton's education proposals or the criticism of his education
record. Instead, the spokeswoman, Kim Serafin, sought to turn the
discussion to an unreleased report on the fund-raising practices of
the Clinton White House. She called on the Clinton administration
to release the report, by a former Justice Department official,
which is critical of President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lunchtime arrival at the ballroom at the Hilton set
off a flurry of excitement, as audience members leapt from their
chairs and scurried to the front of the room, lining up for a
photograph of Clinton, who seemed a little startled.
</P>
<P>
   To this friendly luncheon audience _ representative of
supporters whose enthusiasm is central to Clinton's political hopes
_ the first lady offered an appealing menu of proposals. She
called, for example, for higher salaries for teachers, and signing
bonuses for new teachers. She restated her support for the
centerpiece proposal of Sen. Charles Schumer's campaign two years
ago, to provide four-year college scholarships to teachers who
promise to work in inner-city schools. She called for more federal
spending to hire teachers and to repair run-down schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave no hint of how much she thought all this would
cost, or how it might be financed.
</P>
<P>
   She also assailed vouchers, which Giuliani has presented as a
tool to help parents in New York City assure a good education for
their children, but which Clinton and the teachers' union say would
lead to a flow of money and students out of the public school
system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted her advocacy of higher standards, in the form of
testing, for teachers and students in Arkansas in the 1980s, when
she led a panel on education set up by Bill Clinton, who was then
governor. But she linked those standards to increased spending on
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot raise standards without increasing the resources
needed to meet those standards,'' Clinton said. ``Yes, we need to
end social promotion. But what good does it do to raise the bar if
we don't lift up our young people to be able to vault across it?''
</P>
<P>
   Social promotion is a policy under which students are graduated
with their peers to the next grade, even if they have failed
academically.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech wove together a number of different threads of
her campaign. It allowed her to criticize Giuliani's record on
education (polls show education is one of the top two concerns of
New Yorkers). It also allowed her to reprise an older campaign
theme by raising questions about Giuliani's temperament, while
returning to a new line of attack, attaching Giuliani to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton firmly latched her own fortunes to
those of the presumptive Democratic nominee, Gore. ``I will be by
his side as we fix our crumbling schools, as we put more teachers
in our classroom to lower class size, as we improve the quality of
education,'' she said. ``And I think we know that that is not the
priority of the Bush-Giuliani team. That other team, they want to
talk about gimmicks like vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, once again, as she discussed the state of schools in New
York City, the first lady sounded as if she had set her sights on
City Hall, rather than the United States Capitol; indeed, some of
her remarks were evocative of the attacks Ruth Messinger, the
Democratic candidate for mayor, made against Giuliani when she
challenged him in 1997. Clinton lamented the physical condition of
New York City classrooms she had viewed, worried about an impending
teacher shortage, and warned of overcrowding in public schools with
the start of the next school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been to schools where the ceiling plaster's falling
down, where corridors are barred off, where the windows are broken,
where children are going to class in hallways and closets,'' she
said. ``I know that in many of our schools in this city, the
overcrowding has gotten to such an extent that we don't know where
we're going to put the children next September.''

BRUINS' FIRST-ROUND POSSIBILITIES ARE INTRIGUING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's arduous regular season has created some
delectable possibilities for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Bruins probably will be seeded lower than usual when
the NCAA Tournament pairings are announced today, the pool of
potential first-round opponents is more talented - and more
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Where intrigue lurks, forward JaRon Rush cannot be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   As a No. 7 or 8 seed, the Bruins might draw Missouri, a likely
No.9 or 10 seed whose starting guard is Rush's brother, Kareem.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Bruins could draw Kansas, whose coach, Roy Williams,
reportedly stopped recruiting Rush after his infamous ``Roy subs
too much for me'' comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing Missouri would be nice, very nice,'' said Rush, a
Kansas City native. ``I'd love to play against my brother. But
Kansas would be even better, because of the thing with me and coach
Williams. I'd love to play against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The connections don't end with Rush. The Bruins could draw
Fresno State, whose coach, Jerry Tarkanian, has despised UCLA since
his days at Long Beach State in the early '70s. Tark believes
former UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan informed the NCAA about
rules violations at Long Beach, thus beginning the organization's
two-decade pursuit of Tarkanian.
</P>
<P>
   A first-round matchup would be his first shot at the Bruins
since 1972, when UCLA beat Long Beach State in the tournament. The
teams never played during Tark's tenure at Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's been thinking about (playing UCLA) for almost 30
years,'' a school official said.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Bruins could draw St. Louis, the surprising Conference
USA champion whose coach, Lorenzo Romar, is a former UCLA assistant
and longtime friend of Steve Lavin's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be exciting,'' Lavin said. ``Ro has always been a
positive mold for me, and he's been a good friend through the highs
and lows. He's been so consistent with his voice mails and
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the Bruins could face Utah, whose coach, Rick Majerus, has
long been the favorite of disgruntled UCLA fans. Or they could draw
Wisconsin, whose football team beat UCLA in two Rose Bowls in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Bruins could face a team with no connections and
no intrigue, no big-name coaches and no marquee players. They could
be a No. 6 seed or a No. 9. They could be in Buffalo or Birmingham,
Nashville or Minneapolis. Betting on the selection committee is
usually futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to even begin to try to figure it out,'' Lavin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one certainty: The Bruins will not face former
coach Jim Harrick, whose Georgia Bulldogs did not qualify for the
tournament.

THE CAPITALS TAKE THE DEVILS RIGHT BACK DOWN TO EARTH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Minutes after their nine goals in Atlanta on Friday
night, the Devils were talking about what a severe test awaited
them Saturday night against the Capitals. The Devils were eager to
see how they measured up against a good team after an outing that
looked more like a scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was rather discouraging for the Devils, who suffered
a 4-2 loss to the Capitals. The defeat for the Devils means that
they have just that one victory _ that ludicrous game against
expansion Atlanta _ in their last five games during their longest
trip of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur allowed two quick goals to Chris Simon and Joe
Murphy in the early stages. The Devils tied it on two quick goals
of their own, by Deron Quint and Scott Gomez, before Ulf Dahlen
scored the winner for the Capitals early in the third period and
Steve Konowalchuk secured the victory with an empty-net goal.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who had such an easy night at the office 24 hours
earlier in Atlanta, found himself on his heels in the early stages
as the Capitals came out with enthusiasm and scored twice before
the game was 4 minutes 31 seconds old.
</P>
<P>
   Simon opened the scoring with his 24th of the season, 3:26 after
the opening face-off, when he beat Brodeur from the bottom of the
left circle after a pass by Adam Oates from behind the goal to the
right of Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals doubled their lead 65 seconds later. Murphy beat
Brodeur over the left skate on a slap shot from the bottom of the
right circle after a pass by Peter Bondra. Brodeur's left leg got a
piece of the puck, but not enough to stop it from trickling across
the line.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils did not get discouraged by Washington's early
lead and tied the score about three and a half minutes later on
goals by Quint and Gomez to quiet the sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Quint scored just 38 seconds after Bondra. Paired on defense
with Vladimir Malakhov, Quint was making his Devils debut after his
acquisition from Phoenix this week in a trade for defenseman Lyde
Odelein. The goal was his fourth of the season and it came when he
rushed the net on the left side and converted Malkahov's diagonal
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez tied the score with his 18th of the season at 8:02 when he
beat Olaf Kolzig over the glove from the right side after a pass by
Sergei Nemchinov, who made two good plays to keep the puck in
Washington's zone.
</P>
<P>
   Nemchinov was in the middle of the most exciting play in the
scoreless second period. With 8:20 left in the period, Nemchinov
was awarded a penalty shot after he was pulled down on a breakaway.
But Kolzig denied Nemchinov's move from right to left by stretching
out his right leg.

DEPLETED PENGUINS PULL AHEAD OF RANGERS IN RACE FOR PLAYOFFS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The Pittsburgh Penguins had won once in their
previous nine games. They had not scored in more than seven periods
and Saturday night were playing without their top two scorers,
Jaromir Jagr and Robert Lang.
</P>
<P>
   The Jagr-less Penguins were easy pickings, right? Wrong. And the
Rangers are in danger of missing the playoffs for the third
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   Behind goals from German Titov, Rob Brown and Robert Dome, the
Penguins embarrassed the Rangers, 3-1. Dome's redirection of a Pat
Falloon pass from just off the crease at 9 minutes 53 seconds of
the third period was just Dome's second goal of the season, but it
sealed the Rangers' fate.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Penguins (70 points) leap-frogged the
Rangers into the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference. With 12 games remaining in their regular season, the
Rangers (69 points) are on the outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa General Manager Marshall Johnston was at the game
Saturday night. The National Hockey League trading deadline is
Tuesday at 3 p.m., and Johnston said the Senators are looking for a
forward. Johnston could also be looking for a potential off-season
trade involving Ottawa's holdout center, Aleksei Yashin.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are more concerned about this season, however. They
acquired the 32-year-old right wing Rob Dimaio on Friday from
Boston for right wing Mike Knuble, and their newest player arrived
in time for Saturday's morning skate.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the Rangers faced a depleted Pittsburgh team that
had not scored in a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins were able to end that streak just 5:36 into the
contest, on a German Titov goal. The score was set up by Aleksei
Kovalev. Thus, after going 151:42 without a goal, the Penguins had
the first goal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers Coach John Muckler had planned to have Tim Taylor's line
shadow Straka's every chance he could. But the Rangers could not
get the Taylor line out quick enough on the goal. And Taylor's
reunion with Dimaio proved to be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:04 remaining in the first period, Taylor was tossed from
the game for spearing Darius Kasparaitis in the midsection with the
blade of his stick. Taylor was assessed a game-misconduct penalty,
and the Rangers played the rest of the game one man down.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins managed just two shots on goal during the
five-minute major to Taylor. But 22 seconds after it ended, at
17:42 of the second, Rob Brown swept a backhand shot of a Tyler
Wright rebound behind Mike Richter to give the Penguins a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Rangers nearly eight and a half minutes to register
their first shot on goal in the second period. And after they
slumbered through the first three and a half minutes of a double
minor, Pat Falloon was assessed for high sticking Mike York and it
looked as if the Rangers had packed it in for the night.
</P>
<P>
   But Muckler sent out a new line of Alexandre Daigle centering
Valery Kamensky and Dimaio for the rest of the power play. Kamensky
hammered home the rebound of a Dimaio shot from the slot from off
the left post for his first goal in 14 games, and the Rangers
headed into the second intermission trailing by just 2-1.

OUTRAGED BY EXHIBIT, A WHITNEY CUTS OFF SUPPORT FOR A MUSEUM  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Angry over a planned exhibit at the Whitney Museum
linking Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other political figures to the
Nazis, Marylou Whitney, the widow of Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney,
said Saturday that she had withdrawn her financial support of the
museum and quit its national fund-raising council.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney said that a work by Hans Haacke, a German-born New York
artist, planned for the Whitney's 2000 Biennial opening on March
23, would serve to belittle the Holocaust, politicize art and
violate the principles on which the Whitney was founded by her late
mother-in-law, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, to showcase American
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gertrude would roll over in her grave,'' she said of the
Haacke work _ a wall of garbage cans with speakers blaring the
sound of marching jackboots, a reproduction of the First Amendment,
and quotations from Giuliani and others, including Sen. Jesse
Helms, Pat Buchanan, and the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Recent news of the forthcoming exhibit and the inclusion of the
Haacke work, called ``Sanitation,'' recalled the fury over the
First Amendment issues raised by the ``Sensation'' show at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art last fall, when the mayor attacked some of
the art as ``sick'' and tried to withhold city subsidies from the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney, which receives most of its $20 million budget from
its own earnings and from private and corporate sources, was
confronted with harsh criticism from the Anti-Defamation League and
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, whose feelings were reported Saturday by The New York
Post, said in a telephone interview from her home in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., that she had informed Maxwell L. Anderson, director
of the Whitney, on Friday of her decision.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had told him she was perturbed with the Haacke
work, but was even more upset with the museum for what she said was
a violation of the trust Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney had placed in
the institution she had founded 70 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gertrude wanted to help American artists,'' Mrs. Whitney, 73,
said. ``That's why she called it the Whitney Museum of American
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that Whitney's withdrawal was regrettable, but he
disputed her contention that the museum's mission was to showcase
only the work of American artists. He said it had been the
Whitney's policy for years to show art produced in America by
artists of any nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's granddaughter,
Flora Miller Biddle, an honorary trustee, and great-granddaughter,
Fiona Donovan, a trustee, both supported the inclusion of the
Haacke work in the museum's exhibit, and defended the artist as ``a
voice of social conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Haacke, who is 62 and lives in Manhattan, said it was unfair to
criticize a work of art that has not even been unveiled.

PUMPED SOONERS DUMP TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Perhaps it was a Freudian slip.
</P>
<P>
   After discussing his team's loss to Iowa State in Saturday's
first Big 12 men's basketball semifinal game, Oklahoma State coach
Eddie Sutton predicted a spirited championship matchup between the
Cyclones and Oklahoma _ 15 minutes before Texas would take the
floor against the Sooners in the second semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Sooners came back from Friday's late, late show
victory over Missouri to outhustle and embarrass a rested Texas
team that showed all the emotion of a PBS landscape-painting show
in losing to OU, 81-65.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's inadvertent slip illustrates the kind of respect the
Longhorns don't get in these parts after bowing out of the
proceedings for the second consecutive year in the tournament
semifinals, playing from the No. 1 seed last year and the No. 2
seeds Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question you have to give the credit
to Oklahoma,'' Texas coach Rick Barnes said. ``They played harder
and longer, and I am disappointed in our mental makeup _ the way we
handled the situation. We had guys who played outside their roles
and didn't have the kind of defensive effort we needed to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness we've got another game and another tournament
(the NCAA) to see what we're really made out of. But today, there
were not a lot of things to like about our basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which prides itself on defense, was clipped by the
Sooners. OU pounded in 48.2 percent of their shots and repeatedly
outhustled the Longhorns to loose balls and rebounds. UT's guards
also did not respond offensively, hitting 10 of 32 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns led after a less-than-intense first half, 32-30,
as center Chris Mihm scored 14 points. But after banking in a
jumper to open the second-half scoring, Mihm did not connect on
another field goal until a put-back with 1:09 to play and just
didn't get many touches. He finished with 20 and was unable to
explain the team's lack of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know (why),'' Mihm said. ``But that's exactly what the
game boiled down to. They came out intense and fired up and it
seemed like we were just playing to play. If things went well and
we won, we won. If they didn't, no big deal. We were lackadaisical
in the second half and you can't let your guard down against
Oklahoma. We were expecting good things in the second half, but
they jumped on us and we didn't respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Najera, who scored only 13 in OU's thrilling overtime
victory over Missouri on Friday night, buried Texas with 31. He
said he wasn't surprised that the Sooners' emotion outshone that of
the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not surprised at all,'' he said. ``That's the reason we beat
them in Norman pretty bad (83-59), because we played with a lot of
emotion. We knew if we did the same thing today, it would be the
same way. Once we got that lead (39-36 at 17:02 of the second half)
and played with enthusiasm, we knew they would give up on us.
That's what happened today.'' nn

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN FALL SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. - They had been here before, in a hostile
environment against a heavy favorite in a high-pressure situation.
</P>
<P>
   This was Colorado State all over again for the Cal State
Northridge women's basketball team. And in the end, the feeling was
the same, too.
</P>
<P>
   The underdog Matadors battled top-seeded Montana for two-thirds
of the Big Sky Conference women's tournament final, but the
Grizzlies used a late run to win the title 66-53 Saturday afternoon
and advance to the NCAA Tournament in front of 3,890 at Dahlberg
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded CSUN (18-10) has little hope of a postseason bid.
Its role was reversed last year; Northridge won the tournament
title and went to Fort Collins, Colo., to play the fifth-ranked
Rams in front of a packed arena of rabid fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors made a game of that one, too, before wilting late.
</P>
<P>
   ``(We) battled hard,'' CSUN coach Frozena Jerro said. ``This is
a tough place to come and play. We almost got out of here with one,
we just didn't have enough to sneak through.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN shot out of halftime with fresh legs and more passion than
Montana (22-8) and went on a 10-0 run to lead 31-23. Spurred on by
the crowd, the Grizzlies came back with an 8-0 run to tie it 31-31
with 14 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The lead changed five times in the next nine minutes. Montana
took the lead for good at 48-47 after a jumper by tournament MVP
Linda Weyler with 5:34 left, and the Grizzlies outscored the
Matadors 11-3 in the next four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made an awesome run toward the end,'' Jerro said. ``We
didn't have enough to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue might have set in at that point. The Matadors entered
the tournament with nine available players, and backup forward
Myesha Saleem went out in the first half with a mild concussion.
Two starters - forward Lynda Amari and center Keisha Harris - were
in foul trouble in the last 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN also shot poorly - 34 percent. Senior forward Neda Milic,
an all-tournament selection, had 12 points, but she only made 4 of
10 shots. No other players scored in double-figures for Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Weyler had 21 points and 12 rebounds. Lauren Cooper, an
all-tournament pick, had seven points and a game-high 15 rebounds
for Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge, which held Montana to 33 percent shooting from the
floor, had a three-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we overcame a lot,'' said senior guard Jamilah
Jones, who briefly quit the team in late January. ``A lot of us, we
didn't think we'd make it this far. Coming this far was a good
thing for us.''

A WISH FOR A SENATE RIVAL: BREAK A LEG  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After more than a year of shunning each other,
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani shook hands
before sitting down to the annual Inner Circle dinner show Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in the ballroom of the New York Hilton about
8:20 p.m., stopped briefly at Giuliani's table, shook his hand, and
told him she was looking forward to seeing him perform in the
evening's program, which parodied politicians and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The two had not been in the same room since beginning their
campaigns for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   They were the star attractions at the annual show of the Inner
Circle, an organization of present and former City Hall reporters.
This year's event _ a musical called ``Livin' La Rudy Loca''
performed by reporters lampooning the mayor, followed by Giuliani's
rebuttal with the cast of the Broadway show ``Saturday Night
Fever'' _ was attended by more than 1,000 guests. (Organizers said
sales of the $400 tickets for the black-tie charity event were
about 10 percent higher than usual.) Guests have typically
complained about the length of the not-always-fabulous shows. Often
the evening has stretched past 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Senate race and Clinton's appearance added a welcome
frisson of excitement, even though Clinton did not appear on stage.
By Inner Circle tradition, only the mayor is allowed a rebuttal to
the lampooning.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's entry into New York politics did give reporters
plenty of material for skits that could not have been easy viewing
for the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene of ``Livin' La Rudy Loca,'' according to the
script, a reporter playing Clinton was to find herself in jail with
reporters playing Sean Combs and Jennifer Lopez. When a reporter
playing President Clinton arrived with a bag of money, he was to
bail out Lopez but not his wife. ``I think Jennifer Lopez has
suffered enough,'' the script had the president saying, as he
walked off the stage arm-in-arm with Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Another act was to include Gabe Pressman, a political reporter
for WNBC-TV, singing a song called ``Mild Thing'' about Gov. George
Pataki.

GERTRUDE LEGENDRE, 97, SOCIALITE, HUNTER, AND WAR CAPTIVE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ENID NEMY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gertrude Sanford Legendre, an unlikely debutante of
the 1920s who forsook society to become a big-game hunter and then
to work during World War II for the Office of Strategic Services,
predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency, died on Wednesday
at Medway, her historic 6,800-acre plantation near Charleston, S.C.
She was 97 and also had a home on Fishers Island, off Long Island's
northeastern end.
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Sanford was still in her teens when she took a hunting
trip to the Grand Tetons of Wyoming and shot her first elk. For
some years afterward, she pursued big game throughout Africa,
India, Iran and Indochina, and contributed rare specimens to
museums, including the American Museum of Natural History in New
York, the Peabody Museum at Harvard and the Smithsonian
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   In her later years, her love of hunting evolved into a love of
nature, and she took an active role in environmental issues. She
established the Medway Environmental Trust for educational purposes
and to make sure that Medway would forever be managed as a nature
preserve. In the last decade, she granted conservation easements on
her landmark house to the Historic Charleston Society and on most
of the property to the Wetlands America Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Legendre began her wartime career as a secretary with the OSS in
Washington. But within a year, in 1944, the agency transferred her
to Paris and gave her a WAC uniform and paperwork identifying her
as a second lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   She became the first American woman captured in France when, on
a visit to the front northeast of Paris with several military
friends, she found herself pinned down by German sniper fire and
was forced to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Held as a prisoner of war for six months, she then escaped and
made her way by train to Switzerland. The train stopped just short
of the border, and, as she made a frantic dash to the frontier, a
German guard ordered her to halt or be shot. She continued, though,
and reached the border.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Legendre helped a German prison guard who had
been kind to her emigrate to the United States. She also
established the Medway Plan, a relief organization, to provide
medical help and drugs to countries devastated by the war.
</P>
<P>
   Legendre was born in 1902 in Aiken, S.C., the youngest of three
children of John and Ethel Sanford. She, her brother, Stephen
Sanford, an internationally recognized polo player known as Laddie,
and her sister, Sara Jane Sanford, were said to have been the
inspiration for Philip Barry's 1929 play ``Holiday,'' made into a
classic movie starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. She wrote
two autobiographies, ``The Sands Ceased to Run'' (1947) and ``The
Time of My Life'' (1987).
</P>
<P>
   Legendre was reared in upstate Amsterdam, N.Y., where her father
managed the family carpet business and his horse-breeding farm, and
in a Manhattan town house on East 72nd Street now occupied by the
Lycee Francais. She was educated at the Foxcroft School in
Middleburg, Va., and made her debut after her graduation in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   She met her husband, Sidney J. Legendre, on one of her big-game
hunting trips to Africa. They married in 1929. He died in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Legendre is survived by two daughters, Bokara Legendre of
Manhattan and Mill Valley, Calif., and Landine Manigault of
Stonington, Conn.; four grandchildren, and three
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Known as one of the grand dames of Charleston, Legendre gave a
New Year's Eve costume party that was a tradition for half a
century. At one of the last of those parties, she offered a toast:
``I look ahead. I always have. I don't contemplate life, I live it.
And I'm having the time of my life.''

FRANK PAPE, 91, CELEBRATED CHICAGO DETECTIVE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Pape, a Chicago police detective who fought more than a
dozen gun battles and survived without a scratch while sending nine
suspects to their graves, died March 5 at his home in Park Ridge,
Ill. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   In his 39 years on the force, beginning in the era of fedoras,
tommy guns and gin mills, Pape won, indeed often seemed to strive
for, a reputation as the toughest cop in Chicago. He fruitlessly
staked out Baby Face Nelson as a new recruit, sent 300 men to
prison and 5 to the electric chair and bragged that he never used
his gun to fire warning shots, only to kill.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, Pape headed the department's robbery detail,
its elite unit. There were 49 articles about him in detective
magazines, and his stories provided grist for the 1950s television
series ``M Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never started a fight in my life, but I'm not going to take
any lip from a hoodlum,'' he told Coronet magazine in 1949. ``I
represent the city of Chicago and Chicago stopped taking orders
from gangsters a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he came to feel that the police were handcuffed by
judicial and political supervisors, Pape's own actions were partly
responsible for a famous judicial crackdown on freewheeling tactics
by police officers. In 1958, without an arrest or search warrant,
Pape entered the apartment of a suspect, prompting a legal case
that reached the Supreme Court and resulted in his paying an $8,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the case, Monroe vs. Pape, was to permit the
federal government to bring civil rights actions against police
officers in local cases. Charles Adamson, who wrote ``The Toughest
Cop in America,'' a biography of Pape to be published this summer
by Dilettante Press, likened the restraining effect on police to
the Miranda decision, which protects suspects by requiring that
officers warn them of their rights against self-incrimination when
they are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   When Time reported on that case, Pape filed a $350,000 libel
suit against the magazine. This case, too, went all the way to the
Supreme Court, which ruled against Pape. Time had based its article
on a previously published report by the United States Commission on
Civil Rights and did not make it clear that the report recounted
accusations of racism and abuse on Pape's part, rather than
established facts.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court eventually ruled that the misreading of an
ambiguous document did not amount to the ``actual malice''
necessary to prove libel of Pape, a public official. In legal
terms, when a public official is involved, actual malice involves
knowledge that the published information was false or in reckless
disregard of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Pape was born in the Bucktown section of Chicago in 1909. His
father died when he was a toddler, and he became the man of the
house early in life, taking care of his mother and sister. He
dropped out of high school after two years to become a sheet-metal
worker.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the police department in 1933, two years after Al
Capone had been sentenced to prison for tax evasion. He was so
slight that he stuffed himself with bananas and gallons of water to
make the force's 150-pound minimum weight.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago remained a place of larger-than-life cops and
robbers. Those were the days when policeman would set a trap for a
suspected police killer, cut him down in a hail of bullets and pose
for newspaper pictures afterward. Pape established an identity by
never carrying his gun in a holster: he kept it in his front pants
pocket, which his wife had strengthened by sewing in a canvas
lining.
</P>
<P>
   He relied on shrewd intuition. Adamson tells of the sunny Sunday
afternoon when Pape noticed a car approaching, with two men and a
woman inside. ``There's something dirty about that car,'' he said,
as he whipped his own car around to stop the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The three emerged blasting, but Pape and his partner won the gun
battle. It turned out that one of the men had killed a police
officer. On at least two other occasions, Pape used the same
maneuver, Adamson said.
</P>
<P>
   John Haberkorn, a retired police commander, insisted that Pape
chose his targets carefully. ``He never went after the good guys,''
Haberkorn said. ``He went after the bums and hoodlums.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 interview with The Chicago Tribune, Pape told of
spotting Jackie Cerrone, a top mobster, walking down Washington
Street in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had on a gray herringbone coat with a velvet collar and a
gray hat, very snappy,'' Pape said. ``He was walking toward me, and
he was with a guy who had stopped to look into a shop window. I
walked up to him and said to him, `As long as I'm commander of this
district, you're not welcome here. And take that bum with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ``bum'' was another mobster, Tony (Big Tuna) Accardo. ``They
both left like I told 'em to,'' Pape said.
</P>
<P>
   Plain fear was part of Pape's arsenal. In the same interview, he
remembered once getting a call saying two youth gangs were planning
a gang war. He visited both groups. ``I hear you're going to have a
gang war,'' he said. ``Fine. I'll be there with five of my guys
with baseball bats, and you all better bring a lot of cars, because
when we get done with you there won't be enough ambulances to take
you to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   When he heard that Cerrone was plotting to kill him when he got
out of prison for murder, Pape recalled, he visited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to stop you murderers,'' he said. ``What we should
do is take a shotgun and blow you guys' heads off and leave you on
your front lawns, ring the doorbell and let your families find you.
That'll stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pape had a softer side. ``The toughest guy in Chicago sings
tenor,'' said a 1949 article in Coronet magazine. ``He also dresses
like a college student and frets because his children read Dick
Tracy.''
</P>
<P>
   His son Jerry, who lives in Big Sky, Mont., said Pape found jobs
for unemployed neighbors and helped buy bicycles for their
children. He had a pilot's license and would take children for
airplane rides. He invited his men to big parties at his cottage in
Duck Lake, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Kitty, and
his daughter, Judy Clark, of Park Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Pape said his father had never fired a shot until one of
his partners died in his arms. He told of being a small boy and
having his father come home late at night and wake him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just killed a guy, and I want you to know one thing about
me,'' Pape told his son. ``Everybody I shot and killed deserved it.
I slept like a baby after every one.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE TIMES OF MY LIFE: And My Life With The Times &LR;  By Max
Frankel. Delta, $15.95. The former correspondent and later
executive editor of The New York Times looks back on over 40 years
at the paper, a remarkable career shaped by the Cold War and his
family's escape from Nazi Germany when he was a youth. ``It's a
smart, tough, scrupulous book,'' Ward Just wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999. ``Every reader will learn a very great
deal about how a newspaper works.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUTH OF THE BORDER, West of the Sun &LR;  By Haruki Murakami.
Vintage International, $12. This spare, erotically charged tale by
the author of ``The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle'' tracks the intertwined
lives of two Japanese lovers who connect briefly as 12-year-olds
before drifting apart in adolescence. When they meet again as
adults, they still have vivid memories of each other but their
worldly crassness prevents them from recapturing the lost
perfection of their youth. Murakami ``manages, in his sexual
explicitness, to make intimacy real _ appealing and unembarrassing,
innocent even,'' Mary Hawthorne said in The New York Times Book
Review last year. ``This wise and beautiful book is full of hidden
truths.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEAR GENIUS: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom &LR;  Collected and
edited by Leonard S. Marcus. HarperCollins, $16.95. The children's
book editor who nurtured writers like E.B. White and Maurice Sendak
reveals her wizardry in nearly 50 years' worth of correspondence,
collected by Leonard S. Marcus. Much of it was composed during her
long career as director of Harper &AMP; Row's Department of Books for
Boys and Girls. Her ``genius glows from these letters,'' Rebecca
Pepper Sinkler wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; MARGARET WISE BROWN: Awakened by the Moon &LR;  (Quill/Morrow,
$14), Marcus profiles one of the most famous authors cultivated by
Nordstrom, the prolific and eccentric creator of children's
classics like ``Goodnight Moon.'' In 1992 the reviewer Edith
Kunhardt Davis called this ``an absorbing biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEAVY WATER: And Other Stories &LR;  By Martin Amis. Vintage
International, $12. The author displays startling bravado and
cleverness as he imagines a world in which heterosexuals are
oppressed by the homosexual majority, poets bask in money and
celebrity and a Martian robot knows the fate of the world. ``Amis
applies his comic timing, his perfect pitch and his curatorial eye
to some of the burning issues of our time,'' A.O. Scott wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RIPLEY BOGLE &LR;  By Robert McLiam Wilson. Ballantine, $12.95.
Ripley Bogle is a downtrodden but acutely perceptive Belfast native
who wanders the streets of London recalling the hell of his
childhood and his descent into poverty. In 1998 the reviewer Liam
Callanan called this an uneven novel that details ``the painful
minutiae of homeless existence with aching accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAWSON'S WILL: The Greatest Polar Survival Story Ever Written &LR; 
By Lennard Bickel. Steerforth, $15. In 1912 an Antarctic expedition
led by the Australian geologist Douglas Mawson faced disaster when
one of its members disappeared into a crevasse 300 miles from base,
along with a team of dogs and most of the supplies. This is ``a
riveting account'' of their struggle to survive, The New York Times
Book Review wrote in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, Robert Falcon Scott was searching for
the South Pole, a journey that ended with the death of Scott and
four others on the return trip, just 11 miles from safety. In  &UR; A
FIRST RATE TRAGEDY: Robert Falcon Scott and the Race to the South
Pole &LR;  (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14), Diana Preston, a British
journalist, portrays Scott as both a bungler and a genuine hero. In
1998 the reviewer Robert R. Harris called this ``a concise and
readable account'' of Scott's adventures.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SECOND HAND SMOKE &LR;  By Thane Rosenbaum. St. Martin's Griffin,
$13.95. This novel is about a son of Holocaust survivors who grows
up in a home dominated by his tormented mother and later becomes a
Nazi-hunting lawyer. ``The author exhibits considerable grace in
interweaving themes and time frames,'' Richard Lourie wrote in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LANGUAGE OF CLOTHES &LR;  By Alison Lurie. Owl/Holt, $22.50.
This quirky, illustrated history of fashion and its uses in Western
society was originally published in 1982 and has been reissued with
a new introduction by the author. ``Lurie's contribution ...
appears mainly in the form of droll observations and pithy asides,
especially about sex,'' Walter Goodman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST BAY GREASE &LR;  By Eric Miles Williamson. Picador USA, $13.
T-Bird Murphy, the teen-age narrator of this first novel, takes
refuge from his hard-bitten parents and their world of bikers and
auto garages by combing Oakland's waterfront bars and playing
trumpet. Williamson's ``prose cuts loose in torrid rhythms that
evoke the peril and exuberance of jazz,'' Sally Eckhoff wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WIVES OF THE FISHERMEN &LR;  By Angela Huth. Bard/Avon, $12.50. This
novel explores the lifelong friendship between two women _ one
plain, the other beautiful and flirtatious _ in a secluded fishing
village in Scotland. In 1998 the reviewer Julie Gray praised Huth's
``precise and piquant'' prose.

USC WINS, HOPES FOR NIT BERTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They won't be huddled around a television set
watching the NCAA Tournament Selection Sunday show at Heritage
Hall, but the USC basketball team will have its own waiting game
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans will be anxiously awaiting a phone call tonight,
which is the unglamorous, low-tech approach necessary for teams
eager to make the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get a call on Sunday, because I still have
an unfinished taste in my mouth,'' USC forward Brian Scalabrine
said. ``The season's over, but I want to keep on playing. It looks
like we'll get in, but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Trojans feel they did their part to make the
tournament, after routing Washington State, 82-63, before 3,350 at
the Sports Arena on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   USC (16-14, 9-9) believed it needed two commanding victories
this week to make the NIT, but won't find out until tonight if it
was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of our hands now. We've done what we can do and we'll
take it from there,'' USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``I thought the
deciding factor was getting Sam Clancy back (the past four games)
and winning a couple games decisively. Hopefully, (his return) is
part of the attention we will get when they start to decide who
makes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team knew what we had to do for us to get in the
NIT. We had to win convincingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans certainly did that, opening a 30-11 lead over the
hapless Cougars (6-22, 1-17) in the first half and basically
coasting to victory. Jeff Trepagnier had 20 points, six rebounds
and four steals while David Bluthenthal added 18 points and 13
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to win by more than normal because they were 1-16,''
Trepagnier said. ``We had to beat them big.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bluthenthal, there was an added bonus to an otherwise
unremarkable game. He finished the season as the Pacific-10
Conference's leading rebounder with 9.9 per contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bluthenthal knew he needed eight rebounds to surpass Stanford's
Mark Madsen, and played all 40 minutes just to make sure. He was
actually disappointed, however, because he just missed averaging 10
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really trying to get one last rebound,'' Bluthenthal
said. ``I was so close.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bluthenthal's chase for the rebounding title, though,
the only locker room topic was the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a little disappointing if we don't get in,''
Trepagnier said. ``If we don't get in, we did it to ourselves.
Hopefully, we did get in. We're pretty confident.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of Clancy from a broken right foot has boosted the
confidence of the Trojans, who believe they could reach the
