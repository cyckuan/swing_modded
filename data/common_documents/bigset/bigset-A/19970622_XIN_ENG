<HEADLINE> More Palestinians Rioting in Hebron, Nablus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian rioters continued
clashing with Israeli soldiers in West Bank city Hebron today,
while thousands of others staged an anti-Israel and
anti-U.S. demonstration in Nablus.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 Palestinian protesters were injured in Hebron
by Israeli soldiers, who fired rubber bullets and gas grenades
from balconies and roof-tops to disperse them. No Israeli
casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the eighth straight today that the violent
confrontation continued in Hebron. More than 100 Palestinians have
been injured in the latest wave of violence, which was sparked by
the United States congress' vote on moving the U.S. Embassy from
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several thousands of angry Palestinians held an
anti-Israel and anti-U.S. demonstration in another West Bank city
of Hebron. Protesters chanted anti-Israel and anti-U.S. slogans
and burned Israeli and U.S. flags to protest the U.S. support to
Israel's claim on the disputed holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also intended to march to the Jewish holy
site of the Joseph's Tomb guarded by Israeli soldiers, but they
were blocked by Palestinian police deployed to prevent violent
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
During the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed last September sparked
by Israel's opening of the underground archaeological tunnel in
East Jerusalem, the Joseph's tomb was the scene of the bloodiest
clash where six Israeli soldiers were killed by Palestinian
protesters and policemen.
</P>
<P>
The continued violence in Hebron and the demonstration in
Nablus highlights the rising tension between the two sides due to
the prolonged deadlock in the peace talks, which were frozen since
March when Israel began building the controversial Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Rocket Guerrilla Base in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out at
noon today an air raid at a suspected guerrilla base in south
Lebanon, in an apparent retaliation for an attack on Isaeli
occupation forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Israeli warplanes launched the
strike at 12:15 a.m. (0945 GMT) in Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge
some 65 kilometers southeast of Beirut which is often used
by Muslim guerrillas as a springboard to attack the Israeli
self-carved buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli fighter-bombers fired two air-to-surfaces missiles
on the hill of Tellat Mlita in the area, the security sources
added, noting that no casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
The air raid followed, and was followed by artillery
bombardments at the heights and reconnaissance flights of Israeli
warplanes over the area.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
comfirmed that the Israeli position of Bir Kalab deeply inside the
border strip was attacked by guerrillas, but denied any casualties.
</P>
<P>
In another development, six Irish soldiers of the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which is engaged in a peacekeeping
mission in south Lebanon, were wounded this morning as a result of
a mine explosion in the area of Beit Yahoun.
</P>
<P>
The six have been sent to a field hospital of the
multi-national forces in the south Lebanese border town of
Naqoura and UNIFIl's spokesman Timor Goksel said that two Irish
soldiers were in serious state when four others were slightly
injured.
</P>
<P>
Goksel said that the soldiers were wounded when patrolling a
road in Beit Yahoun inside the Israeli-occupied enclave "after the
UNIFIL was informed by the Israeli side that the road was free of
mines."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force, comprising contingents from Fiji, Finland,
France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Poland, was set
up in 1978 following the first Israeli incursion into the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the UNIFIL's installation, some 200 peacekeepers have
died and more others wounded in various incidents on the last
active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks.

<P>
BEIJING, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Colin McRae of Britain led the

McRae, the 1995 world champion, clocked one hour, 37 minutes
and 58 seconds, followed by Swede Kenneth Eriksson in second place
39 second behind. Japan's Yoshio Fujimoto was third at 1:42:24.
</P>
<P>
The weather was hot and dry in most parts of the stages but
some sections of the road was slippery on some corners.
</P>
<P>
McRae almost rolled over his car on a big jump amid the opening
special stage.
</P>
<P>
"If I had been on full attack that would have been a major
moment," said McRae. "We had that bump in our notes as a caution
and luckily we had slowed down."
</P>
<P>
Ten Chinese drivers took part in the rally, with Lu Ningjun
having the best placing at eighth.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yong, who drove a N-class car for the first time, placed
ninth.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two cars entered the competition at the start of the day
but 13 of them was forced out due to various reasons.

<HEADLINE> French PM Calls for European Cooperation in Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
today called for closer cooperation among European countries to
enhance the competitiveness of Europe's airspace industry in the
face of fierce competition from American airspace groups.
</P>
<P>
"Any future program, whether civilian or military, cannot from
now on avoid the imperative of (European) cooperation," said
Jospin when visiting the Paris Air Show at Bourget.
</P>
<P>
He said that only when all the European countries put together
their efforts to develop the continent's airspace industry, can
they maintain an equal stand with the United States in the field.
</P>
<P>
While praising the dynamism in civilian airspace programs such
as the Airbus series passenger planes, Jospin said that Europe is
experiencing a difficult period in its military airspace industry.
</P>
<P>
"The necessary amalgamation of defense industries remains an
object of study without being started. We should start rapidly but
with method which, in this essential field for our sovereignty,
cannot be done without the participation of the state. The
government will play fully its role which has returned to the
field," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also said that the government will continue to reduce
spending in buying armaments under an overall control of public
spending.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. government for protectionism in American
airspace market and called for a "balanced and transparent"
competition between European and American airspace industries.
</P>
<P>
"The recent appearance of the unusual commercial practices on
the American market -- I think notably to about the exclusive
contracts signed by Boeing for very long distance planes with
three biggest American companies -- is very worrying,"said Jospin.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 21 (Xinhua)-- At least 15 people including
eight Kamajors have died in the fierce fighting between the
traditional hunter militia and the Sierra Leone coupleader's
forces, military sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Three soldiers and four Kamajors were reportedly seriously
injured in the fighting which started Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
The government's reinforcement have been sent to southern S.
Leone's Gerihun area, to combat what a military official
described as "a showdown between the combatants."
</P>
<P>
The 1,000 strong Kamajors have set up a series of road blocks
along the Bo-Kenema highway and the Bo-Yele road to prevent troop
movement in the area which will encircle the Kamajors, a retired
military colonel said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the secretary to the military, colonel
Tom Granby disclosed Saturday that Sierra Leone' s contigent in
west African peace keeping force (Ecomog) has been disarmed two
days ago by Ecomog commanders in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The 300 man contigent was based at waterside on the Liberian
side of the border. "We see this as a ploy by Ecomog officials to
make the Sierra Leone open for the incursion into our country by
the mercenary group from Liberia with the assistance of Ecomog "
Gr Anby Granby said.
</P>
<P>
The military secretary called the action, "a dangerous
development" and called on ECOWAS heads of state "to intervene"

<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized countries and
Russia to work together to meet global challenges.
</P>
<P>
Opening the first working session of the three-day Denver Summit of
the Eight, Clinton said no one can meet challenges such as currency
crisis, organized crime or infectious diseases
</P>
<P>
"Our challenge in this moment of peace and stability is to
organize ourselves for the future; to make change work fo us, not
against us," Clinton told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which opened on Friday night, was attended by British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien,
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Also Russian President Boris Yeltsin attended the whole process
of the event for the first time since Moscow was invited to
participate the discussions in 1991.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the summit are macro-economic policies,
economic globalization, social and political issues in the current
world.
</P>
<P>
"We must seize the opportunities of the global economy to expand
our own prosperity, bring in other nations that want to share in its
benefits, and work together to meet the new threats,"Clinton told
the leaders.
</P>
<P>
"None of our nations can meet these challenges alone, and more
than ever our summit process is an engine of common progress," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are to discuss "the best ways to deepen and extend the
benefits of the 21st century marketplace, to help our societies
thrive as our population grow older, to strengthen further the
stability of the world financial system, to generate economic growth
throughout the world," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
As a host of the summit, the U.S. seeks support from the eight
countries for its initiatives in several areas, including a plan to
help Africa develop economy.

Meanwhile, the leaders will also discuss cooperation to meet
threats such as nuclear smuggling, international crimes and
infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
The summit took place at the Denver Public Library in downtown.
"It is fitting that we meet in a public library, a place where
people come together to learn and share ideas without regard to
their own backgrounds," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Invites Saddam to OIC Summit in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today officially invited his Iraqi counterpart Saddam
Hussein to Tehran for the 8th Summit of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) due to be held in December.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the invitation
was delivered by Iranian Health and Medical Education Minister
Ali Reza Marandi in his meeting with Saddam in Baghdad today.
</P>
<P>
It said that Saddam told the Iranian envoy that his government
was ready to improve relations with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
In response, Marandi voiced the commitment of the Iranian
government to solve existing problems between Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed Iran's concern for the territorial integrity
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Saddam did not say whether he would go to Tehran for
the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
A senior Iraqi diplomat told Xinhua recently that Saddam
would not come here for the forthcoming OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
Salah N. Al-Samarmad, Charge d'affaires of the Iraqi embassy,
said that the Iraqi president would not come to Tehran despite
Rafsanjani's invitation.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, one of Iraq's vice-presidents would come to
Tehran to attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
Al-Samarmad admitted that both Iraq and Iran have the
intention to improve their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Marandi, who arrived in Baghdad Thursday, is the first Iranian
high-ranking official visiting Iraq in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war from 1980 to 1988. So, it
is not easy for the two countries to untie the knot, observers
here noted.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Endorses Government's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti National Assembly
today endorsed the government policy of reconciling relations
with the Arab countries which supported Iraq during the Gulf War
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the parliament during a closed-door
session today ended a week-long deliberation on the government's
foreign policy, especially towards those Arab countries whose
"ties with Kuwait were strained after siding with the Iraqi regime
during its invasion of Kuwait in 1990."
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary members expressed their desire to cooperate
with the government on the initiative.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti first deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber voiced pleasure on the
parliament's positive response to the foreign strategy on keeping
Kuwait close to the Arab arena.
</P>
<P>
He said "the assembly agreed that Kuwait should not be
isolated" from the Arab community.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government started earlier this year an initiative
to reconcile relations with Arab countries, namely Jordan, Sudan
and Yemen, which it regarded as pro-Iraq during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah recently announced that Kuwait would restore its
relations with some of the countries that supported the Iraqi
regime, but he did set a date for the restoration of relations.
</P>
<P>
Local Arabic daily Al-Watan today quoted a Kuwaiti high-ranking
source as saying Kuwait's ties with Jordan and Yemen would resume
in two months.
</P>
<P>
The source said the "upcoming few weeks will witness
practical steps towards the resumption of relations with Jordan"
adding that Kuwait would appoint two ambassadors in Amman and
Sanna "during the next two months."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kuwait Airways Corporation and Jordanian Royal
Airlines would re-operate their flights between Kuwait and Amman
next July.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abudel Salam Al-Majali said Friday
that the atmosphere between Kuwait and Jordan was clearing up.

CAIRO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will go on with its efforts
to salvage the peace process and put it back on track despite the
obstruction from the U.S. Congress, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will continue its peace drive according to the Madrid
conference terms of reference, the land-for-peace principle and
the timetable included in the Oslo agreement, Moussa told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"There are many obstacles in this respect but Egypt will not
be disheartened," he said, commenting on the foreign aid package
approved Wednesday by the U.S. Senate Appropriations subcommittee
that sets aside no money for Cairo.
</P>
<P>
If the bill is enacted, for the first time since Egypt and
Israel signed the U.S.-brokered Camp David peace accords of 1978,
of the two signatories, only Israel would be assured of a
multi-billion-dollar share in the annual U.S. foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
Washington also announced last week that it was creating a
Middle East peace and stability fund that would raise 100 million
U.S. dollars of aid to Jordan and possibly other countries
actively involved in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. attempts to use the aid as a pressure card
on Egypt, Moussa said that the Clinton administration's position
toward the Egyptian peace role is clear that "it should not be
disturbed."
</P>
<P>
After the subcommittee decision, the U.S. State Department
Thursday insisted on its request for more than 2 billion dollars
in aid specially targeted for Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years and especially since 1978, Egypt has
received more than 20 billion in U.S. aid, second only to
Israel in the amount of U.S. aid to any single country.
</P>
<P>
On the Egyptian coordination with Israel, the foreign minister
said the Egyptian mediation efforts were going in the same line
and both sides were still in contact.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Friday exchanged views with
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu on a fresh initiative
aimed at unlocking the logjam in the peace process, which stalled
in March when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in
disputed East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But the top Egyptian diplomat denied the existence of any new
initiative, saying that the Palestinians and Israelis are
negotiating on the initiatives and ideas previously launched by
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also stressed the impact of the Egyptian-European
contacts held over the past three days on activating the peace
process and the role of 15 European countries "linked to the
Mideast region with different ties."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's European tour launched to get the peace process off
hook, has taken him to France and Germany since Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia on Close Watch of Bombing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia watches closely
the new developments in the case of last June's bombing of a
U.S. servicemen compound in the Kingdom, Saudi deputy Interior
Minister prince Ahmad Ben Abdel Aziz said today
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the expatriation of Saudi national Hani
Al-Sayegh from Canada to the United States for alleged involvement
in the Al-Khobar truck bombing last June that killed 19
U.S. airmen.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating an Arab anti-drug conference in Jeddah, a Saudi
red-sea coast city, Ahmad said Saudi Arabia considered the case as
of special importance to it, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sayegh was detained several months ago in Canada after
authorities there refused to grant him political asylum and
considered him a terrorist and a threat to Canadian security.
</P>
<P>
Canadian court documents accused him of having been a driver of
a car that gave the go-ahead signal for the bomb-laden truck
involved in the bombing attack and of being a member of the
radical Saudi Hezbollah. But he has maintained his innocence of
involvement with the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Canadian authorities ruled last month he should be deported as
a suspected terrorist, so Sayegh was extradited to the U.S. last
week and would be tried in the U.S. next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sayegh denied taking part in the bombing and said he was in
Iran at the time when the bombing took place. But he confessed to
taking part in another abortive attempt against U.S. nationals in
Saudi Arabia in December 1995.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Lifts Ban on Restaurants, Food Vendors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government
today lifted a ban on restaurants and food vendors imposed early
this month to check further spread of cholera.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at his office in the town of
Zanzibar, the Isles Minister for Health, Said Bakari Jecha, said
the decision to allow restaurants and food vendors to do their
business effective from tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
He said the unbanning will be followed by the stringent health
check ups by health officers to ensure that all hygienic rules
were met. The use of plastic utensils are still banned, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied that we have been able to certain extent
control the killer disease," explained the minister, adding that
unlike in the past, few cholera cases are now reported.
</P>
<P>
Jecha further said that a ban on the importation of fruits and
vegetables from the Mainland was still there to stay.
</P>
<P>
But he said some few clean tourist hotels would be licenced to
import vegetation and fruits from the Mainland.
</P>
<P>
Since the closure of restaurants to check the spread of the
epidemic, which has so far killed more than 40 people and
affected 260 others, the government has been under criticism for
failing to inspect each restaurant before imposing the decision.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time Zanzibar experienced cholera. The
epidemic broke out in 1959 and killed 25,000 people, and in 1978
claimed lives of 300 people.

According to the Ethiopian News Agency, in an interview with

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Opposition Denies Ban on Marches to Royal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's opposition
Basutholand Congress Party (BCP) today vowed to disregard a ban
on marches to the royal palace imposed by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
A senior spokesman for the former ruling party Tsheliso
Makhakhe said the opposition would continue its protests until
its demands were met.
</P>
<P>
Barring people from seeing their king (King Letsie III) is
tantamount to denying Basotho their constitutional right to
peaceful demonstration and presenting petitions to the king as
head of state, Makhakhe said.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho government headed by Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle
Friday announced to ban all protest marches to the royal palace
in Maseru with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Deputy Prime Minister Paklitha Mosisili said
the planned processions to the palace were intended to bring King
Letsie III into disrepute by "involving him in the dust of
politics".
</P>
<P>
The ban followed protest marches which were held in the
capital this week by large groups of supporters of five main
political parties against the government.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle announced on June 9 the formation of the Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LCD) and immediately transferred the
government power to the newly formed party.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle's moves sent shock waves in the tiny land-locked
mountain kingdom, forcing opposition parties to form a coalition
with the former ruling BCP, which unanimously condemned the move
and term it "unconstituional" or even as "coup d'etat".
</P>
<P>
Tsheliso Makhakhe, an opposition spokesman and executive
member of the BCP, said today that "I don't think there is any
constitution that allow a person in authority like the Prime
Minister (Mokhehle) to overthrow his own government and to form a
new party inside the chamber (parliament) without any reference
to the electorate."
</P>
<P>
The opposition said the government action signalled the coming
of draconian laws in Lesotho, and vowed to resist violation of
basic democratic rights by an "illegitimate" government.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Europe, America Squabble in Denver Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Differences between the
U.S. and its European allies on a wide range of issues come out as
leaders from the Group of Seven industrialized nations and Russia
met for a second day today.
</P>
<P>
The summit was convened against a backdrop of strong economy in
the United States, giving U.S. President Bill Clinton a chance to
boast for his achievement and teach the European allies lessons on
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the Europeans gave a cool shoulder to the U.S. for its
arrogance on matters relating to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), Bosnia and others.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit began with a working dinner on Friday
night, hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton. European leaders
expressed concern to Clinton about U.S. plans to withdraw all its
troops from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has determined to pull out all its 8,500 strong troops
of Bosnia by June 1998, insisting that the Europeans should take
care of their own issues like Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
But when speaking at the dinner, French President Jacques
Chirac made it clear that the Europeans did not want to see
unilateral withdrawal of Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans fear that bloodshed may occur again if
peacekeeping forces were pulled out. The Bosnian Muslims, which
have obtained many heavy weapons from the U.S., were reportedly
prepared to launch new attacks against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The European leaders believe that military and civil goals of
the Dayton peace accords have just been partially achieved, so the
U.S. withdrawal would create a problem for the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Trans-Atlantic differences also remain on NATO's expansion.
Chirac told Clinton during a meeting on Friday that Romania should
be included in the first wave of expansion, while Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi told Clinton that Slovenia should not be
excluded.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has decided firmly to limit the enlargement to three
-- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. seeks to reward Moscow on acquiescing the expansion of
NATO by giving a strong support to Russia's full participation.
Clinton said that Russia was "fully included" in the summit.
</P>
<P>
But France said that there was a consensus among the G-7
nations that Russia should not be included in discussions of
global economic and financial matters.
</P>
<P>
As host, Clinton also wants to rally support for cleaning up in
Chernobyl, Ukraine, after the 1986 nuclear reactor explosion.
Clinton is expected to ask for at least 300 million U.S. dollars
from G-7 members. European leaders are reluctant to pay more for
the project.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on Hong Kong Opens in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition entitled
"The Return of Hong Kong to the Motherland" opened at Tanzania
National Museum in the city this evening.
</P>
<P>
Opening the exhibition, the Tanzania Minister for Education
and Culture, Kapuya said, "we are here to celebrate the return of
Hong Kong to China which will officially take place on July 1,
1997."
</P>
<P>
"As we count down to that day we have every reason to be
happy. We are witnesses to the results of tough but sincere
negotiations between Chinese and British Governments which led to
the Sino-British Joint Declaration," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resuming of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong by
China testifies the extent to which the motherland had a clear
understanding of her rights and the full respect she has for her
legal obligations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We, Tanzanians, are inspired by the patience, understanding
and commitment shown by the government and people of the people's
Republic of China," Minister Kapuya said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, co-organized by the Chinese Embassy in
Tanzania and the Ministry for Education and Culture of Tanzania,
is composed of four parts - Hong Kong's history, its ties with
the inland areas, the process of transfer of power and today's
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
About 150 people, including high-ranking government officials,
diplomatic envoys and representatives of the Chinese Embassy,
Chinese experts teams working in Tanzania as well as Chinese
companies based in Dar es Salaam, attended the opening ceremony,
which will last for 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Dar es Salaam Harbour Dredging Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The dredging up of Dar es
Salaam harbour entrance project has already started, an official
of Tanzania Harbours Authority (THA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The Director General of the THA, Samson Luhigo told the
official Daily News here today that the project estimated to cost
23 million US Dollars will increase the port's handling capacity
of containers from 200 to 500 daily.
</P>
<P>
Luhigo said the process of dredging up the entrance will take
ten months. By September this year, the work will have gained
tempo, he added.
</P>
<P>
The director general said that upon completion of the work,
vessels of up to 40,000 tons can enter the harbour. At the
moment, only 25,000 tons vessels are allowed to sail through the
channel.
</P>
<P>
He said that widening of the entrance would eliminate the
problem of the tide which contributed immensely to THA's low
performance in handling containers.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, a vessel enters and leaves the port only when
the tide is favourable. A ship could finish off loading but some
times it would have to wait for favorable tide condition to get
out of the harbour, he said. Eenditem

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls on UN to Consider its Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today called on the
U.N. Security Council to respect its "political and security
concerns" during the inspection missions of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) disarming the country.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial published today, Al-thawra, mouthpiece of the
ruling Baath Socialist Party, said that "it is not right for the
Security Council... to make it (Iraq) its permanent victim
because of the council's weakness toward U.S. pressure."
</P>
<P>
It described Iraq's reservations over the UNSCOM's acts as
"serious and legitimate." It said these reservations emanate from
"genuine concerns over (Iraq's) national security and
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The latest crisis between Iraq and the Security Council has
been sparked by UNSCOM chief Rolf Ekeus, with "clear U.S. motives
behind", said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus, due to resign on July 1, will pay his last visit to
Iraq in his seven years' mission. He is expected to submit a
report to the Security Council on the arms inspection in Iraq
after his return.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Ekeus reported to the council that the
Iraqi side interfered with UNSCOM helicopters while carrying out
their inspection missions and barred the U.N. arms inspectors
from some compounds during the search for banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Saturday adopted a resolution
demanding the Iraqi government cooperate fully with UNSCOM arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said that it would impose new sanctions
unless weapons monitors certify Iraqi cooperation when they file
their new progress report on October 11.

<HEADLINE> Violence Declines in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Violence by Muslim fundamentalists
in Egypt has firmly decline thanks to toughened security measures,
according to the latest edition of the Middle East Times.
</P>
<P>
The number of people killed dropped from 373 in 1995 to 174 in
1996, representing a 53.3 percent decrease, the English weekly
quoted an annual report of the Egyptian Organization of Human
Rights (EOHR).
</P>
<P>
Among the killed 53 were police officers, 34 Muslim militants,
69 civilians and 18 tourists, the EOHR report said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian security services succeeded in reducing the armed
Islamist groups' activities with successive strikes against their
strong-holds, resulting in the arrests or deaths of their top
leaders, it added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Interior Minister Hassan Al Alfi said last week that
4,392 Muslim fundamentalists had been arrested since a wave of
Muslim militant violence began sweeping the country in March
1992.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,175 people have been killed in the violence that
aimed to bring down the secular government of President Hosni
Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Christie Ends British Team Career with Winning Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Linford Christie, who competed for
the British team for the last time, ran a dead heat with Greece's
Georgios Panayiotopoulos in the 200 metes at the European Cup in
Munich on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Race judges ruled both runners had shared first place, allowing
Christie to end his last race for the British team on a winning
note.
</P>
<P>
Panayiotopoulos caught the 37-year-old Christie from behind and
race officials first ruled he broke the tape alone. But they
changed their decision to a dead heat after reviewing the replays.
</P>
<P>
The two runners were timed at 20.57 on a drizzly cold day, well
off the personal best of 20.09 that Christie ran in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Christie, the 1992 Olympic champion who plans to retire at the
end of the season, has been the dominant athlete at the event,
which brings together Europe's top eight track nations in team
competition.
</P>
<P>
With the dead heat win, and Saturday's triumph in the
100-meters, Christie finished unbeaten in 13 sprints over a decade
at the European Cup.
</P>
<P>
His two wins also helped Britain's men gain their first triumph
since 1989 at the European Cup after leading them to five straight
second-places.
</P>
<P>
Russia also handily beat Germany's women, the defending
champion. It recorded 127 points, while host Germany had 112.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Olga Kuzenkova also shattered the women's hammer throw
record by over three meters with a fling of 73.10, while Olympic
champion Vebjoern Rodal of Norway coasted to the 800 meters win as
expected.
</P>
<P>
Kuzenkova's fling easily broke the mark of 69.58 set earlier
this year by Romanian Melinte Mihaela, who threw 69.76 to finish
second.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Jonathan Edwards leaped to a year's best on his
second leap at 17.64 meters to win the triple jump.
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who owns the world record with a 1995 jump of 18.29,
had his best result in almost a year after three poor outings this
season.

<HEADLINE>   Roundup: Hasina Spends Rule Anniversary Quietly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's second
woman prime minister, completed her first year in office today
amidst poor economic performance but a rather quiet political
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old Hasina took power on June 23 last year after
her Awami League in the parliamentary polls defeated its main
political foe, former Prime Minister and Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) Chairperson Khaleda Zia.
</P>
<P>
Considering lofty election promises and a host of problems
inherited in the economic and socio-political life, "her work is
not so good, not so bad," said an observer here.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the new government has tried its utmost
to maintain political stability although it faced pressure and
protests from formidable political opponents over a series of
political and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
The issues raising controversy in politics mainly were related
to India and they include the Ganges water sharing treaty, transit
facilities to India and tribal insurgency in Chittagong Hill
Tracts.
</P>
<P>
Domestic issues which also created an uproar were an acute
power crisis, the disaster in the stock market, alleged repression
of the opposition and agitation by government employees over the
new office hours and the demand for new pay scales.
</P>
<P>
However, the main opposition BNP and other opposition groups
have so far failed to make any effective stir. Rather, the
opposition thought it prudent to buy more time before starting any
serious agitation using the scattered political and economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the third largest Jatiya Party (JP) is now caught in
a dilemma in determining the party's future. The mainstream JP led
by former President HM Ershad still maintains a soft line toward
the government but a dissident group led by Kazi Zafar is critical
of Hasina's administration.
</P>
<P>
Soon after assuming power, Hasina launched an "economic
diplomacy" to erase the sour memory of the "country of disaster,"
a label used by critics to describe Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister undertook nearly a dozen trips to foreign
countries, including China, the United States, India, Italy and
Turkey, where she spent most of her time meeting big companies and
business leaders and trying to get them to invest in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
However, "Bangladesh is likely to close fiscal 1997 with a
weakened reserve position, no significant structural reform
measures and a still unconvinced private sector," according to a
World Bank report.
</P>
<P>
The overall gross domestic product growth has been estimated at
5.7 percent in the current fiscal compared with 5.3 percent in the
last. This is primarily due to unprecedented performance of
agriculture, which is estimated to grow by 6 to as much as 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
But the manufacturing sector did not enjoy such glorious
performance. According to the Dhaka Chamber of Industries
estimates, the growth rate in the sector would be around 5.7
percent, the lowest in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank study said: "The ongoing depressed investment
and industrial activities, while raising concerns about the
sustainability of a higher economic growth, also highlight that
business confidence has not yet been restored."
</P>
<P>
The donor agency study also estimated that the export growth in
the current fiscal would remain below the government's projected
rate of 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign exchange reserve position remains
critical. Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria said that at the end of
May this year, Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserves stood at
only 1.623 billion U.S. dollars, which was described by experts as
a "vulnerable" situation.
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, Hasina is going to face dual challenges,
said a political observer. "She has to maintain the much-needed
political stability to sustain the most-needed economic growth in
this least-developed country."

<P>
AMMAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A visiting businessmen delegation
from Thailand, Southeast Asia's main tourist destination,
today expressed the wishes to invest in Jordan's tourist sector.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's keenness to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in
the region encourages Thai businessmen to set up investment
projects in the kingdom, said head of the six-member delegation
Kim Watna, who is President of Thai Global, a holding company
with more than 20 firms specializing in tourism.
</P>
<P>
Thai businessmen plan to establish tourism facilities in
Jordan Valley and the Red Sea port city of Aqaba, said Watna
during his meeting with Prince Abdullah Hussein, the Regent.
</P>
<P>
The Regent underlined Jordan's readiness to provide facilities
and necessary services for Thai investors in the kingdom.

A statement from the Jordanian Ministry of Tourism and
Antiquities said that Thailand had expressed on several
occasions its interest in investing in Jordan's tourism sector.

<HEADLINE> Tree Planting Marks Return of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 12,000 people took part
in tree planting along the Shenzhou section of the Beijing-Kowloon
Railway in north China's Hebei province today, marking the return
of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The activity was sponsored by the National Greening Committee
and the Forestry Ministry and is part of efforts to build a "green
corridor" along the new 2,553-km Beijing-Kowloon Railway, linking
Hong Kong and the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to plant trees on both sides of the railway in the
next four years so that by the year 2000, all areas two to five
kilometers along both sides of the railway line will have trees.
</P>
<P>
In the Jiangxi and Anhui province sections of the railway,
green belts have formed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Xu Youfang, the Forestry Minister,
hoped all local governments and departments along the railway to
put more funds into the undertaking and improve the management of
the project.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children in U.S. Depict Hong Kong's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 21 (Xinhua) -- In the eyes of Chinese
children living in the United States with their parents, Hong
Kong's return to China is just like a kid returning to the embrace
of his mother.
</P>
<P>
Many children participating "Celebrating Hong Kong's Return"
painting contest, organized by the Chinese School Association in
the United States (CSAUS), personify the theme and entitle their
paintings "kid returning to mother." Under their pens, the mothers
are always young or middle-aged women, while the kids appear to be
babies or one-year-old just learning to walk. Whatever the age,
the mothers and kids are with black hair, black eyes and yellow
skin. Others draw animals to show the mother-and-kid relationship.
</P>
<P>
Of the 210 paintings shown at the Evergreen Publish and
Station, Monterey Park here, most are selected by some 80 Chinese
schools in 35 U.S. states and cities. Others are by children in
Chinese cities of Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The biggest painting was done collectively by 37 Chinese
children living in Boston, It is a scene of carnival of animals in
front of "peace woods." The painters' own photos are pinned at the
heart of flowers decorating the entire lower part of the picture.
</P>
<P>
Ling Qiu, organizer of the contest and master teacher at the
Hope Chinese School of Southern California, said that is is only
natural for overseas Chinese children to interpret Hong Kong's
return in a kid-returning-to-mother way, because their parents and
teachers say so and also because the Chinese culture cherishes
affection between mothers and children. Also a leader of the
CSAUS, she said members of the association offer classes after
school or during weekends to promote understanding of the Chinese
culture as well as teaching of the Chinese phonetic alphabet and
to simplify Chinese characters and standard Chinese pronunciation
(Mandarin). These schools accept both Chinese and American
children.
</P>
<P>
Ting Shao Kuang, a well-known Chinese painter now living in Los
Angeles, said after visiting the show that children's painting are
direct, real and innocent. "They paint what they think," he
said. "They have no convention to restrict them." Referring to art
education, the famous painter said that adult artistry would
hinder children's imagination and creativity. "Kids above 12 may
learn some adult skills," he said.

<HEADLINE> Good Summer Grain Harvests for Three Consecutive Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to harvest 118
billion kg of grain this summer, a 3.5 percent increase or four
billion kg more than in 1996, hitting an all-time high, according
to the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive year that China has had a good
summer grain harvest, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The output of summer oil-bearing crops is estimated at nine
million tons, an increase of nearly three percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the achievements to greater emphasis on
agriculture, improved science and technology, and good spring
weather.
</P>
<P>
This year's harvest is characterized by increases in growing
areas and per-unit outputs, increases in 21 of the 26 provinces,
autonomous regions, and municipalities, and record summer grain
highs in 15 of them, or nearly half of China's provinces.
</P>
<P>
The total growing area was 32.2 million ha, an increase of
about 666,000 ha. Inter-provincial harvesting by 30,000 combines
has also played a role, the ministry explained.
</P>
<P>
China had a record grain crop of 407.3 billion kg in 1984, but
the figure dropped to 379.1 billion kg the following year, and was
followed by fluctuations for several years. Grain production went
up to 446.2 billion kg in 1990, but again fell for another two
years.
</P>
<P>
Consistent emphasis on agriculture and encouraging farmers in
grain production are among the fundamental factors behind the good
summer harvest. The central government has introduced policies for
increasing input in agriculture and has raised the price of grain
several times in the past years.

<P>
AMMAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Jordanians held
demonstration here today before the U.S. Embassy to denounce a
U.S. Congress' decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's
"undivided" capital.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian news Agency Petra reported that the protesters,
who were representatives from various non-governmental
organizations and groups, presented a condemnation note to the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, which lasted about an hour, went peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives approved on June 10 the
decision to recognize the holy city of Jerusalem as the undivided
capital of Israel and allocate 100 million U.S. dollars to remove
the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to the city. Many Arab countries have
voiced anger over the decision.
</P>
<P>
The sovereignty of Jerusalem has been a hot issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations as both sides claim the
city as their own state capital.

Hong Kong took part in various celebration activities today to
greet the return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Hong Kong residents attended a gala festival,
jointly organized by more than 130 trade union councils at the
Victoria Park, on Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
A trade union official, surnamed Lee, said the fall of the

contribute to the smooth transition of Hong Kong and its long-term
prosperity and stability with their wisdom and talents.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Oil Corporation to Buy More Tankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's oil corporation
Petronas will finalize its deal by early next year to buy another
four to six liquefied natural gas tankers, its senior
vice-president for corporate planning and development, Datuk
Hamzah Bakar, said today.
</P>
<P>
The national oil corporation has received tenders from several
shipyards in countries like France and Japan to build the tankers,
he told a news conference aboard the company's fifth tanker Puteri
Firus in Malacca, about 145 kilometers southeast of here,
according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The corporation now has five such tankers, including the fifth
one, which arrived from France yesterday and cost 700 million
ringgit (about 280 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The tanker is capable of carrying 130,294 tons of LNG.
</P>
<P>
The other four which cost about the same amount each are
already in service.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah said the plan to have more tankers is to meet the
increasing transportation needs of the LNG industry, especially in
view of the completion of the third Malaysia LNG (MLNG) plant in
Bintulu, Sarawak, East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the 15 billion ringgit (about 6 billion
U.S. dollars) plant by the year 2001, the MLNG complex in Bintulu
will position Malaysia as the world's largest LNG producer from a
single location with a total production of about 23 million tons
per annum.
</P>
<P>
The two existing plants, with a total investment of 30 billion
ringgit (about 12 billion dollars), currently have a production
capacity of 16 million tons of LNG annually.
</P>
<P>
To date, Petronas is the third largest LNG producer in the
world, after Algeria and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The official said that about one-third of Petronas' earnings,
which stood at 8.9 billion dollars last year, is expected to come
from the LNG business once the whole MLNG complex comes on stream
by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Petronas is discussing with several countries to market the
product, the official said, adding, "We have received inquiries
from China, Thailand, the Philippines and India."

<HEADLINE> Xinhua News Agency on Reunification of Motherland (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The "one country, two systems"
concept, which is being applied to Hong Kong, was initially
proposed for the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, Xinhua News Agency noted today that in
applying it to the Hong Kong question first, it marks a
significant step in the reunification of the motherland, and the
concept can also be applied to the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping said that the only way to solve the Hong Kong and
Taiwan questions is to use the "one country, two systems"
principle, and the return of Hong Kong will prove the principle's
availability, it said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Taiwan are questions that are left over from
history and resolving them is a matter of Chinese sovereignty and
is the common aspiration of the Chinese people, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan question is different from the Hong Kong one, it
said, explaining that the former was left over from the civil war,
and is entirely an internal matter that should be solved by the
Chinese people themselves, but that the latter was left over by
the British colonialist invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government long
ago proposed the "peaceful reunification", and the "one country,
two systems" as the basic principles for solving the Taiwan
question, meaning that peaceful reunification across the Taiwan
Strait will be achieved through a principle of one China and
through political negotiations, the commentary said.

<P>
The "one country, two systems" principle takes into
consideration both history and reality, and the interests of the
whole nation, the commentary noted. The smooth preparations for
Hong Kong's return over the past 13 years show that the principle
has won the popular support of the people, it said.
</P>
<P>
Allegations by Taiwan authorities that the principle could not
apply to Taiwan are groundless, the commentary noted, adding that
since 1979, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese
government have always advocated equal negotiations between the
two sides across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, in January, 1995 put forth the
eight-point propositions, proposing that talks be held to end the
state of hostility under the principle of one China, but the
Taiwan authorities proposed "splitting the country and ruling
under separate regimes", the commentary said, adding that they
also proposed "equal political entities without mutual
subordination". The Taiwan side has even gone so far as to try to
"join the United Nations" in an attempt to internationalize the
Taiwan question, but all the Taiwan authorities really want is to
get foreigners to interfere in cross-strait relations, the
commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
The one China principle is the base of and the prerequisite to
peaceful reunification of the motherland and it is a common
understanding of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the commentary stressed.
</P>
<P>
When China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,
a series of policies on the "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
and a high-degree of autonomy, will be implemented under the
principle of "one country, two systems", it said.
</P>
<P>
The policies to be adopted for solving the Taiwan question may
be even more lenient, the commentary disclosed, while quoting Deng
Xiaoping as saying that Taiwan can retain its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The experiences of the past 20 years have shown that the
political stability and economic growth in China's inland areas
are conducive to the development and stability in Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Macao, and vice versa. the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The realization of peaceful reunification of the two sides of
the strait according to the principle of "one country, two
systems" will cause no loss for the people of Taiwan, but enable
them to enjoy strong support from the mainland and its
international esteem and fame, it said.

<HEADLINE> Descendant of National Hero Hails Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- When the Qing court signed the
Nanking Treaty, ceding Hong Kong to Britain in 1842, Lin Zexu, an
official who led the move to ban opium trade, ended a
distinguished career in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
Then, 143 years later, Lin Zexu's great great-grandson, Ling
Qing, who served as Chinese ambassador to the United Nations,
submitted the Sino-British Joint Declaration to the UN, stating
that China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historical coincidence," he said, "and a meeting
with destiny," reviewing the history of Hong Kong's being ceded to
Britain and the lengthy process of its return.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiating is a test of power," he said, "the Chinese
government during several periods wanted to get Hong Kong back,
but none of them was able to do it. After the founding of the new
China, the nation began to stand more firmly in the world."
</P>
<P>
Ling was a member of the first generation of new Chinese
diplomats and was a witness to the tremendous changes that took
place in Chinese society, its economy, and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the Sino-British negotiations on the Hong Kong
question, he said proudly that the British had to give in, because
Deng Xiaoping insisted that "the issue of sovereignty is not
negotiable," and pointed out that, "No one can deny that China's
economic growth provided a basis for its recovery of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Ling is descended from Lin Zexu through his third son, Lin
Gongshu. His father, Lin Busui, served as an official in the late
Qing Dynasty and in the government of the Northern Warlords. Ling
took part in the War of Resistance against Japan, and later became
involved in political activities and foreign affairs. It was then
that he changed his name from Lin Moqing to Ling Qing.
</P>
<P>
"For me, the return of Hong Kong is, first and foremost a
matter of pride for Chinese, and a matter of dignity for a Chinese
diplomat at the same time," he said.

FENGJIE, CHONGQING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Adili, a tightrope
walker from China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, materialised
his long-time dream after walking across the Yangtze River with
only 13.8 minutes here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Adili, the seventh generation of Dawazi family, walked on a
640.75-meter-long steel wire stretched 375 meters above the
Yangtze River to cross the Qutang Gorge, one of the well-known
Three Gorges on China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
The Uygur had long hoped to walk arcoss the Yangtze River, a
feat which had been achieved by Canadian tightrope walker Jay
Cochraine in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the 51-year-old Cochrane, an America-based circus
performer, finished the walking in 53.2 minutes, more than 39
minutes than Adili's clocking.

<HEADLINE>   From Double-Deck Tram to Airport Expressway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is both traditional
and ultra-modern in public transport.
It is the only city in the world that has kept a double-deck tram
fleet.
</P>
<P>
Power-driven trams came to Hong Kong in 1904, running a 13-km
double track line along the north shore of Hong Kong Island from
east to west. The fare then was ten cents, a luxury few could
afford at a time when most people traveled on foot.
Nowadays, the fare has risen to 1.6 HK dollars, making tram the
cheapest means of transport.
</P>
<P>
The passage of time has thrown many old stuffs into
obsolescence. But the 93-year-old tram service has moved at its
own pace into the fast changing modern society.
</P>
<P>
The fleet of 163 trams now carries more than 310,000 passengers
a day. The tram is still a favorite of Hong Kong people for its
low price, convenience and a trace of nostalgia despite the fact
that it runs slowly and is without air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the tram is only one of many choices in a highly
mobile city like Hong Kong, where an efficient multi-modal public
transport system handles over ten million passenger trips a day.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong boasts one of the world's busiest underground
railways -- the 43-km Mass Transit Railway, which transports over
two million passengers daily. The heavily-utilized rail system
runs across the Victoria Harbor to link 38 stations in Hong Kong
Island, Kowloon and the "New Territories." It came into full use
in the 1980s and now runs 19 hours a day. During the rush hours, a
train starts off in every two minutes.
</P>
<P>
A 34-km suburban railroad -- a section of the Kowloon-Canton
Railway -- carries commuters daily to new towns in the
northeastern part of the "New Territories." The railway has gone
through modernization since it began operation in 1910 -- from
single track to double tracks, from steam locomotives to diesel
locomotives and eventually to the present high-speed electric
train. In the late 1980s, an electric light rail line began
serving the northwestern part of the "New Territories."
</P>
<P>
A 109-year-old cable-hauled tram carries sightseers along the
tropical slope from downtown Central to the Victoria Peak where
people command a spectacular view of the vast cluster of tall
buildings on Hong Kong Island, the Victoria Harbor and Kowloon
beyond. It takes five minutes for the red carriages to move up and
down along the 1.4-km double-track line.
</P>
<P>
In addition to rails, many other transport services such as
buses, taxis and ferries offer Hong Kong commuters a good range of
choices at reasonable fares and different levels of comfort, speed
and convenience.
</P>
<P>
Like other metropolises, Hong Kong is faced with the pressing
problem of traffic congestion. More than 6.3 million people live
in an area of about 1,000 sq. km, and even worse, the hilly land
offers few plain plots.
</P>
<P>
There are 273 vehicles on every kilometer of road, almost the
highest traffic density in all cities around the world. The
average number of daily passengers via road transport, including
franchised buses, public light buses and taxis, reached 6.7
million at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Actually, quite a number of big infrastructure projects have
been completed or are under construction to improve efficiency of
public transport in tandem with economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Ferry used to be the only means of transport across the
Victoria Harbor, which links Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon
Peninsula. In the past, workers could not get back home when
rainstorms brought waterborne transport to a halt. Nowadays, three
cross-harbor tunnels can ensure different forms of transport to
run safely at any time.
</P>
<P>
The third crossing, the Western Harbor Tunnel, opened to
traffic in April this year. The 7.5-billion-HK dollars project can
handle 180,000 vehicles a day and boosts the cross-harbor capacity
by 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
A 34-km Airport Railway is being built to link Hong Kong
Island and Kowloon with the New Airport under construction at Chek
Lap Kok and Lantau an outlying island in the west of Hong Kong.
When put into use in 1998, the railway will offer two high-speed
services -- an Airport Express and a domestic mass transit service
-- which are expected to ease the urban traffic pressure.
</P>
<P>
A new railway stretching to the northwestern part of the "New
Territories" is being planned and the underground railway will
soon be extended to more new suburban towns.

to China is "to continue the development of cooperation between
the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua after
laying a wreath on the Tomb of Unknown Soldiers near the Red
Square on the occasion of the 56th anniversary of the Patriotic
War taken by the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
He said, "as you know, we (Russia and China) made some plans
when Chinese Premier Li Peng came to Moscow in December last year,
and now I fly to Beijing" to fix these plans.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospects of the China-Russia relations,
Chernomyrdin said, "I can say that the prospects of the relations
between the two countries are good, and the areas of cooperation
are broad."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Russian government delegation will
discuss and solve many important issues in Beijing, mainly the
issues concerning economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stops Using Freon for Refrigerators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran has launched a massive
program to replace freon, which is harmful to the ozone layer, in
manufacturing coolers and refrigerators, a local report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Iran reported that the harmful gas will
be replaced by new gas which will leave no negative impact
on the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Ministry of Industries said that it has
allocated necessary foreign currency for shifting the production
lines. The ongoing development project aims to boost production
and improve quality of products in many household appliances.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the program is expected to complete
by the end of the next year.
</P>
<P>
Iran turned out 96,000 refrigerators and freezers during the
first two months of the current Iranian year (starting March 21),
showing an increase of 89 percent compared to the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicted that the production of those articles
will stand at 1.2 million by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
To help Iran's replacement program, the United Nations has
granted 17 million U.S. dollars for eliminating substances that
destroy the ozone layer such as freon and CFC.
</P>
<P>
The figure is part of UN plans which have been launched
from 1996 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Moharram Nezhad, Deputy President for Human Habitat of
Iran's Ecological Organization, said "by implementing plans aimed
at reconstructing ozone layer, all the substances that play a
role in destroying ozone layer will be eliminated from the
cycle of industrial and chemical products."
</P>
<P>
The official said that these plans were implemented in 1996
in the industrialized countries. In developing countries, too,
these plans will be fully implemented, with UN's assistance, by
the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Iran has pledged that it would reach the defined aims of
this program in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Stocks To Remain Strong in Coming Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's share market is
likely to continue its recent strong performance during the coming
week while the Australian dollar may remain fairly steady.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist of AMP Investments Australia Ltd., Shane
Oliver, told reporters today that "there is nothing to stop those
gains of domestic equities to continue."
</P>
<P>
But Oliver could not anticipate how much the share market would
increase after it surpassed 2700 points on Friday and the U.S. Dow
Jones industrial index average lifted 19.45 points to 7796.15, the
Australian Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that economic data due out in the week would not
have a major impact on financial markets, but hesitancy could
begin to emerge in early July ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether the Federal Reserve of Australia will
raise interest rates again," he added.
</P>
<P>
Economists forecast yesterday that job vacancy figures would be
at any point between a fall of 5 percent and a gain of 4.5 percent
after it dropped 0.9 percent in the month of May.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar is likely to show little movement in the
coming week, having stabilized around 75 U.S. cents after dipping
on speculation about a monetary policy of easing, economists said.
</P>
<P>
According to an analysis by the Colonial State Bank, "with an
absence of factors driving the currency higher, the Australian
dollar may fluctuate between 74.5--75 U.S. cents over the week."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 75.13 U.S. cents Friday from
74.77 at the previous close and the All Ordinaries Index rose by
19.3 points to reach another record closing high of 2712.6.

<HEADLINE> Iran Trains 10,000 AIDS Counselors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran will have 10,000 AIDS
prevention counselors by the end of this Iranian calendar year
(March 20, 1998), the Persian daily Kar-o-Karegar reported today
</P>
<P>
This is part of the Iranian government's effort to prevent the
spread of the AIDS disease, Bahram Yeganeh, Secretary of the
Committee on Campaign against AIDS, was quoted as saying by the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 public health employees, psychiatrists and
specialists on infectious diseases have taken part in training
these people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Health Minister Ali Reza Marandi said last week that
only 1,047 people have been identified as HIV-positive in Iran
which has a population of 62 million.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 to 80 percent of the AIDS patients have acquired the
disease through sexual intercourse, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the blood and other biological products
offered through Iran's blood banks were contaminated with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have any problem in this regard. These products
are completely screened. They are especially free from AIDS
contamination," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Despite government attempts to educate the people through
AIDS counseling, health experts here have repeatedly criticized
the government's reluctance to use the mass media to inform the
people of ways to prevent the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The discussion of AIDS, especially its transmission through
sexual intercourse, is usually hushed in the mass media here.
</P>
<P>
The government-run radio and TV rarely discuss ways to
prevent the transmission of AIDS through sexual intercourse,
including the use of condoms, although condoms are imported by
Iran and openly sold at pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, 122 Iranians were killed by AIDS so
far.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- India is planning to manufacture
its own air defense ship (ADS), a smaller version of an aircraft
carrier, defense sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The move is in line with India's policy of achieving maximum
localization and enhancing self-reliance in a phased manner.
</P>
<P>
India's first aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, was decommissioned
earlier this year. The other aircraft carrier, INS Viraat, would
also be non-operational for a certain period once the proposal for
its modernization is sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
India has decided against going in for the Russian aircraft
carrier, Gorshkov, as it was not being offered at a price which
could suit the country's budget, the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
A defense ship, which is much cheaper than an aircraft carrier,
is a faster and agile vessel suitable for operational needs in the
region, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Meguid Urges Israel to Halt Settlement Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Before leaving for New York for the
a U.N. meeting, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel Meguid
today urged Israel to halt settlement construction to help resume
the stalled Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Israel should stop its provocative practices against the
Palestinians," Meguid told reporters before his departure this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader said that he will meet with a number of
participants of the summit and the representatives of
U.N. Security Council members to explore ways to patch up the
staggering peace march.
</P>
<P>
The settlements have been a focal point of a three-month-old
crisis in the Palestinian-Israeli peace track that derailed in
March when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meguid told reporters that he carries a letter signed by both
the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to the
chairman of the U.N. Security Council on Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
The letter involves some proposals and resolutions adopted to
settle the row over the trial of two Libyans suspected of
involvement in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Libya is under a U.N.-imposed air-traffic ban because of its
refusal to surrender the two men for trial in the U.S. and
Britain. Libya has been insisting that the men be tried in some
other country.
</P>
<P>
The recent OAU summit supports the Libyan proposals on ending
the dispute by conducting the trial in any country other than
Britain and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Meguid pointed out that he will also hold talks with
representatives of Security Council members and the U.N. Arab
group on the latest developments of the situation in Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
received here Saturday a message of invitation from Iranian
President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to attend the 8th
Conference of the Organization of Islamic Conference due in
Tehran late this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported today that the message was sent
in a letter handed over to the Iraqi president by the visiting
Iranian envoy Ali Reza Marandi.
</P>
<P>
Marandi, also minister of health and medical care, wound up his
three-day visit here and left for home this morning.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Rafsanjani also conveyed his country's
willingness to promote relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, long-term foes in the Gulf region, fought an
eight-year war from 1980 to 1988. They resumed their diplomatic
relations in 1990 at the height of the Gulf Crisis, which was
triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, their relations are far from normal because the two
neighbors have been embroiled in disputes over the exchange of
prisoners of the protracted eight-year war and the return of Iraqi
planes which flew to Iran during the 1991 Gulf War to avoid the
attacks by the U.S.-led allies against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> No Cyprus Solution by This Fall: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- No solution to the protracted
Cyprus problem should be expected by Autumn this year, when the
first three rounds of direct talks are concluded, Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides said here today.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides was commenting on Saturday's press reports
that the U.S. and the United Kingdom expect that an agreement can
be reached on Cyprus problem by this Autumn.
</P>
<P>
Clerides told reporters that direct talks are expected to be
suspended in view of February 1998 presidential elections in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, President Clerides said he expects some developments
on the Cyprus issue in 1998, when a U.S. State Department team
will actively involved in efforts for a solution of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Radio Saturday quoted a Greek high-ranking diplomatic
source in New York as saying that the U.S. and Britain expect a
high level agreement to be reached by Autumn 1997 between Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, at their U.N.-sponsored
face-to-face talks, scheduled to begin on July 9, near New York.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Radio also reported today that the U.S. and Britain
were trying to coordinate their efforts for a set of ideas which
they will promote through the U.N. during the forthcoming direct
talks.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, it added, the newly-appointed
U.S. Presidential Emissary Richard Holbrooke had a meeting
Saturday in London with Britain's special envoy for Cyprus, Sir
David Hannay.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after Turkish troops occupied the
northern third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Warships Withdraw from Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The four Nigerian warships stationed off
the coast of Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, have retreated from
S.Leone's territorial waters, according to a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal, which took place on Friday, came against the
background of three-hour closed door talks between Sierra Leone's
military junta and a high-level Ghanaian delegation to resolve the
crisis since the May 25 coup that toppled the 14-month-old
civilian government in S.Leone.
</P>
<P>
Details of the meeting have not been disclosed but the report said
Ghana is against military option in ending the impasse in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Victo Begho, who led the
four-man delegation in Freetown, was reported as warning that military
approach would be catastrophic for the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The warships might have been withdrawn in
order to give a conducive atmosphere for the crisis to be resolved by
negotiation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The warships arrived in Freetown in the wake of the coup when
troops of the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG were
sent to take hold of the seaport and international airport in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite ECOMOG's military buildup, a constant reminder of the use
of force to restore the civilian government in Sierra Leone, west
African leaders maintain their desire to resolve the crisis by
peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Disagrees With Drastic Actions Over Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today expressed
support for efforts by the G7 developed nations to ensure that the
feuding factions in Bosnia abide by the Dayton peace accord signed
two years ago, but said it disagrees with actions which are too
drastic like ending economic aid.
</P>
<P>
Economic sanctions could undermine Bosnia's stability, Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said when asked to comment on a
warning from the G7 yesterday to cut off economic aid to Bosnia
unless the feuding factions there made a greater commitment to
lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
"Without aid, the people there will continue to live in abject
poverty and become weak, thus triggering chaos," Abdullah was
quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying in
Kuala Kangsar, about 250 kilometers north of here.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides stern action, the situation in the Balkan
state needs monitoring to prevent it from reverting to political
disunity.
</P>
<P>
Leaders at the G7 summit in Denver yesterday passed a
resolution asking the authorities in Bosnia to uphold fully the
right of refugees and displaced persons to return to their
homeland in a peaceful and orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian factions were also required to turn over
individuals indicted for war crimes to the International Criminal
Tribunal.

<HEADLINE> India to Ban Azo Dyes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A ban on the use of azo dyes in
the country will come into effect on June 23 this year, a
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The India Ministry of Environment has imposed the ban as part
of its effort to protect public health and the environment. The
use of azo dyes, widely utilized for dyeing natural and synthetic
fibers, leather, plastics, oils, fats, waxes, straw, timber, paper
and food items, is banned through a gazette notification issued by
the government on March 26 this year. The government had said the
ban would take effect 90 days after the issuance of the
notification.
</P>
<P>
The azo dyes are said to cause cancer and to be detrimental to
public health. The ban, which would be applicable throughout the
country, includes all substances containing these dyes, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Worst Yet to Come in Battle Against AIDS: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The worst is still to come in the
worldwide fight against AIDS, a World Health Organization (WHO)
expert warned at an international AIDS conference in Melbourne
today.
</P>
<P>
Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS at the WHO, told the
conference that there has been a dramatic increase in the number
of people living with AIDS in South and Southeast Asia and the
Pacific region, from 3 million in 1995 to 5 million last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 8,500 people, including about 1,000 children, become
infected with the HIV virus every day around the world, said Piot,
a Belgian microbiologist who has worked in the HIV-AIDS field for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Piot told the three-day International AIDS Impact Conference
that 1.5 million people died from AIDS last year, accounting for a
quarter of all AIDS deaths since the beginning of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Half of new HIV infections globally involve women and the virus
is now "largely a heterosexually driven epidemic" internationally,
Piot said.
</P>
<P>
The official said about 23 million people worldwide are living
with HIV but not all countries are responding appropriately.
</P>
<P>
He warned that complacency is developing as new drugs and
treatments are discovered and some countries are denying the
existence of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Piot explained that new treatments shown to improve and extend
the lives of HIV sufferers are too costly for most sufferers in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
While these are a major breakthrough, resistance is developing
against new drugs and there is a race to continually improve them.
</P>
<P>
A vaccine against HIV infections is "dearly needed," but there
is still a long way to go before this is achieved, he noted.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The African Development
Bank (ADB) pledged to provide 14.5 million US Dollars for the
Tanzanian Livestock Marketing Project covering 11 regions of the

</P>
<P>
The project is aimed to improve the volume and quality of meat

<HEADLINE> Poetry Reading Marks Return of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A poetry reading was held today in
Nanjing, the capital city of Jiangsu Province in east China to
greet the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The reading took place at Jinghai Temple, where the "Nanking
Treaty" was signed in 1842, when the Qing government ceded Hong
Kong to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The action is meant to remind the Chinese people that "lagging
behind other nations provides opportunities for foreign
aggression," said film director Xie Jin, who got actors and
actresses from the film "Opium War" to attend the reading. Three
actors recited a poem to express their joy over the return of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hui, a 69-year-old artist, recited the poem "Expecting
the Return of Spring", and said, "I felt so confident and was
excited to recite the poem, because I know that my country has
been becoming increasingly strong."
</P>
<P>
The reading was organized by the Jiangsu Writers' Association,
Jiangsu Television Station, and other units.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong-related Data (1): How Did HK Question Arise? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong question was the
result of the three unequal treaties signed by the Qing government
of China under coercion by the British imperialists.
</P>
<P>
On August 29, 1842, Britain forced the Qing government to sign
the Treaty of Nanking on ending the Opium War. The Qing government
was thereby compelled to permanently cede Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
In 1856, British and French allied forces launched the Second
Opium War, forcing the Qing government to sign the Treaty of
Peking on October 24, 1860. The Qing government was compelled to
permanently cede the Chinese territory south of the Boundary
Street on Kowloon Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, 1898, exploiting China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese
War and the establishment of "spheres of influence" in China by
foreign powers, Britain again forced the Qing government to sign
the Convention Regarding an Extension of the Hong Kong Territory,
"leasing" areas south of Shenzhen River and north of the Boundary
Street and more than 200 nearby isles (commonly called the "New
Territories", which comprise roughly 91 percent of the total area
of the Hong Kong region) for a term of 99 years until 1997.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong-related Data (2): HK Is Not a Colony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Up to the present, Britain has
ruled Hong Kong in a typical colonial fashion. However, this does
not mean Hong Kong is a colony.
</P>
<P>
A colony usually refers to a country that has lost its
sovereignty as a result of foreign rule and administration.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong is part of the Chinese territory, the concept
of colony is not applicable to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Soon after China resumed her membership in the United Nations,
Huang Hua, then Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, wrote to
the chairman of UN Non-Colonization Special Committee on March 8,
1972, declaring, "The Hong Kong and Macao questions are left over
from history, the result of a series of unequal treaties imposed
on China by imperialism. Hong Kong and Macao are component parts
of the Chinese territory occupied by Britain and Portugal
respectively. The settlement of the Hong Kong and Macao questions
is a matter of China's sovereign right. By no means do Hong Kong
and Macao fall within the usual category of 'colony'."
</P>
<P>
The stand of the Chinese government on the question of Hong
Kong has won extensive international support. In November 1972,
the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution by a vote of 99 to 5
to exclude Hong Kong and Macao from the list of colonies.

NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A leading voluntary agency in
India's capital, New Delhi, has launched a week-long awareness
campaign here in an effort to fight against drug and liquor abuse.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi-based Association of National Brotherhood for Social

<HEADLINE> Australia's Housing Market Remains Subdued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's housing market
remained subdued in April, with the number of first home buyers
falling ahead of the federal May budget and interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Agents have reported that the number of properties listed for
sale was either stable or down slightly for the month of April
while levels of inquiry were mostly unchanged, the Real Estate
Institute of Australia (REIA) said in a news release today.
</P>
<P>
But prices and rents rose slightly in most cities, sustaining a
steady increase in the past year in all mainland states and
territories, except Canberra.
</P>
<P>
REIA President Don Brindley said uncertainly in the lead-up to
the May budget contributed to the subdued market activity and he
called on the Reserve Bank of Australia to keep interest rates low
to allow the market to strengthen.
</P>
<P>
He said home loan affordability was at its highest level in
years and that housing oversupplies, which previously kept prices
weak, were nearly exhausted.
</P>
<P>
The 8.8-percent unemployment rate and high job uncertainty had
led to subdued confidence along with the federal budget, he said.
"Consumers were hoping for definitive vision and direction in the
May budget."
</P>
<P>
It has now been left to the Reserve Bank to provide the impetus
needed to encourage stronger economic growth in the country, he
added.

ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign secretaries of Pakistan
and India began this morning a final "crucial" session of their
current round of talks which is scheduled to conclude here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are going for a final session that should be a make or mar
session," Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed told the
press before the start of the meeting.
</P>

Meanwhile, Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haider, who is

<HEADLINE> "It Will Be The Most Exciting Moment in My Life:" HK Barrister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Henry Hu, 77, will be among some
4,000 dignitaries at the historic handover ceremony to be held at
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center Extension at the
midnight of June 30.
As a member of society, the veteran barrister said, "it will be
the most exciting moment in my life to see the end of colonial
rule in Hong Kong and its return to the embrace of the
motherland."
</P>
<P>
In December 1984, Henry Hu personally witnessed the signing of
the Sino-British Joint Declaration in the Great hall of the People
in Beijing.
Moreover, as a government diplomat, he witnessed at the surrender
of the Japanese in 1945 and was also very excited, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the transitional period of more than 10 years, he
said, in spite of those twists and turns, "the sweeping tides of
the handover can't be held back by grains of sand."
</P>
<P>
"Now a smooth transition is at sight and I'm fully confident in
Hong Kong's future," he said.
</P>
<P>
His confidence was justified by the Sino-British Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law, which stipulates that the laws
previously in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged
after its return.
</P>
<P>
And in February this year the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) published a decision on handling
the existing Hong Kong laws. In accordance with the decision, of
the more than 600 ordinances and over 1,000 pieces of subordinate
legislation, most will be retained and adopted as the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) laws.
</P>
<P>
Only 14 ordinances, which included those evolving British
colonial rule and some concerning elections formulated by the
British-Hong Kong government unilaterally, and certain articles of
10 others, such as the Bill of Rights Ordinance, the Public Order
Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance, will not be adopted as
HKSAR laws.
</P>
<P>
Hu acclaimed the decision as very generous, saying that it
reassured the people that after July 1 the Hong Kong laws will
basically remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
As one of the earliest Chinese barristers in Hong Kong, Hu has
frequent contacts with clients from overseas and felt that they
look forward to Hong Kong and have full confidence in the region
which is full of vitality and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
With the Basic Law as a guarantee, and an ever stronger
motherland as a powerful backing, people in Hong Kong have every
reason to foresee a more prosperous Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu has been residing in Hong Kong for more than 40 years. In
1979, he was invited to Beijing to attend the 30th anniversary of
the People Republic of China as a member of the Legislative
Council and the Urban Council.
</P>
<P>
At present, he is a Standing Committee member of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), and a member of the Preparatory Committee for
the HKSAR. He is also a member of the Selection Committee for the
First HKSAR Government.
</P>
<P>
Apart from his legal profession and social work, he has spent
much of his time and all his wealth in the Shue Yan College he
founded in 1970's.
</P>
<P>
"Comparatively speaking, I have, maybe, a much stronger sense
of the Chinese nation. Loving the motherland is the right that
everyone cannot be deprived of."
</P>
<P>
"I will continue making efforts to contribute to the HKSAR," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Minister Leaves for New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati left here for New York early this morning to attend
the 19th World Earth Summit, but U.S.-Iranian ties might be on his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister did not make any comment before
leaving nor in a short announcement yesterday about his trip,
second in a year, to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
However, observers noted that the visit by Velayati to New
York will be eyecatching after general elections in Iran, out of
which a moderate president was elected.
</P>
<P>
Whether the Iranian foreign minister will make any secret
talks with the U.S. officials on normalization of the bilateral
relations is much more interested than his participation in the
summit by observers.
</P>

Shortly after the 7th presidential election in Iran on May
23, U.S. President Bill Clinton made a favorable statement
toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
On May 29, Clinton called the presidential election in Iran
"a reaffirmation of the democratic process" and hoped that
"estrangements" between the people of Iran and the United
States could be "bridged".
</P>
<P>
On May 27, Iranian President-elect Mohammad Khatami called
the United States to abandon its hostile policy toward the
Islamic Republic, saying "as long as the U.S. is after harming
Iran's interests and independence, Iran will have no relations
with the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
"Iran will not tolerate any domination-seeking power. Any
change in our relations with the United States depends on
change in attitude of the U.S.," said the 54-year-old new
president.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. severed diplomatic relations with Iran in 1979 after
Iranian Islamic militants occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and
took 52 diplomats and employees as hostages. The U.S. has been
keeping economic sanctions against Iran ever since.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Dinar Devalues Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi dinar fell sharply against
U.S. dollar today, with one dollar changing 1,660 dinars.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest exchange rate for dinar against
U.S. dollar since the first shipments of humanitarian goods
arrived in the country in March when one dollar traded for
1,200-1,300 dinars.
</P>
<P>
Money exchangers here attributed the devaluation of the dinar
to the unclear prospect of U.N.'s lifting of the nearly
seven-year-old sanctions on Iraq imposed for its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Many residents of the Iraqi capital think that the sanctions
on Iraq will last until the next century.
</P>
<P>
The prices of daily necessities in Iraq such as egg and meat
went up consequently. The price of eggs per kilogram rose from 1,100
dinars a week ago to 1,400 dinars.
</P>
<P>
The daily life of the Iraqis has not been improved distinctly
although food and other humanitarian goods arrived in Iraq
continuously under the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal signed in May
1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Iraq is allowed to export 2 billion dollars
worth of oil over a six month period to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian goods urgently needed in the country.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, Iraq and the U.N. exchanged the letters to renew
the oil-for-food deal. However, the extension of the deal for
another six months did not bring any hope for the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Some money exchangers said the Iraqi government agreed with
the U.N. on the extension only because it "has no other choice"
at present.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Encouraging Inventions, Updating Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has started a campaign to encourage local state-owned
enterprises to invent more and to improve technology.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to improve the quality of industrial goods made
in Liaoning, and to better the performance of these enterprises,"
local officials say.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of China's key industrial bases, boasting one
tenth of the country's large and medium-sized enterprises. But
most of these state-owned enterprises have been losing money since
the country started a reform to develop a market economy.
</P>
<P>
"The equipment is deteriorating in these enterprises, and the
technology content of their products is poor," officials say. So,
according to the government, each local enterprise has to bring at
least one new product into production by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises are also encouraged to increase cooperation
with universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
About 4,500 new products are expected to be put into production
in this year, and the province's new industrial product value will
reach 25 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospects for Hong Kong's Shipping Industry After Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The continuation of China's open
policy and Hong Kong's economic stability will contribute to a
bright future for the region's shipping industry after its return
to China, industry executives here say.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Hong Kong handled 13.42 million standard containers,
up 6.9 percent from 1995, statistics from the Hong Kong Port
Development Board show.
</P>
<P>
The total container throughput this year is expected to
increase by 8.5 percent over last year, the executives say.
</P>
<P>
Of the three major arteries of Hong Kong's shipping industry --
Hong Kong-America, Hong Kong-Europe and Hong Kong-Asia, Hong
Kong-Asia shipping lines have had a prominent performance in
recent years thanks to rapid economic growth in the Asia-Pacific
region. In the first two quarters of this year, cargo throughput
on these lines is expected to grow by about eight percent.
</P>
<P>
And marine trade still constitutes the lifeblood of Hong Kong's
economy, according to the executives.
</P>
<P>
As about 45 percent of China's imports and exports is done via
Hong Kong, the region's status as the port of China's entrepot
trade will remain unchanged so long as China continues its policy
of opening up and reform, the executives say.

BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua Daily Telegram today
frontpaged an article, written on Saturday to mark the 10-day
countdown of the return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1.

The article, titled "Great Changes, and Reflections on

Chinese people to fight against foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
Places such as the Chung Ying Street at the boundary between
Guangdong and Hong Kong, the Yuanmingyuan Park in Beijing, the
Wusongkou Port in Shanghai, and the Dagukou Port in Tianjin had
witnessed the foreign aggressions more than 100 years ago, the
article said, adding that they have benefited from the great
changes taken place since the founding of new China in 1949,
especially from the reform and open-up policies.
</P>
<P>
The past history demonstrated that implementing Deng Xiaoping's
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the
only way that helps China grow strong and win respect in the
world, the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Airline Landing Rights Row Rages Between Kenya, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A diplomatic row between Kenya
and Zambia appears imminent following a breakdown of talks
between the two countries over landing rights for Kenya Airways
(KQ) in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
However, a committee was expected to be set up by Tuesday to
see how a revenue-sharing method can be used to end the
stalemate, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian authorities sent a telegraphic message two days
ago to the Kenyan government asking KQ, Kenya's national carrier,
to stop its Monday and Thursday flights into Zambia's capital
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
KQ sources said the row was caused by the strong "attack" on
the Zambian market by the Kenya Airways, which usually makes four
flights into Lusaka in a week.
</P>
<P>
The economic rivalry is so major that Aero Zambia wants KQ to
either reduce the number of its flights or devise a
revenue-sharing mechanism beneficial to both airlines.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has resulted in the barring of Kenya Airways
flights into Lusaka. Last month, a KQ flight was turned back by
air traffic controllers in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held a meeting three weeks ago to resolve the
stand-off, but ended in vain.

</P>
<P>
The Tibetans, Mongolians and Salars all have their own spoken
or written languages. To provide more opportunities for ethnic
people to learn their languages, the province has launched a
number of newspapers and magazines in those languages.
</P>
<P>
Local television and radio stations have also provided special
channels in Tibetan, offering programs on science, the law,
education, technology and economics.
</P>
<P>
To help ethnic people develop the economy and their culture,
Qinghai Publishing House has published 3.5 million copies of more
than 300 titles in ethnic languages.
</P>
<P>
Each year, over 2,000 ethnic teachers graduate from local
teachers' colleges, and go on to play a leading role in bilingual
education in primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province detailed regulations on ethnic
language protection and development.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls on Israel to Implement UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz today urged Israel to implement U.N. resolution 425 to
withdraw from south Lebanon unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the call in an interview with the Paris-based
Orient Radio which quoted him as calling on France to ask Israel
to clarify its position on the U.N. Security Council Resolution
425.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that Israel knows exactly that only through the
implementation of Resolution 425, which demands an unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, the violence in south
Lebanon can be stopped.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister made the statement in response
to Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai's announcement
Friday that he had asked France to use its influence on the
Lebanese government and the army to fight terrorism and search
for ways to reduce violence and find solutions to the Lebanese
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
"I think the French should put a clear question upon the
Israelis about their position on the implementation of Resolution
425 and their position on the peace process, and the French
should not accept new suggestions which could push the peace
process backward," Boueiz said to the radio.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the land-for-peace principle, Boueiz said: "The
Israeli government also knows that the Madrid mechanism as it
was decided and agreed upon is a guarantee to lead all the
parties involved to a comprehensive and lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
"Those who refuse to implement Resolution 425, and those who
damage the peace process by all means are not qualified to ask
why the violence has prevailed and why the peace has not been
established," Boueiz noted.

<HEADLINE> Inner-Mongolia Show "Red Cards" to Unqualified Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Some senior local officials in the
Inner-Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China will be removed
from their posts because of poor work and bad results.
</P>
<P>
This move was taken by the region to stop corruption and poor
working efficiency within the governmental body, local officials
said.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent evaluation of work done by each
department and bureau of the regional government, the senior
officials in the health department and the metallurgical and
machinery-building department will be demoted.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all local newspapers front-paged the news, which became
a hot topic for residents in Huhhot, capital of the region.
</P>
<P>
"Officials should be promoted according to their real
capability and work done. Those unqualified should be removed, so
as to maintain a high-efficiency government," a worker whose first
name is "Yun" said.
</P>
<P>
"This makes the government officials work hard, if they want to
keep their ranks and positions. That is a great idea in reforming
the government," businessman Chen Jian said.
</P>
<P>
The region has become the second in China to introduce such
methods to evaluate the work by senior officials. The first was
neighboring Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
"This will help improve the work efficiency of the government,
and have all government officials do their best," Liu Mingzu,
chairman of the region, said.
</P>
<P>
According to the evaluation methods, each department has to
work out a plan at the beginning of a year, and local government
will grade its senior officials at the year end based on what has
been done.
</P>
<P>
"Whether an official will be promoted or not, or demoted, it
depends on his work," Qin Gang, a senior official in charge of the
evaluation, said.

<HEADLINE> New Lubricant Developed to Lengthen Life of Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A lubricant developed by Israel
scientists can dramatically lengthen the life and increase the
efficiency of machines, especially automobile engines and cut
gasoline consumption, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Made of a synthetic, inorganic molecule called tungsten
disulfide, the new material has the potential of significantly
increasing the efficiency and lifespan of a variety of machines --
from power tools and cars to jets and satellites, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Reshf Tenne of the Materials and Interfaces
Department of the Weizmann Institute, who headed the research
team, said the new lubricant reduces friction between moving
metal parts to less than half of that with the best existing
lubricants and cut wear on parts by up to six times.
</P>
<P>
"Lubricants reduce friction, and reducing friction means that
machinery parts work more efficiently, so that cars, for example,
would need less gasoline," said Tenne.
</P>
<P>
Even high-performance lubricants tend to stick to metal parts
and eventually rub off because they combine solid and liquid
components. This slows down the machine's functioning and causes
wear. But the new material is made of round, inert molecules that
adhere and rub off far less.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, scientists abroad discovered that under certain
condition carbon atoms will cluster together to form a stable,
hollow ball. Five years ago, Tenne's group found that tungsten
disulfide behaves similarly under certain conditions. This opened
a new research field in materials science.
</P>
<P>
Realizing its potential as a lubricant, Tenne found it is
comprised of many layers of balls, rather like an onion, so that
if the uppermost layer erodes, those below continue to maintain
lubrication.
</P>
<P>
The Yeda Research and Development company of the institute has
filed patent applications for the new lubricant, and companies
around the world have expressed interest in developing commercial
quantities.

<HEADLINE> Israel Limits Rights Of Senior Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli authorities has
decided to put limits on the rights of 20 senior Palestinian
officials in an effort to stop what it called incitement,
according to a report of the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified security sources were quoted as saying that those
on the blacklist are considered responsible for inciting recent
anti-Israel violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as well
as for attacks on Jewish settlers and those Palestinian land
dealers who sell land to Jews.
</P>
<P>
Among those on the list are Palestinian Justice Minister
Freih Abu Middein and a number of the legislative Palestinian
Council.
</P>
<P>
The sources did not specify the range of rights to be
limited, but said that the move would not include preventing
those people from entering Israel or from crossing between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities has occasionally placed restrictions on
the privileges senior Palestinian officials enjoy under the Oslo
Accords. Earlier this month, Israel canceled the VIP card of
Col. Tawfik Tirawi, head of the Palestinian General Security
Service in the West Bank, claiming that he was responsible
allegedly for the killings of three Palestinians who have sold
land to Jews.
</P>
<P>
The VIP card enables the holder to enter Israel from the
West Bank and Gaza Strip freely and to cross into Jordan
and back with no restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Falling Imports Could Impair Foreign Trade: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior economist in Beijing
called for awareness of imports, which have dropped during the
past five months in contrast with the rapid growth of exports,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The lastest report from the General Administration of Customs
said China's exports surged 26.4 percent in the first five months
to 65.5 billion US dollars, while imports decreased 1.2 percent to
51.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although it is reasonable to gloat over increasing exports, a
continuous drop in imports is nothing to brag about. It harms the
long-term development of China's foreign trade, said Zhu Baoliang,
deputy division chief of the State Information Center's economic
forecasting department.
</P>
<P>
A continued surplus in foreign trade coupled with rising
overseas investment will help the renminbi rise. In return, it
will hurt the exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called attention to two patterns characterizing imports in
the first five months. General trade imports have fallen while
processing trade has risen, and finished industrial product
imports have ebbed while primary products gained.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded processing enterprises continue to receive more
orders from abroad and are exempt from domestic market
fluctuations, so their raw material imports are expected to remain
high.
</P>
<P>
Tariff reductions on primary goods stimulated imports of such
products.
</P>
<P>
Decreased imports from the State sector seemed overshadowed by
growth in the processing industry.
</P>
<P>
"slackened performance of State enterprises is causing the
import decline," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
State enterprises constitute about 85 percent of general trade
imports in China.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient demand because of moderately tight macro-economy
impedes enterprises from buying from abroad.
</P>
<P>
As domestic machinery, electronics products and textiles
glutted the market and quality improved, demand for foreign
industrial products decreased, zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the second half of 1997 will continue to
drive the economy's growth. As a result, machinery and
transportation equipment imports should increase.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy  by Zhang Tiegang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Washington's top envoy here said
the United States has a "basically positive" outlook about Hong
Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
"We want the (Hong Kong's) transition to succeed. We want the
approach of 'one country, two systems' to succeed. We believe our
interests will be protected. Hong Kong will prosper and China will
prosper as well," said Richard Boucher, the U.S. consul-general in
Hong Kong, in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
A career diplomat, Richard Boucher came here last August from
his post in Cyprus as American ambassador.
</P>
<P>
As consul-general, he is tasked with steering Washington's
relations with Hong Kong prior and after its return to China on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
"Our outlook (on the future of Hong Kong) is basically
positive," the consul-general said in his Garden Road office.
</P>
<P>
The large U.S. business community in Hong Kong, including the
local American Chamber of Commerce, shares this view. A recent
pool of the community shows that 95 percent believe Hong Kong's
economic prospects are favorable.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong "can continue to play the important role that it has
been playing as a financial center, as a trade center and as a
place where projects are brought together," Boucher said, adding
that "the prospect is quite good."
</P>
<P>
In his view, Hong Kong can not only maintain but also grow its
"ability to organize manufacturing quickly, to bring together
international financing, foreign technology and foreign expertise,
and to put together all of these in a package that results in
products that are designed for a particular market, made quickly
and delivered on time and quickly."
</P>
<P>
"We see lots of good factors," he said. U.S. businessmen view
Beijing's offer of "one country, two systems," "a high-degree of
autonomy" and maintenance of Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years
not only as key components of its social system but also as
important elements of the business environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Boucher acknowledged that the United States has a dispute
with Hong Kong over intellectual property rights and has concerns
over some issues after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
However, Boucher said, "Our basic policy framework is to say
that the (Sino-British) Joint Declaration and the Basic Law (of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) are the right
commitments. As long as they are carried out, we think things will
be OK."
</P>
<P>
A total of 40,000 Americans work and live in Hong Kong, and the
American Chamber of Commerce here is the largest of its kind
outside the United States. Last year alone, more than 700,000
Americans visited Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We have found ever increasing economic ties between the United
States and Hong Kong," the consul-general said, "We have very
significant investment in Hong Kong -- 14 billion U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
According to Mr. Boucher, the United States is Hong Kong's
second largest trading partner. Every year, it buys about seven
billion U.S. dollars of goods from Hong Kong and 31 billion worth
of reexport goods via Hong Kong, usually from China's inland
areas, while Hong Kong buys 15.5 billion U.S. dollars of goods
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
A total of more than 1,200 American companies operate in Hong
Kong, including 450 which run regional operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the Americans, Hong Kong is not only a center for doing
business with China's interior areas and Hong Kong itself but also
a regional Asian center, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much involved in Hong Kong in a way it is now and
the way that I think really helps support not only U.S. relations
with Hong Kong but relations with China as well," he said, noting
that U.S. interests "are really no different" from those of people
in Hong Kong and in the rest of China.

<HEADLINE> Stock Issue Helps Mushroom Company Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The largest mushroom grower in
Asia plans to sell stock in the domestic market to raise money for
expansion, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Yantai Jiufa Edible Fungus Co is expected to float A shares,
which absorb capital from domestic investors, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The company, a Sino-Italian joint venture set up in 1993, sells
fresh mushrooms to Japan, frozen ones to Italy and Germany, and
canned ones to the United States.
</P>
<P>
With a fixed investment of 100 million yuan (12 million US
dollars), the company churns out 3,000 tons of mushrooms a year.
They sell for about 16,000 yuan (1,927) per ton.
</P>
<P>
Qu Xiuren, head of the Yulindian County government, said the
company's annual production capacity would double if sufficient
funds were guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The company is a typical export-oriented firm set up by farmers
on China's east coast.
</P>
<P>
"We need investment, foreign or domestic," Qu said.
</P>
<P>
While the county depends on agriculture, its geographic
location has turned it into a natural export base of green
food. Green food is the Chinese equivalent of organic food, which
is grown without chemical fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Located on the northeast tip of Shandong Peninsula, it has sea
access to Japan and South Korea, which share increasing demand for
organic food and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Qu predicted world demand for the company's mushrooms would not
subside because of the low price and high quality.

<HEADLINE> Heath Optimistic on Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Former British Prime Minister Sir
Edward Heath said he was very upbeat on Hong Kong's future after
its return to China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the prospects of Hong Kong will be very good. The
rest of the world believes this," Heath said in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua in Salisbury Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is showed by the amounts of investments going into Hong
Kong and the People's Republic (of China)."
</P>
<P>
"It is also showed by the fact that the prices of stocks and
shares are continuously rising, which means people have got
confidence in the future of the People's Republic and Hong Kong
working together," said the 81-year-old veteran British statesman.
</P>
<P>
Heath, who was the first British prime minister to propose the
smooth transition of Hong Kong in 1997, said, "I always recognize
that, of course, in 1997 Hong Kong would be returned to the
People's Republic. It was absolutely right that we should accept
this."
</P>
<P>
"I think the people of Hong Kong understand the situation very
clearly. They regard the People's Repubic as their homeland," said
Heath, who, during his term of office as prime minister,
established full diplomatic relations with China in 1972.
</P>
<P>
On the "one country, two systems" concept created by the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Heath said the concept is a very
good formula, because it takes account of the differences between
Hong Kong and the mainland (of China).
</P>
<P>
It means the two can closely work together, because they have
acknowledged the different circumstances, which have existed
between them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Heath dismissed viewpoints by some critics on Hong Kong'
future, saying their criticisms are not justified "when we look at
the figures for trade, investment and general development. The
rest of the world has confidence and they would be very satisfied
with the results."
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of the Sino-British relations after Hong
Kong's return to China, he said "I want them to be as good as
possible. There is no reason why they shouldn't. No reason at all."
</P>
<P>
"Now Hong Kong is returning to China. There will be another
good opportunity for Sino-British trade to increase very
substantially. We want to increase trade now straight away. We
want to do as much trade as possible," said Heath.
</P>
<P>
The well-known British statesman, who visited China 21 times
and met Chinese President Jiang Zemin and the late Chinese leaders
Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, stressed that he was really
impressed with China's dramatic changes achieved through economic
reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"The reforms are very successful. They have transformed China's
economic position and this process will continue in the future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The former British prime minister is going next week to Hong
Kong to attend the handover ceremony as a member of the official
British delegation and is planning his 22nd visit to China later
this year.

Guards barred the U.N. arms inspectors from two compounds during a
search for banned weapons, the Security Council condemned the
Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
It said refusing access to sites designated by the U.N. Special
Commission constitutes a clear and flagrant violation of the
provisions of relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council demanded that the Iraqi government allow
the Special Commission inspection teams "immediate, unconditional
and unrestricted access" to all areas, facilities, equipments,
records and means of transportation which they wish to inspect in
accordance with the mandate of the Commission.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that Iraq give immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access to officials and other people under the
authority of the Iraqi government whom the Special Commission
wishes to interview, so that it may fully discharge its mandate.
</P>
<P>
At today's Security Council meeting, Chinese Permanent
Representative Qin Huasun said that the Chinese government
supports the Special Commission in fulfilling its mandate in
strict compliance with the relevant resolutions of the Security
Council, and urges Iraq to fully implement the relevant
resolutions of the Council and better cooperate with the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that the legitimate security concerns of Iraq should
be respected by all parties, Security Council Resolution 687
should be fully implemented, Iraq's sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence respected, and the joint
statement signed by the Special Commission and Iraq in June last
year implemented in real earnest.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against Iraq have already been enforced for six
years. According to the report of the Special Commission, in the
past six years, Iraq has basically maintained cooperation with it
and the Special Commission has also made great progress in
carrying out the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council.
Moreover, Iraq has cooperated with the commission in most of the
more than 40 inspections conducted over the recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, we should consider gradually lifting
sanctions against Iraq to alleviate its humanitarian difficulties,
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Qin stressed that the Chinese government always opposes the
willful imposition and threat of sanctions against a country.
This was proved to be counterproductive rather than serving to
solve problems appropriately.
</P>
<P>
The task of the Special Commission is to determine whether Iraq
has complied with U.N. orders to destroy its long-range missiles
and other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Republican Guards barred the U.N. arms inspectors
from two compounds during a search for banned weapons on June 10
and 12.
</P>
<P>
Following this incident, the United States and Britain
submitted a resolution to ban Iraqi soldiers, police and
intelligence officers from traveling abroad without permission and
to suspend reviews of the sanctions until October.
</P>
<P>
But the Russian Federation, China and France opposed further
punitive measures. After intensive consultations Friday and today,
the Security Council adopted the resolution, sending a strong
signal to the Iraqi authorities rather than imposing more severe
sanctions on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> India to Seek Assistance for Power Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- India wants to tie up assistance
pledges to the extent of 1.5 billion US dollars from multilateral
agencies for its two major power projects and a couple of road
sector projects at the forthcoming India Development Forum (IDF)
meeting to be held in Paris next month.
</P>
<P>
According to an informed source said here today,
representatives of all donor countries including the United
States, Britain, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, France and
Sweden are slated to attend the meeting which is being held under
the aegis of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of IMF, the European Commission and the ADB are
also likely to participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The IDF meeting for 1997-98, scheduled to be held on June 24
and 25, is likely to commit about 6.5 to 7 billion dollars'
external assistance, maintaining the same level of the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
These pledges include grants, concessional credits and loans
apart from technical assistance granted by several countries, the
same source said.
</P>
<P>
As the balance of payments position in the country is
satisfactory, the main purpose of external assistance now was to
obtain quality funds for investment in priority sectors such as
the social sector and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The special theme for this year's IDF meeting is human
development issues, Finance Ministry sources said.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief to Consult on Advance Force to Republic of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today authorized Secretary-General Kofi Annan to consult
with potential troop-contributing countries, mainly from Africa,
on sending an advance force to the Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The move came after informal consultations on a letter sent to
the council by Annan about a request from Gabon's President Omar
Bongo, who has been mediating negotiations between the Government
of Congo and the rebel militias.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after consultation of the Security
Council, Annan said: "I think the Security Council has agreed with
me that the situation in the country is urgent and we should do
whatever we can to assist."
</P>
<P>
"So we will be consulting the governments in the region that
have indicated that they are prepared to contribute to a force to
try and stabilize the situation and ensure that there is a
ceasefire."
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that he would report back to the
Security Council the availability of troops, the structure and
mandate of the proposed force, and how it would be financed.
</P>
<P>
The aim would be first to send in an advance force quickly,
which could then be built up with reinforcements from other
countries, Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the troops of the government and the rebel
militias erupted on June 5, in which hundreds have been
killed. The two sides agreed on Friday to extend a truce for a
further week.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "New Territories" Residents Greet Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- In Yuen Long of the "New
Territories", people from 26 villages of Pat Heung Township are
building a stone column in Sheung Tsuen Park to commemorate the
handover of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 32.4-meter-high lookout tower named "Tower in
Commemoration of Hong Kong's Handover" is now 90 percent ready in
the Seaside Park of Tai Po. Both erections are scheduled for
completion a few days before the handover.
</P>
<P>
The midnight on June 30 will be an exciting moment for many
when China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
However, none is more excited than the residents in the "New
Territories".
</P>
<P>
"We've been waiting for the day for generations, ever since our
ancestors shed blood and sacrificed lives to defend this piece of
land against the British aggressors," said Chairman of the Pat
Heung Rural Committee Philip Lai, who led his fellow villagers in
donating over one million HK dollars (128,000 U.S. dollars) to
erect the stone column.
</P>
<P>
In 1899, the British troops who had occupied Hong Kong Island
in 1841 expanded their invasion toward the north but met with
fierce resistance from local residents.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the local villagers organized
themselves with simple arms to fight the gun-equipped British
troops. After a few battles the villagers lost, leaving several
hundred dead.
</P>
<P>
some 100 meters from the site of the column there is a memorial
temple, in which two black tablets bear 40-odd names -- martyrs
during those battles. For nearly 100 years they have been
enshrined, secretly of course, as "righteous persons".
</P>
<P>
"Although we have lived under colonial rule for more than 100
years, we never obeyed that rule in the heart. We are all
descendants of the Dragon, we are all Chinese," said Philip Lai.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the founding of the People's Republic of
China in 1949, the local residents have been celebrating China's
National Day every year, in their own way.
</P>
<P>
In another township named Ping Shan, which neighbors Pat Hung,
people are also busy preparing for handover celebrations. Most
residents in Ping Shan belong to the Tang Family, which is one of
the largest clans in the "New Territories".
</P>
<P>
Actually the Tang Family started their celebrations more than a
year ago. On the early morning of October 1 last year, a few
thousand members of the Tang Family gathered in front of the
Tang's Temple for their first ever celebration of the 47th
National Day of the PRC.
</P>
<P>
When the five-star red flag was raised to the music of the
Chinese National Anthem, the villagers set off a 15-meter-long
string of firecrackers and queued up in front of the flagpole to
take pictures.
</P>
<P>
Head of Hung Who Village Tang Chin Peng said that Hong Kong's
handover to the motherland is a must and all the villagers feel
proud of it.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Public Fund of the Tang Family spent over
60,000 HK dollars (about 7,700 U.S. dollars) to erect the
16-meter-high flagpole. From now on the Tang Family will hold
flag-raising ceremony on every National Day.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three-year-old Tang Sing Sze said: "The hoisting of the
red flag means a lot to us. Our country is strong and powerful."
</P>
<P>
"In 1949 when New China was founded, some villagers here raised
a red flag to do their part in national celebration. However, the
British Hong Kong Government quickly sent spies here to collect
information and tried to arrest those who participated in raising
the flag.
</P>
<P>
"On every October 1 since then, we presented our blessing to
the motherland in the heart. You can never cut off anyone from his
motherland. Now we can celebrate the National Day in public and
with proud," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1899, ancestors of the Tang Family allied with
people from 39 local villages to fight the British aggressors, and
many of them died in battle.
</P>
<P>
An announcement by the Tang Family said: "For nearly 100 years,
the Tang Family, like other fellow villagers, have always wished
our motherland strong and powerful, wished the historical
humiliation be erased and our lost land recovered. Now the day is
about to come."
</P>
<P>
Member of the "New Territories" Committee for Celebrating Hong
Kong's Return to China Tang Siu-Tong said the great event will be
grandly celebrated in all the nine districts of the "New
Territories" in June and July.
</P>
<P>
Today in Yuen Long District, tens of thousands of people
swarmed to streets and public areas to participate in various mass
performances and competitions, and enjoy the dancing of nine
dragons and 100 lions -- the most grandiose of all such
performances ever held in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Blue Chips on BSE Attract Brisk Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive index on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market managed to move up further by
53 points even after crossing the psychological 4,000 barrier
perceived as a resistant level during the week.
</P>
<P>
It was mainly due to sharp upswings in index-based heavy
weighted scrips and bonus news from Reliance Industries.
</P>
<P>
A select few blue chips attracted brisk activity and cornered
sharp gains preventing the expected reaction in share prices which
had pushed the sensitive index up by whopping 305.88 points in a
fortnight from May 29 to June 13.
</P>
<P>
The initial hesitancy, which led by a hefty fall in ITC, was
completely wiped out as foreign institutional investors and local
operationors started hectic purchases of the front-line scrips
such as ITC, TELCO, Mah &AMP; Mah, RIL, Tata Steel and software
shares.
</P>
<P>
Activity was largely confined to front-line shares which helped
a substantial rise in the BSE sensitive index.
</P>
<P>
The last two sessions also attracted brisk volume of business
with RIL in the lead on the company's announcement of a board
meeting on June 26 to consider the much-awaited bonus issue.
</P>
<P>
The news generated hectic buying in this scrip and other
heavy-weighted shares.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index, which closed fractionally lower at
4,025.41 on Monday, later rose sharply to cross 4,100-mark at
4,148.86 on Wednesday, before settling down at 4,083.04 at the
weekend as against last weekend's closing of 4,029.99, showing a
net gain of 53.05 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index firmed up by 26.56 points to end the week at
1,753.27 from last weekend 's closing of 1,726.71.

<HEADLINE> G7 Finance Ministers Urge For Financial Markets Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denver, Colorado, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers from
seven Western industrialized countries pledged today to promote
stability in global financial markets by enhancing cooperation and
regulation.
</P>
<P>
In a final report to the G7 leaders attending the Denver
Summit, the finance ministers said that much progress has been
made in promoting the stability of the global financial markets
since last G7 summit in France in 1996.
</P>
<P>
They said that progress has been made in four areas:
international regulatory cooperation, risk management and
market transparency, prudential standards in emerging economies
and electronic money.
</P>
<P>
Looking beyond the Denver Summit, the ministers demanded that
efforts to strengthen the international financial system continue
and identified two areas warranting particular efforts.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation among supervisors for the markets, they
encouraged the international regulatory bodies and national
supervisors to reach agreement and implement their proposals in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to assess the impediments to information
sharing and called on the international regulatory bodies, the IMF
and the World Bank, to report to G7 finance ministers' meeting in
next April on their contribution to the financial systems and
prudential supervision in emerging economies.

<HEADLINE> Create Fine Business Environment for Hong Kong: Senior </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Official
</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Denise Yue Chung-Yee, a senior
government official, said she is confident in Hong Kong's trade
prospects in accordance with the "one country, two systems"
principle after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) provides that Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy after July 1.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong will still be an independent member of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and an independent tariff zone.
Investment from Hong Kong in the inland areas will continue to
enjoy preferential treatment granted to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
All this will fully ensure Hong Kong's status as an
international trade center after it returns to the embrace of the
motherland, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Trade and Industry Branch Yue works with is a key economic
policy-making department in Hong Kong. Its major duties include
the formulation of policies on external trade, industry and
commerce, intellectual property rights and the protection of
consumers' rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
In her forties, Yue is the youngest female official at the
director-level in the HKSAR Government.
</P>
<P>
She believes that external trade is a pillar for Hong Kong's
economy and requires tremendous efforts of her branch.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong develops trade cooperation with other parts of the
world and safeguards its own interests mainly through the WTO. In
1986, it joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
as an independent member and became a founding member of the WTO
after the GATT changed into the WTO in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the interior areas of China and Hong Kong has
grown rapidly since China initiated the policy of reform and
opening-up in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"In 1985, the interior areas replaced the United States as Hong
Kong's largest trade partner and are exerting an increasing
influence on Hong Kong's economic development," she said.
</P>
<P>
Yue deems it imperative to increase economic exchanges and
cooperation with the interior areas, study the new trend toward
trade development and assess the impact of new measures on foreign
trade taken in interior areas on Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, she said, the Trade Department set up a special
body to handle trade relations between the interior areas and Hong
Kong, in an effort to promptly learn the latest information on
trade and foreign investment policies in the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the Trade Department and the Industry
and Commerce Branch of Hong Kong have paid frequent visits to the
interior areas in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Though most labor-intensive industries and industries with a
low added value in Hong Kong have moved to areas in southern China
over the past few years, this does not mean an economic shrinkage
in Hong Kong, she said, because the essential part of various
industries remains in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The government will do its utmost to create a favorable
environment for trade and industrial development, provide
personnel training and various kinds of software and hardware
facilities, and assist local business people explore the overseas
market, she said.
</P>
<P>
The government-funded Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance
Corporation, the Trade Development Council and the Productive
Council are working for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
On how to improve the competitiveness of the Hong Kong economy,
Yue said, it is important to attract and train a large number of
professionals, make an efficient use of funds and make full use of
land resources.

for trade and investment and to support global financial stability;
</P>
<P>
--Promote the successful integration of the transition and

their commitment to widely-shared economic growth and development
and full partnership with developing countries.
</P>

and combating corruption and financial crimes.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Argentina suffered a 2-1
defeat against Peru as three of its players were sent off in the
quarterfinal of the Copa America tournament on Sucre, Bolivia on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two were dismissed in a fight when Marcelo Gallardo rushed to
catch the ball after converting a penalty for Argentina to make
the score 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Peru goalkeeper Miguel Miranda got to the ball at the same time
as Gallardo and the two began fighting for the ball, leading to a
brawl involving most of the players on the field.
</P>
<P>
Gallardo and Eduardo Berizzo were shown the red card. Gustavo
Zapata was later sent off for a second offence.
</P>

Eddie Carazas and Martin Hidalgo had earlier put Peru 2-0

Miguel Miranda performed heroics.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22, (Xinhua) -- The following is the gist of an
article carried by Wen Wei Po today.
</P>
<P>
The article dwells on the wisdom of the "one country, two
systems" thinking advocated by the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"'One country, two systems' is a new thinking in the history of
mankind. It was proposed neither by Britain, nor by any other
foreign country, but by China. Proposition of this great concept
was due primarily to Deng Xiaoping," the article says.
</P>
<P>
The article reviews comments on the "one country, two systems"
thinking made by Chinese Vice-Premier-cum-Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen at a recent Beijing seminar on the thinking.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen said, "Analyzed theoretically, the 'one country,
two systems' thinking has two characteristics: first, it is
sourced in an ideology characterized by 'emancipating the mind'
and 'seeking truth from facts;' and second, it is a thinking used
to achieve the reunification of China, a new method for resolving
contradictions through peaceful means."
</P>
<P>
The article says the Chinese government has always adopted a
"seeking truth from facts" stand and principle in dealing with the
Hong Kong question.
</P>
<P>
In October 1949, when it reached the northern bank of the
Shenzhen river separating Hong Kong from the rest of China, the
Chinese People's Liberation Army did not advance further south.
The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party maintained that, from
an overall point of view, it was not appropriate to resolve the
Hong Kong and Macao questions immediately. It is a strategic
decision of the Chinese government then to leave Hong Kong and
Macao as they were to serve a bridge and window whereby New China
could have contacts with the outside world, thereby breaking
Western encirclement of and embargo against China.
</P>
<P>
"Founders of New China, at the very beginning of dealing with
the Hong Kong question, adopted a line of thinking based on
'seeking truth from facts,'" the article says.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1970s, the Chinese government decided to
focus on three major tasks: modernization, national reunification
and the maintenance of world peace. This indicated that the time
to resolve the Hong Kong question was ripe.
</P>
<P>
In using the "one country, two systems' formula to settle the
Hong Kong question, the purpose is to recover Hong Kong on the one
hand and to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability on the
other, the article says.
</P>
<P>
To do this, the solution should be acceptable to the three
sides involved: China, Hong Kong and Britain. Such a solution,
according to Deng Xiaoping, can only be a "one country, two
systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
"This strongly represents the principle of 'seeking truth from
facts,'" the article says.
</P>
<P>
The article goes on to say that it is great wisdom to use "one
country, two systems" to achieve national reunification because it
is a new method, a peaceful method, to "resolve contradictions."
</P>
<P>
"One country, two systems" means that the method of peaceful
coexistence can be used not only in the international arena, but
also within "one country" to resolve contradictions arising from
"two systems," the article says.
</P>
<P>
"The great wisdom of this lies in the fact that the method can
not only allow contradictions to coexist peacefully but also allow
otherwise contradictory things to be mutually complementary and
beneficial," the article says.

<HEADLINE> Closer Economic Links Between HK and Inland Areas Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong to China
on July 1 offers new opportunities for bilateral economic
development between the interior areas of China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since China began implementing the policies of economic reform
and opening to the outside world in 1978, economic cooperation
between the two sides has strengthened on the basis of mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
In the 1979-1996 period, Hong Kong has established 162,000
projects in the interior areas, involving a combined direct
investment of 100 billion US dollars, which make up 56.2 percent
of total overseas investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong has been one of the most important trading
partners of China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
According customs statistics, the trade volume between the two
sides totaled 40.7 billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral economic cooperation benefits both sides. On the one
hand, Hong Kong has provided funds, information and managerial
expertise for the interior areas, fueling economic development
there. On the other hand, the "China factor" has contributed
greatly to the economic success of Hong Kong. Thanks to the
interior areas' vast market, improved investment environment, rich
natural resources and cheap labor, Hong Kong has transferred most
of its manufacturing industry to the mainland. This has allowed
Hong Kong to change its product mix and shift to
technology-intensive industries and services.
</P>
<P>
Economists on both sides held that there will be more favorable
factors promoting bilateral economic cooperation on a bigger scale
after Hong Kong returns to the embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to speed up economic
development in central and western parts of China in the country's
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period.
</P>
<P>
The country is to invest an estimated 300 billion US dollars in
communications and infrastructure projects alone in these regions
in the next few years. Hong Kong is expected to play a key role in
raising funds for such projects.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict the following trends with regard to economic
cooperation between Hong Kong and the interior areas of China:
</P>
<P>
-- While continuing to invest in the Pearl River Delta and
other coastal areas, Hong Kong businesses are expected to expand
their presence in east, north and northwest China. The Pudong New
Area in Shanghai and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
River will be prime areas of their future investment;
</P>
<P>
-- Hong Kong is expected to enhance cooperation with the five
Special Economic Zones, the Pudong New Area and the Suzhou
Industrial Park in developing high-tech and value-added products;
</P>
<P>
-- Hong Kong will take its advantage of being an international
financial center to raise funds for the technological
transformation of industrial enterprises in interior areas;
</P>
<P>
-- Investment from Hong Kong will continue to flow into the
fields of infrastructure and services;
</P>
<P>
-- Large financial consortia and listed companies in Hong Kong
are expected to be the mainstay of investment in interior areas;
and
</P>
<P>
-- The interior areas of China and Hong Kong will join hands in
 investing in other parts of the world and in expanding overseas
markets.

<P>
BUCHAREST, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Teodor Melescanu, vice chairman
of the former ruling Romanian Social Democratic Party, and four
other senior party officials have quited the party.
</P>
<P>
At the national party congress held on Friday and Saturday,
Melescanu left the party after an unsuccessful attempt to purge
party leaders charged with corruption, saying the party was
"stamped with the brand of corruption."
</P>
<P>
However, Party Chairman Ion Illiescu, the former Romanian
president, said Melescanu's remarks represent "the interest of
small cliques," while Party First Vice Chairman Adrian Nastase
accused Melescanu of attempting to seize the party's second
position.
</P>
<P>
Melescanu expressed that he would not join any other party. But
words are that that he may form a new one.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in today's election, Illiescu was elected again
party chairman with 483 votes for and 41 against, and Nastase,
first vice chairman.

<HEADLINE> Price Cut Fail to Lure Car Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- There was no nationwide follow-up
buying spree after a major car maker cut its car prices a few
weeks ago, according to the "Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC) cut Santana 2000 car
prices by 11,000 yuan. Now the most expensive Santana 2000 sedan
costs 182,000 yuan, while the cheapest costs 164,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shanghai Volkswagen Co, a Sino-German joint venture,
produced about 250,000 cars, including 110,000 Santana 2000s. The
ordinary model cost about 100,000 yuan, but Santana 2000s cost
175,000 yuan to 198,800 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The price gap between the ordinary Santana and the new Santana
2000 is unreasonably wide," said Wang Runzhi, a State Planning
Commission official. This is the main reason we approved their
applications to cut prices," she said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts said SAIC had to compare the price of Jetta
models produced by its sister company, a Changchun-based joint
venture of Volkswagen and First Automotive Works. The Jetta cost
about 143,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chang Qiche, an expert in Beijing, as saying
that the Santana 2000 sedans could have fallen lower if the
company had not considered the interests of its Changchun
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaoyu, director of the automotive department under the
Ministry of Machine Building Industry, said that the price cut
range for the automobile industry would be as much as 10 per cent
to survive the oversupply in the auto sector.

LA PAZ, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Bolivia beat Colombia 2-1 by
exploiting its advantage of high altitude on Saturday, reaching
the semi-finals of the Copa America.
</P>
<P>
Marco Etcheverry and Erwin Sanchez put the host ahead with
goals in the first 25 minutes of the quarterfinal. Etcheverry
chipped a free kick in the third minute and Sanchez wrongfooted
goalkeeper Farid Mondragon for a 2-0 edge for the host.
</P>
<P>
Herman Gaviria pulled back a goal in the second half, the first
Bolivia have conceded in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Bolivia's Julio Cesar Baldivieso hit the
crossbar after seeing Colombia goalkeeper Farid Mondragon off his
line.
</P>
<P>
The Colombians, who rested their best players for the World Cup
qualifiers, arrived just a couple of hours before kick off in an
attempt to reduce the effects of the altitude.

<HEADLINE> Sinopec to Invest in Renovation Instead of Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec)
will upgrade its existing enterprises rather than launch new
projects in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec President Sheng Huaren said the plan fit the national
strategy to shift into an intensive economic growth mode.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec has carried out largescale infrastructure construction
since its establishment in 1983. It has five ethylene lines each
capable of producing 300,000 tons and six large fertilizer
production lines. It also has increased refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company processed 118 million tons of crude oil,
48 million tons more than its 1983 processing capacity.
</P>
<P>
It produced 2.45 million tons of ethylene in 1996, compared to
500,000 tons in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The company is expected to spend half its fixed investment on
technical innovations in the next three years, Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
He said the company is ready to increase the capacity of its
ethylene production lines to 600,000 tons each from 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The company would not establish new refinery enterprises in the
next three years. Instead, it is expected to reconstruct current
enterprises to improve quality and increase quantity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the company is expected to reduce about one-third of
its staff to improve efficiency. Jobs will be created by new
businesses from other industries to employ the laid-off people.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec currently employs 650,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Industry Sales Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' industry sales in
the first quarter of the year went up by five percent to 104
billion pesos (4 billion U.S. dollars) from a year ago, according
to the latest figures released by the Trade and Industry
Department.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of the pulp and paper, automotive and
sugar subsectors which registered a decline of as much as 57
percent eroded gains from growth sectors, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
But double digit growth in the cement and electronics as well
as engineering and metalworking subsectors somewhat offset the
declines.
</P>
<P>
The sugar sector, still suffering from over importation, was
the biggest loser with its sales volume plunging 50 percent and
value down 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another loser, the textile sector registered a 26-percent
decline in sales volume and a 17-percent drop in value due to the
low demand for finishing mills.
</P>
<P>
The gainers, in terms of both volume and value, were led by the
cement manufacturing sector which expanded 24 percent in output
and 28 percent in value owing to a boom in construction.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic Cuts Financial Expenditure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic is cutting its
financial expenditure due to a financial deficit of 12 billion
coruny (about 400 million U.S. dollars) first seen in several
years.
</P>
<P>
The country's revenue stood at 191 billion coruny (about 6.3
billion U.S. dollars) for the first five months of this year while
its spendings reached 202 billion coruny (some 6.8 billion
U.S. dollars), said Ludmila Nutilova, spokeswoman of the Finance
Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
Starting from April, the Czech government began its austerity
measures to curb the increasing deficit by cutting its spendings
by 7.56 percent, dismissing civil servants, postponing the
construction of public buildings and cancelling routine state
banquets.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts attribute the deficit to the nation's slowed
down economic growth, unfavorable foreign trade, loss-making
enterprises that count for one third of all enterprises and a weak
coruny since beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Novotna Faces Sanchez Vicario in Eastbourne Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Arantxa Sanchez Vicario battled
through the quarter and semi finals on Saturday, begging mercy for
a delay of the final against Jana Novotna.
</P>
<P>
As matches were delayed two days by rain, organisers hoped to
cram in the final three rounds of the Eastbourne tournament on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario was exhausted after playing two hard matches on
Saturday. The Spaniard beat Irina Spirlea in the quarter-finals
and Brenda Schultz-McCarthy in the second semifinal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She asked not to be sent straight back on court and to her
wishes, Novotna agreed.
</P>
<P>
The final will be played at 1000 GMT (1100 local) on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who beat Natasha Zvereva 6-7, 6-0, 7-5 in the earlier
semifinal, had at least had an hour's rest while Sanchez Vicario
beat Schultz-McCarthy 7-5, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Early on Saturday, Schultz-McCarthy, the eighth seed, defeated
defending champion Monica Seles 7-5, 7-5 in a quarter-final which
began on Thursday and was postponed because of the rain.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, second seed Novotna first resumed her
quarter-final against Japan's Ai Sugiyama which was interrupted by
rain on Friday with the Czech 6-2, 6-5 up and the score at 15-15.
</P>
<P>
As Novotna was three more points away from the victory, she
took the hard route, failing to convert a matchpoint and then
hitting a double fault to surrender a break which took the second
set to the tiebreak which Sugiyama won 8-6.
</P>
<P>
In the third set, Novotna played perfect serve-and-volley one

<HEADLINE> "El Nino" Climate Phenomenon Threatens Animals in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, June 21 (Xinhua) -- The "El Nino" climate phenomenon has
threatened the life of unique animals living in the Galapagos
Islands archipelago, Ecuador's biggest tourist asset and one of
the last wildlife sanctuaries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The sea water temperature around the islands has reached 28
degrees centigrade that greatly increased risks for animals, such
as sea lions, penguins and albatrosses, by chasing away their
foods including fish and other species.
</P>
<P>
Scientists on the spot warned the water temperature was three or
four degrees above the normal and could go up to 30 to cause the
extermination of many animals existing in the volcanic
archipelago, such as giant turtles.

<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The Beijing Meteorological Satellite Ground Station received
a highly visible cloud picture from a newly-launched
meteorological satellite at 13:30 Beijing time yesterday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first cloud chart sent back to the earth by Fengyun
2, a meteorological satellite launched on June 10 and successfully
stationed over the equator at 105 degrees east longitude a week
later.
</P>
<P>
-- Leaders of China's non-Communist parties and the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce held a forum at the Great Hall
of the People yesterday to greet Hong Kong's upcoming return to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- The Memorial Hall of Li Xiannian, the third president of the
People's Republic of China, opened yesterday in Li's hometown,
Hong'an County, in central China's Hubei Province, to mark the
fifth anniversary of his death.
</P>
<P>
-- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun stressed during a recent
inspection tour in northwest China that the area must conserve
water and soil resources and improve agricultural production
conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- The China Great Wall Industrial Corporation (CGWIC) and the
US-based Hughes Space and Communications Company struck a
long-term deal yesterday in Beijing, under which the Chinese
aerospace company will launch 10 satellites for Hughes from late
1998 through the end of 2006.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Eligible For Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The central government is for the
first time offering private firms a niche in the stock market,
according to the "Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
Duojia Co., a Hubei-based textile manufacturer, is the first to
benefit from the decision. It was listed on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange on June 6.
</P>
<P>
The second, Sichuan agricultural company Hejia, will make its
debut on Thursday in the same market.
</P>
<P>
Although a few non-State firms were already listed under the
recommendation of provincial governments before the two's listing,
the market has been generally considered a funding source
primarily for the State sector, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The country's provinces and industry ministries share listing
companies assigned by the government every year. The All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), China's
private-sector chamber of commerce, has just began to recommend
private firms using quotas from the central government.
</P>
<P>
Duojia and Hejia's listing are expected to positively affect
China's 800,000 private firms, encouraging them to upgrade, said
Ouyang Xiaoming, an official with ACFIC.
</P>
<P>
Mushrooming private firms were one of the most obvious direct
results of China's economic reforms in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The sector has become a significant part of the country's
economy. Some elite companies have emerged with more than one
billion yuan in assets each.

ROME, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro said today that Italy was doing the utmost to investigate
charges that some Italian soldiers tortured and sexually assaulted
the Somali people in 1992-1994.
</P>

Scalfaro also asked Italian Foreign Undersecretary Rino Serri, who
would soon travel to Mogadishu, capital of Somali, to assure the
Somali people and the political and ethnic groups that the Italian
authorities were determined to shed light on those charges as
quickly as possible and to punish those found guilty.
</P>

In the past weeks, the Fologre (Lightning Bolt) paratrooper
brigade serving in Operation Restore Hope in 1992-1994 has been

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Water Diversion Works to Become Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- After three years of construction,
China's largest water diversion works is expected to be put to
full-scale operation in early July in Dalian, a coastal city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The project, drawing water from Biliu River 150 kilometers
outside Dalian, is to provide 1.2 million tons of water daily to
the city, said an official in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
The city government financed the project with more than three
million yuan (362 million US dollars), of which 1.4 billion yuan
(168 million dollars) is in loans from the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Dalian is one of the Chinese cities that suffers from an
extreme water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The official said the diversion project will help to attract
foreign investment, in addition to improving conditions of the
city's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the water problem will not be an obstacle to
the city's economic development in the coming eight years. Dalian
now has a total of 6,000 foreign-funded ventures.
</P>
<P>
The city has moved out more than 40 factories from the urban
areas to ease the water-supply pressures, and will move another 60
factories.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city is making preparations to draw water from
other rivers.

<P>
MADRID, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Sergei Outschakov of Ukraine won
the third stage of the Tour of Catalonia in Manresa but Briton
Chris Boardman kept his overall lead on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The stage brought the riders their first taste of the mountains
but failed to prove decisive, as Boardman kept the overall lead he
has held since Thursday's time trial.
</P>
<P>
The heat of the day made the climbers reluctant to show their
strength until 25km from the line in the last mountain stretch
through the sierra of Montserrat.
</P>
<P>
Luc Leblanc built up a 20 second lead but was caught on the
descent by another French rider Armanda de las Cuevas, who was
then joined by Dutchman Bart Voskamp.
</P>
<P>
Voskamp looked set to take the stage until the final kilometres
but he was hauled in by the Kelme team and Polti's Outschakov was
on hand to find a way through to the line.
</P>
<P>
The Tour continues on Sunday with the 130km fourth stage
between San Juan Despi and Barcelona, where a sprint finish is
expected.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Unemployment Rate Drops to 10.4 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' unemployment rate
dropped to 10.4 percent in April to 3.3 million people from 10.9
percent recorded in the same period of last year, according to the
latest labor force survey by the National Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey said, the double-digit unemployment rate in
April is significantly higher than the 7.7 percent registered
during the January survey.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Office, which conducts four rounds of
survey on labor force every year, explained that the April survey
usually registers the highest unemployment figure due to the
entrance of new graduates in the job market.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year of 1997, the government has set an ambitious
target of 7 percent unemployment rate, from the 9.8 percent
recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the April survey reflected a national
employment rate of 89.6 percent, slightly higher than the 89.1
percent registered a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"The estimated national labor force population in April 1997
reached 31.4 million persons. Last year's comparative estimate was
30.7 million persons," it said.
</P>
<P>
The labor force survey said that many of the jobs were
generated in the services and agricultural sectors, with a total
share of 41.8 percent and 41.3 percent respectively, and the
industry sector got a share of 16.9 percent of the total
employment.

<HEADLINE> Eight Powers Call for Protection of Peace in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, Colorado, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations and Russia today called on the Balkan
leaders to protect peace in Bosnia and would face a cut-off of aid
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
A draft statement, which is to be approved by the leaders of the
U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, Russia and the
European Union, urged the implementation of the civil aspects of the
Dayton peace accords signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It criticized Croatia and Serbia for failing to demonstrate
stronger commitment to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to continue to help the states of this region,
but our continued commitment is not unconditional," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was firmly determined to pull all its 8,500 troops out
of Bosnia by June 1998. But the Europeans are reluctant, fearing
that bloodshed may reoccur in the region.
</P>
<P>
European leaders at the Denver summit have expressed their concern
to U.S. President Bill Clinton about the U.S. decision to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton refused to budge. "As the president has
indicated, there is a defined mission that expires June of 1998 and
that's the timetable we're on," said White House spokesman Michael
McCurry today.
</P>
<P>
The draft statement sidestepped whether the peacekeeping force in
Bosnia will be pulled out as scheduled next year.
</P>
<P>
"We support the mission of the stabilization force to help provide
a secure environment by June 1998," it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub has hoped the foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India would
in their on-going round of talks devise a mechanism for a
sustained, integrated and structured dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Gohar expressed the hope here on Saturday when he met with
Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haider, who leads a six-member
Indian delegation in the current talks which began on Friday.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating the Pakistan's commitment to improve
relations with India, Gohar emphasized the need to avoid any
action which could mar the atmosphere of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Haider said that they were approaching the foreign secretaries'
level talks in a positive manner.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the useful exchanges he had with his Pakistani
counterpart, the Indian foreign secretary said that the two sides
were engaged in thorough exercise to devise a mechanism for the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Haider also called on Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"The progress should be uniform on a broad spectrum of
Indo-Pakistan issues including the core issue of Kashmir," Sharif
said. "There should be meaningful progress in the talks."
</P>
<P>
Haider said that Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral had
instructed him to assure Sharif that India "wanted to open a new
chapter in the relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The present talks are scheduled to conclude on Monday. It is
the second time that India and Pakistan are holding such kind of
talks since March this year after a suspension of over three
years.

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb Rocks Center of Belfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 21 (Xinhua) -- A car bomb rocked the center of
Belfast today, which is thought to have been aimed at two senior
republicants who were in the vehicle, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility but pro-British
Loyalists seeking to avenge the Irish Republic Army (IRA) which
killed two police on Monday were under suspicion, security sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Three people were slightly injured in the bombing. They were
taken to hospital but were later released.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place in the tense run-up to the annual
Protestant marching season and amid British impatience at the
failure of the IRA to call a truce to get its political wing, Sinn
Fein.
</P>
<P>
Security officials believe that Loyalist terrorists may be
behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair voiced anger at the IRA
killing of two police in Lurgan last Monday shortly after his
officials renewed contact with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
Blair is expected to spell out his newly-elected government's
position in Northern Ireland in a major statement to parliament on
Wednesday.
