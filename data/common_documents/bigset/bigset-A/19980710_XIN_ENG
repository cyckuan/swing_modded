<HEADLINE> Belarus Moves to Soften Stance on Drozdy Compound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Belarussian government is taking
conciliatory steps to ease tension with foreign embassies over
their residences in the Drozdy compound.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Gerasimovich said
in Minsk Thursday that foreign embassies are no longer under an
ultimatum to move out of their residences.
</P>
<P>
Instead, a special commission has been set up to find a
solution that serves the interests of both Belarus and the foreign
missions.
</P>
<P>
He said the Drozdy compound was the official residence of
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko and new residences
would be provided for the foreign missions, taking into
consideration their demands.
</P>
<P>
Gerasimovich said foreign embassy staffers "have reacted to
the new situation with understanding", the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He quoted French, German, and U.S. diplomats as saying that
they would leave Drozdy only if the new premises proved acceptable.
</P>
<P>
About 10 meetings with foreign embassy officials were scheduled
on Thursday in search of a comprise, Gerasimovich said.
</P>
<P>
About two months ago, the Belarussian authorities asked foreign
missions in the exclusive compound to vacate their residences, a
move which angered many ambassadors who accused Minsk of violating
the Vienna Convention.
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, the ambassadors of the U. S., the European Union
countries, Poland and Japan were recalled for consultations with
their foreign ministries, plunging Minsk's ties with those
countries to a low point.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Belarussian Foreign Ministry issued a new
notice that the foreign embassies remove their furnishings before
noon Wednesday, but the decision was later revoked.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian relations with the West have been rocky in recent
years and Lukashenko has attributed it to Minsk's closer
integration with Russia and its staunch opposition to NATO's
eastward expansion.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Defies U.N. Embargo to Fly to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Thursday, defying a U.N. air embargo, flew to Libya to meet
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak flew across the Egyptian-Libyan border and arrived at
noon at the Al-Abrak civilian airport in Al-Bayda, 770 kilometers
east of Libyan capital Tripoli, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The flight was not announced in advance, and Mubarak returned
to Cairo several hours later.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is the most senior world leader to defy the air
embargo, which was imposed in 1992 after Libya refused to hand
over two Libyans involved in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gaddafi, who was recovering from a surgery to repair a hip bone he
broke Monday while exercising.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi was sitting in a wheel-chair when he met with Mubarak,
who inquired about the Libyan leader's health.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the visit, but it is believed that
Mubarak went to libya to wish Gaddafi a speedy recovery from the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak Wednesday offered to send a medical team to help Libyan
doctors treat Gaddafi's fractured hip bone.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992, but the
president always flew from Cairo to somewhere near the
Egyptian-Libyan border and then drove across it, abiding by the
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
With the flight, the Egyptian president pioneered in defying
the U.N. embargo against Libya.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Organization of African Unity adopted a
resolution, urging member states to ignore the air embargo from
September 1. The Arab League said it is considering to follow suit.

Dostyr-98, which centered on the rapid rescue of hostages and
possible military conflicts in border areas.
</P>
<P>
The Kazak Telegraph Agency reported that in the exercise, the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jobless Claims Slip Slightly Despite GM Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. jobless claims for
unemployment benefits decreased slightly last week despite of the
impact of the General Motors strike kicked off earlier last month,
the Labor Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The over-a-month-long GM strike pushed the average number
claims for the past month to the highest level in more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
The initial filings for unemployment benefits, after adjusting
for normal seasonal variations, decreased 1,000 last week to
392,000, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
That represented the first drop since early June, just before
the start of a strike at GM's stamping plant in Flint, Michigan,
idled most of the GM's North American factories.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average of unemployment claims rose by
19,500 to 370,500, the highest level since the week ending April
20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The slight drop of 1,000 in the one-week claims figure came as
a surprise to economists, who had been forecasting another big
increase given the GM strike and continued adverse effects on
American manufacturing from the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the number of claims before adjusting for normal
seasonal factors did rise last week by 29,110, with 23,000 of
those claims attributed to layoffs in the auto industry in the
states of Michigan, New York, Indiana and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the four-week moving average confirmed a trend
picked up last week in the monthly unemployment report, which
showed the national jobless rate rising to 4.5 percent in June, up
from a 28-year-low of 4.3 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that development as a fresh sign the
economy is slowing under the impact of the Asian currency crisis,
which has cut sharply into American exports to that region of the
world. Manufacturers cut 29,000 jobs last month, the biggest group
of layoffs since March 1996.

<HEADLINE> Operating Oil Rigs Down 60 Percent in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Low crude oil prices and rainy
weather have led to a 60 percent plunge in the number of drilling
rigs operating across Western Canada, a report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The summer slump is the worst to hit the drilling sector since
1993, when collapsing natural gas prices forced producers to cut
capital spending.
</P>
<P>
The number of rigs working this week was only 176, compared
with 435 in the same period last year, according to Canada's
leading newspaper the Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
Wet weather in June and early July left many fields too soft
for rigs to cross, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Numerous projects have been cancelled because of the depressed
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, light oil averaged 15.42 U.S.
dollars a barrel, down 28 percent from 21.56 dollars in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Prices for heavy oil have fallen even harder, off more than 40
percent in the past year for the heavier grades, which are
fetching less than seven dollars a barrel, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Israel Allows Visits to Lebanese Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 9 (Xinhua) -- After a 10-month ban, Israel on
Thursday allowed Lebanese to visit their relatives jailed in its
prison in the occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four Lebanese traveled to Nabatieh, a central city near
south Lebanon, on a coach provided by the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Orient Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
From there, they walked to the Kfar Tibnit crossing point on
the edge of the zone where they were reunited with 21 prisoners
jailed in Khiam prison.
</P>
<P>
The excited prisoners told the radio that they were grateful to
the ICRC for arranging the visits. They also called on the
Lebanese government to make efforts to secure the release of all
Lebanese prisoners in Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that there are at least 75 Lebanese detainees
remaining in the Khiam prison and another 42 in prisons inside
Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the recent swap between Lebanon and Israel brokered by
the ICRC, Israel already released 60 Lebanese prisoners and
returned bodies of 40 killed guerrillas in exchange for the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed in south Lebanon last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has created a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Khiam prison, run by Israel's allied South Lebanese Army
(SLA), is used to jail the captured members of anti-Israeli
resistance guerrilla groups and those who refuse to collaborate
with Israel or the SLA.

Elections
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's former president Kenneth
Kaunda, leader of the United National Independency Party (UNIP)#,
reiterated Thursday that his party will participate in the
forthcoming local government elections.
</P>
<P>
While reading a statement approved by the largest opposition
party's Central Committee at a news conference held in Lusaka,
Kaunda said the decision was affirmed during a three-day
closed-door meeting ending Monday to discuss his declared
retirement from the party presidency.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda told hundreds of diplomats, reporters and UNIP cadres
that his party, which boycotted the 1996 general elections, will
prepare themselves adequately for the elections and they will
"fight to win."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Zambian govenment to conduct a fresh
registration of voters to ensure that all the eligible voters are
registered, saying that the country's Electoral Commission should
be "truly independent."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the UNIP Central Comittee decided to take
part in the forthcoming local government elections to be held
later this year.
</P>
<P>
As for the issue of Kaunda's retirement from the party
presidency, the statement said the UNIP National Council will
meet to consider it and that if necessary, an extraordinary
congress will be held to make a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was released on June 1 after five months of detention
for alledged involvement in the country's foiled military coup
last October.
</P>
<P>
He later declared at a news briefing that he is seriouly
considering quitting from Zambia's active party politics.
</P>
<P>
His retirement is believed to be part of a package concluded
between the govenment and Kaunda's family to set the 74 year-old
former president free.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Back Home From 3-Nation Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has returned home Thursday afternoon after a four-day regional
tour which took him to Eritrea, Ethiopia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
His trip to the Horn of Africa is deemed as a fresh effort
toward ending the armed border conflict between Eritrea and
Ethiopia, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
During this visit, the president held talks with Eritrean
President Issaias Afeworki, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
and South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders, Museveni
reiterated Uganda's stance on their border dispute, hoping both
sides can overcome their differences and resolve the issue
through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds have died since the long-running border disagreement
boiled over into a bloody conflict on May 6.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports of significant fighting since June
11, but witnesses say that both sides have been building up their
troops and artillery along the front line.
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, Museveni is estimated to have also exchanged
views with Mandela on the Burundi issue, the situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria as well as the
Ethio-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
A South African diplomat was quoted as saying Wednesday that
Museveni is trying to solicit support from the South Africans and
especially President Mandela for a peace initiative aimed at
ending the conflict in the Horn of Africa.
</P>

Museveni was accompanied by First Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya Kategaya during the visit.

<HEADLINE> IMF Mission to Brief G-8 of Pak Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Paul Chabrier, head of an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission, said here Thursday they
will brief both G-8 countries and IMF Executive Board of a major
financial crisis Pakistan is likely to face due to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference with Pakistani Finance
Minister Sartaj Aziz, Chabrier said he will report to the
executive directors of the G-8 countries Monday in Washington that
unless the ESAF/EFF (Extended Structural Adjustment
Facility/Extended Fund Facility) program is activated quickly,
Pakistan will be left with few options to handle the looming
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chabrier further said the implementation of economic reforms
program and policy performance was satisfactory and Pakistan had
met all the targets till June 1998, agreed under ESAF and EFF
program.
</P>
<P>
The IMF representative, who is here as head of the IMF
fact-finding mission after Pakistan's detonation of nuclear
devices at the end of May, said the purpose of the current visit
was to assess the changed environment in the wake of sanctions and
response of the government in this peculiar economic situation.
</P>
<P>
"Sending of this mission by the IMF in this respect is quite
normal," he said. "We were not in direct contact with the
authorities when the sanctions were imposed and it is quite normal
that, given the close relationship we have for so many years with
Pakistan, we sent a mission to look at the facts."
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani government explained what is the position
and on the basis of these facts this review will be reported to
the IMF management and executive directors on the Board.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said on the occasion that at the time of drawing up the
national budget for 1998-99, it was not indicated if the sanctions
would also apply to international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the current economic deterioration was not
due to any change in underlying fundamentals of the economy which
had, in fact, improved substantially in 1997-98, but due primarily
to exogenous factors, arising from the negative impact of
sanctions on inflows from donors and the resulting crisis of
confidence which is affecting private sector inflows.
</P>
<P>
Suspension of inflows from the IMF as part of the ESAF/EFF will
affect the balance of payments both directly and indirectly as
other multilateral agencies like the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank have also linked their support to the resumption
of the program, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister urged the international financial
institutions to activate program and project financing to Pakistan
as the country has met all conditionalities during 1997-98 fiscal
year set by the IMF.

against Croatia which France won 2-1.
</P>
<P>
At the 74th minute, Blanc pushed Croatian defender Slaven Bilic
in the face and got the red card.
</P>
<P>
French coach Aime Jacquet said earlier on Thursday he would
appeal to FIFA over the sending-off because he felt it was unfair.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA ruled out any appeal when it announced the sanction on
Blanc.
</P>
<P>
A red card means an automatic suspension of one game, with any
additional sanction up to FIFA's disciplinary committee.
</P>
<P>
Blanc will now miss the World Cup final match as well as the
first qualifying gme for the 2000 European Championship.

<HEADLINE> Food Shortage Threatens 38 Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of countries facing food
shortage across the world have increased to 38 compared with 31
toward the end of last year, mainly due to the El Nino.
</P>
<P>
Among the countries facing food shortage, 20 are in Africa,
according to the latest issue of Food Outlook published by the
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
In Africa, the food shortage has stemmed from the recent
droughts followed by floods im most of eastern Africa, coupled
with civil strife in some of the countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Somalia, the food supply situation will remain extremely
tight until the next harvest beginning next month following the
worst floods in decades. The floods have also resulted in the
loss of livestock and outbreak of animal diseases.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, food assistance continues to be distributed to those
affected by severe floods in the eastern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Emergency food assistance is still required for some 400,000
displaced people in the north of Uganda affected by continuing
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, food shortage is also experienced in some areas
due to heavy rains and floods.
</P>
<P>
In Ethiopia, food aid is needed by over five million people
while in Eritrea, following two successive reduced cereal harvests,
the overall food supply is tight, and food prices have soared up
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Despite an overall satisfactory harvest in Sudan, the food
situation there is critical for some 2.4 million people affected
by civil strifes and droughts. The distribution of food aid are
hampered by insecurity and poor road conditions.
</P>
<P>
In Burundi, the food situation has deteriorated as a result of
a decline in the 1998 first season food crop production and the
continuing economic embargo by neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The food supply situation in Rwanda is also tight due to a
reduced 1998 first season harvest and insecurity in western areas
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural production is improving in Liberia and Sierra
Leone but both still need international food assistance. The
tense security situation in the east and north of Sierra Leone is
leaving large population displaced and is disrupting all
agricultural activities in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Senegal, Mauritania, the Gambia and Burkina Faso, Niger and
the Democratic Republic of Congo are also facing food shortage
due to poor harvests resulted from El Nino or civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, the output of cereals is expected to be much below
average as a result of incessant rainfalls and extensive flooding
in northern areas, while the southern part experienced near
drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, grave food supply difficulties persist in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. And severe drought in
Indonesia attributed to El Nino, combined with the financial
crisis, has seriously undermined the food security situation.
</P>
<P>
Some other countries in Latin America and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) are also facing food shortage, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Backs Greece's Proposal on No-Fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said Thursday it supports
Greece's proposal for creating a no-fly zone over the divided
island, terming it as a significant step toward demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said: "This position is part of the joint
strategic and tactical policy of Cyprus and Greece."
</P>
<P>
The proposal for creating a no-fly zone over Cyprus was renewed
Wednesday by Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatozopulos during his
meeting in Washington with his U.S. counterpart William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is reportedly pressing Cyprus to refrain from
deploying the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in next
month, citing that this would escalate tension in the island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government has adopted the Greek proposal for
reaching an agreement on establishing a no-fly zone as part of its
efforts to realize demilitarization of island.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides confirmed a report published Thursday by the Greek
Cypriot daily Philelephtheros that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides had
exchanged letters on the situation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Albright had sent a letter to Clerides
suggesting Cyprus reconsider its plan to buy the Russian
missiles. Albright proposed that the Russian missiles be deployed
outside the island or missiles of a shorter range be deployed
instead.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the Russian missiles in 1997, which are
scheduled to be deployed next month. The deal angered Turkey and
the Turkish Cypriots, who said their security would be seriously
threatened by the missiles that have a range of 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has vowed to strike the missiles if they are deployed
in the island.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides reaffirmed that his government would continue to
stand firm on the missile issue despite the U.S. position.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has made it clear that it would halt the
deployment of new weapons only if progress is made on formulating
a schedule for the island's demilitarization or in the Cyprus
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks have been stalled since last July when the
Turkish Cypriots quited the talks in protest against the decision
by the European Union (EU) to start accession talks with the
Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots are demanding the recognition of its
self-proclaimed "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in the north
and the halt of the EU talks as preconditions for resuming the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urges Netanyahu to Advance Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak Thursday met with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and urged him to advance the peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
After a two-hour meeting with Netanyahu, Barak told Israel
Radio that he expressed to the prime minister his deep concern
about the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks have been deadlocked for more than a year, first
because of Israel's settlement housing construction in East Arab
Jerusalem and then because of the long overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Barak told Netanyahu that it was time for the government to
reach a resolution on the second redeployment of Israeli troops in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Netanyahu to make efforts to reach a peace
agreement with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on the
further withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
According to signed agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, Israel should carry out three phases of pullback
before talks on a permanent peace can begin in mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Barak noted that after Wednesday meeting he knew more about the
current state of the peace negotiations with the Palestinians,
which have so far been kept secret. Israeli officials have hinted
that an agreement was near.
</P>
<P>
Barak, however, stressed that he did not discuss with Netanyahu
the issue of establishing a national unity government, which was
seen by some politicians as a way to solve the differences in the
Israeli government over the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been under great pressure from extremists in his
right-wing Likud coalition not to give back any more lands to the
Palestinians. But pressure also came from the U.S. and the
Palestinians, who urged Israel to decide on pullback soon in order
to rescue the falling peace process.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the formation of a broader-based
government to include the leftists could keep Netanyahu afloat and
pave the way for a deal with the Palestinians on redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Barak and Netanyahu came as the United
States was making intense efforts for an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement. Netanyahu is urged to accept the American peace
proposal calling for an Israeli pullback from 13.1 percent more of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has conditioned a breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations on what he called the PNA living up to its
commitments to ensure the security of Israel.

<HEADLINE> BMW to Stop Supplying Engines to Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The German carmaker Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW) announced Thursday that it would stop supplying
engines and other car parts to Rolls-Royce by July 9 next year as
a result of its lost bid to take over the British luxury carmaker.
</P>
<P>
BMW's move came after shareholders of the British Vickers PLC,
the parent company of Rolls-Royce, last month formally approved a
430-million-pound (713-million-U.S. dollar) bid for Rolls-Royce
offered by another German car company, Volkswagen AG, while
turning down the rival bid by BMW.
</P>
<P>
BMW currently supplies about 30 percent of the parts for
Rolls-Royce's new models, including V-12 engines for Silver Seraph
and V-8 engines for Arnage. Executives of the company have
repeatedly threatened to terminate the deliveries during the
fierce bidding war against Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen, however, has promised that it would be able to
develop alternative engines for Roll-Royce.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes Delinking Clinton Visit, START </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday hailed U.S.
President Bill Clinton's decision to visit Moscow regarless of
whether Russian parliament ratifies the second strategic arms
reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told reporters
Thursday that tying up the Russian-U.S. top-level contacts with
the ratification of the START II treaty, as "propagated by some
circles in the U.S.," was counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced last Monday that he would visit Russia in
early September.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said the START II treaty should be ratified, as
it meets Russia's national interests and opens new prospects of
strategic arms reduction.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Clinton are expected to discuss pressing issues in bilateral ties,
including measures to ensure world stability and security, arms
reduction, non-proliferation of arms of mass destruction and
fighting terrorism and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko will meet with U.S.
Vice President Al Gore on July 23-24 to prepare for the September
summit, especially on economic matters, Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, who were scheduled to attend an ASEAN forum on
security problems later this month in Manila, the Philippines,
would discuss political and military issues on the agenda of the
summit.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Puts Out E. African Atlas of Coastal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) Thursday urged to curb mainkind's land-based
activity from oceans when launching the Kenyan volume of East
African Atlas of Coastal Resources, the first one in the region.
</P>
<P>
The atlas is part of a common action plan on ocean
conservation reached by governments of Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania,
Mozambique, the Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles and
Reunion in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Volumes of Tanzania, Seychelles, Mozambique and the Comoros of
their coastal resources atlas are coming soon, said UNEP
Assistant Executive Director Jorge Illucea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed concern about the sagging world's
coastline and the continuous degradation of the marine
environment due to human activities.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that 77 percent of all pollution entering the
world ocean can be traced to land-based activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have increasingly seen that the activities of billions of
us are affecting not only the land, but also the entire planet,
including the 71 percent of it covered by oceans, coastal waters
and estuaries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the shrinking coastlines, about 6.4 billion
people will reside in coastal areas worldwide in three decades,
compared with currently 3.6 billion people, or nearly two-thirds
of the global population.
</P>
<P>
Partly due to the rising population pressures, in much of
Asia, Africa and parts of Latin America, coastal fisheries are
chronically over-exploited, the senior UNEP official sighed.
</P>
<P>
He called for integrated coastal zone management strategies
which would take account of population growth and distribution,
urbanization trends, consumption patterns, generation of wastes
and the use of available resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he spoke highly of the release of the atlas on
coastal resources in east Africa, also on the west Indian Ocean
region, saying that accurate scientific data is key to the
protection of the environment and sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Fleet to Be Equipped with New Safety Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The German airline Lufthansa announced
Thursday that it would equip its planes with a new safety device
which would be useful mainly to prevent possible plane crashes at
landing or takeoff.
</P>
<P>
The new system is based on a computer databank which keeps a
stockpile of all landscape features. The actual position of a
flying plane will be followed through satellite navigation and
will be compared with the electronic map.
</P>
<P>
Should a collision loom ahead, the on-board device could send a
warning signal to the pilot one minute in advance.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new system is much better than the
existing Radar-based one which can only send early warning of
about four to eight seconds in advance.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa said that almost all planes in its fleet would be
equipped with the new system by the year 2001. The costs are
estimated at about 180,000 German marks (100,000 U.S. dollars) for
every plane.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Says Will Never Withdraw From Badme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki said his country will never withdraw from Badme on the
contested border with Ethiopia and is ready to go to war if
necessary, a report reaching here Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast on the Eritrean state television
Wednesday, Isaias said Eritrea was ready to go to war and face
adverse economic consequences if this was necessary.
</P>
<P>
''Even if the sun doesn't rise, we will never withdraw from
Badme,'' Isaias was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
''We will try to negotiate but if the war is not resolved soon
we will take the unwanted steps, which will have consequences. It
may be dangerous but we will take the necessary action,'' Isaias
said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea rejected last month a U.S.-Rwanda four-point plan
which called on Eritrean forces to withdraw from contested
territories to positions held on May 6 when the conflict began.
The U.S.-Rwanda initial plan was endorsed by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and supported by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
After the peace initiative by the presidents of Burkina Faso,
Zimbabwe and Rwanda and the foreign minister of Djibouti who
shuttled between Asmara and Addis Ababa in June, an OAU
ambassadors committee visited both Eritrea and Ethiopia in
follow-up and will present a report to responsible African
leaders soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ethiopia claimed that Eritrea Thursday expelled 200
Ethiopian civilians into Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The office of the Ethiopian government spokesperson said in a
news release issued here that Eritrea has expelled more than
4,000 Ethiopians since the conflict began.
</P>
<P>
The release said, ''more than 600 are still held in prison to
whom the red cross is not allowed access.''

JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General Kgalema
Motlante of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) met a
visiting Chinese Communist Party delegation here Thursday in a
bid to strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Motlante received the delegation of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) headed by Huang Ju, member of the CPC political
bureau, with the two sides vowing to promote relations between
the two parties and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Motlante and Huang held friendly talks over relations between
the ANC and the CPC and exchanged views on common concern in the
ANC headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
Motlante said the CPC has a long history and wealthy
experience, hoping that friendly exchanges between the ANC and
the CPC would be further made.
</P>
<P>
In response, Huang said the CPC attaches great importance to
its relationship with the ANC, and has been in good cooperation
with the party for decades.
</P>
<P>
He believed that such good relations would be further promoted
after China and South Africa established diplomatic ties at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who doubles as the Secretary of the CPC Shanghai
Municipal Committee, invited the ANC to send a delegation to
visit China at its convenient time.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, with a population of 12 million, is the biggest
commercial and industrial city of China.
</P>
<P>
Huang and his entourage arrived here Thursday morning. They
will stay in South Africa for a week, during which Huang is due
to meet ANC President Thabo Mbeki and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki is also deputy president of South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Backs Bicommunal Business Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said Thursday that he supports business contacts between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a meeting Thursday with a group of Greek
Cypriot businessmen who attended a meeting of business
representatives from the two Cypriot communities in Oslo,
Norwegian capital, early this month.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Greek Cypriot businessmen group Constantinos Lordos
told reporters after the meeting that Clerides encouraged them to
continue efforts in pursuing contacts and cooperation with their
Turkish Cypriot counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Clerides also assured them of the government's full support.
</P>
<P>
Lordos said Turkish Cypriot businessmen are also positive in
seeking a relaxation and eventual lifting of all restrictions on
the free movement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said Greek and Turkish Cypriot businessmen will meet again
on November 16-17 in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Oslo meeting, chaired by U.S. Presidential emissary
for Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke, was a follow-up to a meeting in
Brussels in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the Greek and Turkish Cypriot businessmen
agreed to work together on a number of projects such as the
restoration of the Apostolos Andreas Monastery in the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northeastern Karpass peninsula, and the Halal
Sultan Mosque in the government-dominated southern areas.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
the Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey landed troops and
took over the northern third of the island after a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has reportedly been
restricting the participation of Turkish Cypriots in bicommunal
events since last December, to protest against a decision by the
European Union to begin accession talks with the Cypriot
government in March.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Security
Council Thursday urged the former combatants in Sierra Leone to
lay down their weapons and stop attacks against civilians
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press following consultation on the situation in
the country, Council President and Russian Ambassador to the
United Nations Sergey Lavrov said members of the Security Council
had expressed grave concern over the situation in Sierra Leone,
especially in the eastern part of the country and parts of the
north, where remnants of the former junta continued to resist
international peacekeeping forces and the legitimate government
and attack Sierra Leonean civilians.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said the council condemned the mutilations, rapes,
looting and other atrocities carried out by junta elements and
urged them to lay down their weapons and stop attacks against
civilians.
</P>
<P>
A coup took place in Sierra Leone in May 1997 which toppled the
government of Kabbah. With the help of the international
community, President Kabbah returned to Sierra Leone in March 1998
and assumed his presidency. A U.N. observer mission was
established in the country to support its reconstruction and
rehabilitation.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England brought some
respite Thursday to business by deciding not to increase interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee made the
decision after their two days' meeting of leaving rates unchanged
at 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
There was an outcry last month when rates went up by 0.25
percent, prompting fears that the high cost of borrowing and the
strong pound could bring a recession.
</P>
<P>
The announcement sent British stocks and bonds higher and the
pound lower against the mark. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares
reversed earlier losses and rose 0.45 percent. The pound dropped
about a half pfennig to just below 2.98 mark.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the City believe that the announcement provides
some short-term relief for the UK markets. However, the threat of
another increase has not been removed and the action is likely to
be rather limited.
</P>
<P>
The risk of a further increase in August or September remains
intact, they add.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Saharan Warned of Population Explosion, AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa, compared with
other regions in the world, holds both the fastest growing
population and highest death rates triggered by AIDS, a leading
international body on family planning said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By mid 1997, sub-Saharan Africa has a population of some 614
million people, making up about 10 percent of the total world
population, Xinhua learned from a regional meeting of the
International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF).
</P>
<P>
The region's population growing rate stands at about 2.7
percent per year in 1990s, "faster than that of any other region
in the world," said experts at the two-day meeting which will end
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Death rates are also higher here than elsewhere, and are
rapidly increasing due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic," they warned.
</P>
<P>
They quoted the United Nations Program on AIDS as saying that
last year up to 20.8 million people living in Sub-Saharan Africa
were HIV carriers. HIV is the virus which can cause the fatal
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Rapid urbanization, refugee movements caused by war, economic
distress, environmental disasters, poverty, malnutrition, high
level of illiteracy and limited education and health care are
blamed by the experts on the rampant situation of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The maternal mortality rate in sub-Saharan Africa, varying
from 600 to 1,500 for every 100,000 births, is also the highest
in the world, the experts quoted the U.N. data as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fred Sai, the former IPPF president, estimated that there
are at least 150,000 pregnancy-related deaths in Africa each
year, 25 to 50 percent of them resulted from unsafe induced
abortions.
</P>
<P>
The IPPF currently runs family planning projects and health
care operations in more than 30 sub-Saharan African countries.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Orders Retrial of Killer Nurse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Court of Cassation, Egypt's
supreme court, Thursday ordered a retrial of a nurse sentenced to
death as a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
The court said it made the decision after the appeal judges
found that the the original death sentence was flawed.
</P>
<P>
The nurse, 25-year-old Aida Nourreddine, was sentenced to death
by the Alexandria Criminal Court last March on conviction of
murdering a patient and attempting to murder 29 others in the
Alexandria University Hospital in the second largest city
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
In the appeal, the defense lawyers argued that the verdict was
flawed because it was based on false confessions which were taken
from her clients under coercion.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also supported a retrial because the sentence
was based on "probable intention" to kill, which could not be
taken as premeditated murder, and therefore was flawed.
</P>
<P>
After four-hour deliberations, the court ordered a
retrial. Aida was absent from the session but her father fainted
upon hearing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people packed the large hall of the Court of
Cassation in Cairo, mostly of them were lawyers, relatives of the
nurse and representatives of the local, Arab and foreign media.
</P>
<P>
Aida was arrested last August after doctors at the hospital
discovered a pattern in the deaths of 33 intensive care patients
from respiratory failure shortly after they had undergone
successful surgeries.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations found that she injected the patients with
a respiratory muscle relaxant which caused them choke to death.
</P>
<P>
But the former model nurse pleaded innocent all along and
accused doctors at the Neurology Department of negligence by
prescribing wrong medication to their patients.
</P>
<P>
Aida sustained serious broken bones and bruises when she fell
from the third floor of the Prosecution Building where she was
being investigated, the Egyptian English daily Egyptian Gazette
reported. It was unknown if that was her suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
Her case has sparked accusations in the local media about
widespread malpractice and chaos in Egypt's hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Abiola May Be Buried at Lagos Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The remains of Nigeria's opposition
leader Moshood Abiola, who died Tuesday, may be buried at his
home in Lagos, the News Agency of Nigeria reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, three of Abiola's sons -- Kola, Deji
and Agboola -- were seen earlier Thursday inspecting part of the
grounds of the Abiola home earmarked for the grave, beside the
tomb of the late politician's first wife Simbiat.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Kola as telling a crowd that had converged
at the home that arrangements were on to give Abiola a befitting
burial.
</P>
<P>
Abiola died of "cardiac arrest" at a high-level meeting to
discuss his release Tuesday afternoon in the capital Abuja, the
government announced.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Muslim tradition, the body of Abiola, a
Muslim himself, should be buried in 24 hours after his death.
</P>
<P>
But his body has been kept for a postmortem examination to
prove whether Abiola did die a natural death, as requested by
some of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
An international team of five pathologists from Britain,
Canada and the United States is expected to arrive here Thursday
night the latest to participate in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The body of Abiola has reportedly been carried to Lagos where
his family members and supporter believe there are better
facilities.
</P>
<P>
A formal announcement would be made on when Abiola would be
buried after a family meeting, said Kola.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, Kola also pleaded for
calm and understanding as he said it was a difficult period for
him and the country.
</P>
<P>
Two of Abiola's wives, Bisi and Doyin, were on hand to receive
the numerous sympathizers who came to the home to extend
condolence, the report said.

<HEADLINE> World Population to Reach 6 Billion in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- World population will reach
6 billion in 1999, 12 years after it totaled 5 billion in 1987,
according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
World inhabitants amount to 5.9 billion today, with an increase
of 3 persons every second, or 222,000 daily or 81 million yearly.
</P>
<P>
Global population reached the 1 billion level by 1800, but it
took 130 years to reach 2 billion by 1930. The number reached 3
billion by 1960 and 14 years later, it grew to 4 billion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA announced Thursday that 16 June 1999 will be observed
as "The day of Six Billion" symbolizing the moment when the world
population passes the 6 billion mark, though the exact landmark
date could not be known for certain.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA sees it worth celebrating as the 12-year time-span
has sustained the rapidest population growth, when health and
nutritional standards have improved for most of the world's
people, and fertility and family size have fallen faster than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the U.N.-designated World Population Day,
which falls on July 11, UNFPA Executive Director Nafis Sadik said
that if people can exercise their right to choose the size and
spacing of their family, the world will be on the way to slower
and more balanced population growth.
</P>
<P>
The population group aged 15 and 24, numbering some 1 billion
now, will largely determine the pace of population growth in the
next century, Sadik noted.

<HEADLINE> Uneasy Calm Prevails in Lagos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Life began to return to normal
slowly in Lagos, Nigeria's business center, following violent
demonstrations triggered by the sudden death of detained
opposition leader Moshood Abiola Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Abiola, the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential
polls, died of "cardiac arrest" when at a meeting with government
officials and a United States delegation to discuss his release,
according to a government statement.
</P>
<P>
However, some of his relatives and numerous supporters did not
believe that he died a natural death on the eve of release for
political activities which might bring benefit to the people in
the southwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Many people took to the streets to protest his death and the
demonstrations causing reportedly the death of some 30 people in
the southwestern cities of Lagos and Ibadan as well as Abeokuta,
Abiola's birthplace between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
Some were killed in clashes between law enforcement agents and
hoodlums who took advantage of the demonstrations to loot. The
others died in bloody hand-to-hand battle between two ethnic
groups, the Yorubas of the southwest and the Hausas of the north.
</P>
<P>
The country's Head of State, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, who
sacked the cabinet Wednesday, also appealed to Nigerians to
remain calm.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot police and soldiers deployed in strategic positions
in Lagos helped bring the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
Markets and offices, many of which closed to guard against
attacks by angry demonstrators since Tuesday night, began to
resume business.
</P>
<P>
More and more vehicles were seen back on the streets in many
parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
While uneasy calmness prevailed in most parts of the
metropolis of eight million people, chaos continued in the
western outskirts and one business district.
</P>
<P>
One man, hawking sugarcane in the Lagos Island business
district, was killed earlier Thursday by irate mobs protesting
against Abiola's death, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
Ibadan is also quiet down although total peace is yet to
return as skirmishes still persisted in some areas of the second
largest city in the southwest, the official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In Lagos, Ibadan and Abeokuta, schools are closed until
Friday, which is seen by observers as a measure to prevent
students from gathering together.
</P>
<P>
A dusk-to-dawn curfew is also imposed in Abeokuta.
</P>
<P>
But to analysts, the current calm is fragile because the
direct cause of riots still remains untouched unless the
government could provide convincing evidence that Abiola did die
a natural death.
</P>
<P>
Another question facing the government is whether the military
is to to quit office as it has promised years ago.
</P>
<P>
Now a full autopsy of Abiola's body is to be conducted with
the help of some international pathologists, possibly on Friday,
and a report at the end of the exercise will prove whether or not
the government has been honest on the death of the detained
opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Provisional Ruling Council, the highest
decision-making body, is meeting for the second day in the
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which may have ended already by press time, will
produce a detailed new program for the military's transition to
civil rule.
</P>
<P>
People are waiting for the outcome of the autopsy and the
highest meeting to decide what to do next.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland First Minister Warns of Awesome Consequences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First Minister
David Trimble warned Thursday of "awesome" consequences facing the
province if a stand-off over a banned Protestant parade is not
resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out and this society faces a quite awesome
prospect if between now and the weekend we do not find a
satisfactory way out of it," Trimble told a news conference after
meeting Orange Order leaders in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"There are elements here who will take advantage of the quite
understandable protest the Orange Order have organized in order to
create mayhem," he added.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he and Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon were
still exploring ways of averting a feared showdown on July 13, the
climax of an annual series of marches commemorating William of
Orange, the Protestant king who defeated a Catholic monarch in
1690.
</P>
<P>
Orangemen were banned from the Garvaghy Road by an independent
Parades Commission, which took the decision in an attempt to avert
violence. Since Sunday, thousands of members of the Orange Order
have been confronting police barring them from marching down the
mainly Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
</P>

<HEADLINE> E. African Task Force Formed in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Task Force on the East African
Community was formed here Thursday to publicise the
Community Draft Treaty for Public Debate and Inputs.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Prime Minister Kintu Musoke officiated at the function
held at the International Conference Center, Radio Uganda
reported.
</P>
<P>
The task force is not an arm of government but an independent
body which will do its work without undue interference from
government, Musoke said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that for the first time the public is being
consulted to contribute to the building of a community that is
people-centered and people-driven.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the objectives of the community, people
should promote the balanced and equitable development of the east
African countries, exploit the natural resources prudently and
protect the deteriorating environment.
</P>
<P>
Other steps to be taken include enhancement of the role of
women in social and economic development, promotion of good
governance, peace and good neighborliness and basic
infrastructure within the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The work of the task force mainly covers organizing panel
discussions, seminars and workshops to solicit and secure inputs
into the Draft Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged the members of the task force to
undertake the assignment with zeal and determination so that
people's views can be gathered on time and considered seriously.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Pardons All Child Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's child combatants,
estimated at over 4,000, have received a government amnesty,
according to Vice-President Albert Demby, quoted by a report
reaching here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Demby made the announcement during the official release of an
annual report by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the amnesty, UNICEF officials say, more than 4,000
children attached to armed groups in the tiny west African
country will not face prosecution for their actions.
</P>
<P>
Demby did not offer details about the nature of the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 children have been demobilized from the Sierra
Leone army, disbanded after it was toppled from power in
mid-February, and from militia groups loyal to the current
government as well as from rebels of the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
Demby also expressed concern over "the increasing rate of
teenage pregnancies, drug abuse, child prostitution and other
social problems which are consequences of eight years of armed
conflict".
</P>
<P>
Civil war was triggered off by RUF in Sierra Leone in 1991 and
peace is yet to be fully restored, despite the reinstatement of
its legitimate government in March after nine months of military
rule.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF representative Anthony Bloomberg urged the government
and civil groups to take the lead to extend "a hand of
reconciliation to RUF children to facilitate their re-integration
into society."

<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia urged the European Union
Thursday to recognize it as a market economy and ease anti-dumping
sanctions against Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In talks with visiting EU commissioner Hans van den Broek,
Russian officials said the EU's 13 anti-dumping sanctions have
cost Russia an annual 300 million U.S. dollars, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek is on a two-day working visit here. He held talks
with Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Russia and the EU has been developing rapidly in
recent years. Russian exports to EU countries account for some 40
percent of its total while EU investment in Russia represents half
of foreign investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek, who is in charge of foreign policy of the
European Commission, said his trip is intended to show EU support
for Russia is difficult.
</P>
<P>
He praised the resolve of the Kiriyenko government in
formulating and implementing the anti-crisis program.
</P>
<P>
The Russian press reported that the two sides mainly discussed
the EU's support for Russia's financial and economic
stabilization, expanded exports to the EU and cooperation in
energy, transport, telecommunications and high technology.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Ruling Body Meets on Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's ruling body, the
Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), is still meeting on key
national issues including political detainees and a new
transition to democracy timetable.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started at about 3:00 a.m. (local time) Thursday
morning after a joint session of the PRC and all military
administrators, the official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A member of the PRC, Commodore Anthony Oguguo, told NAN that
the meeting would continue Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting was deliberating on the political
situation of the country with a view of fashioning a direction
for the new military administration led by General Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The agenda also includes the release of all political
detainees as well as the fate of coup convicts, among whom is
Oladipo Diya, the number two leader in the government of late
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Diya, the Chief of General Staff until his fall, was sentenced
to death by a special military tribunal for alleged involvement
in a coup plot last December. Abacha was expected to approve his
execution before his sudden death of heart attack on June 8.
</P>
<P>
Diya insisted that he was framed up by Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press Wednesday night, Yobe State
Administrator John Ben-Kalio said the joint session of the PRC
and state administrators discussed the suggestions made by
Abubakar on the political future of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said a statement will be issued after the final decision is
made.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria started its transition to civil rule in 1995 under the
Abacha military government.
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of Abacha, who until his passing away was the
consensus candidate of the country's five political parties for
the presidential election scheduled for August 1, has put the
transition program at a cross.
</P>
<P>
Since Abacha's death, the country's opposition has been
demanding the release of and handover of power to Moshood Abiola,
the believed winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
But that was made impossible by Abiola's sudden death Tuesday
afternoon, also of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar has been under amounting pressure from both home and
abroad to implement a rapid transition to democracy in the most
populous African country.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Float 15 Percent of National Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece would float 15 percent of its
national telecom, Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (OTE),
in Autumn on the Athens and New York stock exchanges, Greece's
National Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou
announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Papantoniou said that OTE would
also issue a bond in international markets and carry out a share
capital rise.
</P>
<P>
Such moves would raise 1 trillion drachmas (about 3.33 billion
U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that OTE's ownership status would have to be
changed to allow the acquisition by private buyers of up to 45
percent in the state-run telecom from the current legally ordained
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
OTE has already carried out two floatations on the Athens stock
exchange.

<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon has chosen Canadian company Profac to run
its post for 12 years, renewable for another three years, the
Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A new company will be set up, with Profac owning two thirds of
its stakes and Lebanese investors holding one third, to mainly
offer service of ordinary and express mail delivery, facsimile,
and sale of stamps.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will
benefit from mail-handling and facsimile services.
</P>
<P>
Profac is expected to invest 50-90 million U.S. dollars to
modernize the country's postal departments and train postal
employees.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon has signed contracts worth over 1 billion
dollars to rebuild its electricity network devastated during the
1975-1990 civil war, the An-Nahar newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the state-run Council of Development
and Reconstruction said that 47 projects have been signed from
1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 28 projects have been completed and 19 others are
still under construction.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Bank of Beirut, one of Lebanon's leading banks said
Wednesday that its net income in the first half of this year
reached 6.1 million dollars, up 46 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank's total assets climbed to 871 million dollars in the
first half of 1998 compared with 643 million dollars in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Beirut is one of the country's four banks listed on
the Beirut Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cyprus' economy is to grow 4 percent this year as
against last year's 2.3 percent mainly due to an expected 10
percent rise in tourist arrivals, a Central Bank report released
Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry is the pillar of Cyprus economy. A total of
2.06 million foreign visitors visited the Mediterranean island in
1997, with foreign exchange earnings reaching 1.6 billion dollars,
making up 20 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Miners Urged to Guard Against Unskilled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Small-scale miners in
Tanzania have been urged to stop using explosives
indiscriminately so as to avoid more tragedies in work places.
</P>
<P>
Johnbosco Tindyebwa, a government officer dealing with mining
affairs, told people in the Kunduchi Mine here
Thursday that unskilled blasting has caused a lot of deaths and
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Tindyebwa told a seminar that most miners have not received
any training on dynamite blasting and that it is necessary to
form cooperative groups to teach miners relevant knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The Kunduchi mine has over 2,000 illegal miners who are
involved in stone crushing, sand mining and are using dynamite to
blast rocks into gravels. However, none of them has received
professional training for the task.
</P>
<P>
Last month, two miners were killed and a number of others were
injured in the area after a dynamite blasting.
</P>
<P>
The officer appealed to small miners in Bunju, Boko, Mtongani
and Mjimwema areas to refrain from storing dynamite in their
houses because the dangerous practice has violated the law.
</P>
<P>
"It is an offense for an unlicensed miner to store dynamite in
a house," Tindyebwa said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tindyebwa, dynamite blasting during mining has
caused environmental problems and threatened security along the
Bagamoyo Road.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Dar es Salaam City Commission to demolish
houses built in the mining areas since they were built by
squatters.
</P>
<P>
A number of houses which should have been demolished last year
at Kunduchi mines are kept intact while illegal construction of
more houses are underway, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tindyebwa promised to help the mine train four people in order
to curb further killings.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's small-scaled mines are often criticized for their
low safety standard. In April, a landslide resulted from floods
buried alive more than 80 miners in a Tanzanite mine in the
northern region of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state power company TANESCO has found illegal
miners excavating sand under high voltage electric poles with
bags, lorries and caterpillars, ignoring all dangers that may
take place.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accuses Greece of Militarizing Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Thursday accused Greece of
militarizing its East Aegean islands, which it said seriously
violated international law.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry again urged Athens
to "comply with the international agreements and define the status
of the islands."
</P>
<P>
This was possibly in reaction to Greece's decision to allow
American warships to make a port call at one of the islands days
ago.
</P>
<P>
It followed a Turkish verbal note of protest last week, which
said the islands should be demilitarized under the 1923 Lausanne
and 1947 Paris treaties.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of World Wars I and II, the east Aegean islands
were left to Greece under the condition that they should never be
militarized. The was aimed at providing Turkey security since the
they are only several miles away from the Turkish shores.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry claimed in the statement that Greece has
been militarizing the islands since the 1960s and continued to do
so "putting as a pretext the 1974 Turkish intervention to Cyprus
and the establishment of the (Turkish) Aegean battalion."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been locked in disputes over territory,
Aegean sea-bed mineral resources as well as the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Alcohol Could Lower Vitamin B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- One or two alcoholic drinks a
day can interfere with vitamin B levels, according to a study by
scientists at the American Agricultural Research Service.
</P>
<P>
The study of 41 men and women suggests that the blood levels
of vitamin B12 dropped when alcohol made up 5 percent of their
daily calories. Over the long term, compromising B12 status could
impair memory.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also evaluated the volunteers' levels of folate.
This kind of vitamin B helps transform an artery-damaging amino
acid, homocysteine, into a harmless substance. That's important
to health, because high homocysteine is linked with increased
risk of heart disease and stroke. Average blood folate levels
didn't drop when the volunteers were consuming the equivalent of
two drinks a day. But during their alcohol-free period, folate
levels rose and homocysteine levels fell.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Defense Force Urged to Uphold Valour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi Thursday called on the country's defense force to uphold
its valour to shatter and evict the invading Eritrean army.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Ethiopian television, Meles said
Ethiopia has developed its capacity and could bear the burden of
war thanks to the development activities carried out over the
past seven years, the official Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters from the relatively backward regions, not among the
strongholds of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic
Front (EPRDF), have volunteered to join the army and some have
caused disturbances due to their failure to meet the requirements
for conscription, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The attempt by the Eritrean army to beat the Ethiopian defense
force in a situation where it could not receive provisions and
other support has failed, the prime minister said, adding that
the defense force has buried 1,800 corpses of the enemy at the
Tekeze front alone.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, Meles said, will come out victorious if war becomes
inevitable for there is a structural framework put in place at
all levels to properly direct and channel to this end all human
and material resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report reaching here Thursday said Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki said Wednesday that his country will
never withdraw from Badme on the contested border with Ethiopia
and is ready to go to war if necessary.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the sun doesn't rise, we will never withdraw from
Badme," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to negotiate but if the war is not resolved soon
we will take the unwanted steps, which will have consequences. It
may be dangerous but we will take the necessary action," Isaias
warned.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea rejected last month a U.S.-Rwanda four-point plan
which called on Eritrean forces to withdraw from contested
territories to the positions held before May 6 when the conflict
began. The U.S.-Rwanda initiative was endorsed by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and supported by the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
After the peace initiative made by the presidents of Burkina
Faso, Zimbabwe and Rwanda as well as the foreign minister of
Djibouti who shuttled between Asmara and Addis Ababa in June, an
OAU ambassadors committee visited both Eritrea and Ethiopia and
will present a report to some African leaders soon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mortgage Rates Drop to Lowest in Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. 30-year mortgage rates
declined to the lowest level in six months, Freddie Mac, the U.S.
mortgage company, announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The average for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped to 6.91
percent, down from 6.98 percent in the week earlier, marking the
lowest level since rates hit a four-year low of 6.89 percent in
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rates hit a high of 7.22 percent in late April this
year, but have slipped since then.
</P>
<P>
Freddie Mac economist Frank Nothaft predicted that low rates
should hold through the Summer buying season. With various signs
that the U.S. economy is slowing to a more sustainable rate, many
analysts are predicting that the Federal Reserve will be content
to leave short-term interest rates unchanged for the rest of this
year.
</P>
<P>
"It looks as though 1998 will register the lowest annual
mortgage rate in 30 years," Nothaft noted.
</P>
<P>
The Freddie Mac weekly report also found that rates for 15-year
mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, averaged 6.60 percent
this week, the lowest level since February and down from 6.65
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 5.60 percent, also the lowest since
February and down from 5.66 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The low mortgage rates have been a boon to the housing industry
this year. Sales of new single-family homes climbed to an annual
rate of 890,000 units in May, the highest level since the
government began tracking them in 1963. May also was the ninth
consecutive month that sales have been at or above the 800,000
mark, the longest such streak in 21 years.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S Troops Continue to Stay in S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said on Thursday that the United States would continue to
deploy its 37,000 combat troops in the Korean Peninsula even if
the two Koreas were to be unified in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We think that should continue. And that should continue even
if there is... a unification of the two Koreas," he said at a
joint news conference with his visiting South Korean counterpart
Cheon Yong-Taek.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said South Korean President Kim Dae-jung also supported
a continued U.S. presence even after any merger of South Korea
with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops have been deployed in South Korea since the
1950-1953 Korean War, in which the United States was forced to
reach a truce agreement in 1953 after its defeat by DPRK and
Chinese forces.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the U.S. troops were forward-deployed in various
parts of the globe "at the request and with the consent of the
host government."
</P>
<P>
"The host (South Korean) government in this particular case
believes it's in their interest and our interest to have our
combat forces there working together and sharing responsibility
for the security of South Korea," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also argued for the necessity of deploying more than U.S.
40,000 troops in Japan, saying any pullout would create a
dangerous "vacuum" that might "be filled in a way that would not
enhance stability but detract from it."
</P>
<P>
He said Japan in current circumstances "would want us even
more, rather than less, in terms of maintaining stability in a
region that could be unstable without our presence."

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Enact Code for Investment Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The draft bill for investment
promotion will be tabled before the Rwandan parliament for
enactment before the end of this month, sources in the Ministry
of Finance said.
</P>
<P>
According to John Milenge, Special Assistant to the minister
of finance, the draft bill has been approved by the cabinet
meeting on July 3 with necessary package of incentives to attract
investors as well as the proposal of creating an autonomous
investment promotion agency to facilitate the investors to
acquire necessary requisites for investing in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Milenge said that there is a task force in the Ministry of
Finance which has been assisting foreign and local investors who
want to start their operations in Rwanda pending the
establishment of the agency and legislation on the Investment
Promotion Code, the Rwanda News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 World Bank report on Rwanda revealed that "the
investment rate in Rwanda has been around 11 percent of the
national gross domestic product (GDP) which appeared to be less

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a four-hour workshop has been organized in the
capital Kigali by the Ministry of Commerce. The workshop focused
its discussions on information exchange and sensitization of
local businessmen about the working of the Private Sector Support
Fund (PSSF).
</P>
<P>
With a 2.5 million U.S.Dollar credit given by the World Bank,
the PSSF has been operational in Rwanda for the last six months.
It was funded through the International Development Association's
12 million Dollar funded project known as "private sector support
project" agreed upon by the government of Rwanda and the World
Bank three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The project is made up of three components: PSSF (2.5 million
Dollars), IDA creditline for local private Investors (7 million
Dollars) and private sector institutional development Unit (2.5
million Dollars).

<HEADLINE> LIFFE Extends UK Product Trading Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The LIFFE (London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange) announced Thursday that
from 20 July it will extend the trading hours of its UK equity
products.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of extending trading hours is to bring the UK
equity products more in line with the underlying cash market, the
LIFFE said.
</P>
<P>
By extending the closing times of its UK FTSE Index contracts,
LIFFE will create a longer overlap with the U.S. equity market,
thereby providing greater cross market trading opportunities for
LIFFE users.
</P>
<P>
The alignment in closing times will also simplify hedging and
trading activity because LIFFE users will no longer be exposed to
price changes in the underlying stocks after the LIFFE close.
</P>
<P>
In addition, following consultation with LIFFE Members, the
Exchange will retain its current opening times of 08.35 hrs for
its FTSE 100 Index futures and options contracts, said Daniel
Hodson, LIFFE's Chief Executive.

NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan horticultural and
floricultural exporters meeting in the capital Kigali Thursday
decided to form an association known as Rwanda Agro-Exporters
Association.
</P>
<P>
The association, which will be the first of this kind in the
country, has the aim of "promoting the export business and
organizing exporters of horticultural and floricultural
products," according to Evase Nsengima, the head of the newly
formed organization.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of this year, the government invited to Ronen
ILAN, an internationally reknown Jewish exporter of fruits and
flowers to Rwanda to discuss with local exporters on production
and market mobilization for horticultural and floricultural
products, the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The businessman promised to work with local exporters, but
advised them to be organized. Thursday's meeting of exporters
was a response to this need.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda Agro-Exporters Association has committed itself to
defending the rights of members and non-members who work in the
same field as well as to the quality standardization of their
exports and market mobilization.

URUMQI July 10 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin visited
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region over the past five days,
where he said that economic and social development in the region
is significant in the country's 21st century development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited Aksu, the Payingholen Mongolian Autonomous
Prefecture, the Hui minority's Changchi Autonomous Prefecture, the
city of Turpan, and the regional capital, Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Qian Qichen, vice-premier of the State Council
and Zeng Qinghong, an alternate member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee and some local officials, Jiang also inspected a
construction project of the southern Xinjiang Railway which runs
from Turpan in the east to Kashgar in the west.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Autonomous Region's ethnic groups should
hold the banner of ethnic unity high under the leadership of the
CPC and take full advantage of the region's natural resources to
further promote economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
He gave full affirmation of the region's reforms and
development drives in recent years, saying that more should be
done to speed up development and to make the region an important
part of China's economic growth in the next century.

<P>
Jiang also visited Uygur, Hui, Mongolian, and Kazakh herdsmen
and farm families and said that he was delighted with their
improved standard of living.
</P>
<P>
The proper ethnic policies have provided a base and a guarantee
of unity among the various ethnic groups, he said repeatedly,
calling China's new ethnic policy the best in China's several
thousand-year history, and the country's 56 ethnic groups equal
members of one big family.
</P>
<P>
He said that religious practice has shown that the CPC's
religious policy is correct and that the Party and government
should trust and unite the religious believers and provide a legal
base for religious activities so as to adapt religion to the
socialist society.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that a stable society and politics
are a condition for social and economic progress, and that the
unity of ethnic groups can only be achieved by firmly opposing
national splittism and safeguarding the country's unification.
</P>
<P>
New situations require better quality officials, he went on to
say. Jiang also asked that all officials, especially leading ones,
improve their knowledge and their political stance, carry the
Party's tradition forward, and increase their work at the
grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also met with local government representatives, the
People's Liberation Army, armed police, and public security
police, and listened to reports, while encouraging them to
contribute more to the region's development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived in Urumqi on July 4 after winding up his visit to
Kazakhstan where he attended a meeting of China, Kazakhstan,
Kyrghyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan.

June 7 and tens of thousands more became displaced in other places
such as the provinces of Mansoa, Bissora, Bafata and Gabu.

<HEADLINE> China Criticizes Nicaragua Proposal on Taiwan's Status (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government expressed
strong indignation today over a proposal by Nicaragua and a number
of other countries calling for discussion of Taiwan's
"representation" in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said that
Nicaragua and a number of other countries sent a letter to the
U.N. secretary general on July 8 once again asking for a
discussion of Taiwan's "representation" in the U.N., which is an
open attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Tang called this a serious matter and an attempt to trample on
the U.N. Charter and interference in China's internal affairs and
pointed out that the United Nations is an international
organization composed of sovereign states and only sovereign
states can be its member states and that there is only one China,
according to Resolution No.2758.
</P>
<P>
The resolution settled the issue of Chinese representation in
the U.N. in a fair and comprehensively way, and stopped the
conspiracy to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan,"
which the Chinese oppose as interference in China's internal
affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legal representative of the entire Chinese people, he said, adding
that Taiwan is internationally recognized as being a part of China
and that it therefore has no qualification to join the U.N. in any
form.

The spokesman also reviewed the 26th U.N. general assembly in
1971, when the People's Republic of China restored all its
legitimate rights in the U.N. under U.N. Resolution 2758.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Tang said, all committees of the UN General
Assembly have refused to put the "Taiwan issue" on their agenda,
while the Taiwan authorities, going against history, have got a
small number of countries to keep making the proposal.
</P>
<P>
This stubborn attempt to separate the motherland will meet with
firm opposition from all Chinese, including those in Taiwan, he
said. Nicaragua and a small number of other countries, in open
defiance of the will of U.N. member nations, forget what is right
at the sight of profit given by the Taiwan authorities and
interfere in China's affairs, the spokesman said, adding that
their action will end in failure.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's basic policy for the Taiwan issue is
"peaceful reunification and 'one country, two systems'," which was
first tried in Hong Kong July 1, 1997, and has had great success,
he said, and it will be applied again when China resumes
sovereignty over Macao in 1999.
</P>
<P>
China firmly believes that the Taiwan issue will be properly
solved eventually in accordance with the same policy, he said, and
that national reunification is the basic guarantee of Taiwan
people's interests, and they can in this way share the
motherland's dignity and honor in the world.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government announced
Friday that differences over conservation caused the breakdown in
negotiations on salmon between the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
However, the State Department said in an announcement that the
two sides have agreed that their fisheries managers would work
closely together during the fishing season to ensure conservation
of the stocks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two sides agreed to close the disputed boundary
waters of the Dixon Entrance to salmon fishing this summer as a
result of Canada's concerns about the conservation of coho stocks,
the department said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. remains committed to the process of negotiating a
resolution to the U.S.-Canadian differences under the Pacific
salmon treaty for the long term," the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement expressed regret that after making substantial
progress and reaching some agreements the talks did not produce a
comprehensive accord on Pacific salmon fisheries for the summer
fishing season.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate was
unchanged at 8.4 percent for the third consecutive month in June,
Statistics Canada said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Though the jobless rate was unchanged, employment actually
declined by an estimated 36,000, the first significant setback in
18 months.
</P>
<P>
Only a decline in the number of people looking for work in June
kept the jobless rate from rising, the statistics agency noted.
</P>
<P>
The job losses were concentrated among Canadian youths. In
June, youth employment declined by 30,000, with the loss entirely
in full-time employment.
</P>
<P>
The youth jobless rate rose 0.2 percentage points to 15.9
percent in June, after remaining unchanged for three months.
</P>
<P>
And in a reversal of recent job-creation patterns, the number
of people of private sector employees fell by 60,000 in the month
while public sector jobs rose by 38,000, the first big gain this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The increase was concentrated in community services in several
provinces but most notably in British Columbia," the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Says Sino-Indian Border Peaceful, But </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee conceded Friday there is peace, tranquillity and
stability along the Sino-Indian border.
</P>
<P>
During a debate on the work of the External Affairs Ministry in
the Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of Indian Parliament, Vajpayee
said New Delhi was keen to resolve the border dispute with China
by giving a further impetus to the dialogue between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Pakistan, the Indian prime minister said
India and Pakistan should sign an agreement on no first use of
nuclear weapons and jointly impress upon nuclear powers the need
for a complete and time-bound elimination of nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"We should reach an agreement on no first use of nuclear
weapons and together appeal to the nuclear power countries to have
a time-bound program to eliminate stockpiles of nuclear weapons,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said his country was willing to resume dialogue with
Pakistan but there could be no third party mediation on Kashmir,
saying "we would like to solve problems ourselves, bilaterally".
</P>
<P>
Stating that India wanted friendly and normal relations with
Pakistan, Vajpayee expressed his hope that his scheduled meeting
with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the
Colombo summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) later this month would help start the stalled
dialogue between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee reiterated that India would not sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) under what he called the dictates of
nuclear powers and asserted that New Delhi would not succumb to
any external pressure to stall its nuclear weaponization and
missile programs.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT in its present form is not acceptable, he said, adding
that India has already announced a moratorium on further tests and
this should be considered by the five nuclear powers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Denies U.S. Pressure Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet Secretary Denny
Naveh denied Friday that the United States is pressuring Israel
to reach an agreement with the Palestinians over the further
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Naveh stressed that the
U.S. was not pressing Israel to accept its peace initiative
calling for a 13 percent handover of the West Bank to the
Palestinians in the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Naveh noted that if the Palestinians fulfilled their
commitments to fighting terrorism, an agreement could be signed in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was making a
major effort to close the gaps with the Palestinians and the
international community would realize this eventually.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for 16
months mainly due to the dispute over the extent of the next
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has formally accepted the
U.S. initiative, but the Israeli government has rejected it citing
that the proposed scope would endanger the security interests of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have repeatedly warned that the stalemate
in the peace process could lead to the eruption of violence in
the region.
</P>
<P>
As the leading mediator in the peace process, the U.S. has been
trying to persuade Israel to accept its plan so to break the
prolonged deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Naveh made the remarks as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was holding talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa and Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani in Washington to
discuss ways of reviving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries have become increasingly critical of Washington
for its failure to rein in the Israeli government. Reports from
Washington said that Albright once again pressed Netanyahu to
reach an accord with the Palestinians on the redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Six Satellites After Repeated Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday successfully
launched a Zenit-2 rocket booster, putting into orbit six
satellites for Australia, Chile, Germany, Israel, Russia and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The launch, conducted by the Russian Strategic Rocket Troop
from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, was put off three
times in June due to malfunctions first in the rocket and later in
the automatic system which controls the launch.
</P>
<P>
The lift-off Friday was again postponed by 42 minutes, but the
Russian Space Agency gave no reason for the delay, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Resurs-O will be engaged in ecological monitoring,
natural resources investigation and meteorology, the agency
reported, quoting Yuri Trifonov, deputy managing director of the
All-Russian Research Institute of Electrical Mechanics, where the
spacecraft was manufactured.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Australia and Thailand uses Russian
services to put into orbit their satellites.
</P>
<P>
Previous launches in 1995 by Russia of a Chilean satellite and
an Israeli one failed.
</P>
<P>
The two-stage Zenit rockets are manufactured by the Ukrainian
Yuzhmash factory. The ecologically clean booster is believed to be
among the best medium-class rockets.
</P>
<P>
However, seven out of 28 launches of this rocket failed in the
past, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The Russians are now equipping the Zenit with a third stage and
plan to use the new version rockets in launches from the floating
cosmodrome Sea Start next year.

<P>
HOHHOT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A festival of Chinese folk arts
opened today in Hohhot, the capital of China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Third Chinese Quyi Festival will have some 80 programs with
more than 200 folk artists performing over the next seven
days. Quyi originated some 1,300 years ago and had a sort of
golden period during the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911).
</P>
<P>
There are some 300 forms in China, including ballads, story
telling, comic dialogues, and crosstalk. "Pingshu," or story
telling, and "xiangsheng," or crosstalk, are among the favorites
of ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Some forms of Quyi are declining in popularity among Chinese
who prefer pop music, karaoke, or the Internet for fun, and some
are on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
"We need to reform and renew Quyi and provide better programs
and teach a new generation of performers," says Liu Lanfang,
executive chairwoman of the Chinese Quyi Artists' Association.
</P>
<P>
The festival is held every five years and is sponsored by the
Artists' Association and the Hohhot city government. It will
include discussions on how to revive the old but largely ignored
art form.

<HEADLINE> Little Parallel Between Financial Crises of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Mexican Foreign
Minister Rosario Green said here Friday that the current Southeast
Asia economic experience is different from the financial crisis
that affected Mexico years ago.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a lecture organized by Singapore's Institute of
Policy Studies, the Mexican foreign minister said, "I consider it
is very difficult to draw parallelisms" between the two crises,
adding "each situation is unique".
</P>
<P>
"We can not teach others," she said. "Others will have to do
the same."
</P>
<P>
But she emphasized that the Mexican experience made valuable
contributions by prompting international awareness about the role
that the global financial organizations should play in the
prevention of future crisis and ignited the urgent reform of the
traditional mechanisms of financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
She said Mexico experienced a very serious financial downturn
at the end of 1994 and many analysts considered it the first truly
global economic crisis because of its nature, its magnitude and
its possible consequences.
</P>
<P>
By taking full responsibilities of the crisis the Mexican
government recognized that it was facing an emergency from the
outset and reacted expeditiously to avoid the collapse of the
financial and productive structures of the country, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Mexico immediately adopted and
implemented a very severe program of economic and financial
adjustments with the purpose of restoring economic stability and
regaining the basis for sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she added, Mexico negotiated an unprecedented
package of external financial support with the U.S. government as
well as international financial institutions such as the IMF and
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Through significant sacrifices and discipline of the Mexican
people," she said, "we were able to turn the corner and restore
economic growth."

<HEADLINE> Canadians Like Chretien, But Want Him to Go: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien enjoys a remarkably strong approval rating, but a clear
majority of Canadians want him to retire before the next election,
according to a poll published Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent of respondents said Chretien, who has been
in office for the last five years, should step aside after 2000 so
someone else can lead the country. Only 38 percent think he should
stay.
</P>
<P>
The findings come at a time when many loyalists are putting out
the word that Chretien might consider going for a third term in
2001 or 2002. He himself has been coy on the question, according
to the Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the survey found that Canadians are content,
even pleased, with their prime minister's performance in office
but still think his time should be winding down.
</P>
<P>
Chretien now enjoys a 65 percent approval rating from
Canadians, well above that accorded him during last year's general
election.
</P>
<P>
Respondents give him high marks on such matters as the
day-to-day running of the government, keeping Canada together,
management of the economy, providing leadership that is right for
the times and presiding over an honest and trustworthy government.
</P>
<P>
The poll suggests that if an election were held today, Chretien
will win a stronger majority than he secured in the general
election a year ago. His party has the backing of 49 percent of
Canadians, well above the 38 percent last June.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail/Angus Reid poll, which was conducted in late
June, is considered accurate to within plus or minus 2.5 percent.

the flood was caused by massive landslides Wednesday in the high

Alisher Atabayev, deputy head of administration of the Fergana

for lack of appropriate control over the situation around
mountainous lakes.

movement in time, the tragedy might have been avoided with people
evacuated beforehand," Tass quoted him as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Health Minister Ismail
Salam arrived here Friday, leading a delegation of doctors and
representatives from pharmaceutical companies on a week-long visit
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Salam told reporters upon arrival that his visit to Iraq
reflected the common desire to discuss means of enhancing
bilateral cooperation relations in different spheres.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister, a heart surgeon, said he would take part
in operation if allowed. He will open the Iraqi-Egyptian Medical
Week here.
</P>
<P>
The 40-member delegation also includes businessmen of the
medicines and medical appliances industry. Egypt has increased its
export of medicines and medical equipment to Iraq under its
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is suffering under a crippling economic embargo imposed by
the U.N. since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. But the
oil-for-food deal made an exception by allowing Baghdad to sell
limited amounts of oil to buy humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian delegation was greeted at the airport by Iraqi
Health Minister Umed Medhat Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for Humanitarian Aid to Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations launched an
appeal Friday for 28.72 million U.S. dollars to urgently help
350,000 war refugees and their vulnerable hosts in Guinea-Bissau.
</P>
<P>
"Timely and substantive response to the appeal will also avert
or considerably minimize the prospects of a massive refugee exodus
into neighboring countries, by ensuring that lifesaving assistance
is provided to the needy population," the UN said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The present interim appeal calls for urgent financial
assistance to supply emergency food and agricultural seeds and
tools for the current planting season to war-affected farming
families, emergency medical assistance to minimize the impact of
diseases and epidemics, provision of basic water and sanitation as
well as child survival care and protection.
</P>
<P>
Funding is also being sought for assistance to vulnerable
populations who would otherwise cross the national borders to seek
asylum in neighboring countries, as well as for refugees in the
neighboring countries of Guinea and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Disaster Management Team for Guinea-Bissau
has already deployed resources at its disposal to the
International Committee of the Red Cross, the International
Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies, the national
Red Cross, and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
Food, medicines and logistics support are the resources
provided by the UN team consisting of officials from the UN
Development Program, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN
Children's Fund, the World Food Program and the World Health
Organization.
</P>
<P>
A high-level UN mission has also been dispatched to
Guinea-Bissau and neighboring countries to address urgent
humanitarian issues and support regional political initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Thuram Thinks French Team of 80's Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIs, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Lilian Thuram, who scored twice to
put France in their first ever World Cup final match, said he
thought the French team of the 80's were better.
</P>
<P>
Thuram said the team which included such players like Jean
Tigana, Alain Giresse and Michel Platini were the best ever.
</P>
<P>
The French team reached two World Cup semi-finals and won the
1984 European Championship.
</P>
<P>
"Tigana was my idol and that French team had really great
players. I feel they cannot be compared with the current French
side and that they were better than us," said Thuram.
</P>
<P>
Before the kick-off of the France'98 World Cup finals, Thuram
had tipped Brazil to win their fifth title. But now after the
semi-final match, he changed his opinion.
</P>
<P>
"France will be super-motivated. We will be in the Stade de
France in front of 80,000 people against Brazil," Thuram said.
</P>
<P>
Thuram said:"Everyone knows Brazil is a very good team with
individual players who are very strong. But sometimes it's not a
good thing to give too much respect."

<HEADLINE> Floods Kill 234 in Sichuan And Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 234 people have been
reported dead as a result of serious flooding in east China's
Zhejiang Province and southwestern province of Sichuan, the
Ministry of Civil Affairs said here today.
</P>
<P>
Since June, 27 cities and 158 counties in the two provinces,
which have a combined population of 15 million, have been flooded
as a result of the unusually heavy rains. Floodwaters have
destroyed 100,000 houses and left more than 90,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
The flooding also affected more than a million hectares of
cropland and caused serious damages to local infrastructure like
irrigation facilities, communications, power, and highways, and
direct losses of 4.6 billion yuan (about 500 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Ministry says that the provincial capital Chengdu, the iron
and steel center Panzhihua, and Guangyuan, Yibin, Meizhou and
Liangshan were the areas most seriously hit in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
In Zhejiang, the flooding mainly hit the central and southern
regions, and the new Jinhua-Wenzhou railway was close for a while.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials say that the Sichuan and Zhejiang
governments have been involved in the fight against the flooding
and have allocated 30 million yuan and over 20 million yuan
respectively for flood relief.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of June, serious flooding has been reported
in many parts of China, mostly south of the Yangtze River.

<HEADLINE> European Monetary Union Roadshow in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A European Monetary Union (EMU)
Roadshow was held here at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center here Friday afternoon, to brief local industrialists and
businessmen on the role of the euro and its effect on the economy
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jurgen Pfister, head of the Economics Department of the
Commerzbank, Germany, said the euro will promote competition and
lead to higher efficiency in the production and distribution of
goods and services and also to more concentration or large units.
</P>
<P>
Above all, he said European monetary integration is not a plot
against anybody. An economic strengthening of Western Europe will
also benefit Asia and North America.
</P>
<P>
He said a single currency will reduce transaction and hedging
costs and exchange-rate uncertainty will disappear. It will also
further lower the barriers to market entry within the European
Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
Pfister said Asia is important for Europe just as Europe is
important for Asia. If intra-EU trade is excluded, one quarter of
the EU's external trade is conducted with Asia. Until recently,
deliveries to Asia have been the most dynamic element in Western
Europe's export growth.
</P>
<P>
"I am fairly confident that in a few years time Asia will
regain its prominent role in the world economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the EMU Roadshow, Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the
Bank of France and future president of the European Central Bank,
and Professor Antonio Borges, dean of the European Institute of
Business Administration and former governor of the Central Bank of
Portugal, also delivered speeches.
</P>
<P>
The event was sponsored by the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Take Feud with Brazil to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The talks between Brazil and Canada
to avert a showdown over aerospace sales have broken down
completely, "The Globe and Mail" newspaper reported friday.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian federal government will file a challenge against
Brazil friday at the World Trade Organization, requesting a
binding dispute panel to settle the long and bitter dispute
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials from Brazil and Canada have gone through two
months of intense meetings in an attempt to implement a specially
commissioned report suggesting solutions to the aerospace dispute,
which has plagued commercial relations between the two countries
for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
But the talks have led nowhere, a Canadian senior government
source said thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa has accused Brazil of unfairly subsidizing aerospace
giant Embraer(Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA) through an
export subsidy that offers buyers of Brazilian aircraft
below-market interest rates. The subsidy program, called Proex,
reduces the price of each plane by about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Proex undercuts Canadian aerospace sales unfairly in a highly
competitive international market, the government source argued,
and it breaks WTO rules on export subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian aerospace sector employs about 60,000 people at
about 400 companies.
</P>
<P>
But Brazil has also accused Canada of breaking rules by
discreetly subsidizing Montreal-based Bombardier Inc., Canada's
biggest aerospace company.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges for Calm in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
appealed for calm in Northern Ireland, saying attacking police was
not tolerated and upholding the rule of law was "paramount."
</P>
<P>
"People can have their different points of view, they can
express them and they can make their protests. I understand
there are strongly held views on either side," Blair said in a
brief interview with BBC TV at his Downing Street residence.
</P>
<P>
"But the rule of law is paramount. That is what we have to
enforce without fear or favour and we cannot allow our police
and our security forces to be attacked by anybody," he added.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after five Northern Ireland police officers
were seriously injured in increasingly violent clashes on Friday
with Protestants angered at a ban on their annual march through a
flashpoint Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he was still trying to get an agreement over a
disputed Protestant march in Portadown and would not allow the
peace process to be "hijacked by extremists from any side."
</P>
<P>
"I will carry on talking to whoever I can and as many people
as I can," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a Downing Street spokesman, Blair spoke by
telephone on Friday morning to Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and
planned to talk later to Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern and
Northern Ireland's first minister-designate David Trimble, leader
of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party, in a bid to seek a way out
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, troops are strengthening barricades at Drumcree
after Orangemen breached part of their defenses in clashes
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Belfast said troops have laid more barbed wire and
put in scaffolding and concrete blocks to stop the marchers from
walking down the controversial route.

<HEADLINE> Russian Upper House Critical of Government Anti-Crisis Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Federation Council, or
upper house of parliament, on Friday criticized the government's
stabilization program as insufficient to overcome the economic and
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution passed Friday after hearing Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko's report on the program, the lawmakers said
measures proposed by the cabinet were "obviously insufficient" to
tackle the causes of the debt and budget crisis, depression and
shrinking investment activity in the real sector.
</P>
<P>
"The program does not contain measures to revive industrial
production, raise investment activity, increase the
competitiveness of national industrial output, strengthen currency
controls, ensure the ruble's stability or provide social
protection for the population," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The document was approved by a 97 to four vote with two
abstentions, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall tone of criticism, Kiriyenko's dialogue
with the senators appeared to have achieved some positive results.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Federation Council, said the
upper house and the cabinet had reached mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the Federation Council and the government
were speaking the same language," Stroyev said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko
reiterated that there was no real threat of ruble devaluation.
</P>
<P>
"The whole government stabilization program is designed to
prevent devaluation," Khristenko told reporters.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Crackdown on Illegal Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government warned
Friday that it will take tough action against any illegal strikes
and protest rallies.
</P>
<P>
"The government will sternly deal with any illegal labor strikes in
accordance with the law," Acting Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil said.
</P>
<P>
Kim made the remarks before starting his trip to France and
Poland.
</P>
<P>
Kim's warning came after the Federation of Korean Trade Unions
and the Korean Confederation of Trade threatened to stage huge
rallies Saturday and general strikes next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of unions are threatening strikes in
protest against government-led corporate and financial
restructuring and the mass layoffs as the country is racked by the
Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The government needs to be strict in dealing with the
organizers of illegal strikes and maintaining social order," Kim
told a cabinet meeting attended by the ministers of justice,
labor, government administration and local autonomy, finance and
economy, and the police chief.
</P>
<P>
The government feared that labor unrest would obstruct its
efforts to overcome the economic crisis and push through reforms,
said a government spokesman Friday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is carrying out painful corporate and financial
restructuring under an agreement signed last December with the
International Monetary Fund for a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S.
dollars after it was hit by a financial crisis caused by corporate
failures and bad loans by financial institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Korea promised to carry out reforms
including financial reforms and the legalization of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless South Koreans, which stood at 1.5 million
in May, is expected to shoot up in the coming months as a result
of corporate and financial restructuring.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate gave final approval to legislation
overhauling the Internal Revenue Service, voting 96-2 to impose
the most sweeping shake-up in decades on the tax-collection
agency's management and culture. President Bill Clinton said he
would sign the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States set out new conditions for taking part in
an international criminal court, calling for sharp limits on its
scope and authority. The United States said it could agree to the
court only if automatic jurisdiction were limited to genocide and
not crimes against humanity or war crimes like rape and torture.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- With the collapse of a comprehensive tobacco bill, the
nation's largest tobacco companies have been trying to negotiate a
multibillion-dollar settlement of the dozens of state lawsuits
pending against the industry.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate vote 98 to 0 Thursday to exempt farm credit
programs from the economic sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan
following their nuclear weapons tests in May. But only after the
bill was stripped of provisions that would have authorized
President Clinton to waive the other sanctions as well.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>

sign of abating. As many as half of the nation's 200 million
people face food shortages by year's end.
</P>
<P>
-- Tests of a new missile defense were postponed by the

<HEADLINE> Donations For Southern China's Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Parts of southern China affected
by serious flooding today received the first major disaster
relief, amounting to 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million
U.S. dollars), from the Guangzhou Jockey Club.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of China, mostly south of the Yangtze River, have
reported unusually heavy rainfall and flooding since the beginning
of June.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Jockey Club, which was founded in 1992, is a
member of the China Charity Federation and was the first CCF
member to respond to its June 30 call for donations from its more
than 60 members.
</P>
<P>
The Club asked that half of the donation go to flood-stricken
parts of Guangdong Province, where Guangzhou is located, and the
other half to the neighboring provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi and
Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
A CCF official says that the Club also helped when the city of
Zhangjiakou, southwest of Beijing, was hit by a major earthquake,
and when Qinghai Province, in the Northwest, was hit by a serious
blizzard earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Declares War Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
Friday mobilized the government and all sectors of society in an
all-out war against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Keynoting the general assembly of the Bishops-Businessmen
Conference, Estrada called on the clergy and business to help him
convince rich and poor Filipinos alike that "they have an equal
stake in the success of their country."
</P>
<P>
He said the economy needs peace and stability to flourish and
this conducive atmosphere can only be achieved if the wealth of
the land is enjoyed by every Filipino.
</P>
<P>
He bewailed that poverty has become so prevalent that the poor
and their plight are "simply part of the landscape" and a "daily
reality to which we have become accustomed."
</P>
<P>
Estrada also reminded businessmen it is the poor's hard-earned
money that sustains their fortune which, he said, should serve as
an impetus for them to help improve the living standard and
purchasing power of the masses.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who won the May 11 presidential polls on a populist
pro-poor platform, has vowed to reduce the country's poverty
incidence to 20 percent from the present 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said earlier that his administration would try to ease
poverty in the country with a population of 70 million by giving
priority to developing its backward agriculture sector.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's GDP Grows by 1.9 Percent: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product (GDP)
of Nepal is expected to grow by only 1.9 percent in the 1997/98
fiscal year which ends in mid-July, the lowest in 22 years, said
the Economic Survey presented by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the GDP grew by four percent in the last
fiscal year, and the decrease is attributed to the decline in the
growth rates of agriculture and non-agriculture sectors.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, which contributes 40 percent to the GDP and
employs more than 80 percent of the economically active population
of the country, is estimated to grow by only 1.1 percent,
reflecting a fall of three percentage points over last year, noted
the report covering the first nine months of the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Because of inadequate irrigation facilities, the agriculture
sector is still dependent on monsoon. And in the current fiscal
year, production of food crops is estimated to decline by one
percent to 6.361 million metric tons compared with last year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The non-agriculture sectors as a whole are expected to grow by
3.1 percent, down from last year's 3.8 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the volume of savings, as a proportion of
total production, is declining, and the current account deficit of
the external sector is increasing.
</P>
<P>
Especially, as there was no improvement in revenue mobilization
as anticipated, the gap between sources and utilization of
resources became wider, resulting in added loan liabilities, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
"Budget deficit is increasing every year," it warned. "It leads
to a situation in which the scope of national saving deteriorates,
the current account deficit of the balance of payments increases
further, the problem of loan service becomes worse and financial
resources for the private sector become scarce."
</P>
<P>
"Besides, it creates distortions like the erosion in people's
purchasing power due to the decline in internal and external value
of the currency, capital flight and distraction of foreign
investment," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the fields of electricity, gas, water and
construction has been negative whereas the growth rate of industry
and mining has come down, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, total
foreign trade recorded a decrease of 0.3 percent as compared with
the same period of last year, but the total trade deficit during
the review period has gone down by 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
And the situation of increasing unemployment and
quasi-employment remains the main problem of the nation, it said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that higher growth rate, in comparison with the
previous year, could be attained only in the sectors of community
and social services and financial and housing.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that attributes of macroeconomic stability
have prevailed in the economy as the price increase has been
controlled, interest rate has been reduced somewhat and
considerable surplus has been maintained in the balance of
payments.
</P>
<P>
"On this basis, it seems that a favorable environment has been
created for the increase in production in the country in future
through the promotion of investment," it added.

<HEADLINE> Expelled Russian Diplomat Proclaims Innocence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Expelled Russian diplomat, Oleg
N. Abramkin, declared innocence before leaving for home Friday
afternoon after he was declared persona non grata by South Korea
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I have collected information on South Korea's domestic
politics and foreign affairs during the four years of my stay
here, but I did not collect information on security or anything I
am ashamed of doing," Abramkin said before departure at Seoul
Kimpo International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Abramkin, a councelor of the Russian Embassy to Seoul, said he
is worried that relations between South Korea may worsen due to
the diplomatic conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian diplomat hoped that he would be the last
person to be sacrificed over such an incident.
</P>
<P>
"I also hope that my government will take no additional measure and
the bilateral relations will be recovered soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea Wednesday ordered Abramkin to leave the nation within
72 hours in retaliation against Russia's expulsion of Cho Sung-woo, a
councelor of the South Korean Embassy in Moscow, on espionage charges
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cho was caught red-handed last Friday when he was giving money to
Valentin Moiseyev, deputy director general for Asian-Pacific affairs
of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Russia accused Cho of bribing Moiseyev to secure classified
information, which the South Korean government denied.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Valery Suhinin, a minister-counsellor of the Russian
Embassy here complained about the South Korean government's decision
to expel the Russian councelor in retaliation, saying that Cho's case
is different from Abramkin's in nature.
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry stated that it is seriously
mulling over taking some additional actions against South Korea in
response to the latter's deportation of Abramkin.
</P>
<P>
The ministry added that South Korea has made the bilateral
relations intense and it is now up to Russia to make response.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Urged to Cancel Sale of Iraqi Oil Tankers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has asked the U.N. chief to
immediately intervene with Kuwaiti authorities to cancel the sale
of five Iraqi oil tankers seized since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported Friday that in a letter to
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said the Kuwaiti move is "illegal and
violating international law."
</P>
<P>
Iraq had received reports Kuwaiti authorities had sold five
Iraqi oil tankers, seized since 1991 when Iraqi occupying troops
were driven out of Kuwait by the coalition forces, to other
parties as junk at 16.5 million dollars, al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
He said four of the five oil tankers were in good condition and
one was damaged, and they were owned by Iraq and registered in
international navigation records under the name of "Iraqi Oil
Tankers Company."
</P>
<P>
"Any such action by the Kuwaiti authorities will be illegal and
have no legal grounds," he added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said Iraqi government demands that Kuwaiti
authorities return these oil tankers to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq reserves legal right to compensations for any damage
done by Kuwaiti authorities to its property, and to prosecute the
purchasers and take legal action against them in any state of the
world," he warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese military atlas of
China used in World War II has been found here, providing more
evidence of Japan's aggression against China during the war.
</P>
<P>
The atlas, called "The New Pocket Atlas of Manchoukuo," was
printed by a publishing house in Tokyo in 1940, according to its
introduction.
</P>
<P>
The book, 14.5 cm long and eight cm wide, has a black cover and
can fit in the hand.
</P>
<P>
The atlas includes eight maps depicting the locations of 18
provinces including Jilin and Binjiang in the so-called
"Manchoukuo" region, now the northeast China area.
</P>
<P>
The atlas was found by Jin Deyuan, a retired teacher from
Changchun City No. 92 Secondary School. It was discovered among the
possessions of his late father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, eight Japanese military atlas used during
World War II have been found in Dongning County, Heilongjiang
Province, providing more evidence of Japan's aggression against China
during that period.
</P>
<P>
Japanese aggressors occupied northeast China in 1931 and set up
the puppet "Manchoukuo" regime in 1934. Northeast China was
controlled by the Japanese aggressors until they surrendered in
1945.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government Friday
announced a 463 million U.S. dollar package to encourage the
nation's textile, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry to increase
investment and stem job losses amid growing competition from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The five-year package announced by Australian Federal Industry
Minister John Moore at a clothing factory in Melbourne Friday is
to take effect from July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The package, known as "TCF Strategic Investment Program", will
provide tax breaks for TCF businesses spending money on equipment,
research and development.
</P>
<P>
Tens of millions of dollars would also be pumped into new
technologies, training, export expansion, and encouraging the use
of Australian textiles by overseas manufacturers, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
The plan comes on top of a government announcement last
September to freeze tariffs in the industry, which employs 100,000
Australians, at year 2000 levels until 2005.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, tariffs are to be reduced to 15 percent for

<HEADLINE> China to Follow Family Planning Policy into Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China will continue its family
planning policy in the next 50 years to maintain its
population at about 1.6 billion in the middle 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weiqing, director of the State Family Planning
Commission, made the statement today at a meeting in Beijing
marking World Population Day on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Based on a forecast that the world population will reach six
billion in 1999, the United Nations has chosen "approaching six
billion" as the theme of this year's World Population Day.
</P>
<P>
"As the most populous country in the world, China is deeply
concerned with the pressure brought by rapid population growth,
and is also responsible for stablizing world population growth and
maintaining sustainable global development," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China should stick to the basic state policies of
family planning and environmental protection, and coordinate
population growth with economic development and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
China plans to have its population under 1.3 billion by the end
of this century, and under 1.4 billion by 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the two decades of family planning in China
have resulted in 300 million fewer people, and the population
growth rate has dropped from 2.6 percent in the late 1970s to 1.06
percent.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with population control, China has been trying to
reduce the incidence of defects in newborn babies and provide
better reproductive health care for women of child-bearing
age, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's State Family Planning Commission, along with the
Representative Office of the United Nations Population Fund in
China and relevant Chinese departments, will hold an event from
July 10 to July 19 in Beijing to mark the World Population Day.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the event will discuss China's achievements in
population control and provide information and services related to
reproductive health care.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh River Heavily Polluted: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The water in the Buriganga River
flowing through this South Asian nation's capital city of Dhaka
has been seriously polluted depleting almost all kinds of fish,
according to a survey available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen a single fishing boat from Mirpur (10
kilometers north of Dhaka) to Pagla point (about 15 kilometers
southeast of here) because of non-availability of fish," said the
survey, conducted by the Surface Water Modeling Center (SWMC)
under the Water Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Dissolved oxygen (DO) levels within the 17 kilometer reach of
the river stretching from Savar to Narayanganj, on the northwest
and southeast outskirts of the capital respectively, were found to
be far below the acceptable level of four milligrams per liter --
the threshold level for survival of aquatic life including fish,
the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The SWMC monitored the DO level at more than 11 points in 1995,
and took samples of water from the river for laboratory tests.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary review of the data showed that the DO level
within the 17 kilometer reach of the river was at some points as
low as 0.1 milligram per liter.
</P>
<P>
Seeped-in residue of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, along
with discharge of human excreta and wastes from industries on the
banks, were the main reasons behind the fall of DO levels, which
caused the depletion of fish in the river, SWMC experts said.
</P>
<P>
There were traces of many hazardous chemicals in the river
water even in the upstream, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts warned that the pollution might turn the
river into a dead river if pragmatic steps were not taken
immediately. Only efficient management practices, with balance
between the environment and development, can save the river, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Controlling and managing the river resources of the country was
very important and a balance should achieved between the sometimes
conflicting requirements of food production, irrigation and
fisheries, which required management tools capable of integrating
all relevant processes, they said.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the SWMC said that final results of the tests and
their analysis which were expected to be available soon would help
assess the environmental impact, and the planning and
implementation of river restoration schemes.

<HEADLINE> World Cereal Output Expected at 1,911 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) now forecasts world cereal production this year at 1,911
million tons compared to 1,909 million tons of last year.
</P>
<P>
Wheat output is forecast at 606 millin tons, 1.5 percent down
from 1997. Asia's output is expected to slip back somewhat from
the record harvest in 1997 but would remain well above the
average of the past few years, accordong to the latest issue of
food outlook published by FAO.
</P>
<P>
In south America the continuing El Nino is affecting
production prospects but output should be only slightly below
average and in north America, wheat output is forecast to
decrease considerably due to a significant decline in plantings
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), adverse
weather and farmers' economic problems are expected to reduce
production this year.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, improved weather conditions in the major wheat
producing areas has allowed a recovery from last year's
drought-reduced crops, while in Europe, Oceania and central
America the wheat harvests are expected to remain close to last
year's level.
</P>
<P>
For coarse grains, global output this year is expected at 925
million tons, 1.6 percent up from 1997.
</P>
<P>
FAO's forecast for global paddy output is 567 million tons
(380 million tons in milled terms), only four million tons less
than 1997. However, this forecast is still very tentative as the
bulk of the 1998 rice crop is yet to be planted in Asia pending
the arrival of the monsoon rains.
</P>
<P>
In northern Africa, the aggregate output is preliminarily
forcast at 13.7 million tons, some 40 percent higher than last
year's drought-affected crops.
</P>
<P>
Aggregate output of coarse grains of this year in the
sub-Sahara region is forecast at some 11.2 million tons, about 21
percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
In southern Africa, a below average output of some 15.5
million tons is preliminarily estimated compared with 17 million
tons of last year.
</P>
<P>
World cereal trade in 1998/99 (July/June) could decrease to
201 million tons, nearly four million tons, or two percent below
1997/98.
</P>
<P>
Global wheat trade in 1998/99 is likely to fall to 90 million
tons, five million tons below that of 1997/98 and the lowest
level since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
World coarse grain trade in 1998/99 points to an expansion of
over three million tons, bringing the total to 91 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, maize imports will increase sharply in 1898/99.
Most of the expected increase in imports would be in southern
Africa, where crop reductions associated with El Nino in some
countries are expected to lift import requirements, particularly
in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is expected to return to the import market mainly to
replenish stocks while substantially large imports are also
anticipated in Lesotho and Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Angolan President Urged to Reverse Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Angola Republic Council has
expressed "extreme worries" over the national political and
military situation, urging President Edwardo dos Santos to "take
up measures" to reverse the situation.
</P>
<P>
Domingos Culolo, spokesman for the council, made the statement
here to the press after the council meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not reveal what concrete measures the council
had suggested to the president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the crisis is caused by the opposition National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), who, on the
one hand, refuses to hand over the four cities in central Angola,
and on the other hand is snatching back the cities from the
government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said, UNITA has planted landmines
back to the de-mined roads, destroying bridges and attacking
unarmed citizens, rendering thousands of people homeless and
reducing them to new refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to Culolo, it is UNITA who proposed to hand over the
four cities under its control to the government by June 30. Since
there are no concrete actions so far to this end, it shows that
UNITA does not have the political will to keep its promise.
</P>
<P>
All members of the republic council have agreed that the
situation is "grim", Culolo said.
</P>
<P>
He also extended the council's deep condolences to the death
of Alioune Blondin Beye, special envoy of the United Nations to
Angola, saying it hopes the U.N. will soon appoint a new envoy so
as to put the Angola Peace Process back on course.
</P>
<P>
Angola Republic Council is the advisory body for the
president. It comprises the president, prime minister,
government ministers, chief procurator, chief justice of the
Supreme Court and heads of political parties which have seats in
the parliament.

<HEADLINE> BMW Denies Alleged Merger Talks with Fiat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The German carmaker Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW) Friday dismissed news reports that it is
seeking a strategic alliance, even a possible merger, with car
manufacturer Fiat of Italy.
</P>
<P>
This week's edition of the British weekly Economist reportedly
said that executives "at the highest level" of BMW and Fiat have
met to see whether a merger between the two was possible.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the report, a BMW spokesman said in Munich on
Friday, "That is absolutely rubbish."
</P>
<P>
Fiat has also denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Speculations about a BMW-Fiat marriage came after a series of
offensives taken by German carmakers in the global auto industry
in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Germany's largest industrial concern Daimler-Benz AG is
currently in the process of forging a merger with the United
States' third-largest carmaker Chrysler while Volkswagen AG has
just won a battle against BMW to take over the British luxury
carmaker Rolls-Royce.

KATHMANDU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people have died of
snake bite during the summer season in Rupandehi and Dhanusha
districts of Nepal, press reports here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Rupandehi district, western Nepal, seven have succumbed to
snake bite and more than 250 others were wounded, the
government-owned Gorkhapatra daily said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the death toll could be much higher as detailed
reports from some villages are not available yet.
</P>
<P>
It noted that about 100 people in the district have got
injections against snake poison.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 10 have died in Dhanusha district, central Nepal,
the official RSS news agency said, adding that snakes,
particularly kraits, are reported to have been posing a menace
there.
</P>

More than 50 others were wounded but they have been treated,
the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
About three or four cases of snake bite are treated every day
at local hospitals, it added.

<HEADLINE> Shirt-pulling, Feigning New Headaches for Referees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Shirt-pulling and simulations of
injuries by players have become new head-aches for referees in the
World Cup, a FIFA official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the previously much debated tacklings from behind faded out of
picture, gaining advantage through pulling of opponents' shirt and
making deceiving dives have become popular, said Volker Roth, a member
of the Referees' Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Now they are pulling (shirts). They are making more simulations,"
Roth told a news conference. "This is dangerous for football."
</P>
<P>
Roth admitted that it was almost impossible to watch out for all
the players' actions especially when they gathered in the penalty area
during a corner kick.
</P>
<P>
He praised the linesmen's work at this World Cup, saying "they were
exceptionally good and much better than four years ago in the United
States."
</P>
<P>
Roth added the performance of the assisstant referees here even set
the standard for some European leagues.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out a possibility of using video technology to
refereeing a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
"This would make football a different sport," he said. "If we use
video supervising in such a top-level competition here but don't
change things in the lower level, we would divide football."
</P>
<P>
He argued that players in underdeveloped areas in Asia and Africa
would have to play "another game" if they could not afford video-aided
refereeing.

<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian supreme court Thursday overthrew an earlier court
verdict to condemn to death Aida Nouredinne, a 25-year-old nurse who
was convicted of killing one patient and of trying to kill 25 others
by a court in Alexandria in March. Since the verdict, Egyptian
newspapers and public opinions had been appealing for a clemency
from the country's judicial authorities usually judged too severe
for the weak.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite a terrorist bombing attack on Thursday in Algiers
which killed 10 and injured 21, tens of thousands of people took to
the street on the same day in the capital to protest the law
imposing Arabic as the only official language of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The new political committee (parliament) of the Gaullist Rally
for the Republic (RPR) will hold its first session on Friday under
the presidency of Philippe Seguin to discuss European integration
and organization of the new rightwing Alliance. This meeting comes
when relationship between President Jacques Chirac, the founder of
RPR, and Seguin remains tense.
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Thursday told his cabinet
ministers that he was determined to implement a leftwing tax policy
by increasing taxes on great value ownership and reforming the Tax
of Solidarity on Fortune, or the ISF.
</P>
<P>
-- After violent riots which erupted after the death of Moshood
Abiola, Nigeria could face a civil war if the autopsy of Abiola's
body proves that he did not die of a heart attack.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Buy Fire Engines From Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
planning to buy three modern fire engines from Indonesia in an
effort to enable the Colombo Fire Services (CFS) to put out fires
more effectively, CFS sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said these vehicles are expected to be deployed in
the CFS by the end of this month and they will help control damage
to property in case of fire.
</P>
<P>
Asked how they could minimize damage to the property by using
the new fire engines, a senior official of the CFS explained that
a fire-dowsing engine called "the Triple Agent" has all three
types of extinguishers -- dry powder, water and foam. Any of
these three agents could be put to use to handle different types
of fires.
</P>
<P>
The Triple Agent is a giant vehicle that could carry up to
3,000 liters of water, 3,000 kilos of dry powder and 300 liters of
foam, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Crisis in N.Ireland Deepens as Stand-off Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The crisis in Northern Ireland
deepened on Friday as Protestants warned major trouble within days
unless a way was found to end the stand-off in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
David Jones, spokesman of the Protestant Orange Order, said
there would be a mass bid to break through security forces' lines
and end the march down the Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 50
km southwest of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"Is (Prime Minister) Tony Blair prepared to have another Bloody
Sunday, only this time in Portadown?" Jones was quoted by BBC as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order has been banned from staging its annual march
along the traditional route through Garvaghy Road for fear of
igniting conflicts with Catholic residents in the area. But they
continued on Sunday in defiance and were halted by security forces.
</P>
<P>
Three policemen were reported to have been hurt when two bombs
were thrown by members of angry crowds in Portadown late Thursday
night. Another was injured by a flying brick.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of Orangemen have flooded into Portadown
as the Order's stand-off with police and army units entered its
sixth day.
</P>
<P>
Police estimate 20,000 to 25,000 people are in the crowds --
the biggest turnout since the Orangemen were stopped on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As the stand-off dragged on, Northern Ireland's First Minister
David Trimble warned of "awesome" consequences facing the province
if a stand-off over a banned Protestant parade is not resolved
soon.
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out and this society faces a quite awesome
prospect if between now and the weekend we do not find a
satisfactory way out of it," he told a news conference on Thursday
after meeting Orange Order leaders in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
But Trimble said he and Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon
were still exploring ways of averting a feared showdown on July
13, the climax of an annual series of marches commemorating
William of Orange, the Protestant king who defeated a Catholic
monarch in 1690.

<HEADLINE> Car Prices in Gulf Region Dip to Record Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Car prices in the Gulf region
have dropped to record low levels, leaving minimal profit margins
for car dealers, a Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The price slump of new cars in Gulf countries this year is up
to an average 15-20 percent, caused by the volatile exchange rates
of major currencies, oversupply and the cut-throat competition
among manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Car dealers in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) agreed that the yen-U.S. dollar exchange rate
recently ended in favor of customers and forced them to refer
U.S. made cars to the Japanese-manufactured.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of shipping new models by anxious manufacturers
also gave car dealers pressures, which forced them to seek a
lion's share of the market, introduce extra incentives for
customers and reap the least profit margin.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that current situation in the Gulf car
markets would continue for a period of time, since customers are
waiting the new models of the next century that will include
drastic changes in designs and specifications.

KUNMING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A giant Chinese hemlock tree was
discovered in Zhongdian County in southwest China's Yunnan
Province during a recent resource survey by local foresty
departments.
</P>
<P>
The tree, thought to be over 1,000 years old, measures 2.8
meters in diameter and stands more than 50 meters high, making it
the king of Chinese hemlock.
</P>

This still-living specimen is one of the rare species of trees
under state protection. The Chinese hemlock is mostly found in
places 2,800 meters above sea level, forestry experts said.
</P>
<P>
Zhongdian County, located in northwestern Yunnan, has an
average elevation of 3,000 meters, and has long been known as
"Shangrila" because of its beautiful and vast primeval forests,

<HEADLINE> Investment in Cambodia Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 10 (Xinhua) -- After several years of steady
growth, capital investment in Cambodia dropped by more than 60
percent in the first half of 1998, according to the Cambodia
Investment Board.
</P>
<P>
The board approved 65 projects worth 147.3 million U.S. dollars
during the first six months of 1998, a sharp decrease from the
same period in 1997, when more than 400 million dollars worth of
investment projects were approved.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due to worries about the country's political
stability and regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Keat Chhon said Monday at an ASEAN workshop
that direct foreign investment from Southeast Asia could slow down
or stop completely for at least one or two years.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the drop might be offset by investment from other
Asian countries, such as South Korea and China, as long as
Cambodia remains attractive.
</P>
<P>
Although investment has dropped significantly, investors are
still interested, provided that the election and transition period
are smooth. Investors will wait until after the new government is
formed.

<HEADLINE> 43 Dar es Salaam Businessmen Netted for Violating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has seized 43 unscrupulous businessmen in Dar es Salaam, the
capital, since the Value Added Tax (VAT) was introduced on July
1.
</P>
<P>
"The traders were netted for various offenses including
failure to register for VAT while they were qualified to do so,
charging VAT while they were not registered and overcharging
goods by imposing tax on tax," a revenue official has said.
</P>
<P>
Augustine Mukandara, a senior Tanzanian Revenue Authority
(TRA) Officer for Publicity and Taxpayer Education on VAT, said
the traders were nabbed in a nationwide crackdown on businessmen
violating the VAT Act.
</P>
<P>
The act, passed in 1997, ruled that a taxable person,
convicted after commiting an offense, is liable to a fine not
exceeding 200,000 Shillings (about 300 U.S. Dollars) or to
imprisonment for a term between two to 12 months, or suffer both
penalties.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by The Guardian on Friday, some of the
seized traders who pleaded guilty have been fined by TRA while
others who pleaded "not guilty" will be taken to court.
</P>
<P>
Mukandara said Thursday that the crackdown and education will go
on so that VAT system is properly carried out.
</P>
<P>
The new tax is applied at a standard rate of 20 percent except
for certain items that were zero-rated. Traders whose annual
turnover has reached 20 million Shillings should register for the
new tax system.
</P>
<P>
The new tax became effective in Mainland Tanzania on July 1.
Zanzibar isles plan to delay the implementation of VAT to January
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mukandara said since July 1, another 500 traders have
registered themselves for VAT. So far, more than 9,000 traders
have registered in Mainland Tanzania, against a target of 15,000.
</P>
<P>
These days, consumer goods prices in several regions have
dropped following a period of chaos of price hikes, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gigantic Hydro-Electric Power Station Built to World Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The gigantic Ertan Hydroelectric
Power Station, expected to begin operations in mid August, has
been hailed as a world-class construction masterpiece, according
to a frontpage story in today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Located in the southwest China city of Panzhihua in Sichuan
Province, the facility, designed to produce 17 billion kilowatts
hours of electricity a year, cost 33 billion yuan (3.98 billion
U.S. dollars), including 930 million U.S. dollars in World Bank
loans, the largest World Bank loan ever for a single project.
</P>
<P>
According to World Bank stipulations, contractors for the
construction of the main project and the producers of major
equipment were determined through international bidding.
</P>
<P>
New bidding practices allowing foreign and Chinese companies to
compete was introduced for this project, thus enabling the Chinese
companies to learn from their overseas counterparts. The
successful bidders include companies from China, France, Italy,
Germany and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The strict implementation of more than 1,200 contracts served a
major guarantor of the success of the power station, which is
second in size only to the Three Gorges Water Conservancy project.
</P>
<P>
So far, no major disputes have occurred between the
proprietors and the contractors since construction began in
September 1991.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the gigantic power station is also a fine
example of cost-saving, as the project was completed under budget.

real estate development and 35 billion yuan in loans for
individual homebuyers this year, the bank official said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Philippines to Ratify Forces Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A top U.S. military official here
Friday urged the Philippine Senate to ratify the proposed Visiting
Forces Agreement which would again allow the holding of joint
military exercises between the United States and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Joseph Prueher, chief of the U.S. Armed Forces Pacific
Command, said he was encouraged by the commitment of support for
the agreement by the Estrada administration.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the agreement by the Senate "would enable us to
work together between our militaries," Prueher said after
attending a closed-door Mutual Defense Board meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. does not seek military bases in the country," he
said, reiterating that American soldiers only desire to visit
seaports in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lieutenant General Joselyn Nazareno, chief of staff
of the Philippine Armed Forces, said he supports the proposed
agreement which "is very advantageous" to the Philippine military.
</P>
<P>
It is very important for the armed forces of the Philippines to
further strengthen military ties with Washington, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Senate vetoed the extension of U.S. military
bases in Subic and Clark in 1992, forcing the U.S. forces to leave
after stationed in the Philippines for nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada, one of the former senators who voted
against the U.S. military, has expressed support for the proposed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The government insists that the international treaty should be
approved by the Senate.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Environment and Natural Resources has issued guidelines for the
implementation of the Industrial Ecowatch System across the
country, the Philippine News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the ecowatch system is an information and
public disclosure-based system which would inform the public of
the status of environmental compliance and responsiveness of
industrial and commercial firms.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, all industrial and commercial firms all over
the country will be evaluated and audited in terms of their
compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations as well
as their responsiveness to waste water effluent and air emissions,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the firms will be rated based on five color
codes, namely black, red, blue, green and gold, to help the public
identify their compliance and responsiveness from very bad to
excellent.
</P>
<P>
The report said the system is being adopted to promote
compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations through
public pressure; encourage pollution reduction through public
recognition and praise; create incentives for polluters to develop
internal environmental management systems; and develop foundations
for international environmental standards.

<HEADLINE> Landmines Raise Concerns in Somali Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- There is a growing concern over
the threat of land mines in the central regions of Hiran and
Galgudud, where an average of two people die in the mine
explosions every week.
</P>
<P>
The Governor of Galgudud region, Yussuf Hassan Eyow, said that
along with the human casualties, dozens of the livestock
especially the camels get perished in those land mines.
</P>
<P>
The governor who spoke with the reporters in Mogadishu said
the threat is now increased by the recent rains which excavated
the land mines from under the earth where they were buried during
the height of the civil war in 1992
</P>
<P>
The peace deals which have been achieved among the different
clans living together in those regions have on the other hand
surfaced the problem of the land mines.
</P>
<P>
Most of the important roads abandoned for the hostility during
the inter-clan fighting are now the most dangerous after they
were re-opened for the use of both the traffic and herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
The mine explosion incidents are now occurring on daily basis
in most of the main roads linking the districts of Dhusamareb and
Abudwaq, EI-Bur and EI-Dher, Beletuein and Qodqod, Guri-EI and
Balanballe, and Adado and Abudwaq.
</P>
<P>
These roads have been re-opened as part of the fruits achieved
through the peace agreements the clansmen reached over their
differences early in the year.
</P>
<P>
The regional officials especially worry about the possible
ways their areas could be de-mined once and for all since many of
the militiamen who planted the mines are not either alive or away
from the area without leaving behind any kind of a trace or a map
for the mine fields nor the quantity which they had planted.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 land mines are believed to have been planted in
a road between Beletuein and Gobane alone, A very small area not
larger than 10 square km.
</P>
<P>
In one of the latest incidents, 20 camels were perished after
they hit a land mine near Dhusamareb district this week according
to the governor, Yussuf Hassan Eyow. Several women who suffered
the land mine shrapnel are now being treated in the hospital of
the town.
</P>
<P>
The district commissioner of Galhareri in Galgudud region,
Abdi Musa Assir, said the most vulnerable in his area are the
children who sometimes come across and collect the rain-exhumed
mines and play them with.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- By the year 2005, China will have
72 to 114 helicopters for civil use, said Shen Yuankang, deputy
director of Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) recently.
</P>
<P>
China first put helicopters into civil use in 1965. By the end
of 1997, China had nine aviation enterprises using 68 helicopters
of 13 different types, and 256 licensed helicopter pilots.
</P>
<P>
Over 95 percent of China's helicopters are imported, mainly
from Europe, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shen Yuankang also pointed out that plans for the manufacture
of helicopters in China have now begun to take shape, though
compared with developed countries China still lags behind in
engineering technology and applications for helicopters.

<HEADLINE> Indian Postmen on Strike for Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Most postal services are
paralyzed in India Friday as an indefinite national strike by more
than 500,000 postal employees for higher pay entered the second
day.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the postal employees stayed away from work
in most states, according to organizers of the strike, the
National Federation of Postal Employees (NFPE) and the Federation
of National Postal Organizations.
</P>
<P>
The two major unions listed nine demands including improved
pay-scales and revision of bonus formula while Communications
Minister Sushma Swaraj appealed to the employees to end the
strike, saying their demands were being considered.
</P>
<P>
The strike disrupted postal services across the country
including collection of letters, sorting, transmission to
outstation posts, booking of registered letters, parcels and other
articles, speed post services for 75 cities and money order
services, the Hindu daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said postal workers had submitted a 10-point charter
of demands last year to the Department of Posts and had
subsequently called off a similar indefinite strike last November
following assurances from the government.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, neither the government nor the department
concerned looked into their demands, forcing them to go on strike.
</P>
<P>
NFPE and FNPO representatives held one-hour talks with Swaraj
Thursday night but in vain, said NFPE Secretary General R. L.
Bhattacharya, who threatened to intensify the strike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, services in all government hospitals and
dispensaries in New Delhi came to a virtual standstill Thursday as
70,000 employees began a two-day total strike to press their
various demands.

34-year-old Bebeto in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo said he was impressed by
Denilson's performance in the semi-final match:"He gives us an extra
option in attack. Brazil always used to have exceptional wingers,
who were feared by our opponents."

But Zagallo would not reveal whether he would start Denilson or
not:"He's still a young player and he must not get carried away with
all the praise that is being heaped on him. Sometimes he

<HEADLINE> Hidden Employment A Burden to Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Hidden employment has become a
burden to State-owned enterprises, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
For example, 42-year-old Song was a laid-off worker of a food
processing factory in Beijing and the same time works as a
temporary cleaner. If she doesn't report her new job to her
employer, she can still receive a monthly subsidy of 200 yuan (26
US dollars) from her original workplace.
</P>
<P>
According to the Daily, such hidden employment is not uncommon
in China's State-owned enterprises, as the social security system
is still incomplete in the country at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Currently, old-age pensions and medical and unemployment
insurance are all offered by State-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
Under the government sponsored re-employment program,
loss-ridden State-owned enterprises are required to set up
re-employment centers, partly to ensure laid-off workers a basic
livelihood while they are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
As a result, workers, after getting their pink slips, prefer to
straddle the fence-both registering as unemployed at the
reemployment center and also hurrying to find a new job on their
own.
</P>
<P>
"We have to spend more than two million yuan every year to
ensure a basic living to laid-offs, even though we know that most
of them have other sources of income", the Daily quoted Han Gang,
head of the re-employment center of Beijing Yili Food Processing
Co. as saying.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo on Falling Banking Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo Friday as
heavy selling of banking in the afternoon triggered a widespread drop
in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
Comments made around noon by Yasuhisa Shiozaki, Japan's
parliamentary vice finance minister, that operators and shareholders
of failed banks "must take responsibility" fueled stronger fears over
Japan's fragile banking system and led to a sell-off of banking
shares.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted 356.89 points, or 2.17
percent, from Thursday's close to finish at 16,090.06.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 20.78 points or 1.65 percent to 1,241.50.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 570 million
shares from Thursday's 397.70 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was Friday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Nikkei's 356-point fall was natural, considering
the index climbed 1,300 points last week, mainly due to expectations
of the government cutting income taxes permanently next year to boost
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, losers outweighed
gainers 895 to 268, with 105 issues remaining unchanged.

BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Changchun
Economic and Technological Development Zone, one of the key
foreign investment sites in Northeast China, Thursday in Beijing
inked 15 cooperative projects with a total committed investment of
130 million U.S. dollars, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The joint ventures, with investors from the United States,
Germany, Iran and Taiwan, covered industrial sectors ranging from
food to automobile components.
</P>
<P>
These agreements are especially important now, as investment in
China suffers heavily from Southeast Asia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We adopt practical measures to provide more preferential
policies, except those on a State Level," said Yu Deman, director
of the administrative committee with the Changchun zone of Jilin
Province.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that some specific projects can enjoy more favourable
terms like low prices for land leases.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, to the non-producing foreign projects, the zone will
offer an income tax rebate, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun zone's strategy is typical among the country's
500 development zones at the state and provincial levels, which
have been tapped as key growth areas for the regional economic
health.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Former Chief of General Staff Won't Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military rulers have
decided to save the lives of former chief of general staff
Lt.-Gen. Oladipo Diya and others sentenced to death for
involvement in a fouled coup plot last December, the State Radio
reported Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
But the highest authorities, after two days of intensive
meeting which ended Thursday night, failed to provide its final
decision on the remaining part of the country's political
transition program.
</P>
<P>
Diya and five others, including two former ministers, were
sentenced to death on charges of treason by a special military
tribunal in April, and execution has since been pending on the
decision of the highest authority.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), the highest
decision-making body, reviewed the death sentences at its meeting
in the last two days, decided to exempt the six people from death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
The PRC decided to change the death sentences of Diya and two other
former ministers to 25 years imprisonment, the report said,
quoting a PRC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence of three others were commuted to 20 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
On the much-expected final decision on how the military
government is to do to push its transition to civil rule program
forward, the spokesman said the head of state will give another
nationwide broadcast on that very soon.

<HEADLINE> Spain To Replace Norway in Peacekeeping in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Troops from Italy and Spain appear
to be heading the list to replace Norwegian soldiers serving with
the United Nations peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon, the Daily
Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a Spain source as saying that the U.N. in New
York has asked Spain to replace the Norwegians working in the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil).
</P>
<P>
Norway last month announced that it would decrease its
600-strong battalion by two thirds at the end of this year,
claiming it could no longer attract sufficient numbers of
volunteers for the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong Unifil was established in 1978 after Israel's
first invasion of Lebanon with the aim of confirming the
withdrawal of Israeli forces and restoring international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Israel has long complained Unifil has been ineffective in
protecting its northern border from Lebanese guerrillas' attack.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon always speaks highly of the role the forces have
played in safeguarding the security and peace across the border
and hoped that it would stay in the region until the Israeli
pullout from its occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
guerrillas attack.
</P>
<P>
The Norway's plan to reduce its soldiers in Lebanon has
prompted the concern of Lebanese government and local residents.
</P>
<P>
They fear that the reduction would eventually lead to the
disbandment of the forces and facilitate the Israeli attack on the
south.
</P>
<P>
The paper also predicted that other than Spain, the most
likely candidate to replace Norwegian soldiers is Italy, which
has considerable peacekeeping experience in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Italy is already represented in Unifil by the 44 pilots and
ground crew of Italair, the peacekeepers' airborne wing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Promises to Help Improve Africa's Civil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States government is
prepared to work with African governments in partnership to
improve their aviation and transportation infrastructures, a U.S.
official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodneyx Slater, who arrived
in Harare Thursday evening to attend a one-day conference for
east and Southern African transportation ministers Friday said
U.S. government had set aside a budget of over one million U.S.
Dollars to help African countries in improving their airways to
meet international standards.
</P>
<P>
More funds, he said, were however needed to achieve the goal
of improving Africa's transportation infrastructure and airlines,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some African countries that have achieved the status of safe
and efficient aviation systems are Ghana, South Africa, Senegal
and Ethiopia, whose national airlines now fly directly to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The one-day conference would discuss the implementation of the
"Africa Safe Skies Initiative" launched recently by the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
"A safe and efficient aviation system is essential for
Zimbabwe as well as other mighty African nations as we access the
markets in the world," said Slater, "the U.S. needs to work with
African governments to make their skies more safe."

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Government Urged to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The parliamentary group of the
Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) Thursday submitted a
bill to the Great Hural (parliament) urging the government to
resign.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary group believes that the government's decision
to merge the state-owned Renovation Bank into the private Golomt
Bank not only violated the country's constitution and laws but
also posed threat to national economic security and financial
policies, the local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government's wrong decision has led to a crisis in the
parliament, said the MPRP members.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid a worse situation, they asked Prime Minister
Tsakhya Elbegdory's government to resign.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural is expected to make a decision on the matter
soon.
</P>
<P>
The government faced strong opposition from the MPRP after it
decided to allow the two banks to merge on May 27.
</P>
<P>
The MPRP bloc in parliament has since then refused to attend
Great Hural meetings, paralyzing parliament since June.

<HEADLINE> Warner Generates Huge Revenues from Selling DVDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Warner Brothers, one of the
giant movie-makers in Hollywood, has generated more than 110
million U.S. dollars from selling new digital videodiscs, or DVDs,
according to reports reaching here late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Warren Lieberfarb, president of Home Video
(a unit of Warner Brothers), disclosed the figure at a working
luncheon with software dealers in Las Vegas, where a trade show
was going on.
</P>
<P>
He said Warner Brothers and several other studios in Hollywood
began selling DVDs in seven test markets in the spring of 1997
with a national launch last summer.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes DVD can reach a penetration level of 10
percent of U.S. households by 2002.
</P>
<P>
DVD is a new technology designed to play back movies, much like
videotapes play in VCRs. But the new digital medium offers a
crisper picture and clearer sound.
</P>
<P>
Many experts believe DVDs will eventually replace VCRs in most
U.S. homes. Lieberfarb said DVD can become a long-lasting product
in the marketplace.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A senior government official Thursday criticized the United
States negotiating team for being "inconsistent" - initially
accepting and endorsing Israeli proposals, but then repudiating
them after receiving negative reactions from Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) leaders.
</P>
<P>
The official denied that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had said the U.S. would terminate its mediation effort by the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinians do not intend to accept any changes to the
U.S. plan for the second further redeployment in the West Bank, a
Palestinian minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PNA Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi also complained that
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ignored all
U.S. deadlines, and that the Americans have not put enough
pressure on Israel to accept its initiative.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- There will be increasing chances of war in the Middle East
next year if the current stalemate in the peace process goes on,
according to an Israeli army intelligence assessment.
</P>
<P>
The assessment said that the Syrians are equipping them with
medium-range ground-to-ground missiles, the Palestinians are
training special units to attack Jewish settlements and Egypt is
purchasing new missiles.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Urge Development of Social Sciences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the prestigious
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) said here today that
President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders have recently
urged the greater development of social sciences.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, he said that Jiang has conveyed
his greetings to researchers at the CASS and instructed that this
sector become a more flourishing one.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, new CASS president and a member of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has
also expressed his hope that research work be stepped up for
China's invigoration in the 21st century, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
These developments show that esteem for intellectuals has
reached a new level, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Their social status rose in the late 1970s when Deng Xiaoping
decided that intellectuals should play a significant role in the
country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, a widespread debate on the criterion of truth
20 years ago, which laid the foundation for China's reform and
opening, has demonstrated that social sciences are vital to
the evolution of human race.
</P>
<P>
Li asked the CASS to attain a level equal to the best research
institutes in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, Marxism should be adhered to by the
researchers, who at the same time must create an open and free
academic environment by further emancipating minds.
</P>
<P>
The CASS spokesman said that the 21-year-old academy, with
3,000 researchers, has decided that 98 programs should receive
special subsidies to increase pure academic research and provide
practical suggestions for decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
These subjects include China's economic growth mode, an
economic history of the People's Republic, modern Chinese,
archaeology, forecasts of the Chinese economy and social
development, and the welfare system in state enterprises, he
said.

<HEADLINE> International Observers to Arrive in Cambodia for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 10 (Xinhua) -- About 470 international
observers are expected to arrive in Cambodia next week to oversee
the country's general elections on July 26, according to the U.N.
Electoral Assistance Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The first 22 observers will arrive from Canada Sunday, followed
by delegations from more than 30 countries and NGOs throughout the
week. Eight Chinese observers will arrive on July 14.
</P>
<P>
The observers will be divided into 235 two-person mobile
monitoring teams, which will each visit about six polling stations
on the election day. They will get a view of 1,300-1,500 stations,
or about 10 percent of all polling booths.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Joint International Observer Group, the umbrella
organization for all international observers, will have enough
monitors to judge whether the elections are free and fair.
</P>
<P>
The international observers will cooperate with 500,000
Cambodian observers, who are expected to be posted at most polling
booths.
</P>
<P>
However, some political parties and human rights groups called
for still more foreign observers, saying that the presence of more
foreign observers is very important to the confidence of the
voters, who are evidently concerned whether the elections will be
free, fair and credible.

<HEADLINE> Intelligence Predicts Confrontations Among Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli General Security
Service (GSS) has warned that extremist Jewish groups could
prepare to take violent, including armed, action against other
Jews, local daily Haartz reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report on the security situation of the country,
GSS said that the confrontations could take place in case of the
further withdrawal of Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government is currently under pressure from the United
States and the Palestinians to accept an American initiative,
which calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to
the Palestinians in the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing parties urged the government to make an
immediate resolution on the extent of the further withdrawal,
while the extreme right-wing parties warned that they would
topple the government if the redeployment was implemented.
</P>
<P>
The GSS noted that the confrontations among Jews could take
the form of organized violence against state institutions, against
 political leaders, or conflict between different groups within
Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
In the past, when the GSS's annual assessment did refer to
possible armed Jewish groups, it generally referred to potential
conspiracies to strike at Palestinians as a strategy to stall or
halt peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Now, for the first time in the organization's history, the GSS
report includes warnings of possible armed attacks by Jews on
Jews.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Warns Rebels of Continued Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine army's Sixth
Infantry Division Friday vowed to continue its assault against
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels in Pigcawayan,
Cotabato, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Major Rosque Garingalao, spokesman of the division, made the
warning one day after government troops and MILF rebels clashed
anew in the area.
</P>
<P>
Skirmishes in Pigcawayan started early Thursday after
patrolling government troops were ambushed by heavily-armed
rebels, Garingalao said.
</P>
<P>
He said the army was forced to use attack helicopters and heavy
artillery as some 200 rebels resisted with machine-guns and other
high-power firearms.
</P>
<P>
Garingalao claimed that there were no casualties on the
government side despite a whole-day gun battle Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MILF Vice Chairman for Military Affairs Al Haj Murad
appealed to the military to stop air strikes and artillery
shelling, saying local civilians were severely affected by the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday, some 1,000 residents have reportedly fled to
safer places to avoid being caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, currently the largest rebel group in the country, has
been engaged in peace talks with the government for the past few
years, but the two parties have made little progress toward
reaching a final peace agreement.

NICOSIA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market headed
upwards this week, exhibiting signs of restored investor
confidence to a certain extent, a market report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said the CISCO All-Share Index closed

Three out of the five trading sessions of this week saw the

</P>
<P>
The market was reinforced by Thursday's advance to 427.1
points achieved amidst relatively high investment activity for the
period.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was contained to lower levels this week and was
3.7 million Cyprus pounds (about 7.4 million U.S. dollars) from
4.3 million pounds (about 8.6 million dollars) the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Havel to Appoint Zeman as Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel
announced Thursday that he will appoint the central leftist Social
Democrat Party (CSSD) leader Milos Zeman as the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Havel said at a press conference that before making the
appointment, he will accept the resignation of Josef Tosovsky's
caretaker government, and discuss the new cabinet line-up with
Zeman.
</P>
<P>
The CSSD, meanwhile, signed a surprise deal with the right-wing
Civic Democratic Party (ODS) to form a minority government,
sharing the power of government and parliament between them.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, which was immediately criticized as "political
trickery," Klaus, hitherto Zeman's arch rival on the Czech
political stage, will be given for his party the posts of speakers
in the two houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ODS agreed not to dissolve parliament by bringing a
no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
It also gives the ODS the chairmanship of the key parliamentary
budget committee.
</P>
<P>
Last month's ballots gave the CSSD 74 seats in the 200-seat
parliament, against 63 for the ODS.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Has to Apply for License in Person </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- On the first day Mike Tyson
could apply for a new license back to the ring, Newada boxing
officials made it clear Thursday they want to hear from Tyson
directly before doing anything.
</P>
<P>
"I want to hear from Mike directly," said Marc Ratner,
executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission. "I will need
to talk to him before we do anything."
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Tyson was fined 3 million U.S. dollars and his
license was revoked after biting Holyfield's ears. Thursday was
the date when Tyson was eligible to apply for a new license that
would allow him to return any competitions.
</P>
<P>
But no such request had been made by the time commission
offices closed for the day. "As far as I know, nobody has given us
anything in writing to indicate they are representing Mike Tyson,"
said James Nave, a commission member.

<HEADLINE> Top Academy Not to Design Political Reform Blueprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) has not been assigned the job of drawing up a plan
to reform China's political structure, an academy spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that some overseas newspapers have
reported that the CASS has received the task from the central
government of drawing up plans for political reform, and that some
researchers have already begun working on the program. "The
reports are totally groundless," he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the CASS is carrying out a research program
concerning the improvement of a legal system and democracy in
China, but this has nothing to do with a so-called "political
reform plan."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the academy has been studying
socialist democracy and the legal system for some time, and among
the newly designed 98 research programs there are such items, but
these are merely academic discussions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as China's top social science research institute,
the CASS will continue to study these important issues, and its
work has the full backing from the central government.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reports Steady Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese capital,
scored comparatively rapid economic growth during the first six
months of the year, according to information released at the
ongoing meeting covering the local economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The city's gross domestic product (GDP) for the January-June
period hit 83.9 billion yuan (10.1 billion US dollars), up 9.1
percent on last year's same period in terms of constant prices.
</P>
<P>
The service sector reported the most rapid growth in output,
with the total value-added for the industry rising by 13.3 percent
to 45.87 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Zhenyu, director of the Beijing Municipal Planning
Commission, attributed the growth to increased investment. Fixed
asset investments during the period stood at 32.46 billion yuan,
up 28.3 percent on the 1997 period.

<HEADLINE> Albania Cautiously Welcomes Group's Statement on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government Thursday
cautiously welcomed the statement issued by the six-nation Contact
Group on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said in a statement that
Albania supported the international community in its continuous
efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
During the Bonn meeting on Wednesday, the Contact Group called
for an immediate cease-fire in Kosovo to pave the way for
continuous dialogue on the future of the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The group also agreed to seek a resolution of the United
Nations Security Council to press for this demand, and guarantee
the safety of international observers operating in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Nano said Albania welcomes the decision made by the Contact
Group on the involvement of international mediators in the
negotiations between Belgrade and the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, Nano said it was too early to hold talks on the status
of Kosovo under the prevailing situation in which the Serbian
authorities had not withdrawn their troops from Kosovo, nor
stopped the oppression.
</P>
<P>
Describing the withdrawal of the Serbian forces as the core
issue for a final solution to the Kosovo crisis, Nano said he did
not see any positive changes in Kosovo because Belgrade still
adhered to its previous stands.
</P>
<P>
The international community should not get excited by sporadic
moves taken by Belgrade, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nano also proposed linking the restoration of Yugoslav seats in
some world organizations with its efforts to end the Kosovo
conflict. The efforts must be based on the respect of the will of
the Kosovo people, and on international norms.
</P>
<P>
A report from Belgrade said the Yugoslav authorities would not
reject the Contact Group's proposal on the determination of the
status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Austrian Foreign Secretary Albert Roan, who
is on a visit to Yugoslavia, as saying that Yugoslavia is enacting
a scheme on the autonomous status for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia would act with caution on the issue, Roan added.
</P>
<P>
During talks between Roan and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivorad
Jovanovic, both sides noted that a lasting and peaceful solution
to the Kosovo problem would come only through unconditional
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population in
the Serbian province of Kosovo, are seeking independence from
Belgrade which stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1991. Hundreds
of people have died since February, 1998 when armed conflicts
escalated tensions there into a crisis.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Compromise Over Caspian Sea Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Caspian Sea's littoral
countries should make compromise over dividing the vast oil
reserves under the seabed, Russian presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembski said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembski highly spoke of the agreement Russia and
Kazkhastan signed Monday on the line of their borders under the
northern Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
On the rejection of the agreement by Iran and Turkmenistan, the
Russian presidential spokesman said that there is difference on
the issue between the five countries bordering the sea.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov will travel to
Iran to hold talks with the Iranian government on the issue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and Turkmenistan President
Saparmurat Niyazov issued a joint statement on Wednesday,
demanding that all the five states should get an equal share of
the resources under the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued in Ashkhabad, capital of Turkmenistan,
said that the Russia-Kazakhstan agreement created obstacles in the
way of reaching consensus on the status of the Capsian Sea among
the five countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran, no longer opposed to dividing the sea, lined up with
Turkmenistan, agreed to divide both the seabed and the water body
into five parts -- one part for each country, but leaving the
central part of the sea under the common control of all the five
countries.
</P>
<P>
Niyazov has reportedly planned to propose a Caspian Sea summit
meeting in this fall to coordinate positions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea, the largest inland sea in the world, is
thought to have the third greatest oil reserves after those of the
Gulf and Siberia, equivalent to 13-15 billion tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian parliament Thursday enacted
a new act, giving the law-enforcing agencies more teeth against
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law which revoked the 1996 law on prevention of
money laundering, those engaging in money laundering are liable to
an imprisonment of three to 12 years, a fine of up to 30 million
leva (about 16,600 U.S. dollars) and confiscation of all or part
of their properties.
</P>
<P>
Officials who violate the law will face a sentence of up to one
year in prison and be fined 1 to 3 million leva (about 550 to
1,650 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A financial investigation bureau will be set up under the
Finance Ministry to process information about financial
transactions carried out by banks, insurance companies, investment
groups, privatization funds, brokers and other economic entities.
</P>
<P>
They are obliged to keep information on any client involved in
a transaction worth more than 30 million leva and inform the
bureau if suspicion arises about money laundering activities.
</P>
<P>
But the requirements do not apply to political parties and some
non-profit organizations.

<HEADLINE> Slide in Interbank Lending Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's interbanking market
handled 48.1 billion yuan in transactions on 124 trading days in
the first half of this year, according to statistics from the
China Foreign Exchange Trading System.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show a 388 million yuan daily turnover rate on
average for the period.
</P>
<P>
The continual decline in the lending and borrowing amount has
mainly been attributed to two central bank interest rate
reductions which caused the interbank lending rate to plummet by
6.5 percent monthly, with the June turnover falling to 11.6
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Seven new banks were granted approval to join in interbank
lending and borrowing, with a total of 142 commercial banks and
subsidiary branches holding the right as of June 5.
</P>
<P>
The Jan-June turnover for China's interbank bond trading stood
at 1.5 billion yuan. Some 32.5 billion yuan of repurchased bonds
changed hands, with the daily trading volume averaging 241 million
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Swedish, Finnish Coast Guards Clear up Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Swedish and Finnish coast guards,
on Thursday, were cleaning up an oil spill nine kilometers long
and 50 meters wide near the island of Aland, off the central
Swedish coast.
</P>
<P>
They were also investigating a Liberian gas tanker over the
spillage.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the coast guards said the spillage was reported
late on Wednesday by a German aircraft flying into Stockholm's
international airport, Arlanda.
</P>
<P>
The oil slick had moved south and was now near Aland and the
mainland port of Gisslehamn, 100 kilometers north of
Stockholm. Finnish coast guards joined the clean-up after the oil
slick reached Finnish waters.
</P>
<P>
According to the coast guards spokesman, the oil is not
threatening the coastline and the clean-up process is relatively
simple and will be completed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish coast guard had stopped a Liberian gas tanker,
suspected of leaking the oil, at the northern Swedish port of Umea.
</P>
<P>
Several oil samples were taken from the ship. If the ship is
proved to be the culprit, it will be billed about 7500 U.S.dollars
for the clean-up operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's population is estimated
to have reached 46.4 million in fiscal 1997-98 ending March,
maintaining an annual growth of about 800,000 or 1.84 percent,
according to the latest report on the country's financial,
economic and social conditions.
</P>
<P>
Of the total estimated 46.4 million, the male population
accounts for 23.04 million or 49.66 percent while the female
represents 23.36 million or 50.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that 15.45 million or 33.3 percent of the
population are in the age group under 15, 27.4 million or 59.05
percent in the working-age group of 15-59, and 3.55 million or
7.65 percent in the age group of 60 and above.
</P>
<P>
The population proportion of the working-age group of 15-59
increased from 56.46 percent in 1987-88 to 59.05 percent in
1997-98, and that of the group of 60 and above rose from 6.23
percent to 7.65 percent, while that of the under-15 group declined
from 37.31 percent to 33.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the last 10 years, the dependency ratio has fallen from
77.11 percent to 69.34 percent due to the increase in the
population of the working-age group.
</P>
<P>
The total employment is estimated at 18.36 million in 1997-98
in various sectors, with 11.5 million in agriculture, 1.7 million
in trade and 1.6 million in processing and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimation, Myanmar's population is to reach
68.5 million in the year 2020 if the present annual growth rate
of 1.84 percent is maintained.
</P>
<P>
The country's population, which stood at 16 million in 1941 and
35.5 million in 1983, has more than doubled in 42 years.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has drafted a population policy to ensure a rational
ratio between the country's population and area, and laid out
plans, including a children's development project, to guarantee
health and fitness for all families.

The two countries also promised in their accord that they would
make joint efforts to fight against terrorist activities in all
forms, ensure the non-proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, and reduce the destabilizing factors in the region.
</P>
<P>
Among differences between Italy and Libya, which was an Italian
colony from 1911 to 1943, has been the questions of financial
compensation for the colonial period, and removal of the land
mines left over there in Libya from the wartime period.
</P>
<P>
In the just signed agreement, Rome expressed "regrets for the
colonial period," and would provide for demining Libyan terrain of
World War II-era land mines, as well as the building of a center
to care for land mine victims.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Foreign Ministry said in the statement that its
policy vis-a-vis Libya is part of its overall policy toward the
Mediterranean region, which is aiming at eliminating all sorts of
antagonism and tension, and establishing cooperative relations
among countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Dini said in an interview with the Italian newspaper La
Repubblica (The Republic) Thursday that the defrosting of
relations with Libya is of great significance to the security in
the Mediterranean, because it meant the removal of tension in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Despite their past discords, Rome and Tripoli have established
strong economic and trade ties. In 1997, Italian imports, mostly
oil, totalled almost 4 billion U.S. dollars, while exports to
Libya reached about 880 million dollars.

<P>
VALLETTA, Malta, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese commodities are
competitive in many aspects and they will have a considerable
slice of market share here, Maltese President Ugo Mifsud Bonnici
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while he was visiting the
Chinese Hall at the annual Malta International Exposition, which
is being attended by exhibitors from China, France, Germany,
Britain, the United States, Italy, Libya, Pakistan and Malta.
</P>
<P>
China-made light industry products, electronic home appliances,
and other commodities should be selling well here because the
Maltese people had enjoyed the good quality of Chinese goods over
a long time, President Bonnici told Chinese exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
The Maltese people are familiar with the Chinese products and
they like them, he added.
</P>
<P>
So Chinese commodities should have their market in Malta and
will enjoy a considerable slice of the market share, because they
are competitive in many aspects.
</P>
<P>
The most welcomed Chinese products at the exposition, the 41st
of its kind, included car television sets, which are made in
China's southern Fujian Province, fishing rods from Guangdong
Province, and cosmetics made in Beijing, an official of the
Chinese delegation said.

<P>
DHAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The budget session of the
Bangladeshi parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, ended here Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
The parliament went into the budget session, the ninth session
of the country's Seventh Parliament, on June 10. The national
budget for the 1998-99 fiscal year beginning July 1 was placed
before the House by Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria the next
day and was passed on June 30.
</P>
<P>
In her winding up speech at the parliament, Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina called upon opposition members of parliament to
attend parliamentary proceedings regularly.
</P>
<P>
"She (Leader of Opposition in parliament Begum Khaleda Zia) has
so far neither attended any meeting of the Jatiya Sangsad Business
Advisory Committee nor she attended the proceedings of the House
regularly -- giving a clear impression that she does not believe
in parliamentary system," Hasina said.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition the Bangladesh Nationalist Party walked
out of the eighth session of the parliament in early May when
three hill district council bills designed to give legal effect to
the Chittagong Hill Tracts peace treaty, signed between the
government and the hill tribals last December, were taken up for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
The BNP members of parliament, accusing the Speaker of failing
to maintain "neutrality" and protested against "limited
discussion" on the bills, have since remained absence from
parliament proceedings for most the time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief Whip of the Opposition Khandaker Delwar
Hossain on Thursday urged the Treasury Bench, particularly the
Leader of the House (Hasina) to "behave in a manner" that would
make the parliament effective.
</P>
<P>
"Her language should not be a language of attack or quarrel,"
Delwar said.
</P>
<P>
"Greater responsibility lies on the stronger shoulder, the
greater leader... leader of the house," and "It is the duty of
the leader of the House to unite the whole country and invite us
(Opposition) in the process," he added.

<HEADLINE> Disney Criticized for Scenes of Violence, Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Walt Disney Co. was criticized
Thursday by a committee of the Texas Board of Education, which
threatens to sell 45-million-U.S.-dollar Disney stock because the
company's movies are too sexy and violent.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it (sale of Disney stock) sends a message to Miramax
Films (a Disney unit) that the public in this country has had
enough of the violence in these movies. How many more school
shootings do you want? " Board Chairman Jack Christie told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The education board runs the public school system in Texas and
controls the 17.6 billion U.S. dollar Permanent School Fund, in
which 406,000 shares of Disney stock are held.
</P>
<P>
Christie said he was convinced to sell the Disney stock after
American Family Association showed him clips from the
Miramax-produced black comedy "Pulp Fiction," which included
scenes of murder, drug usage and sadomasochism.
</P>
<P>
The committee's decision is subject to approval by the full
15-member board of education Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's exports during the
first five months of this year went up by 15.2 percent to 1.95
billion U.S. dollars from 1.70 billion dollars recorded in the
corresponding period of 1997, according to Central Bank Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the higher growth in May this year compared to
April had helped cumulative figures to look impressive. On a
monthly basis, the export performance in May was up by 23 percent
compared to the level in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Export growth during the first four months in 1998 was 13.1
percent in rupee terms and 4.9 percent in the U.S. dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
The growth is considered significant since it was from a higher
base of 1997. Last year the country's exports grew by over 13
percent compared to 7.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the export performance was encouraging in
view of the negative export growth experienced by some of the
southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.8 percent in
the first quarter of 1998 over the corresponding period of last
year which was 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank is monitoring the economic performance on a
quarterly basis now as a prudent measure to provide an update on
overall and sectoral trends of the economy.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of 1998 agricultural exports
achieved the highest growth of 25.6 percent supported by the tea
sector performance of 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rubber exports dropped by 44.8 percent and coconut dropped by
49 percent. Industrial exports increased by 13.7 percent and
textiles by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Thursday approved
an interest-free credit of 50 million U.S. dollar equivalent for
the Ghana Trade and Investment Gateway Project.
</P>
<P>
This project will seek to increase the competitiveness of
Ghanaian products in the global market through the reform of the
legislative, regulatory and incentive systems, institutional
strengthening and capacity building, as well as development of
private participation in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The project will also address the issue of inadequate
infrastructure by supporting the development of Free Trade Zones.
</P>
<P>
"Vision 2020," a long-term development program designed by the
government, seeks to create an environment that actively promotes
the flow of foreign capital and resources, that lowers the cost of
doing business in Ghana and provides infrastructure services of
international quality to investors.
</P>
<P>
This plan aims to develop Ghana into a hub in West Africa for
import, export, storage, assembly, distribution, processing,
manufacturing, and trans-shipment of passengers, goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's National Park Free From Attacks: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua) - The authority of Sri Lanka's
National Park at Yala in the deep south, which was harassed by
Tamil rebels last year, Thursday declared the park safe for
visitors, reports reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) infiltrated the park and launched sporadic attacks on
visitors and officials of the park's administration.
</P>
<P>
After the attacks visitors had been afraid to visit the park
where LTTE cadres acted at will.
</P>
<P>
The park's administration was then placed under military
control, with guards stationed in all parts of the park to carry
out regular patrols to prevent LTTE members from penetrating into
the park.
</P>
<P>
The park authority said rumors that the park was still unsafe
were aimed at continuing hunting, cultivation of narcotics and
illicit felling of timber in the park.
</P>
<P>
Such activities have been curbed and now the park is free from
both LTTE rebels and other racketeers, said the reports, adding
that visitors both local and foreign will return as usual to visit
the park.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Investigates Firm Mismanagement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand' Central Bank is
investigating alleged mismanagement or fraud of seven finance
firms and four small banks taken over by the state, the bank's
Assistant Governor Ratakorn Nimwatana has said.
</P>
<P>
The investigation also covered the 56 financial institutions
shut down soon after the devaluation of the baht on July 2 last
year, Ratakorn was quoted by Friday's Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ratakorn also disclosed that the Central Bank will initiate a
lawsuit against a former financial executive of a "large"
financial company for authorizing undercollaterized loans.
</P>
<P>
He did not give his name on grounds of damaging the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has already filed several lawsuits against
executives of three failed finance companies. Poor management of
the companies was one of the factors that led to the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ratakorn said the probe mainly focused on high-profile
executives and big-name financial companies.
</P>
<P>
It was the policy of the Central Bank to assign priority on
the probe against large firms which have a greater impact on the
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Central Bank Governor Chatumongol Sonakul had
agreed to reassign the bank's staffers who were previously
assigned to supervising the closure of finance firms to assist in
the investigation against former financial executives.
</P>
<P>
The assignment will help speed up efforts to bring the culprits
to court, he said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Build One More Union Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will build another union
highway between Nawnghkio and Lashio in the northeastern Shan
state, following the completion of the Lashio-Muse highway in the
north late last year.
</P>
<P>
The official New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Friday that
the Nawnghkio-Lashio road will be renovated and upgraded by a
local private company, the Asia World Co., under a second contract
reached between the company and the Public Works of the Myanmar
Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The Asia World company started to build the 163-kilometer(km)
Lashio-Muse highway, which runs up to the northern end of the
country towards China's southern city of Ruili in Yunnan province,
in July 1996 under its first contract with the Public Works, and
finished the road in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
The renovation and upgrading of roads in northeastern Myanmar
has facilitated the development of Myanmar's border areas and
boosted its border trade with China.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 1,553 km of
highways were built in Myanmar in the 1997-98 fiscal year which
ended in March, extending the country's highways to a total length
of 29,844 km.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Laos to Tighten Fiscal Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has suggested that Laos tighten its fiscal and monetary
policies to stop a further fall in the exchange rate, higher
inflation and worsening of its banking system.
</P>
<P>
"Executive directors expressed deep concern about the
deteriorating macro-economic performance in 1997 and 1998 (in
Laos)," the IMF revealed in an annual review, which was available
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Laos' currency kip has depreciated by almost 70 percent to the
U.S. dollar, contributing to a sharp rise in annual inflation
which stood at more than 60 percent in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF review said that it had been a mistake not to introduce
tax measures in last September's budget to improve the tax base
and that their recent implementation would have only a limited
effect on the current year's fiscal performance.
</P>
<P>
It said the monetary policy in 1997 had failed to curb rapid
credit growth, which had fed into higher inflation and a falling
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"They (IMF directors) urged the authorities to act quickly to
raise interest rates to positive real levels, and to contain
credit expansion," the review said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Stands for Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany hopes that the conflicting
parties in Kosovo can find a political solution to the Kosovo
crisis, German Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of his one-day visit
to Albania, Kinkel said that Germany does not support the
separation of Kosovo from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The international community will not hesitate to carry out the
NATO's intervention plan if a political solution can not be found,
Kinkel warned.
</P>
<P>
The demand for Kosovo's independence will never have support
from the international community and the Albanian government
should do everything possible to prevent the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo from being involved in acts which could aggravate the
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel arrived here immediately after the five-nation Contact
Group ended its meeting on Kosovo issues Wednesday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Albania, he met Albanian President Rexhep
Mejdani and Prime Minister Fatos Nano and visited the refugee
camps set up in the border areas between Albania and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Kinkel also flew to Skopje, capital of Macedonia,
to talk with Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj Handziski on the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, he urged Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic to exert pressure on both sides involved in the conflict
to stop fighting.

<HEADLINE> Birthing Study Shows Walking No Help in Childbirth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Guidebooks on pregnancy and
childbirth usually recommend walking around to help cut labor
time, but the advice has been knocked down by a new study.
</P>
<P>
Women who pace out their first hours in labor rather than
remaining sitting or lying have no better or worse deliveries than
those who stay put, the report of the New England Journal of
Medicine said.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center in Dallas. Over an 11-month period, 1,067 women
with uncomplicated pregnancies took part in the test, with half
randomly assigned to walk during the first hours of active uterine
contractions, the other half to wait things out in their rooms
attended by nurses and aides.
</P>
<P>
Of the 530 women assigned to walk, only 380 did with several
hundred slow steps over about an hour. Those who didn't were too
far advanced in their labor to start out. But walking had no
apparent effect on any significant outcome that could be measured.
</P>
<P>
Those bearing their first child in the two groups spent about
7.5 hours in the early stage of labor and about an hour actually
delivering the baby. Times were reduced but similar for women who
had delivered before.
</P>
<P>
The condition and health of the babies delivered by the two
groups were indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although there is no medical reason for
walking during labor, it does seem, for some women, to improve
their satisfaction with the labor experience.
</P>
<P>
Walking around, or at least staying in an upright position,
have become hallmarks of most of the prepared childbirth systems
promoted and taught today. Several popular guidebooks mention
research that indicates walking helps cut labor time by an hour,
or 30 percent, or lessens dependence on drugs.
</P>
<P>
Doctors participating in the new study said the trials that led
to the earlier advice were done nearly two decades ago and
involved just 82 women.
</P>
<P>
Two other random trials published about the same time,
involving 670 women, found no difference in labor time.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers to Popularize Use of Clean Fuel Made of Straw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A gasified straw fuel is being
recognized as an environmental friendly and cheap energy for daily
use in China's rural area, according to a meeting source here in
east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Jointly held by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the
Ministry of Agriculture and the State General Administration of
Environmental Protection, the meeting voiced that the use of
gasified straw fuel can avoid waste and pollution resulted from
straw burning.
</P>
<P>
Straw is one of the most popular traditional burning stuffs for
rural living. In China, a largest agricultural country in the
world, 600 million tons of straw of various kinds are yielded
every year, with 200 million tons burnt for cooking.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in some better-off rural areas where coal brick and
LPG are becoming popular fuel stuffs, piling straws, weighing 100
million tons, are just burnt in the fields every year, emiting
huge smoke into the air.
</P>
<P>
Black smoke produced by such practices in Chengdu, capital of
Sichuan Province caused suspending and canceling of 61 flights in
the Shuangliu International Airport in May. It has been the most
serious flight delay accident in China which is caused by
pollution.
</P>
<P>
To this count, the state environment protection department has
vowed to coordinate the spreading of the new clean fuel. A
professional estimate suggests that one million tons of dust
pollutant and 600,000 tons of sulphur dioxide can be eliminated,
should a tenth of the villages in China burn straw gas in stead of
using coal.
</P>
<P>
A straw gasifying facility consumes 200 tons of straw and
generates 400,000 cu.m. gas fuel a year equivalent to the energy
produced by 192 tons of coal or 36 tons of LPG. The gas costs a
household 33.9 yuan a month nearly as cheap as coal and 40 percent
cheaper than LPG.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey made in Shandong shows that 75 percent of the
surveyed farmers preferred straw gas. So far, the province has set
up 54 of the said facilities benefiting 8,000 households.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mount Merapi On Full Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Residents around Indonesia's
volcano Mount Merapi in Central Java were on full alert on
Thursday after a super-hot steam cloud gushed from its crater,
local press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Atje Purbawinata, a volcanologist in Yogyakarta, said small
lava flows and tremors had been recorded within the mountain,
pointing to the possibility of an eruption.
</P>
<P>
"People are on the alert. The situation can change very
quickly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists monitoring the increased activity within Mount
Merapi said the cloud roared down the western face of its cone for
750 meters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, a much larger steam cloud flattened a village farther
down the slope, killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning
others.
</P>
<P>
Another volcanologist Radomo Purbo told reporters that lava
flows from Merapi should prompt officials to evacuate local
residents from the area soon.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968-meter mountain, 400 kilometers east of Jakarta, is
the most active of 127 Indonesia volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
The last eruption of Merapi was in January 1997, when more than
8,000 nearby villagers had to be evacuated after the volcano
spewed hot gas, ash and lava.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Fire-Stricken Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday visited fire-stricken Florida, where he declared 34
counties disaster areas and announced new federal assistance for
the local people suffering from the fires.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also praised the firefighters for their work in keeping
the wildfires from consuming whole communities in the state.
</P>
<P>
The president met with firefighters and local residents who
lost everything in Volusia County, which was hit hard by fires.
Many of the families in the county were renting and had no
insurance, and are now living in hotels or with relatives.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sorry for what you're going through," Clinton told
them.
</P>
<P>
The federal assistance that Clinton announced includes a Labor
Department grant of up to 1 million U.S. dollars for hiring 200
temporary workers to help clean up charred areas, restore roads
and assist at shelters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the entire state is now eligible for emergency
loans through the Department of Agriculture to help compensate for
the loss of 63,000 hectares of forest worth 185 million dollars,
and another 243,000 hectares of crops by an ongoing drought.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said the main purpose of his visit was to praise
the more than 7,000 firefighters and volunteers from most of the
50 states.
</P>
<P>
"You did show our country at its best," Clinton said. "You
showed people what the meaning of community is and why we really
do depend on each other."
</P>
<P>
Wildfires have scorched more than 196,000 hectares since late
May. At least 350 homes and businesses were destroyed, three
people died and more than 100 others injured.
</P>
<P>
It has cost more than 104 million dollars to fight the blazes,
which have caused about 276 million dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
Florida Governor Lawton Chiles said that while the fires are
largely out, there is still a threat of flare-ups because the
state still needs rain.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Bans Raw Seafood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGDONG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Weeks of flooding and sweltering
heat have forced the Guangzhou municipal government to issue a
three-month ban starting this week on eating sashimi in the city,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind in this capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, the ban is valid from July 3 to September
30. Any violators will be severely punished, according to the
official notice.
</P>
<P>
The notice blames raw seafood as a key factor in the increasing
number of cases of cholera, dysentery and other widespread
infectious intestinal diseases appearing this summer.
</P>
<P>
Easily infected by bacteria that flourish in the summer heat,
all seafood now has to be served after thorough cooking, including
shellfish.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the chance of seafood becoming infected is much
higher this year, as the province is now challenged by the worst
flood that may occur once a century.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the ban will be another strike against the
local fishing industry, which has already been severely damaged by
the provincial floods during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Also, the ban makes no exception for sashimi imported from
abroad, which will force local expensive restaurants and hotels to
strike the popular dishes off their menus.
</P>
<P>
Officials warned it's very dangerous for sashimi lovers to eat any
of this favored delicacy in this season, even if they go to other
cities in the Pearl River Delta for their feasts.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A powerful earthquake struck
Anchorage and its surrounding areas of the southern U.S. state of
Alaska Thursday morning, sending people running into the streets,
the U.S. news media reported.
</P>
<P>
There was no serious damage or injuries because of its remote
location.
</P>
<P>
The quake, measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, struck at 11:40
(1940 GMT) and was centered 200 kilometers southwest of Anchorage,
the largest city of the state with a population of 250,000.
</P>
<P>
It was felt in Anchorage, Kodiak, Fairbanks, Palmer and

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Since June 23, nearly 80 percent of
the polluted water of Daming Lake has been channeled into a sewage
treatment plant in a suburb of Jinan, the capital of east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Situated north of Mount Tai and south of the Yellow River,
Jinan has unique topography which made it known as the "city of
springs." By the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234) the city had reported 72
springs. Daming lake is the convergence of these springs, with
46.7 hectares of water surface.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of Daming Lake said that because of a
lack of sewage treatment facilities, domestic and industrial waste
water was being released into Daming Lake at a rate of 30,000
cubic meters per day.
</P>
<P>
This year, silt was cleared from the lake, and some of the
charm should be restored to the city of springs.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Pledges to Meet This Year's Economic Growth Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the leading
manufacturing center in China, will work harder to meet this
year's goal of ten percent economic growth, according to Mayor Xu
Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the municipality generated 173.8
billion yuan in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first six
months of this year, up 9.4 percent over the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
To attain this year's goal, the city will have to realize an 11
percent economic growth in the last half of this year, explained
Mayor Xu, saying that economic growth may be attained if correct
policies are implemented.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has had an average economic growth of 13 percent over
the past six years. Early this year, the city adjusted its
economic growth for the year to ten percent by taking into account
the worsening macro environment caused by the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ren Shangen, head of the Industrial Economic Research Office of
the Shanghai Municipal Economic Commission, said 156 major
industrial manufacturers should intensify efforts to explore and
increase market shares in order to realize 11 percent economic
growth in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector was also told to find new ways of
investing and raising funds and intensifying technical progress to
foster new economic powerhouses by developing a group of
industrialized high-tech projects and upgrading pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of fund-raising channels will also be an
important task for the city in the remaining months of this year,
said Xu Xueshi, an official with the Development Center attached
to the Shanghai Municipal Government.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a joint-stock system, listing of enterprises,
floating bonds, establishing risk investment fund and investment
companies, and increasing mortgage loans for housing should all be
utilized in the search for new investment.
</P>
<P>
In the July-December period this year, the foreign trade sector is
trying to export 1.1 billion U.S. dollars more than it did during
the January-June period by continuing to practice a diverse-market
strategy, with the focus on expanding market in Europe, the United
States, Africa and the Middle East, and to increase the added value
of commodities for export.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Xu Kuangdi also urged various economic departments to
step up the structural adjustment in order to meet the demands of
economic globalization and the rapid growth of the market economy
in China.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Thursday met with a Palestinian delegation
amid indications that the Clinton administration was nearing the
end of its drive for a second withdrawal of Israeli troops from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Saed Erekat, a senior Palestinian
negotiator, was sent by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat who
talked on telephone with Albright on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was said Arafat agreed to a U.S. proposal for the Israeli
troops to withdraw from the 13 percent of territory of the West
Bank at the present stage although he had claimed 97 percent of
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian Cabinet minister said on Thursday the delegation
would not accept any more changes of the U.S. proposal, and Erekat
will listen "but will not renegotiate" over Israel's pullback.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting between Albright and the Palestinian
delegation, State Department spokesman James Rubin said: "We are
clearly in the end game. This cannot go on indefinitely."

<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and visiting Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori Thursday agreed
to enhance various cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman told reporters that the two leaders
held talks in London early Thursday and "signed a bilateral action
plan setting out how they could strengthen cooperation across the
economic, commercial and cultural spheres".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Blair and Fujimori also discussed the
Peruvian economic reforms, Latin America trade liberalization, the
Asian financial crisis and its impact on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Blair also thanked President Fujimori for the
Peruvian government's efforts in tackling the serious drugs
problems in Peru, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Peru accounts for half of the world's
annual output of cocaine, although the Peruvian government has cut
by half the number of hectares of land devoted to coca leaf
production over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The British government has reportedly provided some 250 million
pounds (about 410 million U.S. dollars) in aid to Peru to help the
country fund programs to switch to other crops.

<HEADLINE> China: Continued Efforts Should be Made in Implementing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The goals laid out in the
Platform for Action adopted at the Fourth World Conference and the
Non-governmental Organization Forum on Women held in Beijing in
1995 are still far from being fully achieved and the international
community should make continued efforts in this regard, Chinese
delegate stressed here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the high-level dialogue on world trade sponsored
by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, Chinese
Deputy Representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang said the
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action have laid out the
strategic goals of solving the problems facing women around the
world as well as actions needed in reaching these goals.
</P>
<P>
Shen said governments and non-governmental organizations of
various countries are translating the commitment made then into
action and more and more people have realized that gender
equality is an important yardstick in measuring the progress of
the society.
</P>
<P>
Shen said in order to implement the goals, it is necessary
for the operational activities of the United Nations system to
enhance the policy dialogue and coordination among the various
organizations at the headquarters and U.N. specialized agencies so
that they will act in unison, compliment each other and deepen
the impact of the assistance programs at the country level.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the various proposals and measures by the U.N.
Secretary-General such as capacity building, staff training,
time-bound targets, accountability and evaluation mechanisms are
very necessary.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China fully supports the inclusion of promoting
the advancement of women and emphasizes the role of the resident
coordinator in this respect at the country level so as to
highlight the importance of the promotion of the advancement of
women and truly give expression to the idea of involving the
gender issue in technical cooperation.

LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Office minister
Derek Fatchett will travel to Africa next week in an effort to
secure a ceasefire in southern Sudan and try to get more
international aid into the war-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett was quoted by Reuters as saying Thursday that he would
fly to Nairobi to meet representatives of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) and then travel to Khartoum to hold talks
with Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail.
</P>
<P>
"A temporary truce in the most hunger-affected areas is
essential if the Sudanese people are to be able to start
rebuilding their lives," Fatchett said.
</P>
<P>
"Agreement on corridors of tranquillity which enable aid to get
through would represent an important step in assisting those most
in need. I shall strongly encourage the parties to accept this
proposal." Fatchett added.
</P>
<P>
However, Fatchett made it clear that a long-term solution could
come only through a sustainable political settlement negotiated
between the conflicting parties in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Refereeing Still Needs Improvement: Blatter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The refereeing in the World Cup finals in
France still needed improvement despite that referees' general
performance had been satisfying, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper told a news conference: "Mr. Blatter
said that while FIFA were generally pleased with the standard of
refereeing at the World Cup, more works needed to be done to further
improve standards."
</P>
<P>
FIFA Disciplinary Committee Chairman Pablo Porta of Spain also
praised the World Cup referees in his report in a meeting of the FIFA
World Cup Organizing Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the committee had from time to time used video
evidence to help members better understand what had happened in a case
in point.
</P>
<P>
The committe had been blasted by Blatter earlier this month for
their failure to use video footages to sanction some players for their
unsportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
Blatter has dropped his original proposal to set up a permanent
Executive Board to speed the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
Instead he now proposed to hold more frequent meetings of the
Executive Committe itself, increasing the frequency to at least four
times a year from only twice as at present.
</P>
<P>
FIFA also said on Thursday that no change would be made on the
General Secretariat for the time being but an outside consultancy
agency would study its current structure and make suggestions on a
possible restructuring.
</P>
<P>
A restructuring, FIFA said, would "make it more functional and
better to reflect FIFA's de facto status as a major service
organization."
</P>
<P>
Blatter also suggested that the timing of future presidential
elections should be changed to avoid a clash with the World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
However, such a change would have to require a modification of the
FIFA Statutes by the Congress.

<HEADLINE> China's MFN Meets Little Resistance in US Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The renewal of China's MFN
seemed to have met little resistance in a Senate committee
Thursday despite concerns about a massive U.S. trade deficit with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Key members of the Senate Finance Committee indicated at a
hearing that China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status
should be extended for another year for the sake of U.S.
interests. Critics admitted that they could not gather enough
votes to overturn President Bill Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed to Congress early June that normal trade
relations should be maintained with China, the fourth largest
trading partner of the United States. The Congress has 90 days to
decide if they would go along with the president.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky were present at the hearing, trying to
convince the lawmakers of the importance of normal trade ties with
China. The U.S. is China's second largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that despite differences with China on such
touchy issues as human rights and trade, China's role in the world
economy should not be curbed by imposing high U.S. trade barriers
to its exports.
</P>
<P>
"There is no greater opportunity or challenge for U.S. foreign
policy than to encourage China's integration as a fully
responsible member of the international system," said Albright,
who accompanied President Clinton in his recent visit to China.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that restricting Chinese exports to the U.S. might
well cause China to devalue its currency with potentially dire
consequences for its neighbors, for China's own stability and for
markets worldwide including the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Denial of China's MFN could also hurt the U.S. exports, hike
U.S. consumer prices, set back China's economic reforms and damage
Hong Kong, and jeopardize China's cooperation on political issues
like non-proliferation, she warned.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky also believed that the MFN status is nothing but
normal trade relations that virtually all U.S. trading partners
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
"Normal trade relations are a fundamental part of engagement,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Senator William V, Roth, the committee chairman, shared the
belief, saying "Normal trade relations are the key to our
continued dialogue with China."
</P>
<P>
Senator Connie Mack and several other committee members,
critical of China and the administration's China policy,
acknowledged that they do not have the enough votes to stop the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
Even Mike Jendrzejaczyk of Human Rights Watch, who regularly
criticizes China on human rights issue, said:"We believe that
trade and economy engagement can be a catalyst to promote greater
openness and change from within China."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, concerns were voiced about the spiraling U.S. trade
deficit with China. According to U.S. statistics, the trade
imbalance reached nearly 50 billion U.S. dollars last year and is
heading toward 60 billion dollars this year. However the Chinese
figures are much smaller.
</P>
<P>
Albright called the deficit "deeply troubling," saying "it
cannot keep growing indefinitely." Barshefsky called on China to
move more quickly to meet the terms for joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
China wants to join the WTO as a developing country, but the
U.S. says that its economy is too large.
</P>
<P>
China's IMF has been debated on Capitol Hill annually in the
1990s. President Clinton and some congressmen have vowed to work
for a permanent solution to the problem, but it might take
time.

LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki met with Nigerian new leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar
Thursday, saying that he was very assured about the Nigerian
government's commitment to a rapid transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's visit is the first of its kind by a South African
leader since 1995. Relations between the two leading African
nations got strained by Nelson Mandela's strong criticism of
Nigeria's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who was speaking to the press after his meeting with
Abubakar, said his government is very concerned with the
situation in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said he listened to Abubakar's perspective of the country's
political future and was very assured about the military
government's commitment to a rapid transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa will make response after formal
announcement is made by the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who arrived in Nigeria Thursday, may meet some pressure
groups in Nigeria, according to a report by the Nigerian
Television Authority, quoting South African sources.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Launches Anti-Drug Media Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Speaker Newt Gingrich of the House of Representatives Thursday
announced an anti-drug campaign aimed at curbing teenager drug
abuse with one billion dollars of television, radio, newspaper and
Internet ads over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Starting Thursday night on network TV, the government campaign
intends to hit both parents and kids at least four times a week
with graphic images of drugs' destructiveness and children's
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
"These ads were designed to knock America upside the head and
get America's attention and empower all of you," Clinton told an
audience of mostly children at a ceremony in the World Congress
Center in Atlanta, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich pledged to try to win congressional approval for
expanding the 195 million one-year campaign into a five-year, one
billion taxpayer investment in stopping youth drug use.
</P>
<P>
A 1997 national survey showed half of high school seniors and
nearly one-third of eighth-graders reported using drugs.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come here today to stand with the president to say
that on a bipartisan basis -- Democrats and Republicans, the
legislative branch and the presidency -- we're all trying to reach
out to every young American and say, 'Don't do it,'" said
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug ads were in 75 Thursday morning newspapers.
Though the bulk of the campaign will focus on TV, ads will also
run on radio, billboards and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Barry R. McCaffrey, director of National Drug control Policy,
acknowledged it could be three years before anyone knows whether
the ads are actually driving down drug use.
