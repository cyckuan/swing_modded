<HEADLINE> Embassies a Legacy of The Golden Age  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In Washington's embassies, where crisis is
mellowed by the splash of fountains and diplomacy is practiced over
gleaming silver in frescoed rooms, nearly every stately facade
harbors a story.
</P>
<P>
   Not a few of these tales have nothing whatever to do with the
ebb and flow of relations between nations. Many of these diplomatic
mansions and mini-palaces had previous lives as a product of the
wealth that washed over the capital in the years between the Civil
War and World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Their original owners were the newly rich: moguls, tycoons,
merchant princes, gold-mine wonders and, in one case, a man who
found his fortune at the mouth of a beer bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Tom Walsh, for example. His 60-room extravaganza on
Massachusetts Avenue was built in hope it would be splendid enough
to welcome the king of Belgium. It is now the Embassy of Indonesia
and still splendid.
</P>
<P>
   When Walsh emigrated from Ireland to America in the middle of
the 19th century, his aim was to improve his place in life, not
entertain kings.
</P>
<P>
   A millwright's apprentice, Walsh went west in the 1870s,
discovered gold high in the Colorado Rockies and watched his bank
balance skitter upward like a runaway kite.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he moved to Washington in 1897 he was ready for some
serious spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each morning we Walshes arose richer than we had gone to
bed,'' his daughter, Evalyn Walsh McLean, said in her
autobiography, ''Father Struck it Rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh built his mansion on Massachusetts Avenue to entertain
King Leopold II of Belgium, whom he had met on a European tour. He
was so determined to make the king feel at home that he had his
architect duplicate the royal dining room.
</P>
<P>
   To Walsh's disappointment, Leopold never visited Washington. But
the house remained ready for royalty. In 1919, a decade after Walsh
died, his widow, Carrie, volunteered the mansion for a state dinner
in honor of Leopold's nephew and successor, King Albert.
</P>
<P>
   The table was set with gold from Walsh's Camp Bird Mine,
including gold candelabra and a gold table service.
</P>
<P>
   The family spending went on for years. Evalyn Walsh and her
husband, Ned McLean, bought the Hope Diamond, the world's largest
blue diamond. It is now the star of the gem and mineral collection
of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural
History.
</P>
<P>
   Another tycoon's money built the gray stone mansion a stroll
from the White House that first served the government of Russia in
1913.
</P>
<P>
   In those 87 years, the flag out front has changed from the
double-headed eagle of the czars to the red and yellow hammer and
sickle of the Soviet Union to the blue, white and red tricolor of
the Russian Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In the icier years of the Cold War, American guests ascended the
embassy's grand staircase under either a gigantic portrait of Josef
Stalin or an equally grim likeness of Vladimir Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   They were often amused to learn that this American outpost of
the Kremlin with its gilt-trimmed pillars, richly decorated salons
and gleaming lights held aloft by golden angels was built with
money inherited from George Pullman, the sleeping car magnate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, Edward Hamlin Everett, another Washington
multimillionaire, commissioned architect George Oakley Totten to
build a grand house backing up to Rock Creek Park.
</P>
<P>
   Totten presumably did not object to Everett's instructions:
''Cost is no object! And style and design are up to you!''
</P>
<P>
   Totten met both objectives, spending Everett's money freely and
imposing his own taste.
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Highsmith and Ted Landphair, writing in the 1992 book,
''Embassies of Washington,'' the source for these stories,
described how the new homeowner became rich.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everett earned his walking-around money in Texas oil and
Missouri beer, but he made his fortune on his patent for the
simple, crimped cap that sealed millions of bottles of that beer,
and soft drinks,'' they wrote. He quickly became known as ''The
Bottle-Top King.''
</P>
<P>
   The house Totten designed has a ballroom, conservatory,
hand-carved staircase, stained-glass bay windows, billiard room,
velvet-covered walls, teakwood floors, basement swimming pool and a
rooftop garden with a view of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Totten had recently visited Turkey and many of the exterior
details resemble houses he had seen along the Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
   That fact proved prophetic. The house has been home to
ambassadors from Turkey since 1933.

<HEADLINE> Embassy Construction Program Planned  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned about the security of U.S.
diplomats, the Clinton administration hopes to lay the groundwork
for construction of between 60 and 100 embassies over the next
decade, a top State Department official says.
</P>
<P>
   But there also is concern whether Congress will be willing to
pay for the work.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has given high priority to the issue since
the Aug. 7, 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in which 224 people, including 12 Americans, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden, a Saudi exile believed to be living in
Afghanistan, is wanted for the bombings, and there is concern he
may strike again.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said bin Laden's agents have been keeping U.S. embassies
under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last week that the
United States will continue to do what it can ''to try to hunt down
the terrorists. Their day will come, and there is no statute of
limitations, and we will pursue them as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster embassy security, the State Department official said,
the administration hopes to set in motion a process that will lead
to the construction of between six and 10 embassies a year over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   A commission headed by retired Adm. William Crowe, a former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has recommended that the
government spend $1.4 billion over 10 years to enhance the safety
of American diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The administration estimates that 85 percent of overseas
facilities do not meet minimum security requirements. Since the
1998 bombings, security upgrades have taken place at some overseas
posts. Still, officials say there is no substitute for having a
100-foot buffer zones separating these facilities from the nearest
public areas.
</P>
<P>
   Often, that means acquiring property and building new
installations, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers are taken aback by the staggering costs projected
for the security work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't keep spending $100 million on embassies,'' said Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the State Department is concerned about the potential
for a new round of terrorist activity, possibly linked to Monday's
anniversary of the East Africa bombings.
</P>
<P>
   A travel advisory issued in June advised American travelers to
keep the Aug. 7 anniversary in mind and to take appropriate
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Embassies around the world have been in a high state of alert
since the bombing and State Department officials were unaware of a
previous alert that lasted as long.
</P>
<P>
   As for bin Laden, the administration has had no success in
bringing him to justice.
</P>
<P>
   At U.S. prodding, the U.N. Security Council last year imposed
sanctions against Afghanistan for its refusal to hand bin Laden
over.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings last week, the United States and Russia agreed to
work together to further tighten the Security Council sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Culkin, Wife Call It Quits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Home Alone'' star Macaulay Culkin and his
actress wife of two years have separated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Macaulay Culkin and his wife Rachel Miner have temporarily
separated,'' the actor's publicist, Paul Bloch, said Sunday. ''It
is very amicable, and they remain the best of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Culkin, 20, and Miner, 19, met at New York's Professional
Children's School and wed on June 21, 1998, when both were age 17.
</P>
<P>
   Miner has appeared on Broadway in ''The Diary of Anne Frank''
and in the soap opera ''The Guiding Light.'' Culkin's other film
credits include ''My Girl,'' ''Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,''
''The Good Son,'' and ''Richie Rich.''

<HEADLINE> Harrison Ford Rescues Hiker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) -- Harrison Ford, the heroic rogue in
such movies as ''Star Wars'' and the ''Indiana Jones'' series, is
being credited with rescuing an ailing hiker from a mountain with
his helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah George, 20, and Megan Freeman, 22, were on a five-hour
climb of Table Mountain on July 31 when heat, altitude and
dehydration left George sick and unable to take more than a couple
steps. After another hiker called for help on a cell phone, Ford
was en route with his Bell 407 helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The part-time Jackson, Wyo., resident offers his flying skills
and helicopter for rescue missions, Teton County Sheriff Bob Zimmer
said. It saves the cost of hiring a private pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The actor landed his helicopter in a meadow and picked up
George; Freeman was told there wasn't enough room and had to hike
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was wearing a T-shirt and a cowboy hat,'' said George, who
didn't know Ford was the pilot until an emergency medical
technician on board made it clear. ''He didn't look like I'd ever
seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   With about a minute to go before landing at Jackson's St. John's
Hospital, the ailing George vomited into a hat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe I barfed in Harrison Ford's helicopter,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Blige Offers Aid To Victim's Family  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Mo. (AP) -- Grammy-winning singer Mary J. Blige is
offering support to the families of two black men fatally shot by
two white police officers during a drug raid.
</P>
<P>
   Blige briefly attended a rally Friday night at the restaurant
where Earl Murray and Ronald Beasley were shot June 12. Blige is a
supporter of the National Action Network, a civil rights
organization formed by the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 36, and Beasley, 36, were unarmed when they were shot in
Murray's car by undercover police. Police had planned to arrest
Murray on drug charges and said Beasley was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said the shootings were justified because Murray
tried to ram the officers with his car during the arrest. Relatives
and civil rights activists have suggested police used excessive
force because the men were shot numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings are under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: 'Hurt' by Attacks on Wife  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton says opponents of his
wife's run for the Senate from New York are trying to muddy the
campaign playing field through personal attacks intended to confuse
voters and unfairly incite resentment against her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the bottom line as far as he is concerned is that
Hillary Rodham Clinton is ''a good person'' and well qualified for
the Senate. ''The reason people ought to vote for her is, it's good
for them and for their kids and for their future.''
</P>
<P>
   The president commented Sunday as he concluded a whirlwind
weekend of fund-raising events that collected an estimated $525,000
for his wife's campaign. He planned to return to Washington
sometime Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that hurts me the most (is) if you listen to
the tenor of the campaign against her it's basically, 'Don't vote
for her because she's not from here; don't vote for her because why
is she doing this,'' Clinton said. ''Let me see if I can get you to
resent her.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to supporters on Martha's Vineyard who paid $1,000
apiece to hear from both Clintons, neither the president nor the
first lady mentioned the name of her opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio,
R-N.Y. Nor did Clinton cite examples of allegedly unfair
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said previously that he worries more about the
outcome of his wife's campaign than he ever did about any of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   And he made clear he still believes he has cause to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''If voters in New York can get really confused, that's the only
way she can lose,'' Clinton said. ''Because if they vote for the
strongest person, or the most qualified person, or the person who
could do the most, or the person with whom they agree, she wins.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know that,'' he said of his wife's GOP opposition.
''That's why you have seen the campaign unfold the way it has.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for a counter campaign of personal testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing she most needs is for people like you to tell other
people they know, 'I know this woman. She is a good person, she is
a great public servant and she ought to be the next senator.'''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the presidential election, Clinton also said Vice
President Al Gore's campaign and the New York Senate race together
could determine the fate of legal abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is also a choice about choice,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The next president will likely make between two and four
nominations for the Supreme Court, ''and I hope Al Gore will be
making them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But those nominations must be confirmed by the Senate, Clinton
added.
</P>
<P>
   ''So it matters. Every last Senate seat is of critical
importance in this presidential race.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore, whom Clinton is vigorously supporting to succeed him,
and Mrs. Clinton support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't believe that we should keep Roe v. Wade,'' Clinton
said, referring to Republicans generally and the Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were the guests of honor Sunday at two parties
expected to bring in $400,000. The fanciest affair was an intimate
dinner for 65 with entertainment by singer Carly Simon and a ticket
price of $15,000 per couple.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton played the saxaphone and, according to guests, teamed
with Simon on a version of ''My Funny Valentine.'' The crowd sang
''Happy Birthday to the president who will turn 54 on Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Friday, the president offered himself as the star
attraction at fund-raising parties on Martha's Vineyard, the
neighboring resort island of Nantucket and the Kennedy family
compound on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his family have vacationed on Martha's Vineyard
nearly every year of his presidency. This year's was the shortest
stay -- just three days.
</P>
<P>
   The first family decided not to take a full-fledged summer
vacation this year to focus on campaigning for her Senate race and
fund-raising for Gore and other Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Washington Farm Workers Rally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRI-CITIES, Wash. (AP) -- Some 2,000 farm workers called for
better wages and working conditions during a 4&AMP;frac12;-mile march between
two south-central farm towns.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures in the mid-90s, the marchers -- including a
troupe of drum-beating Aztec dancers from Oregon -- were joined
Sunday by about 2,000 religious, civil rights and political
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators want higher apple-picking wages, amnesty for
undocumented workers and protection for labor organizers from
reprisals by employers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have literally millions of Latinos and people of other
ethnicities performing the work that other people don't want to
do,'' said Arturo Rodriguez, the national president of the United
Farm Workers of America, ''and they're treated like second-class
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is the son-in-law of farm workers union founder Cesar
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the AFL-CIO Executive Council passed a resolution
calling for federal legislation granting amnesty to the 6 million
undocumented workers in the United States. Most of Washington
state's more than 100,000 agricultural workers are undocumented.
</P>
<P>
   Many marchers on the way from Desert Aire to Mattawa, about 165
miles southeast of Seattle, said they make $6.50 an hour. Others
said they got paid $9 or $10 per bin of apples -- about $5 less than
they got three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot feed our families with these low wages and we will
stop working if necessary to get a fair wage,'' said farm worker
Arnulfo Ramirez.

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips 18; Nasdaq Climbs 23  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed Monday, as investors
prepared for another day of choppy trading on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 18.68 at 10,749.07.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was up 23.63 at
3,810.99. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index was down 0.87 at
1,462.06.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continue to search for clues as to whether the Federal
Reserve Board will raise interest rates at its next meeting Aug.
22. But much of the economic data released recently has been of
little help, offering conflicting figures that can be interpreted
several ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Friday the Labor Department reported that the
nation's unemployment rate was unchanged at 4 percent in July,
close to a three-decade low, despite the loss of 108,000 payroll
jobs during the month, the biggest setback in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the losses resulted from 290,000 temporary government
workers laid off in July because their work on the census was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed private payrolls actually rose by 138,000
during the month. However, analysts noted that last month's gain in
private sector jobs was down significantly from a jump of 242,000
in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times since last summer in
an effort to stave off inflation, and investors hope the latest
figures are a sign that strategy is working.

<HEADLINE> Many Crib Deaths Happen in Day Care  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A significant number of crib deaths occur in
daycare, where caretakers may be less likely to have heard about
the importance of putting babies to sleep on their backs, new
research suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 1,916 SIDS cases in 11 states, researchers found
that about 20 percent -- 391 deaths -- occurred in daycare settings.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the daycare deaths occurred in home daycare,
which tend to be unlicensed and run by older women with less access
to pediatricians and others who promote SIDS risk reduction
efforts, said Dr. Rachel Moon, the lead author. She is a
pediatrician at Children's National Medical Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Her data on SIDS deaths from January 1995 to June 1997 appear in
the August issue of Pediatrics, published Monday by the American
Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Especially disturbing, Moon said, was the finding that of
children placed on their stomachs by caretakers, more than half
were usually put to sleep on their backs by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has shown that compared with babies who always
sleep on their backs, back sleepers switched to their stomachs are
20 times more likely to die of SIDS and habitual stomach sleepers
are about five times more likely, Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   Moon and others theorize that habitual back-sleepers are more
vulnerable because they don't develop upper body strength as early
as stomach sleepers, who have to lift their heads or arms to see
what's around them.
</P>
<P>
   SIDS deaths in child-care ranged from a high of 40 percent of
all SIDS deaths in Minnesota to a low of 9 percent in Florida, with
an average of 20.4 in all 11 states. The other states in the study
were Arizona, California, Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Kattwinkel, chairman of an American Academy of
Pediatrics SIDS task force, called the findings ''very worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest risk period for SIDS is when infants are two months
to five months old, which is often the time working mothers return
to their jobs after childbirth, Kattwinkel said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one other bit of evidence from a national health
standpoint that tells us we ought to be educating daycare centers
and grandparents ... as well as parents'' about back-sleeping, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   SIDS deaths have decreased by about 40 percent nationwide since
advocates launched the ''Back to Sleep'' campaign in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Though its cause is unknown, SIDS resembles suffocation and
parents are advised to have babies sleep on their backs to avoid
blocking their airways. Soft mattresses, loose bedding, pillows and
soft toys also should be kept out of cribs.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates, like the SIDS Alliance, even go so far as to
advise against putting any blankets in cribs and instead say babies
should sleep in one-piece ''sleepers'' in cold weather to stay
warm.
</P>
<P>
   SIDS Alliance spokeswoman Phipps Cohe said all child-care
providers should be required to have SIDS risk reduction education.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures indicate about 17 percent of children under 1
year of age are in some kind of child-care setting, Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohe said parents who leave their infants in day care should
''be very specific about the way you want your baby positioned to
sleep. Parents need to spell it out, put it in writing if
necessary.''

Reserve Board will raise interest rates at its next meeting Aug.
22. But much of the economic data released recently has been of
little help, offering conflicting figures that can be interpreted
several ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Friday the Labor Department reported that the
nation's unemployment rate was unchanged at 4 percent in July,
close to a three-decade low, despite the loss of 108,000 payroll
jobs during the month, the biggest setback in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the losses resulted from 290,000 temporary government
workers laid off in July because their work on the census was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed private payrolls actually rose by 138,000
during the month. However, analysts noted that last month's gain in
private sector jobs was down significantly from a jump of 242,000
in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times since last summer in
an effort to stave off inflation, and investors hope the latest
figures are a sign that strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 107.35 million shares, down
from Friday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.58 at 505.21.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.14 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.18 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.12 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.66 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Monday on optimism that interest
rates will remain stable in the face of recent economic data that
suggests the economy is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 29.30 at 10,797.05.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's

<P>
   For example, on Friday the Labor Department reported that the

of the lowest figures in decades.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report showed private payrolls rose by just 138,000
during the month, down significantly from a jump of 242,000 in
June.

<P>
   Investors chose to take an optimistic, big-picture approach
Monday.

<P>
   ''We're in an environment where investors may be a little

Federal Reserve Board wanting to raise interest rates. I think
they'll probably choose the path of least resistance,'' said Al
Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham.
</P>
<P>
   Kugel said investors are looking at three indicators as proof
that another interest rate hike is unnecessary: solid but not
overheated growth, healthy second-quarter earnings reports and
continued low inflation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signing Ocean Ecology Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton is signing bipartisan
legislation to establish a national advisory board on the balance
between ocean ecology and economics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton were closing their short,
working vacation with a bill-signing ceremony Monday at a Coast
Guard station on the shores of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton family has spent three days on the resort island,
raising money for Mrs. Clinton's Senate race in New York and
partying with wealthy patrons. Clinton also managed a round of golf
and an afternoon at a secluded beach.
</P>
<P>
   With the sea and the lighthouse at West Chop for backdrop,
Clinton was also expected to prod Congress to approve his budget
requests for coastal and ocean protection.
</P>
<P>
   The new commission is charged with a broad study of federal
ocean policy, with a reports to Congress and the White House due 18
months after the group begins work.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-member commission will not begin its work until the day
Clinton leaves office in January. He will appoint the membership
through a complicated formula that gives him four unrestricted
appointees, and his pick of 12 others from a list approved by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The setup is intended to ensure representation for fishing,
mining and other industries that depend on the ocean. The board is
also supposed to include state and local government officials,
environmentalists, scientists and academics.
</P>
<P>
   The commission grew out of a conference Clinton attended two
years ago with Vice President Al Gore, in Monterey, Calif. There,
the administration pledged to find compromises among the often
competing goals of marine businesses and conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners will hold public hearings in coastal regions,
including Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Rabbis Delay Debate on Temple Mount  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's top rabbis put off discussion on
Monday of a proposal to build a synagogue at one of the most
sensitive spots in the Middle East -- the Temple Mount in the Old
City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The hill where the holy Jewish temples once stood is now the
site of the Dome of the Rock shrine and Al Aqsa Mosque, the
third-holiest site in Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The mufti of Jerusalem, Ikrema Sabri, who is the senior Islamic
official in the holy city, warned that building a synagogue on the
hill would set off major chaos in the region and start a war ''that
only God knows where it would lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chief Rabbinical Council, the top policy-making body for
Israel's Orthodox Jewish establishment, appointed a committee to
study all the aspects of the issue while protecting the historic
and religious rights of Jews on the Temple Mount, said council
spokesman Shaika Rosenfeld. He said the council repeated its
earlier ruling that Jews are not allowed to enter the Temple Mount
because of its holiness and concerns about ritual purity.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of control over Jerusalem and its holy sites scuttled
a summit meeting outside Washington last month between Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, who were trying to agree on a framework for a
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the council decision, there was Jewish-Muslim
violence on the Temple Mount. Angry Palestinians surrounded a group
of Israelis they thought were praying there. Israeli police said a
Muslim guard hit one of the Israelis with a two-way radio. The
guard later turned himself in to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld said Chief Rabbi Eliahu Bakshi-Doron, president of the
council, decided to postpone the debate after a public outcry over
the issue. No new date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The chief rabbi of Haifa, Shaar-Yeshuv Hacohen, had prepared the
proposal to build the synagogue. He disagreed with the opinion of
most Rabbinical authorities that Jews may not enter the Temple
Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Sabri, the mufti, called on the council to reject the proposal,
not just delay the debate. He said the hill is Islamic and ''is not
subject to negotiations.''

<HEADLINE> German Prince Loses Castle Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- At least there's still his in-laws' palace in
Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Ernst August of Hanover, husband of Princess Caroline of
Monaco, lost an appeal Monday before a Berlin court in which he
sought to get back land taken by Soviet occupiers at the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 40 square miles in Germany's eastern Harz
mountains includes woods, farm fields, a manor, several castles and
a crumbling Cistercian monastery from the 12th century. All of it
became state property in communist East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The case hinged on whether the prince's grandfather --
Ernst-August, Duke of Braunschweig-Lueneburg -- was a German or
British citizen at the time his land was seized. Under a postwar
Allied agreement, property owned by foreigners in Germany was
protected from seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The prince's lawyers argued that his grandfather, who had dual
citizenship, gave up German citizenship when he abdicated his title
in 1918 along with Kaiser Wilhelm II and other German nobility
after defeat in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   But his claim was rejected by officials in the eastern state of
Saxony-Anhalt, who pointed to a questionnaire the duke filled out
in 1946 for Allied authorities, in which he said he still possessed
German citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that he had voted in 1932 and 1933 for a local
party that advocated restoring him to his throne.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials in Magdeburg rejected the prince's claim and a
court there upheld the decision in March, saying no claim could be
made because the expropriation occurred in the late 1940s under the
authority of the Soviet occupiers after the defeat of Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Administrative Court in Berlin ruled Monday that the
special protection granted by the Allies to foreign-held property
applied only to owners who did not hold German citizenship as well.
</P>
<P>
   No further appeal is possible.
</P>
<P>
   A secretary at the prince's office in Nordstemmen, near Hanover,
said there would be no comment on the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   State officials welcomed the decision, saying it would finally
allow them to proceed with restoration work that had been tied up
by the legal wrangling.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Ocean Ecology Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton signed bipartisan
legislation Monday to establish a national advisory board on the
balance between ocean ecology and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Above all this bill is about setting a vision to ensure that
our beaches are clean, our oceans are protected, our coastal
economies remain strong,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that when we protect our oceans we're protecting our
future,'' Clinton said as he closed a short, working vacation with
a bill-signing ceremony on the shores of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton family has spent three days on the resort island,
raising money for Mrs. Clinton's Senate race in New York and
partying with wealthy patrons. Clinton also managed a round of golf
and an afternoon at a secluded beach.
</P>
<P>
   With the sea and the lighthouse at West Chop for backdrop,
Clinton also prodded Congress to approve his budget requests for
coastal and ocean protection. A sailboat and a Coast Guard cutter
bobbing in the rough water completed the tableau over the
president's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   A stiff ocean wind whipped the president's hair and blew a paper
from the desk set up for the signing. ''Get that bill!'' Clinton
yelped in jest.
</P>
<P>
   A Secret Service agent grabbed the paper, which aides said later
was not the bill itself, and Clinton chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually when I speak somewhere all the wind comes from the
politicians,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   The new commission is charged with a broad study of federal

<HEADLINE> South Korea Changes Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Reacting to criticism over the pace of
economic reform, President Kim Dae-jung replaced almost half of his
Cabinet on Monday, including the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over as finance minister is Jin Nyum, South Korea's chief
budget planner for two years. Jin's career has spanned nearly four
decades under five administrations starting in 1963. He was trade
minister and labor minister in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should strengthen competitiveness and straighten market
order by successfully completing restructuring'' of the financial
sector, Jin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Kim retained Prime Minister Lee Han-dong in his largely
ceremonial post. But he made changes in eight of the 19 Cabinet
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the replaced ministers held economic jobs and were
responsible for implementing reforms drawn up at the start of the
Asian financial crisis of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have achieved a lot, but we shouldn't be carried away with
the achievement. There is much to do,'' presidential aides quoted
Kim as telling the new ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization was not expected to affect the government's
engagement policy toward North Korea, because all Cabinet members
handling inter-Korea affairs were retained.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ''sunshine'' policy toward the communist North
calls for economic exchanges and cooperation. Presidential aides
said the new economic team will strongly support that policy.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's economy has recovered in the past three years, but
analysts and opposition lawmakers accused the government of
mishandling the nation's top conglomerate and other failures,
leading to stagnancy in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Paeng Sung-il, a research fellow at Daewoo Economic Research
Institute, said Jin's economic team will help restore market
confidence in government policies.
</P>
<P>
   Jin replaced Lee Hun-jai, who was named to head the finance
ministry in January. Lee was the government's chief financial
regulator before taking the post.
</P>
<P>
   Lee led a high-profile restructuring of South Korea's financial
sector under a program worked out in exchange for a $58 billion
loan from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lee's direction, dozens of financially weak banks were
closed, restoring foreign investor confidence in South Korea's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But he was criticized for his handling of Hyundai, South Korea's
largest conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   A major Hyundai subsidiary, Hyundai Construction and Engineering
Co., recently avoided default on payments only with
government-arranged loans.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai's problems were blamed partly on the government's
failure to enforce regulations to restructure South Korea's
inefficient, family-controlled conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai, which has more than 50 subsidiaries, has failed to keep
its repeated promises to slim down by selling or spinning off
unprofitable subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the Cabinet posts in the shakeup were economic.

<HEADLINE> Germans Recruited Against Neo-Nazis  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- Warning of mounting violence against
minorities, Jewish leaders and government officials in Germany are
recruiting celebrities to rally public opinion against neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation in Germany is unbearable,'' Paul Spiegel,
chairman of the Central Council of Jews, said Monday. ''We are not
going to let a couple of thousand extremists ruin what we have
built up over 55 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel and other leaders met in Duesseldorf, where a bomb
exploded at a train station last month, injuring 10 recent
immigrants, six of them Jews. Although police don't know the
motive, the incident focused attention on ethnic prejudice in a
country still haunted by the memory of the Nazi-era slaughter of
Jews and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said he would help recruit
stars from film, television and sports ''to show public
resistance'' against right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
   He said they would be invited to appear at an event in Berlin in
late September that he hoped would ''set a snowball effect'' in
motion.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest name to sign on so far is former tennis champion
Boris Becker, who has often complained about his wife being
subjected to racial slurs. Barbara Becker is the daughter of a
black American father and a white German mother.
</P>
<P>
   Others joining the campaign include Mario Adorf, who starred in
the Oscar-winning film ''The Tin Drum,'' actress Veronica Ferres
and rock musician Marius Mueller-Westernhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Even as officials met, police said that a bomb found Monday
outside a home in Bavaria may have been planted by neo-Nazis. The
bomb was removed, and police said they did not know who left it
there -- but they noted the family's deceased father was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Recent government statistics show anti-Semitic and
anti-foreigner attacks on the rise this year, with incidents
reported daily.
</P>
<P>
   Two Jewish cemeteries were vandalized with swastikas and Nazi SS
symbols over the weekend in western Germany. On Sunday, two
Pakistani men were attacked in a restaurant in the eastern city of
Gera by drunken men -- two of whom had been at a party the night
before where cries of ''Heil Hitler'' and ''Sieg Heil'' were heard,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials reported in April that the number of known
right-wing extremists in Germany dropped by 2,200 last year to
51,400, out of a population of 81 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the number considered violence-prone rose about 10 percent
to roughly 9,000, they said. Officials also reported 746 violent
crimes -- a 5 percent increase -- attributed to neo-Nazis last year,
including the first killings in three years.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, three killings by neo-Nazis have been
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The government says 129 offenses connected to the extreme right
were recorded in June, including 28 attacks on individuals and two
arsons. That was 47 more than in May and 32 more than in June 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leader's Brother in Trouble  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Police on Monday recommended bribery charges be
brought against the brother of Israel's newly elected president,
saying he persuaded a rival in a mayoral race to quit with the
promise of a top job.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors must still decide whether to indict Lior Katsav, the
mayor of Kiryat Malachi and brother of newly elected President
Moshe Katsav.
</P>
<P>
   The police allege Katsav promised a rival that he and an aide
would get high-level positions if they withdrew from the 1998
mayoral race. The rival agreed and after Katsav was elected mayor
of the poor southern town, the former candidate and his aide were
given jobs, police spokesman Ofer Sivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Katsav was selected by parliament last week to be Israel's
president, beating former prime minister and Nobel laureate Shimon
Peres.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was held three years early after incumbent Ezer Weizman
was driven out by a financial scandal. Weizman resigned July 10
after admitting he received more than $350,000 from a French
textile magnate. Although no charges were filed, the attorney
general ruled Weizman had acted improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Lior Katsav denied the charges against him, saying the deal was
arranged in an agreement that was overseen and signed by a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Katsav signed the agreement innocently and for the good of the
community,'' spokesman Yossi Peretz said.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Katsav's spokeswoman told Israel radio it was a ''private
matter.''

<HEADLINE> Former harness maker to Erie Canal mules closing after nearly 150 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Not many businesses can boast of surviving
for more than 100 years after the departure of some of their
biggest clients.
</P>
<P>
   At Jansen Bros. there is an abundance of work to this day at the
shop Henrich Jansen built crafting leather harnesses for mules that
pulled boats along the Erie Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed since those days, of course. Jansen Bros.
now does automobile interior work and luggage repair along with
making and repairing leather goods for work animals and show
horses.
</P>
<P>
   But the end is near.
</P>
<P>
   The founder's great-grandson, Henry Jansen, will turn 73 next
month and plans to close his shop shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the end of the line when it comes to this business,''
Jansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Henrich Jansen honed his skills in the city's Canal District in
the 1850s, kept busy by the ever-present need for mule harnesses.
He officially established Jansen Bros. in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   While Henry Jansen followed the footsteps of his
great-grandfather, grandfather and father into the shop in the
city, the next generation has chosen a different path.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh yeah, they all tried it at one time or another,'' Henry
Jansen said of his three children. ''But let's face it. This place
ain't the modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   Stitching horses, antique trunks, anvils and other relics from a
bygone era cram the dusty shop - items eventually destined for a
local children's museum, which plans to showcase Jansen in an
exhibit late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bonny Ryder, founder of the MUDPIES museum, said Jansen's
voluminous business records offer an intriguing glimpse into
Buffalo's mercantile past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Henry is a dying breed,'' Ryder said. ''He's a craftsman who
can do the most amazing things with leather. You don't see that too
much anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jansen, who sold the company's retail business two years ago but
has continued to do leather repairs, plans on doing occasional
leather work in the garage of his Eden home. But he said his main
focus will be traveling with his wife in their motor home and
spending time with their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said he has more work than he can handle.
Recent orders include making leather handles for an antique trunk
and an elaborate harness for a a carrousel horse, and installing
several tiny metal insignias, each bearing the name of a horse, on
a leather belt.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of his business still involves horse-related items
such as saddles, bridles and blankets. He also does luggage repair
and a lot of automobile upholstery; restoring antique cars is one
of his passions.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jansen, ''I tell people we'll make anything. But the
impossible takes a little longer.''

<HEADLINE> Early Treatment Key for Strokes  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It happens daily: People show up in the
emergency room with stroke symptoms that began hours, occasionally
days, earlier. But because they didn't recognize -- or denied --
early symptoms, it's too late for frustrated doctors to give a
powerful drug that could have stopped the brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, former President Gerald Ford was lucky last week that
his own stroke proved too mild to need that clot-busting drug,
because he would have been too late.
</P>
<P>
   The drug TPA has revolutionized stroke care, restoring blood
flow into victims' brains to help many recover with little
disability -- but only if they receive it within three hours of the
first symptoms. That's the problem: Mostly because of the tight
timing, fewer than 3 percent of stroke victims get TPA.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists are using sophisticated new brain-scanning
techniques to try to save more patients, hunting which ones still
have salvageable brain tissue six hours or more after the stroke
begins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now if somebody comes in after three hours, we sit on our
hands. I want to change that,'' says Dr. Steven Warach of the
National Institutes of Health. He begins a study at Suburban
Hospital in Bethesda, Md., this fall to see if TPA could work even
after as long as six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University is testing other treatments
against strokes that occurred even longer ago. In one dramatic
case, they restored speech and movement to a man who had suffered a
series of small strokes two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600,000 Americans will suffer a stroke this year. It
is the nation's No. 3 killer, claiming 160,000 lives annually.
</P>
<P>
   A stroke is a lack of blood flow and oxygen that quickly kills
delicate brain tissue. Occasionally it's caused by a burst blood
vessel, called a hemorrhagic stroke. But the vast majority are
''ischemic'' strokes, where arteries feeding the brain are blocked
-- and this ''brain attack'' can be treatable if you act fast.
</P>
<P>
   Dial 911 or get to a hospital immediately if you have any
warning signs:
</P>
<P>
   --Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially
on one side of the body.
</P>
<P>
   --Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding.
</P>
<P>
   --Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or
coordination.
</P>
<P>
   --Sudden severe headache with no known cause, or trouble seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Possible stroke victims get a CT scan, a test that's very good
at distinguishing if a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic.
</P>
<P>
   But CT scans are not very good at detecting the very earliest
stroke signs, and can miss tiny ones, Warach says.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, CT scans don't show brain tissue downstream from the
stroke that's still alive but will die as the stroke continues --
potentially salvageable tissue. In some 30 percent of patients, the
amount of at-risk brain tissue continues growing, because of
impaired blood flow, for 12 hours, Warach says.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the new brain scans come in. Sophisticated new
versions of MRIs, called ''diffusion and perfusion MRI,'' are much
better. Diffusion MRI can spot the first damaged brain tissue four
minutes after the injury occurs, by measuring how fast water
molecules move in the brain, says Hopkins' Dr. Norman Beauchamp.
The perfusion test literally lights up brain tissue that's slowly
starving from lack of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Take Hopkins' dramatic case. Another hospital's CT scan spotted
a series of small strokes in a 59-year-old man, strokes so small he
didn't qualify for TPA. But two days later, he was transferred to
Hopkins barely able to talk or move his right side, symptoms too
severe for those small strokes alone to explain.
</P>
<P>
   The new MRI testing found a huge brain area starved for blood,
about to die. Emergency surgery restored blood flow and the man
recovered well, says Hopkins neurologist Dr. Argye Beth Hillis.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins is testing other late-treatment alternatives: Forcing
blood into starved brain areas by simply raising blood pressure, or
inserting a catheter into the brain and injecting a TPA-like
clot-buster directly onto the stroke site.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to know how many people might benefit from such
attempts, or if Warach's six-hour TPA will work.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''we are finding a fair number of people who are in this
situation where there's a big mismatch between the brain that's
already died and the brain at risk,'' Hillis says.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice remains to get to the hospital within three
hours. But if you miss that window, seek care anyway as soon as
possible, Hillis stresses.

<HEADLINE> City says landlord's $6.65 million lawsuit is frivilous  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) - A city attorney said he would ask a court to
force a landlord to pay up to $10,000 for filing a frivolous
lawsuit against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Property owner Paul Meyer claims in a $6.65 million lawsuit
against the city that he lost ''significant'' business after the
city posted slum property signs in front of two of his rental
properties in 1999. Meyer contended the properties were in
compliance with city codes when the signs were posted and accused
the city of libel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that this is a lawsuit that is frivolous and
intended to harass and we are asking the court to impose
sanctions,'' Assistant Corporation Counsel David Tehan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tehan said the $10,000 would cover the cost of defending the
case and attorneys' fees.
</P>
<P>
   The city posted the signs in February 1999. The signs listed
Meyer's name, address, phone number and said his properties were in
violation of city housing code and contributed to the blight of the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In legal papers responding to Meyer's allegations, Tehan
countered that the information was true and written without malice
so the signs were not libelous.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer sought a court order last year to have the signs removed.
However, a judge ruled the signs were a legal and proper method for
the city to force rental property owners to bring their properties
up to code. Meyer filed a lawsuit in state Supreme Court in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The city codes department posts slum property signs after citing
a landlord for more than three violations within a year, Tehan
said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 90; Nasdaq Adds 72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Monday on optimism that interest
rates will remain stable in the face of recent economic data that
suggests the economy is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 89.74 at 10,857.49.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 15.78 at 1,478.71, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 72.46 at 3,859.82.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are searching for clues as to whether the Federal
Reserve Board will raise interest rates at its next meeting Aug.
22. But much of the economic data released recently has been of
little help, offering conflicting figures that can be interpreted
several ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Friday the Labor Department reported that the
nation's unemployment rate was unchanged at 4 percent in July, one
of the lowest figures in decades.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report showed private payrolls rose by just 138,000
during the month, down significantly from a jump of 242,000 in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Investors chose to take an optimistic, big-picture approach
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in an environment where investors may be a little
confused. But I think we're out of the woods in terms of the
Federal Reserve Board wanting to raise interest rates. I think
they'll probably choose the path of least resistance,'' said Al
Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kugel said investors are looking at three indicators as proof
that another interest rate hike is unnecessary: solid but not
overheated growth, healthy second-quarter earnings reports and
continued low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times since last summer in
an effort to stave off inflation, and investors hope the latest
economic data provide enough evidence that the strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the stocks of big technology companies helped lift
blue-chips. Software company EMC, up $3.75 to $89.063, and chip
maker Texas Instruments, up $2.875 to $57.25, led the way.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in technology stocks also gave a boost to the Nasdaq.
Software company Ariba rose $6.485 to $130.56. Biotechnology stocks
were also up across-the board. Chiron rose $4 to $52.375.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4 to 3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 567.34 million
shares, down from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.96 at 508.59.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Wound 3 at Lebanon Border  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli soldiers shot at stone-throwers
preparing a Molotov cocktail near Fatima Gate on the
Israeli-Lebanese border Monday, injuring a teen-ager and two
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second violent incident in the area in two days; both
times Israeli soldiers opened fire. One man was wounded Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers have deployed in much of southern Lebanon, but
not near Fatima Gate, where hurling stones at an Israeli
observation post has become a ritual for visitors from Lebanon
since Israel withdrew its troops from southern Lebanon May 24.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has not explained why peacekeepers have
stayed away from the gate at Kfar Kila village.
</P>
<P>
   Katya Jarjoura of Montreal, a 25-year-old free-lance reporter
for Radio Canada, was hit in the abdomen by shrapnel from a bullet
and Ali Dia, 50, a Lebanese journalist working for Agence
France-Presse, was injured in both legs, the two told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Tarek Mohammed Hussein, 13, was injured in his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were hurling stones at the Israelis when a soldier emerged
from the outpost and opened fire, hitting me in my toes,'' Hussein
said from his hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Dia, who had the shrapnel removed from his legs and was
discharged from the hospital in Nabatiyeh before dawn, said youths
were throwing stones at the Israeli outpost when he and Jarjoura
reached the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two Israeli soldiers emerged from the outpost, and when they
saw that the youths were preparing to throw a Molotov, they fired
shots at the youths,'' Dia said. The youths then threw their
firebomb.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem initially said the army
was not involved in the shooting. Later, a spokesman acknowledged
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a Molotov cocktail tossed, soldiers returned fire,
and as far as we know, only the man who tossed the Molotov cocktail
was injured,'' Maj. Yarden Vatikay said. ''In an incident such as
this one, all those who are near the rioters -- near those who throw
Molotov cocktails -- are at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarjoura and Dia said they gathered shortly after midnight
waiting for possible deployment of Lebanese security forces in
border villages.
</P>
<P>
   Jarjoura, who came to Lebanon two months ago, said doctors
removed three pieces of shrapnel from her abdomen and she hoped to
be released from the hospital on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not discouraged, '' she said. ''I would still like to
give it a chance here.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a Lebanese man was wounded in the leg when Israeli
soldiers fired into another crowd of stone-throwers at the Fatima
Gate. The Israeli army said a bullet shot by Israeli soldiers
struck the ground and the man was injured by a ricocheting stone.

<HEADLINE> State board meets to certify two-way Democratic primary  </HEADLINE>
With BC-NY--NY Senate, Bjt
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Board of Elections on Monday
settled on a Sept. 12 Democratic U.S. Senate primary ballot that
would have Hillary Rodham Clinton face off against a New York City
orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The primary would pit the first lady against Dr. Mark McMahon,
who has complained about Clinton's lack of New York roots. She
moved into the state in January.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island is the Republican Party's
U.S. Senate nominee and faces no primary challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been facing a potential six-way primary, but four
other potential competitors were knocked off the primary ballot on
Friday by a state Supreme Court justice in Brooklyn. While that
ruling could be appealed, state board officials said they believed
it would stand.
</P>
<P>
   Removed from the Democratic ballot for failing to meet the
petition requirements were: Irving Gelb, a taxi driver; Jimmy
McMillan, a retired letter carrier; Eric Melendez, a civil engineer
who finished last in a four-way Democratic U.S. Senate primary in
1998; and Peter Ruane, a retired New York City police lieutenant.
On Friday, Melendez endorsed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senate candidates must collect the signatures of at least 15,000
party members statewide to win a spot on the ballot. McMahon had
collected more than 40,000 while Clinton didn't need to collect any
because she was the official candidate designee from the party's
state convention in May.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a six-way primary emerged last month when the
two Democratic members of the state Board of Elections refused to
join their two Republican colleagues on the board in voting to
remove the four Democratic contenders from the primary ballot.
Three board votes are needed to declare a petition invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's campaign had hoped for a six-way primary as a
means of diluting the anti-Clinton vote, thus hurting McMahon's
chances in the primary.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VERNON, N.Y. (AP) - The Oneida Indian Nation wants to change the
way people gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In an aging, one-time lawnmower plant, the Oneidas are building
a new advanced cashless gaming system that allows patrons to make
dinner reservations, go shopping or set a golf tee-off time even as
they play for the big jackpot. It also can give casino operators a
profile of their customers and a way to better tailor their
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are trying to do is bring the entire resort to the
person in the most convenient way,'' said Frank Riolo, president of
the Oneida's new enterprise, Standing Stone Gaming.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the process, we get to know our customers,'' said Riolo,
who also serves as chief operating officer of the Oneida's hugely
successful Turning Stone casino-resort hotel-convention center
complex, which has more than 3 million visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need to know your customers, why your customers came to
you and what you need to do to bring them back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas envision their gambling machines one day replacing
the traditional coin-operated machines that fill mainstream casinos
in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, America's gambling meccas.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, the Oneidas expect to put their machines in Native
American gambling halls nationwide, especially in states like New
York that outlaw conventional slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   The machines look like a video game terminal and record credits
and debits like an ATM, offering dozens of games, including keno,
lotto and draw poker. Instead of pumping quarters into slots,
customers are issued identification cards to access the machines
and gamble. Unlike other slot machines, which each operate
independently, the Oneidas machines are all hooked to a central
computer that controls the results and collects the data.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas have already struck a deal to furnish 45 machines
for the Swinowash Indians' casino in Washington state. More orders
could come from Washington's Lummi Indians, who have reached a
tentative pact with the Oneidas to serve as consultants for their
35,000-square-foot casino.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from three other Washington tribes, a California
tribe and two Las Vegas slot machine manufacturers have visited
Turning Stone to assess the Oneida II system, Riolo said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Indian Gaming Association, there are
198 tribal governments running 326 gaming operations in 24 states -
all potential customers, as Riolo sees it. In California alone,
which recently approved the cashless video games, Native Americans
operate more than three dozen gaming operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nickel in the slot'' type machines first appeared in the
mid-1800s and awarded cigars and free drinks. The first
coin-operated counter-wheel machine was patented in 1892 by Gustave
Schultz of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the basic machine has gone through many innovations
until it reached its contemporary form where each machine is
operated by an internal computer. The last big advancement in slot
technology was the bill acceptor first introduced in the early
1980s, a concept borrowed from the vending industry.
</P>
<P>
   When it was first suggested, critics suggested it would never
catch on because most slot players are low-level coin gamblers and
would never put $20 in a machine at one time, Riolo said.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the bill acceptor is why the slot machine has
become the most popular casino game, accounting for as much as 50
percent to 80 percent of a casino's business.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Oneidas believe the proliferation of ATM machines
have conditioned people to readily use a card, there has been
resistance to the idea of cashless slot machines, said an industry
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's when the player decides it will catch on,'' said Stuart
Linde, who follows the gaming industry for Lehman Brothers. ''If
you put two machines side by side, they like to hear the coins.
They like to feel it. They like to have control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the industry would like to see the change, added
Linde.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going cashless really reduces costs. Handling money is
expensive,'' he said. ''You have to pay people to come in and fill
the hoppers. Sometimes, that takes as much as 45 minutes - time
that machine isn't making any money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas are the first Native American tribe to build their
own cashless gaming machines, according to the National Indian
Gaming Association. Several of the industry's top companies -
Aristocrat, Bally, International Games Technology and Universal -
sell comparable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Riolo, however, believes the Oneida system will flourish because
it can be used with any brand of game terminal. Other manufacturers
sell software that supports only their own terminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas invented their cashless video gambling machines out
of necessity in the mid-1990s while negotiating a gaming compact
with New York state, which has outlawed the traditional
coin-operated slots. Under New York law, a slot machine is defined
as a machine that takes something of value (coins or tokens) and
returns something of value (coin, tokens or receipts).
</P>
<P>
   The first machines were a collaboration between the Oneidas,
computer manufacturer Stratus Computer, software company S2 Systems
and game terminal manufacturer U.S. Games, now Leisure Time.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneidas started with 350 of their original video machines on
the floor at Turning Stone. Today, the casino has nearly 1,200. The
Oneidas will place 50 of the new machines in the casino next month.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe also plans to market its system to golf resorts and
horse tracks.

	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state Supreme Court ruled on Monday
that a Stamford man convicted of sexually assaulting his
girlfriend's daughter was denied a fair trial because of improper
comments by the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The high court found Assistant State's Attorney Nancy Dolinsky
violated Andrew Alexander's constitutional rights to due process
when she expressed her own opinion on the credibility of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Dolinsky said in closing arguments that the 12-year-old girl was
telling the truth because she was young, and therefore honest, and
that no child would make up a story about being abused.
</P>
<P>
   ''Statements such as these are likely to sway a jury in favor of
the prosecutor's argument without properly considering the facts of
evidence,'' Judge Flemming L. Norcott Jr. wrote in the unanimous
decision. ''This is especially significant in the present case,
where the credibility of the victim and the defendant comprised the
principal issue of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The court found the prosecutor improperly appealed to the
emotions of the jury as she described the naive, vulnerable victim
and the strong and powerful Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was convicted in 1995 of fourth-degree sexual assault
and risk of injury to a minor. The victim testified that after
Alexander moved in with her mother in Stamford in 1990, he began
coming into her bedroom at night and molesting her. The girl, who
was 8 years old at the time, said the abuse continued for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander was sentenced to one year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully this will send out a warning to prosecutors who try
child abuse cases that they better be careful in terms of the
analogies they use in arguing their case,'' said Alexander's public
defender, Monte Radler. ''You can well imagine that the sympathies
of juries ordinarily lie with the children. The whole area is
certainly subject to abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stamford prosecutor's office did not return a message
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision upholds a ruling by the Appellate
Court overturning Alexander's conviction. The case now returns to
Stamford Superior Court.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 101; Nasdaq Gains 54  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied Monday on optimism that interest
rates will remain stable in the face of recent economic data that
suggests the economy is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 100.72 at 10,868.47.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 13.55 at 1,476.48, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 53.99 at 3,841.35.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are searching for clues as to whether the Federal
Reserve Board will raise interest rates at its next meeting Aug.
22. But much of the economic data released recently has been of
little help, offering conflicting figures that can be interpreted
several ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Friday the Labor Department reported that the
nation's unemployment rate was unchanged at 4 percent in July, one
of the lowest figures in decades.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report showed private payrolls rose by just 138,000
during the month, down significantly from a jump of 242,000 in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Investors chose to take an optimistic, big-picture approach
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in an environment where investors may be a little
confused. But I think we're out of the woods in terms of the
Federal Reserve Board wanting to raise interest rates. I think
they'll probably choose the path of least resistance,'' said Al
Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kugel said investors are looking at three indicators as proof
that another interest rate hike is unnecessary: solid but not
overheated growth, healthy second-quarter earnings reports and
continued low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times since last summer in
an effort to stave off inflation, and investors hope the latest
economic data provide enough evidence that the strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the stocks of big technology companies helped lift
blue-chips. Software company EMC, up $3.125 to $88.438, and chip
maker Texas Instruments, up $2.50 to $56.875, led the way.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in technology stocks also gave a boost to the Nasdaq.
Software company Ariba rose $6.985 to $131.063. Biotechnology
stocks were also up across the board. Chiron rose $3.484 to
$51.859.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4 to 3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 671.57 million
shares, down from Friday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.59 at 508.22.

<HEADLINE> Entry Added to Yugoslavia Elections  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Formalizing the breach in opposition
ranks, a coalition opposed to Slobodan Milosevic nominated its own
presidential candidate Monday, the third challenger to Milosevic
for Yugoslavia's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Serbia's opposition parties endorsed the candidacy of
Vojislav Kostunica of the small center-right Serbian Democratic
Party, a moderate nationalist widely respected for his decade-long
uncompromising opposition to the autocratic Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's nomination came a day after the Serbian Renewal
Movement, the single largest opposition party, broke ranks with the
rest of the democratic opposition and put forward its own
candidate, Belgrade Mayor Vojislav Mihajlovic. The move is likely
to split opposition votes and diminish chances of success.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said yes because of the public,'' Kostunica, 56, said after
the nomination. ''It's my moral duty to the opposition, and not my
wish.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Milosevic votes will be sliced further by the
ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party's announcement Monday that
it had picked its own candidate as well. The party, known for its
''Serbs First'' policies, put up Tomislav Nikolic.
</P>
<P>
   According to all recent independent polls, Kostunica, who has a
Ph.D. in law, enjoys the most public support of the various
challengers among Serbs, who are disappointed with other bickering
leaders. He has not been linked to the corruption which has
tarnished the reputations of some other opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica said the presence of other candidates in the crowded
field is aimed at preventing him from reaching a likely second
round in the elections, to be held two weeks later if no one wins
an outright majority on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Radical leader Vojislav Seselj said Nikolic, 48, had the best
chances because of his determination to protect ''Serbian national
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikolic, known locally as ''Toma the gravedigger'' because he
worked as the chief of a local graveyard, said his victory ''will
be the first in a series for the Radicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Alternative party
criticized the decision by Vuk Draskovic's Serbian Renewal Movement
to press ahead on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one, no single party has the right to gamble with the
country's national interests and bring down the entire nation,''
the party's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But another leader, Zoran Djindjic, expressed hope that
''eighteen parties in this coalition are strong enough to field the
best candidate to beat Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have been furious with Draskovic for months because of his
alleged involvement in illegal business operations in Belgrade and
for serving in Milosevic's government as a Yugoslav deputy prime
minister until he was fired during the 1999 NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica earlier urged the pro-Western administration in
Montenegro, which along with Serbia forms the Yugoslav federation,
to participate in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the pro-Western government of Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic has refused to take part in the September elections,
saying recent changes in the constitution unfairly improved
Milosevic's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's opposition parties managed to unite against Milosevic
only once -- in 1996-1997 -- for massive protests over attempts to
annul local elections that brought them into power in all of
Serbia's major towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the elections, the democratic alliance fell
apart, leaving it unable to seriously contest the 1997 Serbian
presidential and parliamentary elections, won by Milosevic's
Socialists.

<HEADLINE> City's cultural affairs chief fined for ethics violation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The city's cultural affairs chief has been fined
$500 by the city's ethics board for hosting a political fund-raiser
at his house last year that included guests with business dealings
with the city, the board announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Schuyler Chapin, appointed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in 1994 as
the commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, held a
fund-raiser at his house for former mayoral candidate Fran Reiter
in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Reiter, a former deputy mayor under Giuliani who also headed the
mayor's 1997 re-election campaign and served as the head of the
city's tourism bureau, has since dropped out of the 2001 mayor's
race.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin was on vacation Monday and could not be reached for
comment, but in a statement to the Conflicts of Interest Board, he
acknowledged that he had acted improperly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several of the attendees to this fund-raiser had, at the time
of the fund-raiser, business dealings with the Department of
Cultural Affairs and, or, the city,'' Chapin said. ''I freely and
voluntarily admit that my conduct in co-hosting this fund-raiser
violated the New York City Charter.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapin said before he hosted the fund-raiser that an attorney
informed him that he would not be violating any city rules.
</P>
<P>
   The city charter bars high-level city officials like Chapin from
seeking political contributions for others or from hosting
fund-raisers whose guests include people who have business dealings
with their agencies.

<HEADLINE> Scientists trying to create 'Jersey tomatoes' in greenhouse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - Rutgers University scientists say
they're close to finding a way for New Jersey farmers to grow the
famed ''Jersey tomatoes'' profitably in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been trying to duplicate the juicy, plump
tomatoes that have become the state's premier crop by growing them
in nutrient-enriched water in greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists control the temperature at a one-acre greenhouse
in Columbus, Burlington County, keeping it at 72 degrees during the
day, 68 degrees at night. They adjust the light so that the
tomatoes are kept in darkness for six to eight hours a day,
sprinkle ladybugs on the plants to fight other insects, and
regulate the humidity to cultivate the tomatoes' sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took us a long time to manipulate the growing conditions so
we could come up with a tomato with the right taste that people
love,'' said Harry Janes, who has conducted greenhouse tomato
research at Rutgers since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Rutgers scientists also can grow tomatoes closer together
than farmers can on fields. About 150 pounds of tomatoes can grow
in 90 days on a 6-by-15-foot greenhouse table, about five times as
many as farmers can grow in the same area in a field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prefer the tomatoes grown outside, but in the wintertime,
when you can't enjoy a nice Jersey tomato, (the greenhouse
tomatoes) are not a bad tomato to have,'' said Al Murray, chief of
market development and promotions for the state Agriculture
Department's Division of Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Janes said the university is close to developing a plan for
farmers to use the greenhouse research to grow tomatoes for more
months of the year. Tomatoes are now harvested between July and
October. California and Florida export most of the tomato crops
during winter months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are just about to the point now where we can demonstrate
profitability for farmers,'' Janes told The Star-Ledger of Newark
in Monday's editions. ''We're not there yet, but each year we're
getting closer and closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the greenhouse tomatoes, labeled with white and green
stickers that say ''Jersey Fresh Premium Greenhouse Tomato,''
always exceeds supply at supermarkets that have sold them over the
last three years, said Jeff Shilling, director for purchasing for
RLB Food Distributors, which sells the greenhouse tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have been wary of the greenhouse method because of cost.
Building a greenhouse can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of
dollars. Many said they would consider trying to grow a Jersey
tomato indoors if costs could be contained.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have recommended using fuel from a nearby source to
power the greenhouse. In Columbus, Rutgers scientists use energy
generated from the waste at the adjacent Burlington County
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Matarazzo, a Warren County farmer and member of the New
Jersey Tomato Council, says energy costs may keep farmers from
trying to grow tomatoes in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fuel prices are definitely going to deter most farmers from
going into the dead of winter with greenhouse tomatoes,'' Matarazzo
said. ''But extending the season, say through March and April and
May, and November and December, that would be great.''

<HEADLINE> Serial killer sentenced to life in prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - Kendall Francois was sentenced to life
in prison without parole Monday for the murders of eight women
whose bodies were found in his family's home.
</P>
<P>
   Francois, 29, made no statement and looked down or straight
ahead as members of the victims' families spoke in Dutchess County
Court. His attorney said that Francois was deeply sorry for his
actions, but did not want to give a statement that could be
misconstrued by the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to see you die eight times over,'' said Heidi
Cramer, whose mother, 51-year-old Sandra French was killed by
Francois. The former middle school hall monitor had confessed to
all eight murders to avoid the death penalty. He told police that
he had solicited the women for sex and then strangled them.
</P>
<P>
   His family members were not implicated in the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Sala escaped from Francois and called police on Sept.
1, 1998, leading authorities to the gruesome discovery of the
bodies in Francois' garbage-strewn home.
</P>
<P>
   The murders occurred over a 22-month period from October 1996 to
August 1998. ''If I had the chance, I'd cut you up into little
bitty pieces,'' Sala said. ''I hope they kill you in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois, who has tested positive for the virus which causes
AIDS, was also sentenced to eight consecutive sentences of
25-years-to-life and 1 1/3 to four years for attempted assault on
Sala.
</P>
<P>
   Dutchess County Court Judge Thomas J. Dolan told Francois that
he had caused anguish to an entire community with his ''unspeakable
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois' cousin, MonRay Francois, sat with victims' family
members in the courtroom, but did not speak Monday. He has said in
the past that he believed his cousin should get the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Dutchess County District Attorney William Grady had
said he would seek the death penalty, but said in June that he
accepted the plea bargain in part because of the victims' families
who wanted closure and a guarantee that Francois would die in
prison. In addition, Grady had said the Francois' psychiatric
issues would weigh heavily in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Francois and his lawyer had tried to thwart Grady's intention to
seek the death penalty immediately after Francois' arrest by having
him hurriedly plead guilty to the slayings in December 1998. That
was before the 120-day period had expired under which Grady and
other prosecutors have to decide whether to seek the death penalty
against a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   In May 2000, the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals,
ruled that no plea is valid in a death penalty case while a local
prosecutor is weighing whether to seek to execute the defendant.

<HEADLINE> All 113 Concorde Victims Identified  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTOISE, France (AP) -- Forensic experts on Monday finished
identifying the remains of all 113 victims of the Concorde crash,
nearly two weeks after the supersonic jet plunged to the ground in
a town outside Paris, a French public prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Xavier Salvat also said he ordered experts to
evaluate the jet's tires, motors, tanks and other important
features as part of the ongoing judicial inquiry into the July 25
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Salvat, the prosecutor in Pontoise, north of Paris, who is in
charge of the judicial inquiry, said investigators still had not
pinpointed the chain of events that led the delta-winged jetliner,
streaming with flames, to plunge into a small hotel in Gonesse
north of Paris shortly after takeoff. Four people on the ground and
all 109 people in the plane were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The French government has grounded the five remaining Air France
Concordes while the inquiry continues.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, France's civil aviation ground mechanics called for
the government to rethink its move to freeze Concorde flights,
while the mayor of the town where the plane crashed underlined his
support for the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The national union of civil aviation ground mechanics, known by
its French initials SNMSAC, released a statement demanding a
''rapid lifting'' of the grounding order, saying the Concorde
itself should not be called into question.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy sent a letter to Air
France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta underlining his support for
the supersonic jet's grounding and threatening to push on with
stronger demands.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways has continued to fly its fleet of Concordes.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation in the French press that a 16-inch
strip of metal found on the runway -- and not belonging to the
Concorde -- could have been at the origin of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Accident and Inquiry Office reported the
discovery of the metal strip without further comment. In their
statement, the civil aviation ground mechanics questioned why
officials revealed this news nearly two weeks after the accident.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls for Release of Ibrahim  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department urged Egypt on Monday to
free a respected Egyptian-American liberal sociologist who has been
imprisoned for a month without being charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said ''it's a fair assumption'' that
Saad Eddin Ibrahim, 61, is in jail because of his advocacy for
human rights in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Under Egyptian law, Ibrahim can be held up to six months without
formal charges. Other members of his research group, Ibn Khaldun,
which monitors working conditions, also have been detained, Boucher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have made several accusations against Ibrahim in
their investigations, including that he accepted foreign money
without government permission and forged voting cards for a
documentary about elections that tarnished Egypt's image. Ibrahim
has denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim's lawyer, Farid el-Dib, told The Associated Press on
Sunday that the scholar also was accused of ''espionage for the
United States to undermine Egypt's national security and harm its
military, economic and political interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, asked about the situation at Monday's State Department
news briefing, said, ''We share the concern of many others who
question the detention of an internationally recognized advocate of
civil society and democratic reform in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the reported espionage accusation, U.S. diplomats who
met in Cairo with senior Egyptian officials were told that no
charges were filed against Ibrahim, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we're pleased to find that those reports (of espionage
allegations) are inaccurate,'' Boucher said. ''But we remain deeply
concerned about his continued detention without charges. The
Egyptian government is fully aware of our concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing Ibrahim's extended detention inexplicable, the U.S.
spokesman said, ''We call upon the Egyptian government to make
clear the formal charges against him or, better yet, to release
him.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Sir Alec Guinness Dies at 86  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- From Dylan Thomas to George Smiley to Obi-Wan
Kenobi: Sir Alec Guinness made them all live during an acting
career that stretched across six mesmerizing decades.
</P>
<P>
   Tributes poured forth Monday for the self-effacing actor, who
died at age 86 on Saturday. Hospital officials did not specify the
cause of death, but newspapers said it was liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world has lost a great artist,'' said George Lucas,
creator of the ''Star Wars'' movies that, beginning in 1977,
brought Guinness to a vast international audience, winning him an
Oscar nomination for best supporting actor as Obi-Wan Kenobi.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness had previously taken the best actor prize for playing a
British colonel in David Lean's 1957 film, ''The Bridge On the
River Kwai.'' In 1980, he received an honorary Oscar for his
overall career.
</P>
<P>
   John Mills, Guinness' co-star in his screen debut in another
Lean film, the 1946 ''Great Expectations,'' called him ''one of the
greatest character actors ... a very, very rare person.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was a reluctant superstar, preferring to go about
unrecognized. ''Dear Ron,'' he wrote the writer Ronald Harwood, who
compiled tributes to the actor on his 75th birthday, ''wouldn't it
be good to call the whole thing off? I must say I'd breathe more
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness gave an interview to The Associated Press during the
1988 Berlin Film Festival -- but only on condition that it take
place at the Berlin Zoo, where the actor enjoyed chatting to the
animals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Star Wars'' co-star Carrie Fisher recalled Guinness's quiet
poise: ''While the rest of us were sitting on the set, it was as if
(Alec) were sitting on the deck of a yacht. He had a way of
elevating his environment.''
</P>
<P>
   His death further thins Britain's ranks of elder statesmen
actors, following the loss earlier this year of Sir John Gielgud,
one of Guinness's lifelong friends.
</P>
<P>
   Few actors shared Guinness's genius for submerging himself in a
role, so that the part -- not his personality -- came through.
</P>
<P>
   But Guinness gently dismissed the tag once given him by his
agent: ''The man of a thousand faces.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolute rubbish -- it has plagued me all my life,'' he
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was born out of wedlock on April 2, 1914, and did not
know until he was 14 that the name on his birth certificate was
Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't miserable -- children accept what happens -- but I had
a lonely childhood and I suppose acting came from inventing things
for myself,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   Following boarding school, Guinness worked briefly as an
advertising copywriter, spending most of his pound-a-week salary on
theater tickets.
</P>
<P>
   After lessons with the actress Martita Hunt, he won a place at
the Fay Compton School of Acting. There, Gielgud judged the
end-of-term performances and chose Guinness as the winner, later
giving him a break as Osric in ''Hamlet'' in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness married actress Merula Salaman in 1938. They had a son,
Matthew, and lived in the country 50 miles southwest of London.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness helped define the Ealing Studio comedies of the late
1940s and the 1950s -- ''The Man in the White Suit,'' ''The Lavender
Hill Mob,'' ''The Lady Killers,'' and, most remarkably, ''Kind
Hearts and Coronets,'' in which he played the entire d'Ascoyne
family.
</P>
<P>
   His collaborations with director Lean were a career constant,

   He won a Tony award as best actor for playing poet Dylan Thomas
in ''Dylan'' on Broadway in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in ''Star Wars'' and its
two sequels that brought Guinness pop culture celebrity -- and some
dismay. Guinness said he detested the ''Star Wars'' phenomenon and
once described the films' dialogue as ''frightful rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, Guinness distinguished himself as John Le Carre's
quiet spy, George Smiley, in ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy,'' and
''Smiley's People'' in 1979 and 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness's 1985 memoir, ''Blessings in Disguise,'' told more
about the talented and eccentric people he knew than about himself.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the stories he told about himself, Guinness checks his
hat and coat at a restaurant and asks for a claim ticket. ''It will
not be necessary,'' the attendant says, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Pleased at being recognized, Guinness later retrieves his
garments, puts his hand in the coat pocket and finds a slip of
paper on which is written, ''Bald with glasses.''

<HEADLINE> Soldier Tells of Albanian Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- An Army sergeant testified Monday
that he shot at an ethnic Albanian last year in Kosovo, according
to those who heard his testimony. That evidence may clear a Serb
family accused in the death.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the trial of the father and his two sons ended with
Sgt. Robert Black describing the July 1999 gun battle. At the
request of French judge Patrice de Charette, the court traveled to
this southeastern town to show where he and other American snipers
were deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were not allowed inside the heavily guarded building,
but several people who were present said the soldier repeated
statements he gave Army investigators detailing how he fired at an
ethnic Albanian who had been shooting at U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed a man in the shed firing at the tower. I fired with
my M203, 40mm high-explosive rounds,'' said the written statement
by Black that was read before the U.N. court last month. ''The
second round exploded inside the shed and I kept up small,
suppressive fire.''
</P>
<P>
   United Nations officials say Afrim Gagica was in the shed when
he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Black is not expected to face charges since the rules of
engagement at the time allowed peacekeepers to fire in self
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Mirolub ''Mirko'' Momcilovic, 60, and his sons
Jugoslav, 32, and Boban, 25, has dragged on for more than a year,
and is considered a test of whether Kosovo's embryonic,
internationally monitored justice system can work.
</P>
<P>
   Although Black's statement provides evidence that could clear
the Serbs, in Kosovo's ethnically charged climate international
officials close to the case have warned it would be difficult for
the ethnic Albanian judges to arrive at an impartial verdict
because they have to go back and face their own communities.
</P>
<P>
   De Charette said he and the four ethnic Albanian judges who
presided over the case would deliberate and announce the verdict on
Tuesday. A simple majority is required to rule on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been embarrassed by the case because
information on U.S. soldiers' role in Gagica's death was not
released for more than a year, casting doubts on whether Serbs
could get a fair trial in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians constitute
the majority.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since NATO troops entered the province, Kosovo's
Serbs have come under reprisal attacks by the province's ethnic
Albanians, who suffered a crackdown by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's forces. Despite the presence of a NATO-led peacekeeping
force and efforts of international officials, deep hatreds remain
between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian prosecutor, Sabit Maliqi, dragged out the case,
requesting that the court hear as many as possible of the 37
testimonies from U.S. soldiers involved in gunbattles that day. The
request to hear more testimonies Monday was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing remarks, Maliqi claimed the distance from Black's
position in the building was too far away from where Gagica
allegedly was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Zivojin Jaknovic closed by saying the testimonies
given by 37 U.S. soldiers -- consisting mostly of written statements
included in a 130-page U.S. Army report -- all said Gagica was shot
by a U.S. military sniper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. Army doesn't have any reason not to be objective''
about what happened, he said.

<HEADLINE> Murderer of former police officer sentenced to 22 years to life in prison </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A drug abuser who stabbed a retired New York
City policeman to death with a 10-inch bayonet while arguing with
the victim's daughter was sentenced Monday to 22 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Bruce Allen told Thomas Kelly, 48,
that he imposed less than the maximum of 25 years to life because
he did not believe his murder of William Hageman, 51, was
premeditated. ''The criminal intent was formed almost on the spur
of the moment,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan jury convicted Kelly of second-degree murder on May
8 for fatally stabbing Hageman in the chest on July 29, 1997,
outside a Lower Eastside tenement building, where the former cop
was the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   An unconscious Hageman was taken to nearby Beth Israel Medical
Center where he was pronounced dead a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from the youngest of Hageman's two daughters, Kristin,
now 14, was read in court by Assistant District Attorney Kevin
Pogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never felt pain like this before,'' Kristin wrote. ''Each
time I think about him (Hageman), something inside me dies because
I know I'll never get to tell him I love him ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Offered a chance to speak before he was sentenced, Kelly said,
''I'm just sorry that it happened. What else can I say? There's no
more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Pogue told the court that Kelly had waited outside the apartment
house and stabbed Hageman after futilely pleading to get Hageman's
daughter, Dawn, 29, to move back in with him. She refused. They had
lived together for 3&AMP;frac12; years.
</P>
<P>
   Hageman rebuffed Kelly saying did not want to hear anything he
had to say, and told him to leave his family alone.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Kelly stabbed Hageman and fled, trial evidence
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Kenneth Walsh asked Allen to impose the minimum
sentence. He said Kelly was a hard working man who developed a drug
addiction and who was turning his life around and trying to get his
ex-lover to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said Kelly's intent during the confrontation was ''to
rescue Dawn from a downward spiral.'' He never intended to hurt
anyone, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Hageman became a police officer in 1968. He retired in 1977
while assigned to the Central Park Precinct. He had been working as
the superintendent in the East 12th Street building for 17 years
when he was killed.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Doctors Leave Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Accusing the United Nations of
allowing ethnic cleansing to persist in Kosovo, the Belgian branch
of the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders announced Monday
it was ceasing operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders ''can no longer tolerate the serious and
continuous deterioration of living conditions of the ethnic
minorities in Kosovo,'' the group said in a statement released in
Pristina. French teams from Doctors Without Borders will remain in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the Belgian doctors had been ''eyewitnesses to
the daily harassment and terror against the Serb minority in (the
towns of) Vucitrn and Srbica and the Albanian minority in (the
northern part of Kosovska) Mitrovica.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said life for ethnic minorities was marked by
killings, drive-by shootings, hand grenade attacks, verbal abuse,
threats, robbery and blackmail. Many had been forced to leave their
homes, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after NATO and the United Nations marched into
Kosovo, mistrust and violence still fester between ethnic
Albanians, Serbs and other minority groups. International officials
make almost daily appeals for tolerance, saying ethnic tensions are
preventing the southern Serb province from achieving economic and
social progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctors Without Borders questions the appropriateness of
humanitarian medical and psychological assistance when, in the
presence of internationally mandated protection forces, the
fundamental rights of people are being denied,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris-based group, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1999, has worked in Kosovo since 1993. It provides home-based
care in the ethnically divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica.

<HEADLINE> Arctic Ocean Oil Drilling Protested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Six environmental activists
occupied a barge towing equipment to the Northstar oil project off
the Alaska coast Monday, hoping to block the start of the first
offshore oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean, Greenpeace said.
</P>
<P>
   Activists from the Greenpeace ship MV Arctic Sunrise boarded the
barge carrying a four-story facility for BP Amoco early Monday,
about four hours sailing time from Barrow on Alaska's northern
coast.
</P>
<P>
   The tug towing the barge toward Prudhoe Bay turned around and
was headed toward Barrow, Greenpeace spokesman Erwin Jackson said
from the organization's Amsterdam headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said no one else was aboard the 420-foot barge. Sailors
on the tug did not resist the activists, who intended to stay on
the barge as long as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the barge by satellite phone, activist Stephanie
Tunmore said the group had followed the barge for an hour, then
climbed aboard using its ladders. Tunmore also said they had
hoisted a banner that read, ''Stop BP's Northstar.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They have just turned the barge around now and we are heading
back to Barrow in Alaska,'' Tunmore said. ''They want to get us
off.''
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco spokesman Paul Laird said the captain of the tug was
given the option of finding ''a safe place to park,'' or heading to
port. It was not clear whether the company would attempt to remove
the activists.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the $690 million Northstar project began in 1995,
and BP is pushing hard to have it producing by next year. It is
expected to produce nearly 200 million barrels of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace claims the drilling will further warm the Arctic
Ocean, where it says the ice pack is melting and populations of
polar bear, caribou and walrus are in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of London-based BP Amoco have defended the company's
environmental policy in the past, arguing that its operations have
not harmed Alaska's wildlife.

By The Associated Press	   Heading from east to west, here are some of U.S.
Route 20's many
highlights:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -The first formal Shaker Society settlement in America was
started in the Mount Lebanon area.
</P>
<P>
   -The oldest unaltered Episcopal church in the state, built in
1789, is located in Duanesburg.
</P>
<P>
   - In Sharon Springs, the derelict shells of once-majestic hotels
still stand as a silent reminder of the days when tourists came by
the thousands to bath in the area's natural sulfur and magnesium
springs.
</P>
<P>
   -Cherry Valley was the scene of a famous massacre in 1778 in
which nearly 50 villagers and soldiers were killed by raiders led
by Joseph Brant, a prominent Iroquois chief. A large marble
sarcophagus commemorates the attack.
</P>
<P>
   -Richfield Springs is the home of the Petrified Creatures Museum
of Natural History, chartered in 1934 as one of the oldest hands-on
museums in the state. Visitors can dig for 40 different kinds of
invertebrate fossils on the museum's nearly six acres, which also
include woodland trails, nature paths and life-size dinosaur
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   -In Sangerfield, travelers pass the northern tip of Nine Mile
Swamp, which once served as the hiding place for the infamous
Loomis Gang, which terrorized the countryside from 1848-1866.
</P>
<P>
   -Bouckville, where one of the largest antique shows in the
Eastern United States is staged every August. Nearby is Nichols
Pond, where Samuel de Champlain and an expeditionary force of
French and Hurons attacked a stockaded fort of the Oneida Indians
in October, 1615 - an act that helped drive the Iroquois tribes to
ally with the English during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   -Cazenovia was a stagecoach stopover where John Lincklaen built
the Lorenzo House in 1807, an exquisite two-story Georgian
structure that features delicate pilasters, elliptical arches,
gables and a roof parapet.
</P>
<P>
   -Between Pompey and Lafayette, travelers cross the heart of the
ancient Onondaga Indian Nation where the centuries-old Iroquois
Confederacy was born. The area also is one of the leading
apple-producing areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   -In Cardiff, visitors will learn the history of the Cardiff
Giant, a 10-foot tall hand-carved statute that was buried in the
ground by two 19th-century local hucksters and became regarded as
''America's Greatest Hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   -As travelers pass through Auburn, they can stop at the homes of
Harriet Tubman, who became a national heroine for her pivotal role
in leading slaves to freedom through the Underground Railroad, and
former Secretary of State William H. Seward, who engineered the
purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.
</P>
<P>
   -Montezuma Swamp, a national wildlife refuge and a birdwatchers'
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   -In Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the women's suffrage
movement where visitors can stop at the National Women's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   -Waterloo boasts it is the birthplace of the first Memorial Day
observance. It also is the location of the Scythe Tree. Legend says
that in 1861, James Wyburn Johnson, a local farm boy, hung his
scythe on a six-inch poplar sapling until his return from the Civil
War. Johnson was killed in battle and scythe remained while the
tree grew. Today, today only six inches of blade shows; the wooden
handle having long ago rotted away.
</P>
<P>
   -Geneva is the home of the acclaimed Lake Geneva Inn and the
site of an old Iroquois village. It lies in the heart of the Finger
Lakes region and New York's world famous wine country.
</P>
<P>
   -Town Line is remembered for the fact that a majority of the
townsfolk voted in 1861 to join the South and seceded from the
Union.
</P>
<P>
   -After passing through the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation,
travelers come to Westfield, the original headquarters of the Welch
Grape Juice Company, started in 1896 by Dr. Thomas Branwell Welch
and his son.

<HEADLINE> 40 Said Killed Off Nigeria Coast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- At least forty passengers drowned after an
overcrowded boat capsized in a storm off the Nigerian coast,
officials said. Forty-two people are believed to have survived.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ran into a storm suddenly and the boat started to go down
in the water,'' Olatunji Olawale, one of the crew members, said
Sunday, a day after the boat went down amid the islands and swamps
of Nigeria's Atlantic coast, near the Cameroon border.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Agbiti, the commander of the Eastern Naval Command, told
reporters in the southeastern city of Calabar that overcrowding
might have caused the boat to capsize about two hours after it left
shore. Nigerian navy boats rescued people clinging to their
belongings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the passengers were traders, heading for the Cameroon
port city of Douala.
</P>
<P>
   Fatal boating accidents are common in Nigeria, where passenger
boats, often old, in disrepair and overcrowded, are the main source
of transportation for many people living along the country's rivers
and coastline.

<HEADLINE> Standard Infant Screening Sought  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- All newborns in Maine, but not neighboring New
Hampshire, are routinely tested for a sometimes fatal metabolic
disease called MCAD. In Colorado, they're tested for sickle cell
disease, but not across the state line in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned by such inconsistencies, the American Academy of
Pediatrics wants the federal government to adopt uniform testing
standards for the 4 million infants born nationwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   The academy urges the move in a supplemental report published
Monday in the August issue of its journal, Pediatrics, summarizing
recommendations of a task force that met in May 1999 at the request
of the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Health Resources and other agencies will use the report in
working with states to ''try to produce some national agreement on
what tests should be developed or be part of a core set of tests
that at a minimum states should test for,'' said Dr. Peter van
Dyck, director of HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Tests are available for about 30 inherited diseases, but few
states require newborn screening for them all.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not specify which or how many diseases should be
included.
</P>
<P>
   All states have mandatory newborn screening for phenylketonuria
(PKU) and hypothyroidism, which can cause retardation if untreated.
Most also routinely test for galactosemia, a rare inherited
disorder in which the body can't metabolize sugar. Forty-one
routinely test for sickle-cell disease, an incurable blood disorder
that occurs primarily in blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The March of Dimes believes tests for these four diseases are
among eight that should be mandatory for all newborns, spokeswoman
Michele Kling said. The other four are congenital adrenal
hyperplasia, a set of inherited disorders involving the synthesis
of hormones; biotinidase deficiency, involving a crucial enzyme;
maple syrup urine disease, a rare inborn metabolic disorder, and
homocystinuria, another rare enzyme deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural values and economics are among reasons for the testing
disparity, the task force said.
</P>
<P>
   States that don't have mandatory sickle-cell tests for newborns
argue that they don't have enough blacks to justify the cost or
effort, but in many cases they test for diseases that are even more
rare, said Dr. Edward McCabe, co-chair of a task force that
prepared the report and physician-in-chief at UCLA's Mattel
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Burke, whose son, Bryce, faces a lifetime of medical
bills that already have surpassed half a million dollars, says that
economically, uniform testing ''is a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth, Texas, boy was born in 1996, seemingly healthy
until he fell into a coma at 19 months. Bryce eventually was
diagnosed with MCAD, an inherited enzyme deficiency disease that is
easily treated with diet if detected early, but can otherwise cause
severe retardation or death. It was too late for Bryce, now 4, who
can't walk, talk or feed himself.
</P>
<P>
   MCAD occurs in as many as 1 in 10,000 births and is about as
common as PKU, said McCabe. But only four states routinely test all
newborns for MCAD. Texas does not.
</P>
<P>
   Testing for a single disease like PKU involves taking a drop of
blood from a newborn's heel and costs $1 or less, McCabe said. With
technology called tandem mass spectrometry, the same blood drop
also can be used to test for MCAD and more than 20 other diseases
at a total cost of about $25, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, 41, worries that without uniform standards, the same
thing that happened to his son will affect other families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody out there today has a child being born and they're
sitting there holding their son or daughter and thinking it's a
miracle, so thankful that they have a healthy child, when what they
really have is a time bomb waiting to go off,'' Burke said.
''Somebody should have told them ... there's a way to defuse it.''

<HEADLINE> Terminally Ill Kids' Care Sought  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Before 4-year-old Anthony Jadek died of a rare
brain tumor, his parents had to make agonizing decisions -- whether
to let doctors pour toxic drugs into his body when they knew he was
dying, whether to sign a do-not-resuscitate order, whether to let
him come home to his room to die.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were under so much stress. He was our only child. Where do
you draw from to make decisions like that?'' said Liz Jadek, whose
son died in March after a two-year battle.
</P>
<P>
   Jadek turned to a hospice-type program at a Chicago children's
hospital that offers palliative, or comfort, care, which has become
well-accepted for dying adults. But few such programs exist for the
53,000 U.S. youngsters who die each year and their families.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued its first
recommendation that comprehensive hospice-like treatment designed
to improve the quality of life for children with life-threatening
or terminal illnesses be made widely available.
</P>
<P>
   The academy said palliative care should be used first in
conjunction with medical treatment designed to cure. But it also
suggested that when it becomes obvious a child will not recover,
palliative care should replace such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The academy recommended offering art and music lessons to dying
children, and having social workers available to let parents know
it's acceptable to give their children drugs like morphine, a
painkiller many associate with death.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations also reiterate the academy's opposition to
doctor-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medical professionals are obligated to ensure that medical
technology is used only when the benefits for the child outweigh
the burdens,'' the academy wrote in the August issue of its
journal, Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The concept may be hard for some pediatricians to accept, said
Dr. Marcia Levetown, a member of the academy's bioethics committee
and an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of
Texas' medical branch in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pediatric doctors may feel unprepared for a patient's
impending death,'' she said. ''It's an 'unnatural' thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the United States, we're of such a rescue mentality that
we're willing to do anything to a child'' to save him, Levetown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent Hutchins, a pediatrician at Georgetown University,
said some doctors think palliative care ''is sort of giving up and
saying we can't cure anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This paper is good and says there should be a plan for
palliative care along with curative care,'' Hutchins said. ''Then
you can switch from one to another as time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of 2,500 hospice programs nationwide, only about 250 are for
children, said Ann Armstrong-Dailey, founder of Children's Hospice
International, a suburban Washington-based advocacy group that
promotes palliative care for children.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid will only pay for hospice treatment for children
believed to be close to death, a policy similar to Medicare's for
older adults, Levetown said.
</P>
<P>
   The academy says that requirement should be abolished, and that
there should be equitable reimbursement for palliative and
life-prolonging care.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong-Dailey praised the recommendations and said there are
other promising signs, including a $1 million appropriation her
group received last year from Congress to develop a model program
''to incorporate hospice care into health care from the time of
diagnosis.''

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Lawyer Expects Decision  </HEADLINE>
By DANILO BURZAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two Britons and two Canadians
arrested on suspicion of spying and terrorism, gave statements
Monday before a military court. Their lawyer said he expected a
decision soon on whether they would be released or formally
charged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect that within the next 24 hours, the army prosecutor
will decide whether to press (ahead) ... or drop proceedings
against the four,'' Vojislav Zecevic told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The four were bought under heavy security to the court building
in Podgorica, capital of Montenegro, which makes up Yugoslavia
along with Serbia. Only the magistrate, prosecutor, a court
interpreter and Zecevic were allowed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Zecevic said his clients appeared healthy and said they suffered
no ''personal problems.'' He did not say what the accused told the
hearing, but all four have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   If the army decides to press on, the four will likely be charged
immediately after the investigation, Zecevic said. They could also
be moved for trial elsewhere, probably to a higher military court
in Belgrade, Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   A military helicopter transferred the four men this weekend from
the army camp in Andrijevica, close to the place of arrest near the
border with Kosovo, to a military prison in Podgorica, a senior
army official earlier said.
</P>
<P>
   The four men were arrested Tuesday in northern Montenegro while
driving back to Kosovo. The two Britons, John Yore and Adrian
Prangnell, were working as instructors at a police academy in
Kosovo run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun Going, one of the Canadians arrested along with his nephew
Liam Hall, was a contractor doing reconstruction work in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   No diplomats have been able to contact the men, detained on
suspicion of spying and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Zecevic said he was concerned that the ''technical equipment''
allegedly found on the arrested and the fact that they were
traveling without documents may be sufficient for the army to bring
charges against his clients.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army claimed the detainees were suspected of
training pro-Western forces in Montenegro for ''terrorist
actions.'' The four had military equipment and explosives in their
possession at the time of arrest, an army statement claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian authorities, who are at odds with the pro-Western
Montenegrin government, have alleged that special British forces,
and other foreign experts were training Montenegrin police in
preparation for its secession from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Office Minister Keith Vaz said that the Yugoslav
authorities had not informed his government of charges against the
two British policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Vaz played down claims that one of the captured Canadians had
fuses or explosives
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had no information, we've not been told why they are
being held, we have -- as usual with Milosevic and his regime --
rumors and innuendo being spread about like confetti,'' Vaz told
BBC Radio 4's World at One program, referring to President Slobodan
Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> US Blasts Chavez for Iraq Visit  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department reacted sharply Monday to
the planned visit of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to Iraq and
vowed an effort to persuade him to cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday visit to Baghdad will be the first by a foreign
head of government since United Nations sanctions were imposed
against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said it was
''particularly galling'' that the first such visit is being made by
a leader who is democratically elected. For Chavez, he said, this
is a ''dubious distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela and Iraq are both major oil exporters, and Chavez will
visit Baghdad as part of a tour of Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. He arrived Monday in Saudi Arabia, his first
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said it is hard to understand Chavez's decision to visit
Iraq, given what he called Iraq's ''continuous flouting of its
international obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Iraq remains unwilling to accept U.N. Security Council
demands requiring the country to relinquish its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be discussing President Chavez' plans to visit Baghdad
with relevant officials in Venezuela in an effort to find some
other means to accomplish his goal of coordination with the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States is also concerned about reports that
Chavez would go to Baghdad without the required United Nations
approval
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Venezuela's obligation, as a U.N. member state, to
observe all the Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq and the
sanctions regime,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   While expressing concern privately about Chavez's links to Cuba
and his commitment to democracy, the Clinton administration has not
criticized him because he generally has followed democratic norms,
including national elections on July 30 in which Chavez was awarded
a six-year term by a comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan leader has made a point of staking out an
independent foreign policy -- forging a close friendship with Cuba's
Fidel Castro and praising Libya as a model of ''participatory
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip to 10 oil-producing nations is part of Chavez's
stated goal of strengthening the oil cartel as a global force.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez plans to invite his OPEC counterparts to a Sept. 27
summit in Venezuela, the first such meeting since 1975.

<HEADLINE> Russia Struggles To Free Its Money  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Lawyers for the cash-strapped Russian Embassy asked
a French court on Monday to unfreeze its bank accounts, the latest
chapter of a bizarre legal feud that has left the mission
struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Pitted against Russia is a Swiss-based trading company, Noga,
which says Moscow owes it $62.5 million from oil-for-food deals
signed in 1991, the year the Soviet Union dissolved, and in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Noga managed to get the accounts of Russia's embassy, trade
mission and delegation to UNESCO frozen in May. The accounts hold
only $392,000, but the lack of resources is starting to pinch.
</P>
<P>
   ''An embassy without a bank account cannot work,'' Daniel Guyot,
a lawyer for the Russian side, said after the court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Noga's claim was backed by an arbitration court in Stockholm,
Sweden, in 1997, clearing the way for the legal action in France.
Lawyers for both sides pleaded their cases at Monday's hearing at
the Court of Appeals. The verdict is due Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The case has taken its toll on already strained relations
between Russia and France, a vociferous critic of Russia's war in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Noga has not just targeted Russia's diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it succeeded in temporarily impounding a renowned
Russian tall ship that sailed to France to take part in an
international regatta.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss firm also threatened to seize Russian President
Vladimir Putin's plane when he comes to France on an official visit
set for October.
</P>
<P>
   The court battle centered on whether Russia, at the time still
part of the Soviet Union, signed away its immunity from payment
default in the original contract, and whether that included
diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Noga contends it did, making all Russia's assets fair game in
its bid to recoup its money. Noga lawyer Antoine Chatain said it
was pursuing legal claims in Luxembourg, Switzerland and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the appeal, Guyot told the court that Russia's
diplomatic immunity was protected by the Vienna conventions of 1961
and 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were to accept the senseless theory supported by Noga,
it would allow a private company to close an embassy, which is
unheard-of in the international community,'' Guyot told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Reformist Writer Detained in Iran  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Bolstered by an order from Iran's supreme
leader that undercut hopes of greater press freedom, hard-liners
arrested a liberal journalist and shut down a reformist newspaper
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Outside parliament, hundreds of hard-liners gathered to chant
praise for Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and demand that pro-reform
legislators be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Death to opponents of absolute jurisprudence. ... We are ready
to give our life for Imam Khamenei,'' shouted the hard-line
protesters, many of them wearing the chafieh, a cloth usually
draped on the shoulders by the hard-line Ansar-e-Hezbollah group.
</P>
<P>
   The tension threatened to worsen a political rift between
Khamenei, the supreme religious leader, and supporters of reformist
President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters had pushed for laws guaranteeing
greater press freedom, but debate on the legislation was halted on
Sunday on orders from Khamenei. His intervention touched off
scuffles in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department said it had ''very serious
concerns'' over the suspension of debate on the bill. But spokesman
Richard Boucher said the loosening of U.S. trade restrictions with
Iran, passed in February, would not be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Using powers granted by the restrictive press law the reformers
had hoped to amend, plainclothes security forces arrested
journalist Ahmad Zeidabadi at his home Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Zeidabadi's cousin, Yasser Bayenat, told The Associated Press
the arrest was believed related to articles Zeidabadi published
last year in reformist newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the pro-reform weekly Cheshmeh Ardebil in
northwestern Iran was ordered closed for four months on charges of
''disturbing public opinion'' and ''insulting Islamic sanctities,''
the daily Abrar reported.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed Laylaz, an Iranian political analyst, said the fight over
press freedom and Khamenei's intervention in parliament could have
far-reaching repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The struggle between political factions will intensify from
now on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers' options appeared limited, and a split appeared to be
growing between moderates that want to find a compromise with the
hard-liners and the more radical factions that want to vigorously
pursue reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter read in parliament Sunday, Khamenei warned that ''if
the enemies of Islam and the Islamic system take control of the
press or infiltrate it, a big danger will threaten the security and
faith of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The current (press) law has been somewhat able to prevent this
great plague, and amending it is not in the benefit of the
establishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In February elections, Iranian hard-liners lost control of the
legislature for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hard-liners' last undertakings in the previous
legislative session was to force through the restrictive press law.
The laws have been the basis for a ban on 23 publications -- most of
them pro-democracy newspapers -- and the arrests of several
prominent journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami's 1997 election, the hard-liners have lost
considerable power, but they still retain control of the judiciary,
military and television network and are backed by Khamenei, who has
the last say on all matters. Though unelected, Khamenei's word
outweighs Khatami's.

<HEADLINE> McGreevey gets backing from Torricelli's home base  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Bergen County Democrats staged yet another
rally Monday to back Jim McGreevey for a gubernatorial race that is
more than a year away.
</P>
<P>
   This one was held on the home turf of U.S. Sen. Robert
Torricelli, who recently dropped his brief bid to challenge
McGreevey for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli backed out after leading state Democrats came out in
support of McGreevey earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But Torricelli still hasn't offered McGreevey his support.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen county Democrats deny that the rally, which was held just
days after a similar event held in Trenton, was designed to put the
pressure on the powerful senator to throw his weight behind
McGreevey.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ferriero, county chairman, said he would like to see
Torricelli endorse McGreevey, but the rally was aimed at
discouraging anyone else from challenging the Woodbridge mayor for
the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to send a very strong and powerful message to anyone
else who might be thinking about running for governor that Bergen
is united solidly behind Jim McGreevey,'' Ferriero said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 16 county chairmen, representing nearly 75 percent of
the state's Democrats, crammed into a room at the Statehouse,
gathered around McGreevey and called for the party to unify behind
him for the 2001 gubernatorial election.
</P>
<P>
   Rich McGrath, Torricelli's spokesman, said the senator supports
Democratic leaders making their own decision about whom to endorse
- and he'll do the same when the time is right.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democratic leaders must reach their own individual decisions
about endorsing candidates,'' McGrath said. ''Just as Senator
Torricelli will use his best judgment when and how to best help the
Democrats of New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey and Torricelli met recently for the first time since
Torricelli announced his candidacy and then backed out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a positive and friendly meeting that demonstrates that
their friendship and mutual respect are strong and more enduring
than any temporary political competition,'' McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said Torricelli is focusing right now on national races
and has no timetable for making a decision about New Jersey's 2001
gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's rally was touted as the largest political endorsement
ever in Bergen County.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ferriero, state Sen. Byron Baer, D-Bergen,
Assemblyman Ken Zisa, D-Bergen, all 27 Bergen County Democratic
mayors and a raft of other party leaders were among the supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jim McGreevey has worked with the rank and file here in Bergen
County for years,'' Ferriero said in a telephone interview. ''There
has always been this closeness with him. It was unfortunate that we
had to take a step back when Bob (Torricelli) was contemplating a
run. With that behind us, everyone is extremely enthusiastic about
Jim's candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians reportedly contemplating a run at earning the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination are: U.S Reps. Robert Andrews
of Haddon Heights, Frank Pallone Jr. of Long Branch and Bill
Pascrell of Paterson.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Dog a Splash at Beach  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Buddy, President Clinton's dog, made
quite a splash at the beach and beyond on the first family's
whirlwind weekend vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek chocolate Labrador retriever ate ice cream, met the
locals and played rough with Clinton in the waves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Buddy and I went swimming'' Sunday, Clinton told reporters.
''He clawed me pretty bad,'' the president said matter-of-factly as
he patted his upper chest gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got in some rough waves. I should have given him a manicure
before we went out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as Clinton greeted people in the town of Vineyard
Haven, Buddy tolerated a sea of hands reaching under a rope
barricade to pat him, and stood, panting, as one delighted family
took a picture with him.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy's reward for patience was a goodly portion of Clinton's
double-dip raspberry and peaches and cream ice cream cone. Clinton,
emerging from Mad Martha's ice cream shop with daughter Chelsea,
tossed the treat to Buddy, who downed it in one gulp.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gotta share,'' Clinton said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy, who has accompanied the Clintons on several trips to
Martha's Vineyard, was honored with his own T-shirt in this final
year of the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Vineyard bakery and gift shop The Black Dog printed
a version of its standard logo shirt featuring a Labrador wearing
an Uncle Sam top hat and playing the saxophone. On the back it
reads: ''Hail and Farewell. Here's to Wonderful Vineyard Memories.
Bye-bye, Buddy. Bye-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons spent three days on Martha's Vineyard this year,
their shortest vacation on the island yet.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds swarm Buddy almost as eagerly as they greet the
president, and years of star treatment seem to have made the dog
blase. Although polite, Buddy shows little interest in anyone other
than Clinton and a White House steward who serves as the dog's
primary handler.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, interested in food. When allowed to roam the
White House West Wing unfettered, Buddy makes a single-minded
circuit of staff offices and the press room. A quick check of the
trash can, a sniff of the carpet for crumbs and he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy may be the only White House resident who thoroughly
enjoyed last month's Camp David peace talks. For him, the rural
setting and loose schedule were ideal: Lots of room to run and lots
of people eating at almost any hour of the day or night.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Announces Delay in Defense  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's assessment of how and when to
move forward with a national missile defense will take several
weeks long than planned, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cohen is unlikely to recommend a course of action
to President Clinton until early September, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That still would give Clinton time to decide before leaving
office whether to authorize initial steps toward building a new
missile-tracking radar in Alaska -- a key first step to eventually
deploying a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen previously had indicated he expected to make his
recommendation to Clinton by mid-August following an internal
Pentagon study, called a deployment readiness review, to assess
technical progress and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of difficult issues remain to be resolved,'' Cohen
said in a brief written statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   These issues -- including whether the rocket booster to be used
for the antimissile system can be ready for full-scale production
by 2003 -- must be settled before Cohen receives the internal
assessment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another unsettled question is whether the Pentagon should go
ahead with the next flight test of the antimissile system as
scheduled this fall. Officials are considering putting it off until
December or later. The past two flight tests -- the most recent of
which was in early July -- failed, raising questions about whether
the Pentagon was pushing too hard to meet a target date for
deploying the system by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The internal review now under way is headed by Jacques Gansler,
the under secretary of defense for acquisition and technology, and
officials of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which runs
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will make no recommendation about the future of the NMD
program until I have analyzed their findings,'' Cohen said. ''I
expect that to happen and to report to the president within the
next few weeks. Recent reports that I have made a decision on this
matter, preliminary or otherwise, are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no immediate or artificial deadline for a
recommendation to the president,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to make the best possible recommendation ... not
the earliest possible recommendation.''

<HEADLINE> Several injured in I-91 accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORWICH, Vt. (AP) - Wet pavement is being blamed for an accident
that sent a van airborne off the southbound lane of Interstate 91
in Norwich.
</P>
<P>
   Four children and two adults, all from New York, were
transported to the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon,
N.H., by several ambulances from the towns of Fairlee, Hartford and
Hanover, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont State Police Trooper Peter Garivaltis said none of the
injuries sustained in the accident appeared to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked a lot worse than it was. There was a ton of
ambulances up there because there were four kids in the van and
everyone was being really cautious because of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The occupants of the van were all family members from Brooklyn,
N.Y., and the four children were ages 1, 2, 3, and 5, Garivaltis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The little ones are all fine,'' he said. ''They were just
bringing the father in for some precautionary x-rays, but everybody
else was set to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Garivaltis said the cause of the crash appeared to be the wet
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The driver said the road was wet and he just slipped off the
road. There wasn't any skidding on the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norwich Fire Chief Jack Fraser, who oversaw the rescue efforts,
said crews worked quickly to help the injured but were hampered by
a language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all Korean and as near as we could tell none of them
could speak English,'' he said. ''We went down into the brook bed
and searched all around to make sure there weren't any more
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ambulance crews and a large number of Vermont
State Police troopers, fire engines and FAST Squad members were
called to the scene from Norwich, Hartford, Thetford and Hanover to
provide manpower to help carry patients on backboards several
hundred feet back up to the roadway for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It takes a while to evaluate each patient and get them
properly on the backboard and check them out so it took awhile,''
Fraser said. ''We put five people in neck braces and stuff because
we weren't sure how bad they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The van was headed south and had just passed over the
Pompanoosuc Bridge when the accident occurred shortly before 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The van ended up upright in a stream with both front airbags
deployed and some damage to the bottom and the front of the
vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman on ticket could help Hillary Clinton win Jews  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - He stood up for Hillary Rodham Clinton when she
was accused of anti-Semitism, and he stood next to her when she met
with Orthodox rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Now Joseph Lieberman's name will appear along with Clinton's on
every ballot in New York. And that could help her get Jewish votes
she desperately needs to beat Republican Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary has got to be smiling today,'' said Democratic state
Assemblyman Dov Hikind, an Orthodox Jew who has not yet made an
endorsement in the Senate race and has criticized Clinton for some
of her positions on Jewish issues.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore selected Lieberman, the Democratic senator from
Connecticut, as his vice presidential running mate Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone like Lieberman, who is deeply respected, is going to
make a lot of independent-minded people take a second look at the
Democrats,'' Hikind said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, it's good news for Hillary,'' said Lee Miringoff,
pollster for the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ''She's
having trouble with the Jewish vote. This will start off a larger
number of Jews on the Gore-Lieberman-Clinton line. ... Also we can
expect a larger Jewish turnout. It's not a guarantee of success but
it shifts everything to a more favorable terrain for her.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If they project a close race for Hillary, as they are
projecting, it could be the difference,'' said U.S. Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show voters overall are nearly evenly divided between
Clinton and Lazio. Jews make up just 12 percent of the electorate
here, but about 15 percent of them are undecided, so winning their
support could help win the race.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has also been fighting a perception that she is
overly sympathetic to the Palestinians, and Lieberman could aid her
credibility. In December, he accompanied Clinton to a meeting with
the Orthodox Union, which represents Orthodox synagogues. Last
month, Lieberman joined other Jewish legislators in Washington
defending Clinton against an allegation that she used an
anti-Semitic obscenity in an argument in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's friendship with the Clintons goes back to 1970, when
President Clinton - then a Yale Law student - campaigned for
Lieberman's state Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, New York Democrats were already gleefully
linking the first lady's name with his. ''Al Gore, Joe Lieberman,
and Hillary Clinton will be a strong and effective team,'' said
state party Chairwoman Judith Hope.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks Clinton will get a bounce from
Lieberman's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Yaakov Kornreich, who works for the National Council of Young
Israel, which is based in New York and represents 150 Orthodox
synagogues nationwide, noted that Lieberman is best known for
having denounced the president's sexual escapades and said, ''If we
see the selection of Joe Lieberman as a repudiation of the Clinton
White House, I don't see how that helps Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Diament, public policy director for the Orthodox Union,
said that if Lieberman were to campaign with Clinton, ''maybe that
could impress some swing voters.''
</P>
<P>
   But he pointed out that ''if Lazio and Clinton get in a debate
about school choice, Lazio can say, 'Well, Sen. Lieberman voted for
school choice.''' Lieberman supports tax-funded vouchers for
private school tuition; Clinton does not. Lazio supports them in
areas with failing public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaign spokesman Dan McLagan said that while Lieberman
is ''well-respected on both sides of the political aisle, I doubt
it'll have any impact on the Senate race because New Yorkers
realize this is about Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio, not who Al
Gore's V.P. pick is.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan President to Stop in L.A.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite China's objection, the president of
Taiwan will be permitted to stop in Los Angeles on his way to
Central America later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is designed ''for the safety and convenience of
the traveler,'' the State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Monday. ''There are no meetings expected with any administration
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   China objected to the U.S. decision to issue Chen Shui-bian a
visa for the layover in Los Angeles and warned it would damage U.S.
ties with China severely.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao expressed ''strong
resentment and firm opposition'' to the decision.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, China was enraged when Chen's predecessor, Lee
Teng-hui, was permitted to speak at his alma mater, Cornell
University. China responded by lobbing test missiles near Taiwan
and suspending talks with the island.
</P>
<P>
   Chen announced last month that he would visit Taiwan's allies in
Central America and Africa in August, via Los Angeles, in his first
diplomatic offensive since taking office in May.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week trip, beginning Sunday, includes Dominica,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Chad, which are
among Taiwan's 29 diplomatic allies.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing China's complaint, Boucher said ''We have explained
it to the Chinese. I think we've answered this question several
times in public.''

<HEADLINE> Cuomo, Pataki dole out federal grants  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo and
Gov. George Pataki Monday went on separate grant-giving trips in
eastern New York, but both said their handing out of government
goodies on the same day was just a scheduling coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Cuomo is considering a run for governor in 2002 while
Pataki, a Republican who unseated Cuomo's father Mario in 1994, has
indicated he may seek re-election to a third term in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo stopped at Haverstraw, Peekskill and Beacon to announce
$19.4 million in federal economic development funds for the Hudson
Valley region. Grants were awarded to the three communities, as
well as to Ossining, Yonkers, Newburgh and Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are part of a regional economic development plan
modeled after HUD's Canal Corridor Initiative for communities along
the Erie Canal, Cuomo spokeswoman Sandi Abadinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson River Partnership 2000 comprises the seven
communities and is expected to create more than 500 jobs locally,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the Erie Canal was ''an overwhelming success'' and
that the Hudson Valley Partnership would ''bring the same concept
to sustainable economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pataki doled out more than $22 million in federal
money for various local projects in eastern New York. The governor
stopped in Highland Falls, Scotia and Saranac Lake to make the
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Development Block Grant Small Cities Program was
originally administered by HUD, but last year President Clinton
authorized transferring control of the program to the Pataki
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The transition ended weeks of political squabbling in Albany and
Washington over who would get authority - and thus the political
credit - or handing out the $60 million in federal grants. Prior to
Clinton's action, New York and Hawaii were the only states that
didn't distribute the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York communities now deal with one central office that is
accountable to New York residents,'' Pataki said. ''This is a major
improvement over the previous Washington-based process.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said Monday the funds are still HUD money, with ''the
state as our agent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate Governor Pataki highlighting the importance of
the federal grants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans have said they were concerned about the
political mileage Cuomo could have gotten out of the grant program
during a possible gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Pataki and Cuomo said they were not aware of each
other's schedules until Monday, when it became apparent that the
two men were making announcements similar in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our schedule was made way in advance,'' Cuomo spokeswoman
Sandi Abadinsky said. ''It's a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokeswoman Suzanne Morris also called the competing
grant-giving tours a ''coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Abadinsky said the funds Cuomo handed out Monday came out of
federal programs that were separate from the Small Cities
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   About $15.8 million of the assistance came from HUD's Economic
Development Loan Guarantees, which allow municipalities to borrow
money at reduced interest rates. The remaining $3.8 million are
grants from the federal Economic Development Initiative, designed
to help create local jobs among low and moderate income residents.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Cuomo released a report Monday touting the
economic impact of the Canal Corridor Initiative. The Cornell
University study concluded that the initiative helped increase
hotel occupancy and boat traffic in the region and would result in
27,000 new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani: City had record number of visitors in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The number of tourists visiting the city reached
an all-time high in 1999, with 36.7 million visitors spending an
estimated $15.5 billion, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is second only to Orlando as the destination of
choice among visitors from the United States, according to the
convention and tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism figures - culled from the U.S. Department of
Commerce, consumer surveys and a travel research study - were not
debated by tourism officials in Orlando or Las Vegas, which placed
third, according to the city report.
</P>
<P>
   The convention and tourism bureau defines a visitor as someone
who travels at least 50 miles to reach the city - excluding
commuters - or someone who stays overnight.

<HEADLINE> Premature Kids Linked to Problems  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Babies born prematurely tend to have more
problems in school and in childhood socializing than do babies that
were carried to full term, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by psychology researchers at Syracuse University,
found that significantly more children born prematurely had
behavioral, learning and thinking problems than did children who
were born full term. The study was presented Monday at the national
convention of the American Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lewandowski of Syracuse University said the study was
important because more babies born at 24 to 31 weeks now are being
kept alive and become well enough physically to leave the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A study co-authored by Lewandowski and Jeremie R. Barlow
compared the development of 118 babies born prematurely (gestation
of 24 to 31 weeks) with that of 119 babies who were delivered after
a full term gestation, 38 to 42 weeks. The study conclusions were
based on tests that started at birth and were continued at
intervals until the age of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow said that she found 39 percent of the premature babies
had below normal IQs of 85 or less, while only 13 percent of the
full term infants had such IQs. The international average for IQs
of 85 or less is 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Based on data from questionnaires filled out by teachers and
parents, Barlow said the researchers also found that the premature
youngsters had more social problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''More of them did poorly on measures of social skills,'' said
Barlow. ''There was more peer conflict and they tended to have
fewer friends, and less social success.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study measuring academic skills, 41 of the premature
children, or 35 percent, scored at the deficit level in an academic
screening test, while 10 of the full term children, about eight
percent, scored in the low range.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight of the 118 premature children were classified as
learning disabled, while 11 of the 119 full term children were
given this classification.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results...indicated that preterm children were more likely
to have clinically significant scores (impairment) on more than one
measures and in more than one area,'' the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewandowski said that earlier studies had shown that children
born prematurely were up to four times less likely to graduate from
high school. The new study shows that social and academic deficits
start very early and continue until at least age 10. He said it is
hoped that the children can be followed through high school to see
if there is an improvement with maturity.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, said Lewandowski, the study suggests strongly that
parents of premature babies need to make special effort to enrich
the social and intellectual development of their children. He said
such parents should seek professional help to learn special
''parenting skills'' that may be needed for these children.
</P>
<P>
   Such things as massage and other physical contact, bright and
interesting visual objects, and pleasant and interesting sounds all
provide cribside stimulation that may help these infants develop
better intellectual and social skills for their school years, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Congressional colleagues support Gore's choice  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The five Democrats and two Republicans in
the Connecticut congressional delegation have tackled everything
from defense contracts to heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they reacted with pride and praise after learning
Sen. Joseph Lieberman is Vice President Al Gore's choice for
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a proud day, a wonderful day for the state and the
country. You have two very bright, committed individuals who will
make their case across the country,'' said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro,
a New Haven Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   DeLauro, who has known Lieberman for about 30 years, said she
also believes voters will sense the genuine friendship between Gore
and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't feign a friendship,'' said the five-term
congresswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Senate colleague Christopher Dodd called his fellow Democrat ''a
tremendously decent human being.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he thinks Lieberman should continue his re-election
bid for Senate. Under state law he can run for both at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a strong candidate. I don't think it's fair to deprive
him of that,'' said Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   John Larson, the first-term Democrat from East Hartford, said he
believed Gore's choice had more to do with who Lieberman is than an
attempt to distance himself from President Clinton's sex scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he selected Joe Lieberman to get inoculated,''
said Larson. ''As we know ... (Lieberman's) a fighter, he's willing
to take on big oil, the pharmaceutical industry, the entertainment
industry. ... I believe that that's the reason that Gore selected
him.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. James Maloney, a Waterbury Democrat, said Lieberman's
candidacy would energize voters from all parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe Lieberman is a man of strong character and family
values,'' said Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson said Lieberman would be a solid
campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really strengthens Al Gore and builds the kind of
partnership we want in the White House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican colleagues also praised Gore's choice. U.S. Rep.
Christopher Shays of Bridgeport likened Lieberman to Bush running
mate Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is thoughtful and articulate, and commands respect on both
sides of the aisle,'' said Shays.
</P>
<P>
   New Britain Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson also praised
Lieberman's ability to work across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore has done himself a great favor. He couldn't have made
a better choice,'' Johnson said. ''I think it strengthens the Gore
ticket, but in the end I never saw any presidential election that
was determined by the vice presidential nominee.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats, Jews, even Whitman shower praise on Lieberman selection  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Al Gore is drawing praise in New Jersey for
his choice of a running mate both from Democrats counting on a
solid presidential ticket and from Jews proud that a milestone has
been reached in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is
expected to formally introduce Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman
Tuesday at a Tennessee news conference. Lieberman, a devout
Orthodox Jew, confirmed to reporters Monday he had been offered and
had accepted the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republican Gov. Christie Whitman offered a backhanded
compliment Monday, saying Lieberman would fit better with GOP
presidential nominee George W. Bush because of Lieberman's
integrity and support for school-choice programs. ''Sen. Lieberman
has been more in synch with Gov. Bush than he's been with Vice
President Gore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg said Lieberman boosts the ticket as a
man of high morals who will place education first. But Lautenberg
downplayed the importance of the nominee's religious faith, noting
he and Lieberman are among 11 Jews in the U.S. Senate. ''I think
once we've had a couple of days go by, you'll see less talk that
he's a Jew,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac College of Hamden, Conn., reported that its polling
in New Jersey since June 1999 found Lieberman with higher approval
ratings among New Jersey registered voters than another other
person they asked about. The most recent poll on July 20 gave
Lieberman a 74-percent approval rating in a poll with a margin of
error of 3.1 percentage points. Five earlier polls gave Lieberman
approval ratings above 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Goldstein of the Anti-Defamation League called the
selection ''a milestone in America's political maturity and
sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an even greater milestone if his Judiasm had no
impact either way,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The senator is an observant Jew who has served his state well
for 12 years, so it should not matter,'' Goldstein said, doubting
there will be a measurable loss of votes because of anti-Semitism.
''These people will be dismissed as the extremists that they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, D-Bergen, praised Lieberman's
selection as a triple play because it appeals to her as a party
organizer in New Jersey, as a delegate to the Democratic National
Convention and as a Jewish woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''On all three of those counts I am very, very pleased with this
selection,'' she said. ''It came as a surprise, which by itself is
very important to boost interest in the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg recalled how her father, Murray Isaacs, endured
anti-Semitic insults while involved in Democratic politics in New
York City. ''As a Jew, this will be a moment none of us ever
forgets,'' she said. ''This country is a little bit behind on
firsts.''

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Trial Seems Unlikely  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- When it meets on Tuesday, Chile's Supreme
Court is expected confirm it has given its legal approval for Gen.
Augusto Pinochet to be tried on human rights abuse charges.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the high court agreeing to the elimination of his
immunity from prosecution, the former dictator's foes acknowledge
that a quick trial is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The former dictator's age of 84, his medical problems and his
other legal privileges could drag out attempts to try him on
charges stemming from his 1973-1990 rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not see Pinochet going to jail,'' Hugo Gutierrez,
attorney for several plaintiffs in the case, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Pinochet on trial ''could take up to eight years,''
Eduardo Contreras, a communist lawyer who filed the first complaint
against Pinochet in 1998, said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The court voted last week on Pinochet's appeal of a lower
court's ruling stripping him of the immunity he enjoys as a
senator-for-life, a position he created for himself in the
constitution written by his regime.
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling will not be announced until Tuesday, lawyers
for both sides and Chilean news media have reported that the 20
justices voted 11-9 against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they would step up security around the court
building to keep expected pro- and anti-Pinochet demonstrators
apart.
</P>
<P>
   President Ricardo Lagos, a socialist who was briefly jailed
under Pinochet, appealed Monday for calm and for all to respect the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   If the case against Pinochet goes forward, prospective trial
judge Juan Guzman, would almost certainly face further delays.
Since Pinochet is older than 70, Guzman would have to have him
examined by doctors to determine whether he is fit to stand trial.
Pinochet's relatives and lawyers, however, say the former ruler
will not submit to the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   They say that while Pinochet is in poor health, he is not
mentally incompetent, the only grounds in Chilean law to exempt
people from criminal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet suffers from diabetes, has a pacemaker and has
sustained three mild strokes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pinochet's status as a retired general gives him
the right to be questioned in writing rather than in person, which
could also delay the process.
</P>
<P>
   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he

<HEADLINE> 15-year-old girl found dead, high school classmate charged with murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) - A 16-year-old high school student was
charged with second-degree murder on Monday, only hours after the
body of one of his classmates was discovered at the edge of Seneca
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Horein, 16, of Watkins Glen, was arrested Monday in
connection with the death of Amber Brockway, also a village
resident. He was arraigned in Town of Dix Justice Court and was
being held without bail at Schuyler County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Brockway's body was found in a remote area near the southern
edge of the lake, according to the Schuyler County Sheriff's
Department. An autopsy performed by the Monroe County Medical
Examiner's Office indicated that she died immediately after being
struck several times in the head with a blunt object.
</P>
<P>
   Family members had reported Amber missing Saturday evening after
she failed to return home, and police began an around-the-clock
search for her. She was last seen at approximately 7 p.m. near the
Watkins Glen public fishing pier, where she had walked to meet with
some friends, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   No motive was given for the murder, but investigators confirmed
that Amber and her attacker had been friends and that both attended
Watkins Glen High School. No further arrests were expected, police
said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina's Unemployed Pray  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Argentina's
unemployed and under-employed flocked to a shrine of the patron
saint of labor on Monday, in an annual pilgrimage swollen by one of
the highest jobless rates in years.
</P>
<P>
   Waving sheaves of grain symbolizing work, the crowd formed lines
winding their way more than a mile to the Church of San Cayetano, a
Roman Catholic saint many here call upon in times of joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God, I now have work. I am here to thank San Cayetano
for fulfilling my prayers,'' said Oscar Gomez, a 36-year-old
carpenter who went three months without a job and now counts
himself lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrimage, held every year on Aug. 7, comes just weeks
after the government of President Fernando De la Rua announced the
official unemployment rate remains stubbornly high.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported in mid-July that national joblessness
has edged up to 15.4 percent. That compares with 13.8 percent in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The latest unemployment figure is still lower than the peak of
18.4 percent reached in May 1995, but it has left many analysts
with darkened hopes for an economic revival in Argentina. The
country is struggling to pull itself from a region-wide recession
that began in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks now, the unemployed have been camping around the San
Cayetano church in hopes of an economic miracle, some traveling
from poorer cities in the Argentine countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no work. I need to find work to take care of my son.
I'll do anything: clean rooms, work as a maid, anything,'' said
Maria Fernandez, 25, who cradled an 8-month-old boy in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   Police cordoned off whole blocks around the church, and street
vendors spent a brisk morning selling plastic statues of San
Cayetano and special powders and incense used in petitions to the
labor saint.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Alegre, 44, brought his two children in tow, hoping for
work. ''It's been a year since I've had a decent job. Right now I'm
just doing any little thing to get by,'' said Alegre. ''This has
been a very tough year.''
</P>
<P>
   Double-digit unemployment has troubled Argentine since 1994 --
even during periods of high growth. The government has forecast 3.5
percent growth this year, but independent economists say that is
optimistic at best.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Molina, a 25-year-old restaurant worker, said Monday he
was thankful for his job, but worried about the rest of Argentina.
''Things are rally bad. You can see it in the streets,'' said
Molina.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of job seekers have lined up in recent weeks at
factories and businesses advertising only a handful of jobs.
Protests by unemployed workers have become commonplace in
Argentina's impoverished provinces, where demonstrations often
ended in clashes with police.

<HEADLINE> Fox: US Ties May Help Latin America  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Mexico's President-elect Vicente Fox said
Monday his country's close trade and economic ties with the United
States could help bring stronger ties with Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chilean capital, Fox launched a four-nation tour of South
America vowing to seek ''full integration.'' Aside from Chile, Fox
will visit Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, which along with Paraguay
make up the Mercosur free trade block.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make absolutely clear that we are turning our eyes
toward Latin America,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a joint news conference with Chilean President
Ricardo Lagos, Fox said the United States should drop its current
unilateral certification of foreign countries' efforts against drug
production and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said his trip -- his first since his July 2 election victory
-- aims to show that while ''we have built a very important trade
and political relationship with North America, that should not
separate us from Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, he said, ''our closeness to the world's biggest
market should be useful to every nation in Latin America.'' Mexico
formed the North American Free Trade Accord, NAFTA, with the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the certification of efforts against drugs by countries
that produce drugs or are used as transit by traffickers ''should
be a multilateral mechanism where we all participate, with clearly
established obligations and goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the United States makes a unilateral certification,
which is also used to determine its aid to foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
   A multilateral action ''would allow us to face in an
internationally coordinated manner a crime that is internationally
organized,'' Fox said. ''It is not possible for individual
countries to fight this scum, this cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who takes office Dec. 1st, said his government will
maintain Mexico's oil giant ''in the current conditions'' under
state ownership. He said private investments will be accepted in
some areas of the electric sector, but that the sector would remain
in the hands of the state.
</P>
<P>
   He said that as a result of his election, Mexico has gained
''full democracy.'' Fox was the first opposition presidential
candidate to defeat a member of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, in power for 71 years.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani administration orders safety changes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Giuliani administration has ordered a series
of safety measures at one of the city's largest parades after two
children and an adult were struck and killed last year by floats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes at next month's West Indian American Day
Parade will be a ban on alcohol sales and consumption, and the
requirement that the parade's drivers and vehicles pass a Police
Department safety review before the September 4 parade.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the city will mandate vehicles pulling floats to have a
police officer riding in the passenger cab and require the parade's
marshals to undergo training by the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, recommended by a mayoral task force, will
also be instituted at the city's other parades.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1999 West Indian Day Parade, two 11-year-old children
dancing behind a parade float died after the truck pulling the
float stopped abruptly and a second vehicle pinned them between the
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the vehicle that stopped had a suspended license.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, an 18-year-old man was killed by a float
after he was startled by someone in the crowd with a yellow snake
and stumbled backward. His clothing became caught on the float - an
18-wheel flatbed truck - and he was pulled under it and crushed.
</P>
<P>
   But City Councilwoman Una Clarke said the city ban on alcohol
sales at related events preceding the parade could hurt the event's
finances, which is underwritten in part through alcohol sales
during the five-day celebration that encompasses the parade.
</P>
<P>
   The annual parade in Brooklyn attracts some 2 million people
each year and has been a New York tradition since the 1930s.

<HEADLINE> NYPD reports 56 incidents during first two days of strike  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Strikers heckled workers at Verizon
Communications buildings on Monday and police reported 56 incidents
of violence or harassment during the first two days of a phone
company strike affecting 87,200 workers in 12 states.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 picketers wearing red union T-shirts milled about
behind police barricades in front of the company's midtown
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey scab! How's it feel to be a scab!'' they shouted at people
who entered and left the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want job security,'' said Jeff Greenberg, a central office
technician and shop steward. ''Everything we've worked for in every
contract Verizon is trying to re-negotiate and retrogress.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Rodriguez, a customer service representative, added,
''They're relocating our work. We can do it. Why go to outside
contractors?''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Verizon and its unions - the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers - continued Monday in Washington after the contract expired
early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The main issues include job security and the unions' ability to
organize in Verizon's wireless division, where fewer than 50 of the
32,000 workers are union members.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was formed in June by the merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE Corp and maintains 160 offices, garages and warehouses
throughout the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   New York City police reported 40 acts of vandalism against phone
company installations since Sunday and 16 other incidents such as
threats against Verizon managers.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,500 telephone customers lost service in the Bronx on
Sunday, and in Manhattan someone vandalized a fiber optic station
on East 15th Street, causing another 600 customers to lose phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   A Verizon truck was set on fire in the Bronx on Monday but
firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze, said Sgt. Brian Burke,
a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Soraya Rodriguez, a Verizon spokeswoman, said the company was
''not making assumptions'' about who was responsible for the acts
of vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's part of doing business, unfortunately,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Master, a spokesman for the union, said, ''We discourage any
illegal behavior, we discourage any acts of violence, but we are a
militant union and we organize and protest very forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as we know, there is no indication that this is even
connected to the strike. Even the company admits that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said some 30,000 managers have been deployed to keep
phone service running.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customers should have no problems making or receiving calls,''
she said, but adding that anyone who calls for repair work should
expect delays.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman praises American dream, working people, attacks Republicans </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Suddenly in the spotlight as Al Gore's
running mate, Joseph I. Lieberman praised the American dream and
told Connecticut union workers that they are the engine of the
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Officially wearing the hat of a senator seeking re-election,
Lieberman spoke Monday to the state AFL-CIO political convention.
But word of Gore's early morning decision turned the speech into a
rousing rally for the 58-year-old Orthodox Jew from New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, a funny thing happened to me on the way to the
AFL-CIO convention,'' Lieberman joked as hundreds of union workers
chanted his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of a place I'd rather be at this momentous time
in my life than with you, the working people of the state of
Connecticut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore formally gave Lieberman the vice presidential nod in a
telephone call at midday, and Lieberman accepted, having known for
hours that the job was his.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, Lieberman emphasized his working-class
beginnings and they way his own parents lived the American dream.
He praised both teachers and laborers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is you and your families that are the real heroes in making
Connecticut's comeback happen,'' he said. ''You are the engine that
has driven our remarkable economic recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on all levels have successfully created jobs, lowered
interest rates, protected the environment and helped Americans move
from welfare to work, Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Gore, Lieberman described his boss-to-be as an
honorable, intelligent, hardworking man who is qualified to lead
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will be proud to stand with him every day, just as I am
proud to stand with you, the true American heroes.'' Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   His words for the Republican party were less friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the working people of America look for a helping hand
from the other party and the other ticket, they too often will
receive the back of the hand,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, as reporters awaited Lieberman's arrival outside the
Hartford Hilton, his Republican opponent in the Senate race took
the stage. Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano said his city has a
strong, longtime association with labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano said he walked picket lines with union workers after a
local mall was built by non-labor workers. His most notable
achievement regarding unions in Waterbury, he said, has been the
development of strong project labor agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've done my best to maintain a good relationship with the
unions,'' he said. ''The local trade unions have an excellent
record of completing a quality job on time, and under budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite speculation that Republican leaders may ask him to
withdraw from the Senate race in favor of a stronger candidate,
Giordano said he is not quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't give up the ship that easy,'' Giordano said. ''It's
the old Marine in me. Once I make a decision, I give it 150
percent.''

<P>
	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - A man with a knife accosted a teen-age
couple on the Boardwalk and abducted the girl, who was later found
in Cumberland County, where she reported being sexually assaulted,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, who was described as a 5-foot-11 inch, 190-pound
white man, accosted the 17-year-old victims on the Boardwalk at
First Street about 2:20 a.m. Monday, according to Det. Sgt. William
Wilent.
</P>
<P>
   He forced them onto the beach, where he tied up the boy before
taking the girl to a light-colored Ford and driving her to
Commercial Township, where she was found by the New Jersey State
Police.
</P>
<P>
   ''She reported being sexually assaulted in an isolated area,''
Wilent said in a prepared statement released late Tuesday by
police. Wilent could not be reached for comment Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, whose identity was withheld by police, was treated and
released at Burdette Tomlin Hospital in Cape May Court House.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Strahan Returns to Practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Three-time Pro Bowl defensive end Michael
Strahan returned to practice with the New York Giants on Monday
after missing the last week with a sore back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't go anywhere without people asking me about my back,''
Strahan said. ''My back is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan, 28, said he probably will have to take care of his back
the rest of the season, getting in early to stretch and doing
strengthening exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan, defensive tackle Keith Hamilton, middle linebacker Mike
Barrow and safety Shaun Williams all missed Saturday night's 20-8
loss to the Chicago Bears in the preseason opener.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton (hamstring) and guard Scott Kiernan (ankle) returned to
practice Monday along with Strahan. Barrow (knee) and Williams
(toe) are still sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Joe Jurevicius left practice with a mild shoulder
sprain. Also missing practice Monday were fullback Greg Comella
(back), running back Omar Bacon (hamstring), defensive tackle Ryan
Hale (shoulder), safety Tawambi Settles (shoulder), defensive end
Jeremiah Parker (stinger), guard Mike Rosenthal (shoulder) and
fullback Ron Janes (hamstring).

<HEADLINE> Blumenthal: Lieberman started trend of activist AGs  </HEADLINE>
By RICH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Before he was a U.S. senator, before he
was Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman was Connecticut's
attorney general. While in that office he went after consumer fraud
and polluters with a vigor that sent the tone for his successors.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was one of the first proactive, really activist attorneys
general, particularly in areas like consumer protection and
environmental safeguards,'' said current Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal, also a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said Lieberman took on unsafe products such as lead
paint and certain types of all-terrain vehicles; targeted home
improvement fraud and odometer tampering; and brought hundreds of
lawsuits alleging violations of air, land, and water pollution
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1985, Lieberman threatened to sue record stores that
keep profits from ''Do They Know It's Christmas,'' a British album
meant to benefit starving people in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later he went to bat for then-state Rep. Chris
Shays, a Republican, who had been jailed for refusing to halt a
statement from the witness stand criticizing the state's judicial
review procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman argued that Shays should not have been jailed during
the legislative session and challenged the constitutionality of
Superior Court Judge Norris L. O'Neill's contempt ruling. The case
was later ruled moot.
</P>
<P>
   Shays is now a Republican member of Congress from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1985 Lieberman lost a U.S. Supreme Court case in which
he defended the state's sabbath law, which required employers to
give workers their choice of a day off for religious purposes each
week. The high court struck down the law as violating the
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 Lieberman failed in an effort to force the Boy Scouts of
America to accept a female troop leader, and sued the USA for
Africa Foundation for failing to file a required financial
disclosure statement.
</P>
<P>
   USA for Africa, maker of the ''We Are the World'' rock music
video, had raised millions of dollars, mostly for famine relief
victims in Africa. Lieberman dropped the suit after getting the
information he sought.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of environmental law and consumer protection, he was
very much at the forefront nationally in many different cases,''
Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, the very activist and aggressive approach to using
the law was different,'' he said. ''He made a very significant mark
on the office.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 99; Nasdaq Gains 76  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rallied Monday on optimism that interest
rates will remain stable in the face of recent economic data that
suggests the economy is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 99.26 at 10,867.01,
according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 16.39 at 1,479.32, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 75.63 at 3,862.99.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are searching for clues as to whether the Federal
Reserve Board will raise interest rates at its next meeting Aug.
22. But much of the economic data released recently has been of
little help, offering conflicting figures that can be interpreted
several ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on Friday the Labor Department reported that the
nation's unemployment rate was unchanged at 4 percent in July, one
of the lowest figures in decades.
</P>
<P>
   However, the report showed private payrolls rose by just 138,000
during the month, down significantly from a jump of 242,000 in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Investors chose to take an optimistic, big-picture approach
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in an environment where investors may be a little
confused. But I think we're out of the woods in terms of the
Federal Reserve Board wanting to raise interest rates. I think
they'll probably choose the path of least resistance,'' said Al
Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kugel said investors are looking at three indicators as proof
that another interest rate hike is unnecessary: solid but not
overheated growth, healthy second-quarter earnings reports and
continued low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a report on worker productivity due for release on
Tuesday is expected to reinforce the belief that the economy can
continue to grow, but not at the expense of rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised interest rates six times since last summer in
an effort to stave off inflation, and investors hope the recent
economic data provide enough evidence that the strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the stocks of big technology companies helped lift
blue-chips. Internet parts company Nortel Networks rose $4.312 to
$79.25, software company EMC jumped $4.687 to $90, and chip maker
Texas Instruments gained $3.375 to $57.75.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in technology stocks also gave a boost to the Nasdaq.
Software companies led the way, as Ariba closed up $10.922 to $135,
and BEA Systems rose $6.562 to $55.75. And fiber optics company JDS
Uniphase gained $5.25 to $121.188.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks were also up across the board. Chiron rose
$3.938 to $52.313.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3 to 2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.04 billion shares,
well below Friday's pace of 1.12 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 6.24 at 509.87.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.14 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.38 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.38 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.89 percent.

<HEADLINE> To friends and neighbors, Lieberman will always be 'Joe'  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Joseph Lieberman's life was catapulted
into the national spotlight Monday, but those who know the vice
presidential candidate say his new and temporary title won't change
him or what they think of him.
</P>
<P>
   When news broke that Al Gore had chosen Lieberman as his running
mate, friends and neighbors joined the growing crowd of reporters
in front of the Connecticut senator's house in the upper
middle-class Westville neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some were holding congratulatory signs reading ''Mazel tov
Joe.'' A next-door neighbor shouted ''Go get 'em Joe!'' when
Lieberman crossed his driveway on the way to take a private jet to
Gore's campaign headquarters in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has remained very humble,'' said Rabbi Albert Feldman of
the Westville Synagogue, which Lieberman attends. ''When he comes
to the synagogue, he still takes his seat in the back. And to
everyone, he's Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even last Friday - after a long meeting earlier in the day with
Gore - Lieberman wasn't too preoccupied to join his neighbors
across the street at sunset to usher in the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   ''We asked him if he would accept the nomination to join us,''
joked Nachama Langenauer, Lieberman's neighbor for the last 22
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very exciting, but we just know him as a person,''
Langenauer said. ''Who would think the person across the street
would be running for vice president?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Segaloff, who was a law firm partner with Lieberman from
1973 to 1985, said his friend was always more interested on
politics than law.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one level this doesn't surprise me,'' Segaloff said of
Lieberman's rise from state senator to attorney general and U.S.
senator. ''He was always very focused and very together. He had an
incredibly strong moral commitment to do what was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Many say it's Lieberman's strong moral center that made him a
good pick for Gore, who critics charge is poised to inherit a
morally bankrupt administration.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was one of the first Democrats to criticize President
Clinton's behavior in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and has been a
vocal critic of violence and sex in movies and on television.
Beyond his neighborhood, Lieberman's sense of decency has gained
respect in his workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe Lieberman is a giant in the Senate,'' said Massachusetts
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. ''He's worked brilliantly, effectively and
tirelessly to promote the highest values of public service and
integrity in public office.''

<HEADLINE> Ferre: Wallet Stolen at Funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Former Gov. Luis A. Ferre says a
pickpocket stole his wallet with $1,500 during a funeral for his
sister, a Roman Catholic nun whose charity work gained her acclaim
in Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Ferre, 96, told police that the wallet disappeared Saturday
during a ceremony attended by thousands of people for Isolina Ferre
in Ponce, according to a police report. Ferre was escorted by aides
and police bodyguards at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Monday they had no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Ferre founded the U.S. Caribbean territory's New Progressive
Party and was governor from 1968 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Isolina Ferre, founded centers for delinquent youth in
Puerto Rico, New York and the Appalachian mountain region of the
United States. She was awarded her the Medal of Freedom, the United
States' highest civilian honor, in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Recall Pitcher Cubillan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Darwin Cubillan, a right-hander acquired last
month in a trade with Toronto, was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma
on Monday by the Texas Rangers, who optioned reliever Francisco
Cordero back to the minors/
</P>
<P>
   ubillan, 25, came to Texas in a July 19 deal with the Blue Jays
along with infielder Mike Young. In six games at Oklahoma, Cubillan
did not allow a run in 13 innings, got one save and struck out 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he has done at Triple-A has been exciting,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said of Cubillan, who spent seven seasons in
the Yankees organization before signing with Toronto as a free
agent in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, 22, went 1-1 with a 5.62 ERA in 41 games for the
Rangers. He got off to a good start this season, but he allowed
runs in five of his last six appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can get big league hitters out right now, but I think he
has a chance to be a superstar out of the bullpen,'' Oates said.
''He's got the arm for it. He's got the slider for it, but
location-wise he's got to get better.''

<HEADLINE> Titans' McNair Rests Sore Shoulder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Steve McNair watched practice Monday
afternoon, resting his sore shoulder following the Tennessee
Titans' exhibition opener.
</P>
<P>
   McNair finished practice with some light running, and coach Jeff
Fisher said the quarterback will be back at practice Tuesday.
Fisher said coaches didn't want to push McNair so early since the
Titans don't play again until Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just sore. He's actually been stiff last week, week and a
half, and just worked through it. He's been doing an awful lot of
throwing. We just decided to back down a little bit,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher said the soreness wasn't a concern even though McNair
sat out some drills during a practice last week. McNair was 3-of-5
for 26 yards and a touchdown in the Titans' 14-10 victory over
Kansas City on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans did get linebacker Terry Killens (strained quad
muscle) and cornerbacks Dainon Sidney (strained calf) and Kareem
Clark (hamstring) back at practice.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Yancey Thigpen ran by himself during drills and spent
25 minutes catching passes from rookie quarterback Billy Volek
after practice. The Titans hope he can join in drills for the first
time since training camp started by mid-week.

<HEADLINE> 'Hollow Man' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An invisible mad scientist beat a portly
professor, a band of grumpy old astronauts and a bunch of babes on
a bar.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollow Man,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue,
materialized as the No. 1 film over the weekend, debuting with
$26.8 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's top movie, ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,''
slipped to second place with $18 million. Clint Eastwood and crew
opened in third with ''Space Cowboys,'' a tale of aging pilots on a
NASA mission, taking in $17.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coyote Ugly,'' about an aspiring songwriter who lands a job
strutting on a rowdy nightclub bar, premiered at No. 4 with $17
million.
</P>
<P>
   With three diverse new movies and a strong holdover in ''Nutty
Professor,'' the overall box office still lagged far behind the
same period in 1999. The top 12 movies grossed $116.5 million, down
15.3 percent from the same weekend a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The marketplace is not expanding. You had three huge movies
that opened and were highly anticipated, and this marketplace
couldn't expand?'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for
Universal. ''I wish the business was better.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, this summer's box office is off slightly from last
year, when revenues hit a record $3 billion, said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks
movie-ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Given a weak crop of films opening before Labor Day, Hollywood
seems to have little chance of meeting last year's high. Last
August was buoyed by the surprise smashes ''The Blair Witch
Project'' and ''The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They call it the dog days of August for a reason, but last
year changed all that. It became the strong days of August,''
Dergarabedian said. ''Holdovers did well, and new movies came in
strong. I don't know if we'll see that this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's movie lineup this season simply has not stacked up
to last year's. ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' fired
up summer 1999, followed by an ''Austin Powers'' sequel,
''Tarzan,'' Adam Sandler's ''Big Daddy,'' ''American Pie'' and
Julia Roberts' ''Notting Hill'' and ''Runaway Bride.'' Even Stanley
Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' while ultimately disappointing
film-goers, built anticipation and got audiences thinking about
going to movies.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's successes have been solid but more modest overall.
''Mission: Impossible 2'' is the only movie to top $200 million,
and ''The Perfect Storm'' has hit $165 million. ''Scary Movie'' has
been the only surprise blockbuster, hitting $140 million and
surpassing ''Good Will Hunting'' as Miramax's top-grossing movie
ever.
</P>
<P>
   If the weekend numbers hold, ''Hollow Man'' would become the
biggest August debut ever, beating ''The Sixth Sense's'' $26.7
million. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, ''Hollow Man'' features
dazzling visual wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Audiences were very ripe for an invisible man story, and
clearly, the special effects are just incredible,'' said Ed
Russell, executive vice president for publicity at Sony, the
movie's distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Space Cowboys,'' directed by Eastwood and co-starring Tommy
Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner, was Eastwood's
best-ever opening. The movie drew mainly older audiences, said Dan
Fellman, head of distribution for Warner Bros., which released
''Space Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Coyote Ugly'' attracted largely female crowds, with half the
audience under 21, said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for
Disney, whose Touchstone label released it.
</P>
<P>
   In limited release, ''Saving Grace'' grossed $290,000 at 30
cinemas, a healthy opening average of $9,630 a theater. The comedy
stars Brenda Blethyn as a widow who grows marijuana to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Tao of Steve,'' starring Donal Logue as a chubby
womanizer, debuted at nine theaters with $90,407, averaging
$10,045.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Hollow Man,'' $26.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,'' $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''Space Cowboys,'' $17.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Coyote Ugly,'' $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''What Lies Beneath,'' $13.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''X-men,'' $6.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Scary Movie,'' $4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''The Perfect Storm,'' $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Disney's The Kid,'' $2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''The Patriot,'' $2.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Colts' Bennett Passes Physical  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- An anxious Cornelius Bennett went to
bed early Sunday night -- hoping he would pass his physical the next
morning and get to practice with the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   The good night's sleep paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, I stay up until two, three o'clock in the morning,
regardless of what time I have to get up,'' he said. ''I was in bed
about 8, 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very anxious to get out to prove, not only to everybody
that wants me out there, but to prove to myself that I can overcome
adversity,'' said Bennett, who led the Colts with 114 tackles last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's plans for a 14th NFL season were put on hold when he
failed a physical after reporting to training camp July 13. He had
remained in camp, rehabilitating his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett injured two ligaments in his knee on the opening play in
the final regular season game. He has missed only 10 regular season
games due to injury in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long road from January 2,'' Bennett said. ''It was
hard work on my behalf, and the trainers, and a lot of praying --
and here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who will be 35 on Aug. 25, was a major part of a
defense that helped the Colts win the AFC East last year with a
13-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Since camp opened, he's mainly been a spectator on the field,
watching and offering help to the team's young linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be out there, but then it's the preseason. In my
mind, training camp is training camp,'' he said. ''I've worked real
hard. ... To come back from the injuries that I had is very
unrealistic in a sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett didn't need surgery to repair his medial collateral and
posterior cruciate ligaments, but the injury left the Colts in dire
need of experienced linebackers. That need became greater as
first-round draft pick Rob Morris missed 17 practices during his
contract holdout and second-round pick Marcus Washington missed
most of the camp with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has too much football savvy to rush himself back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't do all the practice today. I stayed out of the
contact work. Overall, I thought I had a pretty good first day,''
he said, adding he has no plans to play when the Colts meet New
Orleans in West Lafayette on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went through the individual drills. I still got some rust,
but I think that just might be old age,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was injured on the opening weekend of camp and missed
24 practices until returning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good to be out there with the guys, just to get back in
the swing of things,'' said the rookie from Auburn, who is expected
to be a back up to Bennett and also play some defensive end this
season. ''It (watching) was kind of hard to be because I'm kind of
used to going full speed.''

<HEADLINE> Pete Sampras Wwings With Reds  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras traded his
high-tech racquet for some old-fashioned wood Monday, taking a
brief round of batting practice with the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a line drive over second base the first time he made
contact, had a few awkward swings and achieved his primary goal --
he didn't hurt or embarrass himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my place on earth is not on the baseball field,''
Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Courier and other tennis stars have taken batting practice
with the Reds over the years when a homestand coincided with the
ATP Championship in nearby Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras had a bye Monday in the tournament, now the Masters
Series-Cincinnati. He knows Ken Griffey Jr. and was glad to get a
firsthand feel for what it's like to swing with major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in tennis shoes, shorts and shirt but no batting helmet,
Sampras stood in the batting cage for about five minutes before the
Reds' regulars took over. He said he'd never done anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   Batting right-handed, he hit the ball several times and lunged
and missed pitches at other times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm healthy. That's the main thing,'' he said. ''I didn't want
to hurt my back.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sampras hit the line drive on first contact, Griffey --
standing beside the cage -- sounded impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can send you to rookie ball,'' Griffey yelled out. ''You'll
take a pay cut but don't worry about it.''

<P>
   MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings receiver Randy Moss was
back on the practice field Monday, going through a full workout and
showing no effects from a bruised shoulder and ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Randy's a very tough player,'' coach Dennis Green said. ''He
and Cris (Carter) have great work habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss was injured on a spectacular 55-yard catch and run in the
second quarter of Saturday's 25-24 preseason loss to the New
Orleans Saints. He landed on his shoulder after hurdling a defender
inside the 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Moss wore extra padding around his ribs during Monday's workout.

<HEADLINE> Report: Military in Disappearances  </HEADLINE>
By RICARDO MIRANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A report by a leading human rights group
about children who vanished during Guatemala's civil war says the
military was to blame for most of the disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Roman Catholic Church's main human rights
office in Guatemala, released to the media on Monday, details the
cases of 86 children who disappeared during the 36-year civil war,
which ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The military said it would not respond until it saw the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military has not seen this document, and we would have to
read it carefully before giving our point of view,'' said the
office of military spokesman Capt. Jose Maria Valladares.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors said there are accounts of 358 other cases
that could not be fully documented.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were members of Guatemala's Maya Indian
majority, who suffered most from the army's scorched-earth campaign
against rebel fighters, the report said. Hundreds of villages were
raided and many were obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast majority of disappearances, the children were
abducted, said Nery Rodenas, director of the Archbishop's Human
Rights Office. The rest were caused by ''the dynamic of armed
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have in our hands is the confirmation that children
were used as war booty, that forced disappearance was used as an
instrument of war against those most vulnerable, the children,''
Rodenas told a news conference. In some cases, the vanished
children ''were used for military ends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which will be released publicly Tuesday, attributed
79 of the cases to the military, 3 of the cases to
government-organized paramilitary groups and 2 of the cases to
leftist rebels. The causes of 2 of the cases could not be
clarified.
</P>
<P>
   One case highlighted in the report was that of Baudilio Monzon,
a 9-year-old Mayan boy who vanished on Feb. 18, 1984 during a raid
on his village.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, a military helicopter dropped fliers with a
picture of the boy in a hospital bed and message promising safety
if villagers came out of the jungle where they had fled and
surrendered to the army. ''Thank God, I am being healed,'' the
flier quoted the boy as saying.
</P>
<P>
   His parents have not seen him since. The boy's father was quoted
in the report saying he had heard at first that his son was being
kept at a military unit in Xalbal, about 180 miles north of the
capital, then years later that he was under the care of a colonel
named Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   Rodenas said many of the families lack the resources to search
for the children. ''Furthermore, there is still fear of reprisals,
which leads them to leave things as they are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the next step is to try to locate the missing children
and try to reunite them with their families.
</P>
<P>
   The coordinator of the human rights office, Bishop Mario Rios
Montt, urged Guatemalans to confront the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let it not be a political issue nor a motive for profit or
sensationalism,'' he said. ''Remember that it involves human beings
who have been profoundly harmed by war.''

<HEADLINE> Taliban Arms Embargo Contemplated  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping up its campaign against the Taliban
government in Afghanistan, the Clinton administration said Monday
it is discussing with other U.N. Security Council members the
possibility of imposing an arms embargo against that country.
</P>
<P>
   This and other punitive measures are being contemplated for the
Taliban's refusal to hand over suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden,
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said other steps include barring senior Taliban
officials from traveling internationally and the closing of Taliban
offices in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher used the occasion of the second anniversary of the
bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa to disclose the
initiative. In a statement, President Clinton remembered the lives
lost in the bombing of the embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they were targets precisely because they were
dedicated to principles of tolerance, understanding and cooperation
across frontiers,'' Clinton said. ''The terrorists took from us our
colleagues, friends and loved ones, but they have failed utterly to
deter us from advancing these principles around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is wanted for the East Africa bombings
but the Taliban says he cannot be turned over to American
authorities because there is no bilateral extradition treaty. The
Taliban also says Afghan culture forbids a guest their country to
be delivered to enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher noted that six persons wanted in the bombings are
awaiting trial in the United States and three others are in custody
in the United Kingdom pending extradition to the United States.
Eight others, including bin Laden, remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made a brief appearance
before reporters Monday to talk about the East Africa bombings,
which killed more than 200 persons, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families of those,
American and African, who were killed or seriously injured,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the tragedy, she said, physical security has been enhanced
at every U.S. diplomatic post and there are now mandatory
inspections for every vehicle entering American diplomatic
facilities overseas. In addition, 337 new diplomatic security
personnel have been hired and trained.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher also talked about additional security enhancements
either taken or planned:
</P>
<P>
   -- More than 20,000 representatives from more than 100 countries
have received instruction in anti-terrorism techniques.
</P>
<P>
   -- U.S. surveillance teams have been established in many
countries ''so we can watch for those who might be watching us.''
</P>
<P>
   -- At the State Department itself, security awareness briefings
have been held for 7,000 officials. Eventually, briefings will be
held for all department employees.
</P>
<P>
   -- The presence of uniformed guards has been increased both
inside and outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   -- Plans call for the creation of 900 new positions, including
500 security special agents over a two- or three-year period, at a
cost of $300 million.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fire Rages in Spain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- After working nonstop for 24 hours,
firefighters brought under control Monday a fire that charred miles
of forests in northeast Spain and forced hundreds out of their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Morning winds gusting at 40 mph fanned the flames in Gerona
province, north of Barcelona on the border with France, thwarting
the work of 300 firefighters using planes, hoses and shovels to
battle one of the worst fires in Spain this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But as of midday the wind had eased somewhat and only one active
front remained, said Xavier Pomes, interior minister of the
Catalonia regional government. Officials said Monday evening that
the fire was under control.
</P>
<P>
   Pomes said that the fire had charred more than 9 square miles of
the Cabo de Creus national park and 1&AMP;frac12; square miles of the L'Albera
national park.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were also able to control a front that had been
advancing east toward Cadaques, a Mediterranean coastal town famous
for being the birthplace of surrealist painter Salvador Dali.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the fire started Sunday, apparently when someone
set fire to a pile of scrubwood.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2,500 people were evacuated but most had returned
to their homes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The rail line linking Spain and France was cut off briefly, but
was reopened Monday, the Catalan emergency coordination center
said.

<HEADLINE> Members of Congress walk trail, try mediating dispute  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARRISON, N.Y. (AP) - Sen. Charles Schumer and Rep. Sue Kelly
walked a short stretch of the Appalachian Trail on Monday to see
for themselves the forested land that the National Park Service
wants and a Franciscan friary doesn't want to give up.
</P>
<P>
   And after listening briefly to officials from both sides, they
expressed confidence about a compromise and announced that
negotiations would begin Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been misunderstandings about what each side really
wants,'' Schumer said. ''The two goals are not in conflict. We
don't need to take this to court.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500-mile trail, which runs from Georgia to Maine, crosses
Graymoor, headquarters of the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement,
along a 58-acre easement the park service purchased in 1984. But in
some places the easement is only 50 feet wide and the park service
wants to buffer it with an additional 18 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The friars, who are among the trail's most hospitable hosts -
they offer food and shelter to all hikers - are wary of losing a
bigger piece of their ''Holy Mountain'' and want to retain room to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the park service - which has seen the friary
violate the easement with a pump house and sewer pipes - wants to
eliminate the possibility of development a backpack's throw from
the trail.
</P>
<P>
   After years of on-and-off negotiations, the park service
referred the case to the Justice Department this spring for eminent
domain proceedings - taking the land without permission while
paying market price.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a Republican, called that ''a heavy-handed tactic.'' She
and Schumer wrote to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and the park
service agreed to hold off, pending negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The elected officials met Monday with the Rev. Arthur Johnson,
minister general of the friars; Pam Underhill, the trail
superintendent for the park service; and Judy Brumbach, the
service's chief of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very amicable and very productive,'' said Underhill.
''We have each other's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added, ''I am sure something can be worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said various general ideas about settlements were
discussed, but added, ''The devil is in the details.'' He would not
specify what form any agreement might take.
</P>
<P>
   ''God and nature are one to some of the great Catholic and other
philosophers,'' he said. ''The goals of both parties are in no
conflict whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said there was no discussion of money because, ''That is
not our concern.''
</P>
<P>
   On the trail, Schumer marveled at the beauty of the forest,
steamy in near-90-degree heat. ''This is not Brooklyn,'' said the
Democrat from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But the hikers also noted a manhole cover labeled ''sewer'' and
Underhill said, ''You don't see too many of these on the
Appalachian Trail.''

<HEADLINE> Pete Sampras Swings With Reds  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras traded his
high-tech racquet for some old-fashioned wood Monday, taking a
brief round of batting practice with the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a line drive over second base the first time he made
contact, had a few awkward swings and achieved his primary goal --
he didn't hurt or embarrass himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my place on earth is not on the baseball field,''
Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Courier and other tennis stars have taken batting practice
with the Reds over the years when a homestand coincided with the
ATP Championship in nearby Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras had a bye Monday in the tournament, now the Masters
Series-Cincinnati. He knows Ken Griffey Jr. and was glad to get a
firsthand feel for what it's like to swing with major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in tennis shoes, shorts and shirt but no batting helmet,
Sampras stood in the batting cage for about five minutes before the
Reds' regulars took over. He said he'd never done anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   Batting right-handed, he hit the ball several times and lunged
and missed pitches at other times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm healthy. That's the main thing,'' he said. ''I didn't want
to hurt my back.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sampras hit the line drive on first contact, Griffey --
standing beside the cage -- sounded impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can send you to rookie ball,'' Griffey yelled out. ''You'll
take a pay cut but don't worry about it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Timberwolves were expected to
announce the free agent signings of Chauncey Billups and Joe Smith
on Tuesday, WCCO-TV reported.
</P>
<P>
   The team called a news conference at Target Center on Tuesday
morning but wouldn't provide any details.
</P>
<P>
   Both Billups and Smith are represented by agent Andy Miller, who
didn't immediately return a phone call to The Associated Press on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves have been courting Billups, who played at Orlando
last season, to help fill the void left by the death of Malik
Sealy, who was killed in a traffic accident last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Billups, the third overall pick in the 1997 draft out of
Colorado, has played for Boston, Toronto, Denver and Orlando. He's
been bothered by injuries that have helped hasten his departure
from several teams.
</P>
<P>
   Smith averaged 9.9 points and 6.2 rebounds last year for the
Wolves, who were able to offer him a one-year deal for $2.35
million.

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb Blast in Spain Kills Three  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A car bomb exploded Monday in the northern
Basque city of Bilbao Monday night, killing at least three
suspected separatists who appeared to be transporting the
explosive, police and news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   All three victims were apparently inside the moving car when it
exploded and burst into flames. Police said they were investigating
whether the three were activists of the Basque separatist group
ETA.
</P>
<P>
   The national news agency Efe said one of the victims was Patxi
Rementeria, suspected chief of the Commando Vizcaya, one of ETA's
bloodiest units.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the remains of the two men and a woman found at the
scene were being examined in an attempt to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were investigating whether the car was en route
to an attack when the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The ETA -- an acronym that stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom
-- has killed some 800 people since beginning a violent campaign in
the late 1960s to carve an independent homeland out of Basque areas
in northern Spain and southwest France.
</P>
<P>
   In an acceleration of the violence, 17 attacks have been blamed
on ETA since it ended a 14-month cease-fire in December, including
nine attacks in July alone. Seven people had been killed before
Monday's incident.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of violence included the assassinations in July
of a town councilor in the southern city of Malaga and a former
senior government official in the Basque country.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbao Mayor Inaki Azuna, who rushed to the scene Monday night,
said the ''terrorists'' had probably targeted ''some citizen or a
building in Bilbao.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged ''dialogue instead of pistols and car bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred near a street intersection in the
sparsely populated industrial neighborhood of Bolueta in Bilbao
shortly before 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One body was thrown 50 yards from the blast. Weapons were also
found in the street, apparently blasted from the car in the
explosion.

<HEADLINE> Study: Failing to Test Osteoporosis  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Doctors are failing to test women who suffer
wrist fractures for osteoporosis, even though treatment often
proves effective and the same women face a greater risk of more
serious bone fractures, new research says.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 1,162 women over age 54 who suffered wrist
fractures found that only 33 patients underwent a bone density scan
to detect the presence of osteoporosis and only 266 were treated
with medication for the disease. Those women are nearly twice as
likely to have hip fractures.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lack of communication between the physicians
treating the fractures and the (primary care) physicians who are
treating the more chronic medical problems,'' said Dr. Kevin B.
Freedman, lead author of the study, published in the August issue
of The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggests that women who receive treatment for
osteoporosis have a dramatically lower risk of breaking more bones.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis gradually weakens bones and often leads to painful
and crippling fractures. It affects about one-third of women and 10
percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michele Bellantoni, medical director of the Osteoporosis
Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, said
orthopedic surgeons tend not to ''view treatment of osteoporosis as
part of what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a recent study of women receiving treatment at Johns
Hopkins for hip fractures found that 50 percent had previous
extremities fractures but did not undergo a diagnostic test for the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drugs reduce the risk of new fractures by 50 percent. They are
effective treatments but can't be used until people make the
connection between fractures and thin bones,'' Bellantoni said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Invites Casey's Sons to DNC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, TENN. (AP) -- Al Gore has invited two sons of the late
Robert Casey to introduce a video tribute to the staunchly
anti-abortion Pennsylvania governor at next week's Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides said Robert Casey Jr., who is up for re-election
as auditor general of Pennsylvania, and Pat Casey will speak to the
Aug. 14-17 convention on a yet to be determined date.
</P>
<P>
   Casey who was elected as governor of Pennsylvania in 1986 and
served through 1995. He died May 31 of this year. He was one of the
Democratic Party's prominent opponents of abortion rights and was
not allowed to speak at the 1992 Democratic convention, when he
wanted to address the delegates and discuss his anti-abortion
views.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has tried to make his fierce support of a woman's right to
an abortion a defining issue in his race to the White House against
Republican George W. Bush. Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway
said the Casey family speeches and tribute to the governor are
meant to send a message of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party, in its very platform,'' Hattaway said, ''has made
clear that people with differing views on the (abortion) issue are
welcome in the party.''

<HEADLINE> Travis Butler in custody of dead mother's friend  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL PAYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Deputies removed 10-year-old Travis Butler
from his grandparents' custody and placed him with the woman who
discovered him living with his mother's corpse, friends and
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Jeffries, who found Travis in a Memphis, Tenn.,
apartment in December, took custody of the boy in her Olive Branch
home Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Travis had been living with his grandparents in a single-wide
trailer in rural Carthage, but after a custody hearing last week
with Chancery Judge Bill Lutz, he was moved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I raised the boy most his life,'' said H.P. Wilder, Travis'
step-grandfather. ''I couldn't understand why they want to give him
to this strange person.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Travis lived for a month with his dead mother, too
afraid to tell anyone because he feared being placed in foster
care. His mother, Crystal Wells, died Nov. 3 from a lung tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Travis cut his hair, fixed meals and went to school every day
from the time his mother died until her body was discovered by
Wells' friend.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffries could not immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   After the ordeal, Travis' maternal grandmother, Shirley Wilder,
assumed custody.
</P>
<P>
   H.P. Wilder said Leake County deputies picked up Travis and
drove him to the Jeffries' home in north Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't want to go,'' Wilder said. ''She wasn't no friend of
Crystal's.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis' plight has gained national attention and amassed
hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations. He appeared on the
Montel Williams show and trust accounts have been established in
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Rathe, a New York City production company owner who
started an education fund worth nearly $100,000, said ''he's in
good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I spoke to Travis today and he seemed OK,'' Rathe told The
Associated Press on Monday. ''All I care about is that he grows and
thrives. Whether it is with the Jeffries or not doesn't matter.''

<HEADLINE> Haas-Zoeller Team Leads Challenge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALOHA, Ore. (AP) -- The team of Jay Haas and Fuzzy Zoeller shot a
10-under-par 62 Monday and took a one-stroke after the first round
of the Fred Meyer Challenge best-ball event at The Reserve
Vineyards &AMP; Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Haas had planned to spend time at home with his family this
week. Instead, he became a last-minute fill-in for Tom Lehman, who
injured his knee last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''They asked if I wanted to come and play. I asked if it was a
trick question,'' Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   If Haas and Zoeller can hold off the rest of the field in
Tuesday's second round, they will divide the $180,000 first prize.
The way Haas played Monday, Zoeller figures they will be hard to
beat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even know why the other groups are going to show up
tomorrow,'' Zoeller joked.
</P>
<P>
   The Haas-Zoeller team got off to an excellent start with birdies
on six of the first seven holes, and Haas made four of those birdie
putts. That was good enough to give the duo a front-nine 29.
</P>
<P>
   They added birdies on Nos. 12, 13 and 16, but they still only
had a one-stroke lead. Haas pushed the lead to two strokes when he
hit a 4-foot birdie putt on the par-5 18th, but the second-place
team of Jim Furyk and David Frost also birdied 18 to close the gap
back to one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Haas held last year's first-round lead while teaming with Phil
Mickelson. But that tandem faltered the second day, losing by four
strokes to Brad Faxon and Billy Andrade.
</P>
<P>
   Faxon and Andrade posted a 64 Monday, joining Brian Henninger
and Scott McCarron, Tim Herron and Stewart Cink, and John Cook and
Mark O'Meara in a tie for third.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tournament was the first time since 1997 that both
Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer appeared in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Since they were paired in different foursomes, their only
head-to-head competition came in a pre-tournament skills challenge.
The two legends took turns choosing sides among the pros on hand
and after eight rounds, the event was tied 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   To break the tie, Nicklaus and Palmer faced off in a
pitch-and-run contest from 60 feet. Nicklaus' third and final
attempt eased within 1&AMP;frac12; feet of the cup, about 18 inches better
than Palmer's best effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Same old stuff,'' Palmer muttered after another, albeit
unofficial, loss to his old nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   In the official event, Nicklaus and his son Gary carded a 65.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer teamed with tournament host Peter Jacobsen and they also
shot a 65.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Sign Fullback Sam Gash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens signed fullback Sam
Gash to a one-year contract Monday to help their suddenly depleted
backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Gash was selected to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year
even though he didn't carry the ball once for the Buffalo Bills
last season. He did however catch 20 passes for 163 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Gash, a veteran of eight years, will battle with third-year
player Obafemi Ayanbadejo and undrafted rookie Alan Ricard.
</P>
<P>
   Starting fullback Chuck Evans is expected to be out until at
least November with a torn left triceps muscle sustained in
Saturday's 16-13 preseason victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Second-team running back Jay Graham sprained his ankle in the
game and is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries left the Ravens with just five running backs,
including three rookies, going into Monday morning's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who had surgery to repair the muscle Sunday, may be
placed on the injured reserve list, forcing him to miss the entire
season, coach Brian Billick said.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Stable After Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry was in
stable condition at a Manhattan hospital after undergoing a second
round of surgery for cancer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they were ''optimistic for an uneventful
recovery,'' a hospital statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-man surgical team removed an ''isolated tumor mass''
near Strawberry's left kidney, adding that ''evaluation ...
supported the preoperative impression that there was no obvious
distant spread of cancer,'' and ''no evidence of any residual
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery was performed at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital by a team that included
Drs. Mitchell C. Benson, George J. Todd, Richard L. Whelan and
Peter B. Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry previously underwent surgery for colon cancer in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre, who underwent cancer surgery last
year, said he would wait to talk to Strawberry until the player
lets him know that he is feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   ''This helps you appreciate what you have today and not look too
far down the road,'' Torre said of the mindset going into surgery.
''You just want to enjoy every day here. For certain when you have
a young child, that monopolizes your thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was suspended in February for testing positive for
drugs and had hoped to have his suspension reduced and rejoin the
New York Yankees this season. But then his cancer returned and an
investigation began last month to see if he had violated his
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's made a lot of mistakes in his life and maybe he is paying
for it right now,'' Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson said. ''I hope he
does well, his family does well. This is a tough time for every
one.''

<HEADLINE> Brian Hunter Joins Reds  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Three weeks ago, Reds reliever Scott Sullivan
and Rockies outfielder Brian Hunter were wrestling and trading
swings in front of the pitcher's mound in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they were teammates -- an odd coupling indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy to be his teammate,'' Sullivan said with a
mischievous smile. ''He has ability as a player and he'd definitely
got some spunk to him and that's what we need. I like a person that
will defend himself. I'm aggressive by nature and he is, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds found out exactly how aggressive on July 15, when
Sullivan threw a pitch up and in -- he claimed it slipped -- and
Hunter charged the mound after being hit.
</P>
<P>
   They met about halfway between home and the mound, and Sullivan
got in a few swings before they were engulfed by teammates. Both of
them got three-game suspensions -- Sullivan has served his, Hunter
has appealed his.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds traded for Hunter on Sunday, sending minor league
pitcher Robert Averette to the Rockies. Hunter arrived about a
half-hour before the start of Monday's game and was in the starting
lineup, batting leadoff and playing left field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why not?'' manager Jack McKeon said. ''I'll play him today to
see if we can't get a little something going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had lost five in a row heading into Monday's game
against Atlanta, leaving them with a losing record and a six-game
deficit in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Sullivan-Hunter history was a subject for clubhouse humor
before the newcomer arrived. Catcher Eddie Taubensee pointed toward
Sullivan's cubicle and then to the other end of the clubhouse and
said, ''Sullivan here, Hunter there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about how it worked out -- Sullivan dresses at one end of
the clubhouse with the relievers, Hunter's new cubicle was at the
other end with position players.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter wasn't available before the game. After the fight last
month, he told reporters he went to the mound intending to hurt
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really crossed my mind to go with my helmet and try to hit
him and maybe knock an eyeball out or something,'' Hunter said at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan remembered the line and had one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got some goggles,'' Sullivan said. ''He said he was going to
poke my eye out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was willing to reserve judgment on Hunter until he got
to know him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had situations where I couldn't stand playing against
someone and when I met the guy I was like, 'Hey, this is a nice
guy. I had the wrong impression of him,''' Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Leader Visits Saudis  </HEADLINE>
By ABDULLAH AL-SHIHRI
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are
intent on ensuring a stable oil market with a goal of an average
oil price of $25 a barrel, officials said Tuesday after Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez opened a tour of OPEC nations.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez met late Monday with Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince
Abdullah in the Red Sea port city of Jiddah. The visit comes
against a backdrop of warnings of an oil price collapse and of
quota-busting among members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   No official statements followed the meeting, which ended early
Tuesday. A Venezuelan source, however, said afterward that the two
sides agreed the current OPEC production level is sufficient so
there is no need for additional supplies this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The source, who insisted on not being further identified, didn't
say whether the sufficient level included some or all of the extra
500,000 barrels a day the Saudis had decided to add to the market
to bring down prices, of which about 200,000 barrels a day is
estimated to be on the market now. The Saudi plan had angered many
of its OPEC partners.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez and Saudi leaders, the source said, also agreed that high
prices in large industrialized nations were mainly due to high
taxes on oil or oil products but were being blamed on producing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   A Saudi official, who also insisted on anonymity, said the
leaders also discussed the need for coordination between OPEC and
non-OPEC nations to maintain stability in oil markets ''with a goal
of an average price of $25 a barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Fahd told his Cabinet that both countries are
keen in maintaining oil market stability and balance for the
interest of all producers and consumers. ''Our views are identical
on a number of petroleum issues,'' the official Saudi Press Agency
quoted Fahd as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's trip is aimed at welding unity among OPEC members and
comes one week after OPEC president and Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali
Rodriguez expressed concern over reports that the organization is
leaking an extra 700,000 barrels a day into the market.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC delivers about one-third of the world's oil supply. Its
official output is 25.4 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, the
cartel's most influential member, produces almost a third of that.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, once the group's most notorious quota buster and most
apathetic member, has been lobbying for stability in the market
through establishing closer ties with fellow OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela was instrumental in engineering production cuts after
oil prices hit record lows in 1998 and 1999, lifting prices to
9-year highs and earning Chavez credibility among OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
   During his tour, Chavez was extending invitations to the leaders
of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Iraq,
Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria and Algeria to attend an OPEC summit in
Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's tour is also significant because he will visit Iraq
next week, making him the first foreign leader to pay an official
state visit to Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department sharply criticized Chavez for the
planned stop in Baghdad, calling it ''particularly galling'' that
the first such visit is being made by a leader who is
democratically elected.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States is also
concerned about reports that Chavez would go to Baghdad without the
required United Nations approval. ''It's Venezuela's obligation, as
a U.N. member state, to observe all the Security Council
resolutions regarding Iraq and the sanctions regime,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Angels Release Pitcher Ken Hill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Right-hander Ken Hill, in the final
season of a $16.05 million, three-year contract, was released
Monday by the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, 34, was 5-7 with a 6.52 ERA in 16 games this season -- all
starts. He spent three weeks on the disabled list earlier this
season and only last week admitted to contemplating retirement
because of an arthritic elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not disappointed, because I'd been thinking of hanging it
up anyway,'' Hill said before the Angels played the Boston Red Sox.
''I'd rather go out on a more positive note than getting
released.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim manager Mike Scioscia said releasing Hill was difficult
because of the effort the right-hander had put into regaining his
form.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he just wasn't responding to the needs we had,'' Scioscia
said. ''The consistency we sought just wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's release -- and the trade a week ago of Kent Bottenfield --
leaves Anaheim dependent on a young starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels began Monday night's game in third place in the AL
West, 8&AMP;frac12; games behind Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that they need innings, and they've got young
guys they need to see,'' Hill said. ''They want to see them
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, which is responsible for the remainder of Hill's $5.6
million salary, activated left-hander Jarrod Washburn to take
Hill's place on the roster. Washburn, 6-2 with a 3.87 ERA, was
scheduled to start Monday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the rotation includes rookies Scott Schoeneweis and
Brian Cooper, with Matt Wise, another rookie, expected to make his
first major league start Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Another rookie starter, Seth Etherton, was placed on the
disabled list Sunday with a tired arm.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was acquired by the Angels from Texas for catcher Jim
Leyritz and infielder Robert Sasser on July 29, 1997, and re-signed
with the Angels the following November. The Angels had a $6 million
club option for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just didn't think Kenny pitched as well as he could, or
take as deep into games as we expected,'' Anaheim general manager
Bill Stoneman said. ''It's an opportunity for one of our young
pitchers to be in the rotation, and I don't think that's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who spent time on the disabled list earlier this season,
had a 4-11 record with a 4.77 ERA in 22 starts and four relief
appearances last season. He was 9-6 with a 4.98 ERA in 19 games in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hill also spent time with the St. Louis Cardinals, Montreal
Expos and Cleveland Indians. His career record is 117-107 with 19
complete games, eight shutouts and a 4.00 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Darryl Strawberry stable after surgery  </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Royals' Beltran Begin Rehabbing  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Outfielder Carlos Beltran has begun
working out in Kansas City and remains suspended without pay for
refusing to go to Florida on a rehab assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, saying it was team policy, told Beltran to work out
at their spring training complex near Haines City, Fla. Beltran
objected, citing a clause in baseball's collective bargaining
agreement, and the Royals said last Thursday they were suspended
him without pay for 30 days or until he reported to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The players' association then filed a grievance, forcing the
matter before arbitrator Shaym Das. The union also said it will
file a default notice if Beltran doesn't get a full paycheck Aug.
15.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Allard Baird said he met with Beltran on Monday
and that nothing had changed with the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year,
who went on the DL on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran will rehab his bruised right knee at Kauffman Stadium
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where we are right now is Carlos is going to continue his
rehab program here,'' Baird said. ''We've set it up with our
trainers and our strength and conditioning guys as well as our
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird said this does not mean the Royals have made a concession
to Beltran.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't scrapped the policy. We've suspended the player,''
he said. ''I'm not going to tell a 23-year-old kid to go out and
swing off the tee on his own. I'm not going to tell a 23-year-old
kid to go out and rehab himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltran does not appear to have much sympathy from his
teammates, many of who have done rehab work at the Florida complex.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got better things to worry about,'' third baseman Joe
Randa said. ''We've got to focus all our concentration on trying to
win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltran said Monday he wants ''the team to accept me when I'm
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be away from the team. That's what I don't
think they understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Beltran was batting just .247 with six home
runs and 32 RBIs following a terrific rookie season, when he hit
.293 with 112 runs scored, 22 home runs and 108 RBIs. Getting him
physically ready to play by Sept. 1 would be ''cutting it close,''
Baird said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our discussion today was on a personal level, not a business
level,'' Baird said. ''We're talking about a very young kid who
came off a tremendous year last year and has failed a little bit
this year. I'm sure he has second-guessed himself in a lot of
different things on the field. And now he's put in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is there compassion from me? Yes. Who's the most important in
this thing? The organization. We had a good discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird does not expect the arbitration hearing to be held until
late August. If the union files a default notice, the Royals said
they will pay Beltran the full bimonthly portion of his $350,000
salary rather than risk him becoming a free agent if Das rules in
his favor.
</P>
<P>
   If the Royals win the grievance, the money would be withheld
from later paychecks.

<HEADLINE> Six Lions Killed in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO (AP) -- Police firing machine guns and shotguns killed
six circus lions Monday after they escaped their cage and prowled
around a town in southeastern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The animals fled from a zoo park in Sao Simao, about 200 miles
northwest of Sao Paulo, where they had been held after the local
authorities decided the cages of a traveling circus weren't secure
enough, State Police Officer Jefferson Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect purposely someone opened the door to the cage to
release the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty state police officers used 12-gauge shotguns and machine
guns to hunt and kill the lions, Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no way to avoid the sacrifice,'' Silva said. ''This
is a small town and we did not have any equipment to deal with
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning residents were warned by loudspeakers
mounted on cars to remain in their homes, Silva said. No one was
injured during the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Circus safety became a concern earlier this year after a caged
circus lion in northeastern Brazil snatched a 6-year-old boy from
his father's arms and killed him.

<HEADLINE> Stottlemyre Recovering Quickly  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Todd Stottlemyre's recovery from an elbow injury
is ahead of schedule and the Arizona Diamondbacks have tentatively
targeted his return to the rotation for Sept. 3 against the Florida
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander has been on the disabled list since June 26
with tendinitis in his right elbow. He plans to begin throwing off
the mound on Wednesday, about five days ahead of what had been
scheduled, after a week of throwing on flat ground each day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fired up,'' Stottlemyre said Monday. ''I've thrown seven
straight days and I've had no pain. I have felt great every day.
It's kind of nice to stand here and be honest with you and tell you
I feel good when I really feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   If Stottlemyre can return for the stretch run, he would add to
an already formidable rotation that includes Randy Johnson, Curt
Schilling and Brian Anderson. The Sept. 3 date looks good to
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I think I can make it?'' Stottlemyre said. ''Book it.''
</P>
<P>
   Team doctor David Zeman gave his blessing to the accelerated
schedule, which would include a couple of rehabilitation
appearances in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's looking better than I had anticipated,'' Zeman said.
''He's just doing great. ... His strength is great. His shoulder's
looking great. His flexibility is really good. He just looks really
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre already is pitching with a partial tear in his
rotator cuff. That injury last season required extensive
conditioning as he decided to come back without surgery,
compensating for the tear by beefing up the muscle around the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He came back to earn Arizona's lone victory in its playoff
series against the New York Mets last fall, then got off to a
strong start this season. In 14 starts, he was 8-5 with a 4.24 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But the tendinitis first sidelined him on May 14. He returned on
June 14, and initially pitched without any problems. Then the pain
returned, worse than ever, and doctors prescribed a much longer
layoff.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee the pain won't return, Zeman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why we want to go cautiously,'' the doctor said. ''But
in terms of all the ways of measuring it -- tenderness, swelling,
range of motion, strength, flexibility. All the objective things
look great. And I think this time Todd understands that he can't
tolerate a setback. He's not going to rush it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre is expected to undergo elbow surgery after the
season.
</P>
<P>
   But he wants to come back for the tough September schedule that
faces the Diamondbacks as they try to defend their NL West title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to push because I feel good,'' Stottlemyre said.
''If there's anyway I can help, I'm going to try to help. At this
point, I'm not going to get overly crazy about it because there's a
long road between now and a major league start.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I guess from a long-term standpoint, the nice thing is
it's not like I'm going to go out there and put my whole career at
risk where I couldn't come back next year. That's not the case.
Knowing that, knowing the structure of my elbow is in good shape,
if I have to pitch in some sort of pain, so be it. I did it the
first two months, I can do it the last two.''

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Protests Albanian Office  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Yugoslavia protested to the U.N. Security
Council on Monday against an Albanian liaison office in Kosovo,
saying it would fuel Albania's hopes of splitting the province from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the council making the ''strongest protest,''
Yugoslav envoy Vladislav Jovanovic called the opening of the
Albanian office an unlawful act of ''diplomatic piracy'' that will
promote Albania's ''illegitimate and hostile claims'' to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the council to annul a U.N. regulation allowing foreign
missions to open in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   His letter put the spotlight again on the thorny and unresolved
issue of the future of Kosovo, where Serbs want to remain part of
Yugoslavia and ethnic Albanians seek independence.
</P>
<P>
   The council resolution enshrining the June 1999 peace agreement
that ended NATO's 78-day bombing campaign of Yugoslavia reaffirms
Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But it also authorized the U.N. administration to set up an
interim democratic government in Kosovo that would have
''substantial autonomy'' within Yugoslavia -- and to facilitate ''a
political process designed to determine Kosovo's future status.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombed Yugoslavia in an effort to halt a Serb crackdown on
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, and Serb forces withdrew from
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has not tackled the issue of Kosovo's
future, despite urgings by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the NATO
commander, and the province's U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government has repeatedly accused the U.N.
administration of trying to sever Belgrade's ties to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic complained to the council in the letter circulated
Monday that Albania characterized the opening of the liaison office
in the Kosovo capital, Pristina, on July 24 as ''the establishment
of diplomatic relations between Albania and Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused Kouchner of illegally promulgating a regulation June
10 allowing the establishment of foreign liaison offices in Kosovo
and called on the Security Council to annul it.
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovic noted that Yugoslavia has no diplomatic relations with
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian Parliament in October 1992 recognized the so-called
Republic of Kosovo, ''which constituted a glaring example of
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign, neighboring
state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt, Jovanovic said, that the Albanian liaison
office, will be ''abused'' to further the secession of Kosovo from
Yugoslavia and the creation of ''Greater Albania.''

<HEADLINE> Aboriginals To Protest in Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An Aboriginal group has applied for
police permission to march to Sydney Airport in the five days
leading up to the Olympics, meaning international visitors could be
greeted by sign-carrying protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council also officially
notified police it would like to march on the Sydney office of
Prime Minister John Howard on Sept. 15, the day of the opening
ceremony for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they will consider whether the proposed protests
endanger public safety before deciding whether to grant approval. A
police spokesman said Tuesday there was no timetable for deciding
on the requests.
</P>
<P>
   If permission is granted for the airport march, protesters would
peacefully greet visitors as they left the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we envisage here is a human chain along the roads
nominated,'' the group said in a letter to police superintendent
Roland Tisdale of the Sydney Olympic Park precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ''There would be no disruption to passengers disembarking or
traveling to the city from the airport or from the terminal, as we
would not be near the terminal buildings -- only holding placards by
the roadside,'' the petition said.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal leaders view the Olympics as a springboard to
publicize their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Aborigines were Australia's original inhabitants, but now are a
minority of 353,000 mostly impoverished people. They are beset by
substance abuse, poor health and crime.
</P>
<P>
   The land council, known as Metro, is the designated protest
leader for the 118 local Aboriginal land councils in the state of
New South Wales -- of which Sydney is the major city. It does not
speak for all Aborigines, some of whom have threatened more violent
protests against the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of Aborigines who have set up a tent city in
Sydney's Victoria Park said Monday they hope to fill the downtown
park with peaceful protesters during the Olympics. The tent city,
formed near Sydney University about two weeks ago, has grown to
about 25 tents.

<HEADLINE> Strike continues, some consumer services delayed  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Talks between Verizon Communications, the
Northeast's leading local telephone company, and striking union
members hit a snag Monday over several issues, including the
shifting of work to areas that are not as heavily unionized or
where the pay scale is lower.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, the Communications Workers of America,
the larger of the two unions in negotiations, said several
job-security issues have slowed the overall progress of contract
talks although discussions continued Monday evening. The strike by
87,200 company employees affects operations for 25 million
customers from Maine to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators wrapped up the day's formal talks around 8 p.m. EDT.
They expected to begin talking again Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the barriers to a settlement is the question of
transfer of work. Verizon was formed in June by the merger of Bell
Atlantic and GTE Corp., and unions fear the company could move work
to areas that are cheaper or have less of a union presence or force
employees to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it needs flexibility to distribute calls
depending on the level of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue bogging down talks deals with a subsidiary of
Verizon that handles wiring within the home, the CWA said. That
division split off from the main business several years ago so that
it could have a separate wage scale and compete more effectively
with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The unions argue that some of the work done by this subsidiary
in five states and D.C. should really be handled by workers in the
core company.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues still unresolved include organizing rights for
wireless workers, forced overtime and workplace stress.
</P>
<P>
   But Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe said he was not discouraged by
the bumps because the two sides are continuing to discuss these
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The strike affects these areas in Verizon's territory: Delaware,
the District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, 14,000 employees picketed in front of
Verizon facilities Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Spellane, spokesman for the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, which is also at the bargaining table, said
that 800 other IBEW members - who work for a Verizon subsidiary but
are not part of these talks - filed an unfair practice complaint
with the National Labor Relations Board against the company Monday,
</P>
<P>
   The workers allege that when they refused to cross CWA picket
lines in New Jersey where they work, the company took disciplinary
action against them, Spellane said. The workers then went out on
strike, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, police reported 56 incidents of violence or
harassment and 40 acts of vandalism against phone company
installations since Sunday - when the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 Verizon managers filled in for the more than 87,000
striking employees, pledging to work 12-hour shifts and focusing on
critical network repairs first.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they did not think the strike would harm
the phone system's integrity, but weather conditions could cause
outages. Verizon also recommended that consumers hold off on
ordering new phone lines or asking billing questions until the
strike ends.
</P>
<P>
   In Providence, R.I., more than 350 people rallied outside the
local headquarters. Workers wore black T-shirts with a cobra rising
from the union symbol on the back and the slogan, ''Will strike if
provoked.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There doesn't seem to be any loyalty to workers,'' said John
Lang, 52, of Johnston, R.I., a technician for 32 years. ''All we
want is a few crumbs from the table and don't give our jobs away.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sensitive issue at the bargaining table is the unions'
ability to organize in Verizon's burgeoning wireless division -
where fewer than 50 of the 32,000 workers are union members.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say they want to ensure that their members can get
access to jobs in the wireless division, framing it as a question
of labor's presence in the new economy. The union also is pushing
for a system in which employees in that unit could vote for
representation by filling out an authorization card.
</P>
<P>
   The company says ballot elections would protect workers' rights
better. On Monday, Verizon officials bristled at the idea that
union members don't already have access to high-tech jobs. They
contended the company has experienced tremendous growth in its data
business, which provides high-speed Internet service over its
traditional phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The objective is for us to add high-tech new economy jobs
there,'' said Rabe, the company spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Gore Picks Sen. Lieberman for VP  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore selected Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman to be his running mate Monday, rounding out the
Democratic ticket with the first Jewish vice presidential candidate
for a major party in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered the spot on the ticket in a telephone call at
midday, and Lieberman accepted, having known for hours that the job
was his.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the call. It was directly from Al Gore,'' Lieberman
said, pulling up to his house in New Haven, Conn., with a cell
phone to his ear. ''We said a short prayer together,'' the senator
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was all smiles. Hours earlier, Gore aides had informally
given him the good news. ''Miracles happen,'' Lieberman said, his
voice wavering with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Picking the moderate Democrat and self-styled moral crusader as
his running mate signals an effort by Gore to win over independent
and Republican voters and distance himself from President Clinton's
controversies. Lieberman was the first prominent Democratic
lawmaker to openly criticize the president's conduct with Monica
Lewinsky. Polls have suggested that Republican George W. Bush
benefits from ''Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his decision in Tennessee after discussions late
Sunday night and early Monday morning with top advisers, including
former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who headed the search
process, brother-in-law Frank Hunger, wife Tipper and campaign
chairman Bill Daley, according to sources familiar with the events.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and his running mate will appear together at
a noontime rally Tuesday in Nashville. Lieberman arrived in
Nashville Monday night, but made no public comments upon leaving
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, 58, beat out five other finalists: Sens. Evan Bayh of
Indiana, John Edwards of North Carolina, John Kerry of
Massachusetts; House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and
New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Lieberman's selection came as the Republican
National Committee announced a new $3.7 million television ad
campaign that criticizes Gore on his environmental record on his
own property, citing references to mining and water pollution on
his property. The ad will air for the next week in 17 battleground
states.
</P>
<P>
   After calling Lieberman, Gore began calling the others on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen praised the selection as ''an excellent choice.'' She
said, ''He's a man of strong character and principle, and he really
understands the economy we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said: ''It is a special honor to be asked to run for
vice president with a man I deeply believe in, Al Gore, and who I
think is ready to be a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign hoped Lieberman's selection would be a bold
stroke heading into next week's Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles. The vice president trails rival Bush in polls after
last week's GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic ally said Gore was driven in part by a need to
make a pre-convention splash, which Lieberman's religion provides.
That Democrat said the vice president has been disturbed by polls
giving Bush a double-digit edge and fears the election will slip
away unless he uses this critical two-week period to gain
significant ground, particularly among independents and women.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic centrist, Lieberman would amplify Gore's support of
fiscal discipline and middle class tax cuts, Democrats said. The
Gore campaign plans to draw a contrast to the GOP ticket's ties to
the oil industry and other special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he was sure his record would be combed for issues
on which the two had disagreed, but he added, ''Al Gore and I have
pretty much walked the same path, and where we've had disagreements
they've been good-faith disagreements, never disagreements that
touch our values.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have disagreed over school vouchers -- Lieberman has
proposed trying them -- and the senator once spoke favorably of the
partial privatization of Social Security, although spokesman Dan
Gerstein now says Lieberman ''ultimately decided it was the wrong
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, ''Al Gore has chosen a
man whose positions are more similar to Governor Bush's than to his
own. ... The fact that Al Gore is willing to select a running mate
whose positions he has attacked throughout this campaign will cause
many to question Al Gore's commitment to the positions he takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned in Nashville, Tenn., Gore said he would stick to his
schedule of a Tuesday announcement there. He said, as he has for
months, that his running mate would be someone who is qualified to
be president and ''who shares my values, who could be a good
partner for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was greeted with cheers when he arrived for a
previously scheduled speech to the Connecticut AFL-CIO in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke emotionally of his gratitude at being chosen for the
Democratic ticket -- ''this dream beyond anything I ever dreamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also took a quick shot at the Republicans and their
national convention. He said he was ''happy to be here at a
convention where working people are a priority, not as they were in
Philadelphia last week, just props.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on vacation on Martha's Vineyard off the coast of
Massachusetts, said Lieberman was a friend of 30 years and ''one of
the most outstanding figures in public life. ... He is a bold
figure. He is always full of new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also saw wisdom in the pick
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a bold move,'' said GOP consultant Scott Reed,
who ran Bob Dole's 1996 campaign against Clinton. ''It's a
nontraditional pick and it shows that Gore is going to make the cut
from Clinton and say that Clinton's actions the last few years have
been unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's selection of an Orthodox Jew is a first.
</P>
<P>
   Because he and his wife Hadassah observe the Jewish Sabbath from
sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, Lieberman is ostensibly
prohibited from working.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has interpreted this to mean he may still work
during that time, but only to promote ''the respect and protection
of human life and well-being.'' He has said he will vote on
legislation and participate in important meetings on the Sabbath --
but won't campaign. He skipped one of his state nominating
conventions because it was held on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman emerged as a possible candidate in recent weeks,
Democrats wondered out loud whether some voters would object to a
Jewish running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew
on the ticket,'' Democratic Party chairman Ed Rendell said last
week. '' If Joe Lieberman were Episcopalian it would be a slam
dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since John F. Kennedy was elected as the nation's first
Catholic president has religion been much of an issue in a White
House race.
</P>
<P>
   While critics call Lieberman a liberal who votes for abortion
rights, gun control and tax hikes, Democrats say he's more
conservative when it comes to issues such as defense spending and
family values.

<HEADLINE> Virginia company agrees to buy Millstone to $1.3 billion  </HEADLINE>
	   By DONNA TOMMELLEO:
Associated Press Writer:
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Virginia power company will buy the
Millstone Power Station from Northeast Utilities for $1.3 billion,
the companies announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the once-troubled nuclear complex to Dominion
Resources Inc. is expected to be completed by April 2001 and must
still undergo regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dominion will be a welcome new competitor in the state,'' said
Michael Morris, NU chairman and chief executive officer. ''We are
extremely pleased that our Millstone nuclear units are being sold
to an outstanding company committed to operating a safe and
successful national nuclear organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin-based Northeast Utilities, planning a merger with
Consolidated Edison of New York to create the nation's largest
electric and gas distribution company, put the three-plant complex
on the auction block several months ago to comply with deregulation
laws requiring it to divest power generating units. The company
also has sold its fossil fuel plants in New England.
</P>
<P>
   The complex was sold through a bidding process handled by J.P.
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The final price was so far above the $240 million minimum bid,
the sale will save Connecticut consumers about $1 billion in the
so-called stranded costs, said state utility regulators. NU needs
to collect those costs from customers to cover debts incurred under
decades of regulation. The higher the price of the plant, the lower
the stranded costs will be.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond-based Dominion has been lauded by industry analysts
and federal regulators for its safety record and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have an excellent track record and some of the most
efficient plants in the country,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst
from Credit Suisse First Boston. ''They're a first-rate nuclear
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of a Safe Millstone also welcomed the sale to Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dominion Resources is nationally known for its zeal for safety
and its passion for first-rate environmentally sensitive nuclear
operations,'' said Ron McKeown, director and founder of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Roger Hannah, whose
Region 2 office oversees Dominion, said former NRC Chairwoman
Shirley Jackson would often hold Dominion up as an example of how a
company can be both efficient and safety conscious.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a management team from Dominion assisted NU about three
years ago while Millstone was shut down due to safety concerns.
That's when the interest in the complex along the Long Island Sound
shore began.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought the equipment was good. We felt the people there
were very good,'' said James O'Hanlon, president and chief
operating officer of Dominion's generation subsidary. ''When NU
changed the management and the leadership it all started coming
together. Plus, those folks up there know how to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Millstone was shut down four years ago and had to undergo
intense NRC scrutiny until federal regulators were convinced the
company improved its safety procedures and handling of
whistleblower complaints. Millstone 3 reopened in June 1998 and
Millstone 2 restarted last May. Millstone 1 is in the process of
being decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process they went through when they were shut down was
probably one of the most intensive efforts seen in this country,''
said NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan. ''We've seen some dramatic
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   Millstone employs about 1,800 people. NU spokesman Joe
Pillittere said all workers have been guaranteed a job at least one
year after the sale is complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal since recovering has been to become the best of the
best and this agreement really reinforces that goal and places
Millstone in an environment that fully supports safety and
efficiency,'' said Pillittere.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion, which operates two nuclear plants in Virgina, serves
about 4 million customers in Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and West Virginia. NU has 1.75 million customers in
Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

<HEADLINE> American Indian Brain Reclaimed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Nearly 90 years after an Indian known as
Ishi walked out of the wilderness and was put on display as the
''Last Wild Man in North America,'' his brain is being brought back
home from the Smithsonian Institution to California for a proper
burial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about time,'' said Larry Myers, executive secretary of
the California Native American Heritage Commission. ''This should
never have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians from California are scheduled to take possession of a
jar containing Ishi's brain in a private ceremony Tuesday at the
Smithsonian, in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   They will reunite it with Ishi's cremated remains, which have
spent decades in a cemetery south of San Francisco, and bury both
in a secret ceremony in the foothills of majestic Mount Lassen in
far Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ishi goes back to 1911, when he was found near
Oroville in remote Butte County. He soon drew the attention of
University of California anthropologist Alfred Kroeber, a revered
campus figure whose name is emblazoned on the UC Berkeley
anthropology building.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Ishi was installed in the university's anthropology
museum, where he worked as a janitor's assistant and was treated as
a living link to the Stone Age, making spears, bows and arrows as
visitors watched.
</P>
<P>
   He never told his name. Anthropologists came up with Ishi, which
means ''man'' in a local Indian dialect.
</P>
<P>
   Ishi died in 1916 of what doctors believed was tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death, Ishi had made it clear he did not want to be
autopsied, believing that bodies should quickly be burned to
release the soul. Kroeber, who was in New York when Ishi died,
ordered that Ishi's body be cremated. But his colleagues couldn't
resist, autopsying Ishi and removing his brain. In an unexplained
inconsistency, Kroeber later sent the brain to the Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   Ishi became a figure in California folklore. He was the subject
of the 1961 book ''Ishi in Two Worlds'' -- written by Kroeber's
widow, Theodora -- that became part of the history lesson plan for
California fourth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1997, the Butte County Native American Cultural
Committee began trying to locate Ishi's remains.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year investigation by UCSF led to the whereabouts of the
brain. The Smithsonian had kept Ishi's brain in storage, along with
thousands of other artifacts, including human remains.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ishi was known as the ''last of the Yahi,'' the
Smithsonian found that Ishi had ties to the Yana tribe, descendants
of whom live on in the Pit River tribe and Redding Rancheria group
of Indians, Smithsonian spokesman Randall Kremer said. The museum
announced last May it was returning the brain to those tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe members did not return telephone calls to The Associated
Press, but Pit River member Mickey Gemmill told the San Jose
Mercury News it is time for Ishi to come home.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was anyone exploited by non-Indians to the max, it
was Ishi,'' he said. ''Hopefully, he will be at last at rest and at
peace and free to join his family and ancestors.''

<HEADLINE> Burundian Rebels Ambush Cadets  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYNE SAMBIRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Burundian rebels ambushed a truck
carrying military cadets home from a handball tournament, killing
28 soldiers and six civilians, survivors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack is the most deadly on the Burundian army since peace
talks began in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The military vehicle was ambushed Sunday evening near Nyabiraba
village, 15 miles south of Bujumbura, said one of the seven wounded
survivors, who spoke from a military hospital on condition he not
be named.
</P>
<P>
   All 28 soldiers killed were students at Burundi's national
military academy, the Superior Institute for Military Officers, and
were returning from a handball match in southern Bururi province.
The road is normally closed to civilian vehicles at 4 p.m. because
of rebel activity in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor said he heard the rebel commander order his troops
to capture the survivors alive, but the wounded were able to escape
into the forest.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman was not available for comment and there was
no immediate reaction from government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's civil war erupted in October 1993 when Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated the country's first democratically
elected president -- Hutu Melchior Ndadaye. It has claimed the lives
of at least 200,000 people, most of them civilians. Another 1.2
million have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Tutsi minority has dominated Burundi's military and
government for most of the nation's history since independence in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks resumed Monday in Arusha, Tanzania on a technical
level. Former South African President Nelson Mandela has said he
hopes to conclude a final peace agreement by the end of the month,
but both the rebels and the government have publicly expressed
doubts that an accord can be reached that soon.
</P>
<P>
   One stumbling block for the peace talks has been the integration
of Hutu rebels into the Tutsi-dominated military. One proposal
would require the army to be 50 percent Hutu and 50 percent Tutsi.

<HEADLINE> Twins 4, Devil Rays 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Redman became the first
American League rookie to win 10 games this season, giving up four
hits in 8 2-3 innings Monday night to lead the Minnesota Twins over
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Redman (10-5) struck out nine and walked two to win for the
fifth time in his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   After Russ Johnson's second inning single, the 26-year-old
left-hander allowed just one runner in the next six innings. Redman
took a two-hitter into the ninth before Greg Vaughn singled,
advanced on defensive indifference and scored on Fred McGriff's
single.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Johnson followed with a run-scoring single off LaTroy
Hawkins, and Eddie Guardado retired pinch-hitter John Flaherty on a
game-ending flyout with runners on first and third for his seventh
save in seven chances.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has won 11 of its past 17 games. The Devil Rays lost
for just the fourth time in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rekar (4-7) gave up nine hits in his second complete game
of the season, pitching at least seven innings for the fourth
straight start.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota was just 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position in
the first four innings as it took a 2-0 lead on RBI grounders by
Midre Cummings in the first and Jacque Jones in the fourth. Corey
Koskie added a two-run homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's best early chance came in the first when Cairo
doubled and Vaughn walked. Redman retiried McGriff on a grounder
and struck out Jose Guillen.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Devil Rays DH Jose Canseco was claimed off waivers by the
New York Yankees. ''I thought we could have gotten a Twix bar or
something,'' Canseco said before leaving Tropicana Field. ''These
things happen.'' ... The Devil Rays recalled OF Quinton McCracken
from Triple-A Durham to replace Canseco. ... Cristian Guzman tied a
the Twins' team-record held by Rod Carew (1977) in the first inning
with his 16th triple of the season. ... Tampa Bay LHP Tony Saunders
(broken left arm) gave up one run and one hit in three innings in
his second rehab start for Class-A Charleston. ... Only 12 of the
25 players on the Tampa Bay roster when the Devil Rays opened the
2000 season at Minnesota are still with the team.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Mudslide Victims Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTON, Mass. (AP) -- A father and son who died in a freak
mudslide in Switzerland over the weekend were remembered Monday as
devoted people who made family a top priority even after a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vaughn and his son, Benjamin, were killed Sunday while
walking with a group of 18 hikers and two guides across a flat
trail above the central Swiss resort of Grindelwald. The Vaughns
were buried when the sudden mudslide swept them 66 feet downslope
into a mountain stream.
</P>
<P>
   After Paul Vaughn divorced his wife, he moved next door to her
and her parents, and friends said the neighborhood scenario
illustrated where Vaughn placed his priorities. The arrangement
ensured both he and his ex-wife could easily raise their children
together as parents, if no longer as spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of amazing,'' said Richard Toelke, Vaughn's
colleague and friend. ''After his divorce, he probably wanted to
move away from his wife. ... But whatever was best for his kids,
that's what was best.''
</P>
<P>
   In the four years since their divorce, Benjamin, 12, and his
brother, Adam, 10, who survived the accident, were still able to
move freely between the houses while Vaughn and his ex-wife, Paula,
shared custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very unusual situation, and a wonderful, wonderful
picture to watch,'' neighbor Eleanor Johnson said. ''You couldn't
find a family more devoted and family oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson watched as Paula Vaughn sank to her knees in grief as
police broke the news after her morning run Sunday. She and her
parents flew to Switzerland to join Adam.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin was a precocious child, skilled at the violin and
piano, and was comfortable holding conversations with adults and
children alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a great kid -- sweet-natured,'' said neighbor Beth
Marsh-Doyle, whose son Matt was friends with Benjamin. ''Just a
wonderful child in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt, 10, said he'd talk to Benjamin about everything from food
to his favorite movies. They enjoyed water fights with hoses and
squirt guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a good role model,'' Matt said. ''He was never mean to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vaughn was remembered by neighbors for his devotion to his
boys. Every school day, Vaughn would wait at the bus stop before
heading to his Boston law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn earned his law degree from Boston University and later
became one of the top commercial real estate lawyers in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But next to his kids, Vaughn's job took a back seat, Toelke
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a great position in a prestigious firm,'' Toelke said,
''but compared to his kids, it was nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Cops: Cop in Video Shot by Officer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An officer whose gunshot wound to the thumb
led to a frantic police chase and a nationally televised police
beating of the suspect was actually shot by another officer,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault against
suspect Thomas Jones were dropped Monday after ballistics tests
indicated he did not shoot Officer Michael Livewell July 12. Jones
is still accused of carjacking, robbery and fleeing police.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne M. Abraham said the shot
was fired by Officer Cedric Gaines as he and Livewell struggled
with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''My client has always maintained he didn't have a gun,'' said
Jones' attorney, Blake Berenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 30, was initially pulled over by police for allegedly
driving a stolen car. He then drove off in a police vehicle. Later,
a television helicopter videotaped officers kicking and punching
him during his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had been in critical condition, was released from a
hospital Monday.

	   Syracuse, N.Y. (AP) -- Joey Hamilton tossed a complete game and
Kevin Witt hit a two-run homer for the Syracuse SkyChiefs in a 2-1
win over the Pawtucket Red Sox Monday in the International League.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton (2-2) and Carlos Castillo (1-2) throwing for Pawtucket
had a dual no-hitter through 6 1/2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The no-hitter ended in the eighth. Freddy Garcia had a leadoff
single to left. Jim Chamblee pitch-ran for Garcia and with one out
the shutout came to an end. Lou Merloni doubled to center scoring
Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Freel broke up the no-hitter with a double to the gap in
left. With one out Witt crushed the ball to deep right. Castillo
also surrendered a double to Andy Thompson later in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo was relieved by Tim Young in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo was put into a starting role because Pawtucket had to
shake up its rotation after Bret Saberhagen's short six pitch
outing on Saturday which required Sunday's starter Sun-Woo Kim to
enter the game. Subsequently Monday's starter Dan Smith went to the
hill on Sunday leaving no rested arms for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse has won eight of its last nine while Pawtucket has won
only one of its last nine.

<HEADLINE> Another person added to list of those sickened by E. coli  </HEADLINE>
By CARRIE ANTLFINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) - Another person has been linked to an E. coli
outbreak at two local Sizzler restaurants that killed a 3-year-old
and sickened dozens of customers, including one from Long Island,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, 57 cases have been linked to a south side
Milwaukee Sizzler and two to a Wauwatosa Sizzler, health officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   They are investigating the possibility that some infections were
caused by person-to-person contact.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned about secondary transmission,'' said Paul
Biedrzycki, manager of disease control and prevention for the
Milwaukee Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''It probably has occurred. To what degree I don't know, but not
to the degree of large numbers of people getting sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Biedrzycki said the number of cases could continue rising if
customers were exposed to the bacteria up until the restaurants
were closed.
</P>
<P>
   It can take up to eight days for symptoms to appear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The south side location closed July 26. The Wauwatosa franchise
closed August 2.
</P>
<P>
   Most confirmed victims ate at the Sizzlers between July 12 and
21.
</P>
<P>
   Last week nine lawsuits were filed relating to the outbreak,
including a wrongful death suit on behalf of 3-year-old Brianna
Kriefall.
</P>
<P>
   She died July 28 from complications of hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS), a kidney disease caused by the E. coli infection, after
eating at the Milwaukee restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle Cetta, a 4-year-old girl at Children's Hospital in New
York, remained in stable but improving condition Monday. Cetta, of
Long Island, became ill after eating at the Milwaukee Sizzler while
visiting relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Hospital of Wisconsin reported Monday that there were
two children still being treated there for E. coli infection, but
only one was related to Sizzler food.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the children was not released but neither were
in intensive care, a hospital spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Does Flourishes in Polls  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush is flourishing in the polls,
but a majority of Americans in two surveys released Monday don't
consider him to be ''a different kind of Republican'' as claimed by
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll said 35 percent consider the GOP presidential
nominee a different Republican, while 52 percent said he is ''a
typical Republican.'' An ABC News-Washington Post poll had similar
results on that question, with 35 percent saying he was different
and 56 percent saying he's the same as other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite skepticism about that claim, Bush led Gore by 16 points
in the CBS poll of registered voters, 50 percent to 34 percent,
while Ralph Nader had 5 percent and Pat Buchanan had 1 percent. And
he led by 14 points in the ABC-Post poll, 51 percent to 37 percent
with Nader at 5 percent and Buchanan at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has leads ranging from 11 points to 18 points in polls that
have been taken since the end of the GOP nominating convention last
week. His lead increased from 6 points before the convention to 15
points afterward in the CBS poll and from 9 points before the
convention to 14 points afterward in the ABC-Post survey.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have made gains in the last year on the public's
trust for them to be tolerant, with 35 percent saying that now
compared with 21 percent saying that in March of 1999. In the
ABC-Post poll, nearly half, 46 percent, trusted Democrats to be
tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   The public remains divided on whether the country needs to
change direction from Clinton's leadership, with 48 percent
preferring a change and 44 percent favoring the current direction.
Bush and running mate Dick Cheney raised that issue in convention
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   While a majority of the public doesn't view Bush as ''a
different kind of Republican, more than half believe he cares about
the problems of blacks and other minorities, according to the CBS
poll.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS poll of 868 registered voters and the ABC-Post poll of
975 registered voters were taken Friday through Sunday and have
error margins of 3 percentage points.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Doctors are failing to test women who suffer wrist
fractures for osteoporosis, even though treatment often proves effective and the
same women face a greater risk of more serious bone fractures, new research
says. The study of 1,162 women over age 54 who suffered wrist fractures found
that only 33 patients underwent a bone density scan to detect the presence of
osteoporosis and only 266 were treated with medication for the disease. Those
women are nearly twice as likely to have hip fractures.

<HEADLINE> Couples Leads Canadian Skins Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERNON, British Columbia (AP) -- Fred Couples made a 12-foot putt
worth $75,000 Monday to cap the first day of the Export A Skins
Game.
</P>
<P>
   The big payout on the day's ninth and final hole came when the
previous three holes had been carried over. The $90,000 gave
Couples the lead through nine holes and pushed his total winnings
in eight Canadian skins games past $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia, who has struggled on the PGA Tour this year, took
a liking to the Predator Ridge Golf Resort course. He took $15,000
on the opening hole and finished with $60,000 on four skins.
</P>
<P>
   Both defending champion Mike Weir and Phil Mickelson, third on
the PGA money list this year with over $2.9 million, failed to win
a skin.
</P>
<P>
   Weir, a native of Canada, won $210,000 at last year's
competition and then went on to win his first PGA event, the Air
Canada Championship, also in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Couples has won the tournament four times, with his last victory
in 1998 when he pocketed $220,000 at Crowbush Cove, Prince Edward
Island. He was shut out of the money last year.
</P>
<P>
   Couples won $15,000 on the second hole.
</P>
<P>
   Under the skins format, the low score on each hole wins the
assigned prize money. In the case of low-score tie, the money is
carried over until there is a single winner.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's play starts with holes 10 through 12 assigned $20,000
each. The final six holes are $25,000 each.

   BOSTON (AP) -- The New England Patriots traded an undisclosed
draft choice to the St. Louis Rams on Monday for rookie wide
receiver Dane Looker.
</P>
<P>
   Looker, 24, signed with the Rams as a free agent in April
following the NFL draft. The 6-foot, 193-pound Looker started 13 of
21 games and caught 84 passes for 949 yards and five touchdowns in
two seasons at Washington after transferring from Western
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In his preseason debut with the Rams last Saturday, he caught a

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Says Americans Bias  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A top Palestinian negotiator on Monday accused
the United States of favoring Israel and said American pressure on
the Palestinians was hampering efforts to reach a final peace
agreement by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Qureia, one of the top negotiators at a failed summit at
Camp David last month, warned that another summit would only be a
''trap'' if the United States and Israel do not recognize
Palestinian rights to east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In order for another round of talks to be possible, either
Israel must agree to divide the disputed city or the United States
must issue ''a letter of guarantees specifying its real positions
and not those positions biased toward the Israelis,'' Qureia said.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S.-mediated summit, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
had offered the Palestinians some control in east Jerusalem,
including in the walled Old City, but Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat demanded full sovereignty over the sector Israel captured in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   The sides are under heavy pressure to complete an agreement
quickly. Arafat says he will declare a state on Sept. 13. Israel
has said it will retaliate by annexing parts of the Gaza Strip and
West Bank. That could lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia said he doubted the sides could reach an agreement before
the date, which the sides had set as a deadline for the completion
of the final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see that the atmosphere and the mentality are such
that they could lead to a fair agreement,'' said Qureia, who is
speaker of the Palestinian parliament. ''The Israelis are still
thinking of blackmailing us while the Americans are still thinking
of putting pressure on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that the illusion on the Israeli and the American sides
that we can agree on what is less than our rights is finished,''
Qureia added. ''We will not walk into a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and American attempts to force the Palestinians to agree
to less than full sovereignty in east Jerusalem -- particularly the
Al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site to Muslims -- runs counter to
the positions of Arab nations as well, Qureia said.
</P>
<P>
   The Old City also houses sites holy to Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was visiting the Persian Gulf region Monday, hoping to
garner support for his plans to declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis B. Ross, is expected to resume
his talks with Israel and the Palestinians in the region Aug. 20.
to determine if the sides are ready for another round of formal
talks.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 4, Tigers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Ivanon Coffie hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly in
the ninth inning and Brady Anderson homered to lead the Baltimore
Orioles over the Detroit Tigers 4-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 3-all, Chris Richard led off the ninth with a
double off Doug Brocail (5-4) and advanced on Brook Fordyce's
groundout. Coffie then lifted fly to center that was just deep
enough to score Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Groom (4-3) struck out the only batter he faced, Bobby
Higginson in the eighth, and Ryan Kohlmeier pitched a perfect ninth
for his first major league save, sealing Baltimore's sixth win in
nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer homered for the Tigers, 1-4 on a seven-game
homestand. They stranded 11 runners -- eight in scoring position --
and left the bases full in both the fifth and sixth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Neither rookie starter figured in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles left-hander John Parrish, making his third major league
start, allowed two runs, eight hits and five walks in 5 1-3
innings, leaving with a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit right-hander Adam Bernero, making his second major
league start and appearance, gave up three runs and six hits in 6
2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields' RBI single but Baltimore ahead in the third,
with Melvin Mora thrown out at the plate by center fielder Juan
Encarnacion on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Ausmus' run-scoring grounder tied it in the bottom half,
but the Orioles went back ahead in the fourth when Jeff Conine
tripled and scored on Brook Fordyce's sacrifice fly, dropped by
Encarnacion for a two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson made it 3-1 with a solo homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit loaded the bases with two outs in the home half, but
Parrish struck out Juan Gonzalez on a 2-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer led off the sixth with his 21st home run, and the Tigers
loaded the bases again with one out to knock out Parrish. But Mike
Trombley relieved and retired Damion Easley and Ausmus on grounders
to third.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Billy McMillon tied it with an RBI double in the
seventh off Trombley.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Tigers ran themselves out of the first inning after
Easley hit a leadoff single and Ausmus walked. Parrish caught
Easley leaning off second and ran him down for the first out, then
threw to Mora at shortstop to throw out Ausmus trying to steal.
Bobby Higginson then walked, but Gonzalez flied out, ending the
inning. ... Albert Belle was 0-for-4 and is hitting just .196
(11-for-56) in his last 14 games. ... Chris Richard was 1-for-5 and
has hit safely in all seven games since the Orioles obtained him
July 29 from St. Louis for Mike Timlin. ... Gonzalez was 0-for-5
with two strikeouts and stranded six runners. He's 1-for-17 during
the homestand.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Faulted on Missing  </HEADLINE>
By RICARDO MIRANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A report by a leading human rights group
about children who vanished during Guatemala's civil war says the
military was to blame for most of the disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Roman Catholic Church's main human rights
office in Guatemala, released to the media on Monday, details the
cases of 86 children who disappeared during the 36-year civil war,
which ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The military said it would not respond until it saw the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military has not seen this document, and we would have to
read it carefully before giving our point of view,'' said the
office of military spokesman Capt. Jose Maria Valladares.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors said there are accounts of 358 other cases
that could not be fully documented.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were members of Guatemala's Maya Indian
majority, who suffered most from the army's scorched-earth campaign
against rebel fighters, the report said. Hundreds of villages were
raided and many were obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast majority of disappearances, the children were
abducted, said Nery Rodenas, director of the Archbishop's Human
Rights Office. The rest were caused by ''the dynamic of armed
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have in our hands is the confirmation that children
were used as war booty, that forced disappearance was used as an
instrument of war against those most vulnerable, the children,''
Rodenas told a news conference. In some cases, the vanished
children ''were used for military ends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which will be released publicly Tuesday, attributed
79 of the cases to the military, 3 of the cases to
government-organized paramilitary groups and 2 of the cases to
leftist rebels. The causes of 2 of the cases could not be
clarified.
</P>
<P>
   The group says they are still looking for the children, and is
unsure if they all survived the war.
</P>
<P>
   One case highlighted in the report was that of Baudilio Monzon,
a 9-year-old Mayan boy who vanished on Feb. 18, 1984 during a raid
on his village.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, a military helicopter dropped fliers with a
picture of the boy in a hospital bed and message promising safety
if villagers came out of the jungle where they had fled and
surrendered to the army. ''Thank God, I am being healed,'' the
flier quoted the boy as saying.
</P>
<P>
   His parents have not seen him since. The boy's father was quoted
in the report saying he had heard at first that his son was being
kept at a military unit in Xalbal, about 180 miles north of the
capital, then years later that he was under the care of a colonel
named Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   Rodenas said many of the families lack the resources to search
for the children. ''Furthermore, there is still fear of reprisals,
which leads them to leave things as they are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the next step is to try to locate the missing children
and try to reunite them with their families.
</P>
<P>
   The coordinator of the human rights office, Bishop Mario Rios
Montt, urged Guatemalans to confront the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let it not be a political issue nor a motive for profit or
sensationalism,'' he said. ''Remember that it involves human beings
who have been profoundly harmed by war.''

<HEADLINE> Actors Take Strike to Streets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actors on strike against the advertising
industry took their cause to the streets Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of actors went on a protest march and gathered at the
Hollywood Palladium on Sunset Boulevard in the 15th week of the
strike involving the Screen Actors Guild and the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need to get back to the negotiating table,'' actor
Richard Crenna said, criticizing the industry's wage proposals so
far as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Federal mediators' efforts to restart talks last month between
the unions -- representing 135,000 actors -- and the ad industry were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and AFTRA want to change the industry's compensation
structure to give actors ''pay-per-play'' residuals for both
network and cable TV commercials. Advertisers want to pay flat fees
for both.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ad industry, ad production during the strike
that began May 1 has remained close to normal with the use of
nonunion performers.

<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Mobil Oil Corporation has become the third
oil company to agree to partially reimburse the state for cleanup
of two city blocks dubbed ''Oil City'' because of contamination
left by more than a century of fuel storage tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfax, Va.-based company will pay $100,000. In addition,
the company has agreed to perform remediation measures on the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement will ensure that these contaminated sites are
properly cleaned up and help pave the way for the redevelopment of
Oil City and Syracuse's Inner Harbor,'' state Department of
Environmental Conservation Commissioner John Cahill said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Included in that redevelopment is the planned $200 million
expansion of Pyramid's Carousel Center mall, reportedly on delay
because of the pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Pyramid officials told the DEC they were ''frustrated'' with the
slow pace of the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   The Citgo and Sunoco oil companies previously signed similar
consent orders.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' QB Fiedler Plans Return  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler is
recovering rapidly from arthroscopic hip surgery and hopes to play
in the team's final exhibition game Aug. 25 against New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler underwent surgery Thursday and was walking the next day.
He's also riding a bicycle and swimming to regain a full range of
motion in his right hip, and for the first time in weeks he's
pain-free.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we're shooting for that last preseason game,'' he
said Monday. ''That's our goal, and it looks like we're on
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis last week of the injury, which had bothered Fiedler
since last spring, temporarily ended the battle to succeed Dan
Marino at quarterback. Damon Huard is expected to start the first
game Sept. 3 against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But Fiedler, who signed with Miami as a free agent in March,
still expects to play this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a long season,'' he said. ''No matter who was going to
get the starting job from the beginning, there are very few
quarterbacks who last 16 games. The backup is going to be needed at
some point.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation repaired a tear in Fiedler's hip joint. His
surgeon, Dr. Mark Philipon, performed a similar procedure five
weeks ago on golfer Greg Norman, who recovered quickly and finished
fourth Sunday in The International tournament in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seeing that keeps me very hopeful,'' Fiedler said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much the injury hampered Fiedler, who had been
unable to overtake Huard in the quarterback derby. Fiedler said the
hip bothered him most when he turned to throw sideline passes.
</P>
<P>
   He'll miss at least three exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sets me back a little bit, but I've been here since March
and working with the guys for a while,'' he said. ''Physically I'll
just have to catch up on the work I miss.''

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Summit Ends  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) -- Southern African leaders pressed the
warring parties in Congo on Monday to join a dialogue as part of
the peace process aiming to end the country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But the Heads of state from the 14-nation Southern African
Development Community, who ended their annual summit Monday,
postponed addressing Congo President Laurent Kabila's rejection of
the mediator for the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   In a final statement, the leaders insisted the Congolese peace
process was still on track, despite repeated violations of
cease-fires and other setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Congo has been wracked by civil war with Uganda and Rwanda
backing Congolese rebels and Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe
supporting Kabila. Kabila did not show up for the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The summit urged the Congolese to honor their agreements by
supporting an internal political dialogue under former Botswana
President Sir Ketumile Masire, who Kabila has adamantly rejected as
a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's refusal to accept Masire will be discussed at a special
meeting on Congo to be held in Lusaka, Zambia, on August 14,
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will never give up,'' said Nujoma, the incoming SADC
chairman for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The SADC leaders also supported beleaguered Zimbabwe and
condemned the U.S. Congress' passage of a bill that would impose a
series of political conditions on the country in return for
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing SADC chairman Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano and
Nujoma told reporters that Zimbabwe's June parliamentary elections
had been free and fair, despite international observers
condemnation of pre-election violence that killed more than 30
people and left thousands of others, mainly opposition supporters,
battered.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I am concerned, the elections were free and fair,''
said Nujoma, a staunch ally of embattled President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   SADC's acting secretary-general, Prega Ramsamy, said the meeting
led to progress in terms of regional agricultural development,
infrastructure and energy issues.
</P>
<P>
   The final statement also called for urgent action on combatting
the HIV/AIDS pandemic sweeping the continent and praised the
general political stability and respect for human rights the region
has enjoyed over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Chissano cautioned that the region would have to register
annual economic growth in excess of 6 percent if the leaders were
to make a dent in widespread poverty.
</P>
<P>
   SADC hoped that by implementing a Free Trade Area beginning next
month, the increasingly free flow of goods and people could help
achieve this target, Chissano said.

<HEADLINE> Safir to announce he's leaving NYPD  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who has
presided over a department beset by racial incidents at the same
time that crime has dropped dramatically, will be leaving the NYPD
next month, police sources with direct knowledge of Safir's plans
confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Three sources, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Safir is expected to make the announcement at a yet-to-be scheduled
news conference Tuesday, but they were not certain whether he is
going to another job, or if his decision had anything to do with
the diagnosis in May that he has prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Safir's spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, did not immediately respond
to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir told WPIX-TV Channel 11 that there would be an
announcement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is that there will be some change,'' he said. ''But I
don't want to talk about it until the mayor actually announces it.
He and I will do it together as we have done most things
together.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his time as police commissioner ''the best job that
I'll ever have in my entire life,'' while saying the most difficult
aspect has been ''when we bury police officers, and any time we
lose a police officer that's still the hardest part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir, 58, was appointed police commissioner in 1996 by his good
friend, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whom he has known for more than 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Safir was often deemed by his critics as being merely Giuliani's
puppet at Police Headquarters, rubber-stamping the mayor's
policies. Safir was never as popular as his predecessor, the
affable William Bratton, who won over the men and women in blue, as
well as the public.
</P>
<P>
   But Safir followed up on many of Bratton's initiatives,
including COMPSTAT - a computer tracking of crime statistics, and
the crackdown on ''quality of life'' offenders, such as jaywalkers
and squeegee men, and crime fell during his watch.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of controversial incidents have dogged Safir. In
1997, Haitian immigrant Abner Louima was brutalized in the bathroom
of the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn by Officer Justin Volpe. Volpe
pleaded guilty in 1999. Five other officers have either been
convicted at trial or pleaded guilty in one of the worst police
brutality scandals in city history.
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, Safir transferred the entire precinct,
bringing in a number of Hispanic and black officers in hopes of
appeasing the mostly minority community that precinct serves. But
in June, a federal jury ordered the police department to pay 24
officers $50,000 each for being involuntarily transferred.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, four white police officers fatally gunned down
West African immigrant Amadou Diallo in his Bronx apartment
vestibule because they thought the wallet he was holding was a gun.
All of the officers were acquitted in February of murder and other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the shooting, Safir took an all-expenses-paid trip
to the Academy Awards, courtesy of a Revlon executive friend,
leaving town amid the protests over Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar trip prompted the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association -
the union representing more than 26,000 cops - to issue its
first-ever ''no-confidence'' vote against a commissioner. Safir
refused to quit and reiterated a statement he has made many times
during his tenure: ''Crime has gone down more under my stewardship
than any time in the history of this city. ... It is a safer
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir - and Giuliani - were mired in controversy again when in
March, an undercover detective fatally shot Patrick Dorismond, an
unarmed security guard, on a Manhattan street known as a drug
location. However, Dorismond did not have any drugs on him. Both
Safir and the mayor were heavily criticized for releasing
Dorismond's sealed juvenile record. A state grand jury declined to
indict the detective.
</P>
<P>
   Safir suffered a personal blow in May, when he was diagnosed
with prostate cancer. When he made his diagnosis public, just weeks
after Giuliani announced that he was suffering from prostate
cancer, Safir said his condition was treatable, but has not
disclosed his treatment plan.
</P>
<P>
   Safir was appointed the city's 39th police commissioner after a
stint as fire commissioner. He had earlier spent 26 years in
federal law enforcement, serving with the Drug Enforcement
Administration and later as operations chief of the U.S. Marshals
Service in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He then formed his own security consulting firm, Safir
Associates, based in Fairfax, Va. In 1994, the Bronx native
returned to the city to serve in Giuliani's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Safir graduated from Hofstra University in 1963 with a bachelor
of arts degree in history and political science, and went on to
Brooklyn Law School. He and his wife have been married for 34
years. They have two adult children, Adam and Jennifer, both of
whom are married.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Hits Okinawa, Injures 2  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKINAWA CITY, Japan (AP) -- Typhoon Jelawat pounded Japan's
southern island of Okinawa on Tuesday, lightly injuring two
children, knocking down trees and leaving thousands of homes
without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Jelawat's winds of 90 mph also dumped torrential rains on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Flying debris hit an 11-year-old boy on the head and a
14-year-old boy on the back, inflicting light cuts, said Okinawa
police spokesman Jun Yogi.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military, which has a strong presence on Okinawa,
grounded aircraft Monday and a bar on flying remained in effect
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Military personnel and their families were restricted to their
homes while the military monitored weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   About 19,000 homes hit by power outages across Okinawa's main
island, with most centered in the northern city of Nago, said
Okinawa Electric Power Company spokeswoman Yoko Nakanishi.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was too early to say when power might be restored.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million people live on Okinawa, located about 1,000
miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Jelawat was located about 50 miles north of
Nago, according to Japan's Meteorological Agency. It was heading
northwest at a slow speed toward the East China Sea, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 people were stranded at Naha's airport late Monday
after commercial flights were canceled, said Naha Domestic Airport
official Yasushi Oshiro. As of early Tuesday, 30 flights remained
canceled.

<HEADLINE> Inside Gore's VP Pick Deliberation  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore, in blue jeans, picked at the
oversized fruit platter in his hotel suite and quizzed a team of
lawyers about the four senators named on Warren Christopher's
neatly labeled, manila research folders.
</P>
<P>
   What would the unions think of this guy? Is that one 100 percent
for abortion rights? How would so-and-so go over with the
environmental groups? Where does he hail from?
</P>
<P>
   And, what about Joe Lieberman being an Orthodox Jew?
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hunger, Gore's brother-in-law, who had piped in only here
and there during several hours with shifting groups of advisers,
jumped in at that moment, his Mississippi twang at its thickest:
''If the country's not ready for it, it damn well should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president seconded Hunger's sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Lieberman's faith is an asset, agreed campaign chairman
William Daley and Christopher, the former secretary of state who
headed the search for a No. 2 on Gore's Democratic presidential
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion moved on.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight, Gore told confidantes sitting with him around a
dining table: ''I'm going to go with Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator from Connecticut, choked with emotion, called it ''a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 52, reached Lieberman at noontime Monday on his cell
phone, as a driver ferried him from the Connecticut AFL-CIO
convention in Hartford to his New Haven, Conn., driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Would you be my running mate?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be honored,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   If I send a private jet (with a ''Gore for President'' poster
hastily taped to the fuselage), would you and your family join me
for dinner in Nashville tonight?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any better invitations,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old senator was still in the passenger seat and on
the phone when news cameras on stakeout on his front lawn pressed
up to the car window. Lieberman flashed them a smiling thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   According to two insiders who were present for the deliberations
and spoke on condition they not be identified, Gore's midnight
decision, kept under wraps until an Associated Press bulletin at
6:51 a.m., followed a sober and orderly series of meetings around
the table in his suite on the hotel's cordoned-off 10th floor.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife Tipper and daughter Sarah were stuck at
Washington's Reagan National Airport, Gore reached his wife by cell
phone at the gate to run the progress by her. He also telephoned
daughter Karenna in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Up to the final hour -- after Mrs. Gore finally arrived and had
her turn questioning Christopher and the lawyers, Gore asked
questions about each contender. Washington attorney Jim Hamilton
led the legal team and had vetted finalists Lieberman, of
Connecticut, Evan Bayh of Indiana, John Edwards of North Carolina,
and John Kerry of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Top aides, including consultant Tad Devine and campaign manager
Donna Brazile, were brought in at one point to offer their counsel.
Sarah Gore quietly took it all in.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, where reporters awaited clues to any decision,
aides shut out of Gore's deliberation continued to talk up the
charismatic Edwards as the dream candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the upstairs suite emptied of all but the
family, plus Daley, Christopher and campaign communications
director Mark Fabiani that Gore's questions and comments zeroed in
on Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ''had asked all the questions that, in the end, satisfied
him that the decision he already had in mind was the right one,''
said one insider.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman had well-positioned boosters.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger, who has been the loyal confidante at Gore's side on the
trail since his 1992 campaign with Bill Clinton, appeared to be
rooting for Lieberman. So did top strategist Carter Eskew, who
worked on Lieberman's 1988 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   On six hours of sleep, Gore went about a normal routine Monday --
the treadmill, breakfast with Mrs. Gore, pecking at his laptop on
his Aug. 17 convention speech -- while the morning news shows buzzed
about Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took his time popping the question to the man of the hour
and, later, calling to let President Clinton know. Gore also called
the passed-over finalists.
</P>
<P>
   But first, there was an interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw at a
nearby soda shop. Gore dismissed polls showing that his deficit to
GOP rival George W. Bush has deepened since last week's Republican
National Convention. Gore gets his turn on in the spotlight when
Democrats convene Aug. 14 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it was off to a staged stroll with Brokaw through the
Vanderbilt University campus and, finally, the call to Lieberman.
They said a brief prayer together.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman put it, ''You've got to praise God for blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, Liberman flew to Nashville for dinner with the
Gores, bringing his wife Hadassah, his mother Marcia, two of his
four children -- Hana, 12, and Matthew, 32 -- and daughter-in-law
April.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Friends Cite Character  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Sen. Joseph Lieberman needs to take the
pulse of Connecticut voters, he heads to a diner and asks his
constituents to ''have a cup of joe'' with Joe. He says it's the
best way to get unfiltered views.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, aides estimate he has visited more than 100 Connecticut
diners. And while he seeks diverse opinions, Lieberman sticks to a
standard order: a tuna fish sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation for steady habits, a resolute manner and
faithfulness to his beliefs has won him fans among Republicans as
well as Democrats. Now he's Al Gore's vice presidential running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm delighted. He's my favorite Democrat,'' said former
Education Secretary William Bennett, a Republican adviser to the
presidential campaign of George W. Bush. ''They've got a serious
person. ... He's arguably the most impressive Democrat in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until two years ago, not many people knew the 58-year-old
Orthodox Jewish senator outside of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   That changed with a Sept. 3, 1998, speech on the Senate floor in
which he chastised President Clinton -- his friend of almost 30
years -- for Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. He described Clinton's behavior as ''disgraceful'' and
''embarrassing'' to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Though he eventually voted to acquit the president of
impeachment charges, the speech boosted Lieberman's reputation as a
moral crusader. Fellow Democrats dubbed him the ''conscience of the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman made his comments despite his long friendship with
Clinton, dating back to their days at Yale Law School. In 1970, as
a student, Clinton campaigned for Lieberman when he was running for
a state senate district that included Yale. In 1992, Lieberman
returned the favor, speaking up as the first senator from the
Northeast to endorse Clinton's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to his wife, Hadassah, is the second for each of
them. He and his first wife, Elizabeth, divorced in 1981 after 16
years and have two grown children together, Matthew, 32, and
Rebecca, 31.
</P>
<P>
   He and Hadassah were married in 1983, she bringing her son from
her previous marriage, Ethan, to the family. Ethan is 24. The
Liebermans live in New Haven with the daughter they had together,
Hana, 12. Lieberman also has two granddaughters, Tennessee and
Willie.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was born in Stamford to Marcia and Henry Lieberman.
The father was a liquor store salesman. The son attended public
schools before heading to Yale as an undergraduate in 1964. He
graduated from Yale Law School in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He won the state Senate seat in 1970, and served the New Haven
area district for 10 years. He was elected state attorney general
in 1983 and stayed in that office until his 1988 run for U.S.
Senate against Republican incumbent Lowell P. Weicker. Lieberman
won by just 10,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   His re-election in 1994 was a landslide. He beat Republican
Gerald Labriola by some 350,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's politics, though Democratic, have always leaned
somewhat to the right, some say, pointing to his support for
increased defense spending and school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Lieberman and Bennett began handing out ''Silver
Sewer Awards'' to single out producers of sexually explicit and
violent films, music, television programs and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call him a liberal who votes for abortion rights, gun
control and tax hikes. Philip Giordano, Lieberman's challenger for
re-election to the Senate this year, says, ''He looks like the
pillar of morality, but then he goes with his party line.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. John G. Rowland, though endorsing Giordano,
called Lieberman ''a great friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters talk most often of his character.
</P>
<P>
   ''His integrity and commitment to good values are the most
impressive things about him,'' said Rabbi Barry Fruendel of Kesher
Israel, the synagogue Lieberman attends in Washington. ''He's not
afraid to put life's most important things in front of politics.''	   His
religion itself is notable. He is the first Jewish vice
presidential candidate on a major-party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Because he and his wife observe the Jewish Sabbath from sundown
Friday to sundown Saturday, Lieberman adjusts his work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   His religion immediately raised questions about how he would
deal with Middle East matters. But Faisal Husseini, a top official
with the Palestinian Liberation Organization in Jerusalem, said,
''I hope that when he is in such a position that he will look at
the issue through a wider lens and make balanced decisions. I
believe he can do so because he is informed about the Middle
East.''

<HEADLINE> Bhutan-India Floods Kill Over 200  </HEADLINE>
By WASBIR HUSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAUHATI, India (AP) -- Monsoon rains that left 2.5 million
Indians homeless in the northeast have hit the neighboring kingdom
of Bhutan, killing nearly 200 people, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 180 bodies had been recovered as of Sunday in Pashaka,
a village in Bhutan close to the Indian border that was pounded by
mudslides, United News of India reported.
</P>
<P>
   The village was destroyed, the agency quoted Indian officials in
the border Jalpaiguri district as saying. More villagers were
feared dead.
</P>
<P>
   The swollen Dhuti Khola River has submerged much of the tiny
kingdom's main economic center, the town of Phuntsholing, under
water in the past week, the Bhutanese government-owned Kuensel
weekly newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Bhutanese soldiers and policemen have been asked to carry
food, medicine and tents for hundreds of people left homeless. The
telephone links have also been snapped between major towns in
Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
   To help rescue efforts, the Indian army has sent troops to the
flood-hit areas across the border, UNI said.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Bangladesh, torrential rains and overflowing rivers
flooded hundreds of villages, leaving at least 12 people dead and
thousands of others stranded or homeless, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Indian side, the death toll has risen to 80 in 16
flood-hit districts of Assam state, government officials said.
Those hit by the floods were facing a severe shortage of food and
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are virtually starving with nothing to eat. Whatever we
managed to carry, as we fled our homes on Thursday when flood
waters entered our homes, has now finished,'' said Dhruva Das, a
resident of village Borbhag in Nalbari district, 75 miles west of
Gauhati, the capital of Assam state, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of infants and elderly people have developed symptoms
of dysentery and other waterborne diseases in relief camps.
</P>
<P>
   The flood waters have been receding since Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than 2,500 villagers have been rescued so far by the Air
Force helicopters,'' said S. Madhok, an army commander in Rangiya,
30 miles west of Gauhati.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Doctors Bound for Miami  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Two Cuban doctors jailed in Zimbabwe for more than
a month after defecting from a medical mission arrived in Miami
Monday night after nearly a month's temporary refuge in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Leonel Cordova Rodriguez, 31, and Noris Pena Martinez, 25, left
Stockholm on a morning flight, with stopovers in Zurich,
Switzerland, and New York. About 30 people greeted them when they
arrived in Miami, two held Cuban flags and one held a sign that
said ''Bienvenidos Doctores'' (Welcome Doctors).
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered loudly and sang the Cuban national anthem when
the doctors arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a product of the new generations coming out of Cuba and as
a doctor or professional, I felt like a slave in the Cuban state,''
Pena Martinez said. ''I have defected, seeking freedom, just as the
majority of the young professionals in Cuba would like to enjoy in
a free and democratic Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Rodriguez said that his family in Cuba was kicked out of
their home because of his defection.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family is suffering, they're suffering a lot ... Now they
are out living with the help of friends at the mercy of the
state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena Martinez plans to stay with her second cousin, Mina
Fernandez, who helped lead efforts in the local Cuban exile
community on behalf of the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy that she got out of Zimbabwe,'' Fernandez said.
''It was not easy to get them out of there. Thank God for the help
of the politicians and the U.S. government for getting them the
temporary visas ... Fidel Castro lost this battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban American National Foundation, a powerful Miami-based
anti-Castro Cuban exile group, has pledged to help the pair find
jobs here.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Rodriguez intended to stay with Emilio de-Quesada, 45,
who taught the doctor when he was a student at the University of
Havana medical school. De-Quesdada said he would help guide his
former student through adjustment to life in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't have the slightest idea what life is like here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena Martinez, a dentist, and Cordova Rodriguez, a physician,
were hoping to find work as assistants in their fields, and both
planned to go through the lengthy process of getting their Cuban
degrees revalidated in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The pair arrived in Stockholm on July 8 after the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees negotiated their release from jail and
Swedish immigration authorities issued them two-month visas while
they applied for refugee status in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Their refugee status, which was granted just over a week ago,
will allow them to apply for permanent residency after one year in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova Rodriguez and Pena Martinez were in Zimbabwe on a
medical mission when they sought refuge at the Canadian and U.S.
embassies in Harare, which referred them to the U.N. commission.
But the Cubans disappeared June 2, the day of their hearing before
a Zimbabwean asylum committee.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors accused Zimbabwean security officers of kidnapping
them and helping Cuban diplomats try to force them on a flight to
Havana. Air France refused to let them board during a stopover in
South Africa after the doctors slipped a note to a crew member
saying they were kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were returned to Zimbabwe and jailed, while the U.N.
refugee agency demanded their release under international law.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba said the doctors betrayed the medical mission to aid
Zimbabwe's health service but denied any involvement in the alleged
kidnapping.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Ricans Chase U.S. Navy Bus  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rican protesters chased a
U.S. Navy bus and scuffled with riot police Monday as authorities
arrested 32 women for trying to stop bombing exercises on the
outlying island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The women, arrested Monday at dawn, were the latest of dozens of
protesters to break into the military training ground on Vieques.
They were immediately detained.
</P>
<P>
   When a Navy bus carrying the detainees left the camp, about 80
other protesters jumped in their cars and chased the bus, Police
Sgt. Jose L. Velardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Police escorting the bus called for reinforcements, who set up a
roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had 20 to 25 cars following this bus,'' Velardo said.
''Things were very tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Three witnesses said that riot police threw Luz Legillu, a
retired schoolteacher and wife of a former Vieques mayor, to the
ground and pointed weapons at her.
</P>
<P>
   Legillu, however, denied the confrontation was so violent, and a
spokesman for the Vieques Rescue Committee, Roberto Rabin, said
that the incident had been blown out of proportion to ''give the
false impression that there was some kind of violent confrontation
here, that protesters were being violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Velardo said Legillu complained to him but said he did not see
the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Velardo said the crowd dispersed after local police intervened.
</P>
<P>
   He also said riot police reported that protesters threw motor
oil at the bus and patrol cars. Rabin denied that. The riot police
commander could not be reached for comment immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The clash came as the Navy's USS Harry Truman battle group
continued practicing. Jets began dropping dummy bombs on the firing
range last week. Ships are expected to fire inert shells during
exercises that could last through Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Anger over the Navy's presence flared in April 1999 after a jet
dropped two bombs off target and killed a civilian guard on the
range.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters invaded the area for a year until federal agents
removed them May 4. The Navy owns two-thirds of Vieques. Its
bombing range is about 10 miles from the civilian sector and covers
900 acres on the eastern tip -- less than 3 percent of the island.
</P>
<P>
   A Puerto Rican government report said exercises over 60 years
had stunted the economy and harmed the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy denies any damage and says its live-fire training at
Vieques is essential practice that saves lives in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement between President Clinton and the Puerto
Rican government, the Navy resumed exercises with dummy munitions
until a referendum is held. The Navy must pull out by May 2003 if
residents vote to expel it.

<HEADLINE> Plaza Hotel security guards exchange shots with burglary suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - An altercation between security guards and a
burglary suspect in the lobby of the Plaza Hotel turned into a wild
chase and shootout Monday night, ending with police arresting the
wounded suspect down the street from the Edwardian-style Central
Park south landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, who was not identified, was approached in the lobby
by hotel security about 9 p.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the hotel, he pulled a gun and fired shots at the
guards, prompting one of them to fire one shot back, hitting the
suspect in the arm, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described a wild scene as the fleeing suspect, wearing
a navy suit and tie, skirted around the William Tecumseh Sherman
statue in front of the hotel and hopped into a taxi at 60th Street
and Fifth Avenue, a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Police cars hemmed the taxi in. The suspect jumped out of the
cab and was wrestled to the ground by police officers, said one
witness, limousine driver Diego Morales, 43.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth Avenue was closed between 60th and 62nd streets for about
two hours while police interviewed witnesses and combed the area
for shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was taken to St. Clair's Hospital, where he was
listed in stable condition.

<HEADLINE> Judge Hears Scientist's Motions  </HEADLINE>
By CHAKA FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Wen Ho Lee's lawyers asked a judge
Monday to dismiss most of the charges against the fired nuclear
scientist on grounds that his alleged misconduct is not covered by
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, is charged with 59 counts, mostly alleging that he
transferred restricted files from secure to unsecure computers and
to computer tapes at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   He could spend life in prison if convicted. His trial is
scheduled to begin Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   In their motion, defense attorneys Mark Holscher and John Cline
ask U.S. District Judge James A. Parker to dismiss all but 10 of
the counts because they deal with ''intangible information'' not
covered by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statutes at issue ... respectively cover only tangibles
such as documents and writings and do not apply to intangibles such
as information,'' the motion states.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate motion, the defense argues that the lab did not
assign a classification level to the files Lee allegedly downloaded
until after he was fired on March 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   They contend the references could cause a jury to believe that
the files had been classified as secret or confidential at the time
of Lee's alleged misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''The allegations concerning the files' classification levels
represent an improper, after-the-fact attempt to inflate the files'
sensitivity,'' the motion says.
</P>
<P>
   Phone messages left for the U.S. attorney's office and defense
attorneys were not immediately returned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been held without bail since December. His defense team
requested a new bail hearing, but prosecutors responded Friday by
saying he still poses a flight risk and a threat to national
security if released pending trial.
