Bureau of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China
(CCCPC) arrived in Hanoi Thursday on an official goodwill visit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Late President Yang Shangkun Cares for Country, People  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Late Chinese President Yang
Shangkun, who died of illness early this week in Beijing at the
age of 92, continued to show great concern about the country and
people during his last days of life.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who retired from official posts in 1993, was hospitalized
on June 7 as his state of illness worsened.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with President Jiang Zemin on August 19, Yang
smiled in relief after Jiang told him that the Party Central
Committee and the State Council had taken effective measures to
counter the grave floods along the Yangtze, Nenjiang and Songhua
rivers and assured him that the Chinese people could overcome
the temporary difficulties.
</P>
<P>
While talking with Premier Zhu Rongji about the devastating
floods, Yang said: "I am happy that you have the right ways for
flood control."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
and Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing, all members of the
Standing Committee of Political Bureau of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, all visited Yang during his
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ying, widow of late veteran revolutionary Zhang Wentian,
Wang Guangmei, widow of late Chinese President Liu Shaoqi, Zhu
Lin, widow of late Leader Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Jiqing, widow of
Peng Zhen, late chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, many
relatives of Yang's comrades-in-arms, and people from southern
Guangdong Province, where Yang worked between 1978-1980, among
many others, also visited or sent flowers to Yang while he was in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
As a great revolutionary, Yang concerned himself with majors
issues at home and abroad and with China's reform, opening-up and
socialist modernization cause.

While watching a program of the China Central Television on
document falsification by some grain supply enterprises, he said
worriedly "we suffered from falsification in the past and why
should some places continue to falsify?"
</P>
<P>
When he learned from TV reports that some flood-control workers
fell on the river dyke after consecutive days and nights of hard
work, Yang said "we should learn from them."
</P>
<P>
However, on hearing that some local officials had committed
dereliction of duty on the flood-control frontlines, Yang said
angrily that such officials should be investigated and punished.
</P>
<P>
In early August, Yang asked his children to donate 20,000 yuan,
which was his and his wife's bank savings, to the flooded areas to
be used for purchasing medicines.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis was always on Yang's mind. He told
people around him that with the firm backing of the motherland,
Hong Kong would tide over the temporary difficulties caused by the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
On September 2, Yang called together members of his family and
told them that "man must die and you must not be too sad."
</P>
<P>
"As to my funeral matter, you'd ask the central government to
make it simple and even simpler as our country has suffered grave
disasters," Yang told his family.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Records $13.9 Bln Deficit in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
climbed up to 13.9 billion U.S. dollars in July, the Commerce
Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department statistics showed that the July deficit was 2.1
percent higher over June's revised imbalance of 13.6 billion
dollars. That made July the third-highest monthly deficit on
record, surpassed only by May and April of this year.
</P>
<P>
The worsening situation in July reflected a big jump in the
U.S. deficit with Pacific Rim countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Pacific Rim countries, which includes
hard-hit South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, rose by 5.1 percent
in July and for the first seven months this year totals 87.8
billion dollars, a 42 percent above the imbalance for the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
This country's deficit with Japan narrowed slightly to 5.2
billion dollars in July but so far this year is still running 16
percent above the 1997 pact.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is in Tokyo this
week, pressing for further market-opening measures to narrow the
deficit in preparation for a meeting between President Bill
Clinton and new Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi in New York
next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The July overall trade deficit reflected a 1.3 percent drop in
U.S. exports to 75.4 billion dollars, the lowest level since
February 1997. U.S. imports were also down, but by a smaller 0.8
percent to 89.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The drop in exports reflected a 0.6 percent decline in sales of
farm products, which fell to 3.8 billion dollars in July and so
far this year are running 7.2 percent below the 1998 level.
</P>
<P>
Sales of American autos and auto parts dropped by 863 million
dollars in July while sales of telecommunications equipment were
down 166 million dollars and sales of computer products fell by
166 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. import decline was led by a 1.2 percent
drop in foreign oil, which fell to 4.07 billion dollars as the
average price per barrel of oil dipped to 10.71 dollars, the
lowest since August 1986.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the trade deficit in goods and services is
running at a record annual rate of 185 billion dollars, 68 percent
higher than last year's deficit of 110 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Tri-Nation Probe Fails to Determine Validity of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Releasing its long-awaited report Thursday, the South
African-led commission, appointed by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), said however it does have serious
concerns about apparent irregularities in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition parties claimed the May elections, which
saw the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) win 79 of 80
seats of parliament, were rigged.
</P>
<P>
"We are unable to state that the invalidity of the elections
has been conclusively established," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"We point out, however, that some of the apparent
irregularities and discrepancies are sufficiently serious
concerns.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot, however, postulate that the result does not
reflect the will of the Lesotho electorate."
</P>
<P>
The commission, which also included members from Zimbabwe and
Botswana, pointed out that the means for checking this had been
compromised and created much room for doubt.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member commission said that on its calculations, the
Basotho National Party (BNP), an opposition party, appeared to
have won two rather than only one in a total of 80
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
However, this related to a constituency the ballot papers of
which were not accessible to the commission.
</P>
<P>
The government of the tiny mountain kingdom was paralyzed
Wednesday as opposition parties' supporters forced civil servants
to leave their offices in an intensified protest against the
delay in releasing the report.
</P>
<P>
But later Wednesday, opposition parties said they would reject
the report whatever the findings might be.

BEIJING, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A painting and calligraphy
show to mark the centenary of the birth of late marshal Peng
Dehuai is being held at the Military Museum of the Chinese
People's Revolution in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The show consists of over 280 works from the mainland, Hong
Kong and Taiwan as well as Singapore and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Peng was born on October 24, 1898. He fought courageously
against the Japanese aggressors and the Nationalist-led army in
the civil war. He was wrongly punished for his outspoken criticism
of immature economic practices in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, a memorial hall on him as well as a bronze
statute was expected to be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
A pictorial book and some other books on the late marshal's
revolutionary deeds and personality will soon to be published, as
part of the memorial activities on the 100th anniversary of his
birth.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Wants Liberian Refugees to Leave by Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has warned all Liberian
refugees to leave the country by December 31 this year, or they
will lose their status, a report reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ghana Refugee Board said in Accra Wednesday that after the
deadline, all the refugees intending to stay will have to apply
for immigrant status.
</P>
<P>
Ebenezer Blavo, chairman of the board, was quoted as saying
that the new measure is introduced in view of the poor responses
of Liberian refugees to the voluntary repatriation exercise being
carried out by the Ghanaian government and the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in Liberia has returned to normal and
that all refugees are expected to accept repatriation.
</P>
<P>
"Those who wish to stay in Ghana will be interviewed and those
found to have genuine fears will be made to stay as refugees.
Those with nothing to fear will have to apply for immigrants
status," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Blavo also said that refugees who thought they could get visas
to travel to the U.S. or Europe if they remain as refugees should
discard that notion "because nothing of that sort exists".
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that about one million Liberians fled their
country during the 1989-1997 civil war. Thousands of them fled
into Ghana.

<HEADLINE> UK Calls for Reform of Global Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain, the current president
of the Group of Seven (G7) industrial countries, has called for
urgent reform of the international financial system which has been
found wanting in the current global crisis.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Byers, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, told a London
conference Thursday that British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordan Brown would make a number of proposals to reform the
existing international institutions.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that they (financial institutions) have been found
wanting and need changing. Britain will be taking the lead in
this," Byers said, "We have benefited from the accelerating
integration of the international economy. Now we must manage it
through more difficult times."
</P>
<P>
"I believe the essential answer to the problems of the moment
is not less globalization, not new national structures to separate
and isolate economies, but stronger international structures to
make globalization work in harder times as well as easy ones," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the urgent need is "closer
cooperation, continuing dialogue and an unwavering commitment to
open commerce." "We must not let temporary instability put global
progress at risk."
</P>
<P>
Byers noted that Chancellor Brown would be having extensive
discussions with the other G7 countries -- Canada, France,
Germany, Italy and the United States -- over the the next three
weeks on this issue.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Call for Lifting Sanctions on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Foreign
Ministerial Council Thursday expressed support to Libya's demand
for guarantees for a fair trial of the Lockerbie case and called
for suspending U.N. sanctions against Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Libya has rejected a new U.S.-British decision to accept the
trial in the Hague before Scottish judges without ensuring the
safety of the accused during transit and after the trial should
they be convicted.
</P>
<P>
The two were accused of blowing up an American plane in 1988
over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people. The
U.N. imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on the country in
1992 after it failed to hand over the two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
Top diplomats from the Arab League (AL)'s 22 member states made
their stance clear at the end of their two-day meeting in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions should be suspended immediately after (Libya)
reaching an agreement with the parties concerned on arrangements
and guarantees for putting the two Libyan suspects to trial before
the court," said a resolution issued by the council.
</P>
<P>
The council also recommended "the complete lifting of sanctions
against Libya immediately after the two suspects stand trial."
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League will act according to this basis," said the
resolution, without specifying what it will do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
However, in a draft resolution issued Wednesday, the council
toed a tougher line, saying that it is considering to bypass the
U.N. sanctions on Libya if its demand for a fair trial is not met.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposes stopping compliance with the sanctions
unless the "parties concerned" agree to negotiate with Libya on
these guarantees.
</P>
<P>
But in the resolution issued Thursday, the conferees expressed
the discontent of the Arab countries over the adverse impact the
international embargo has upon the Libyan people.
</P>
<P>
The council also condemned threats calling for tightening
sanctions imposed against Libya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council welcomed the decision adopted by Britain
and the United States on accepting the proposals, presented by the
AL and Libya on putting the two Libyan suspects to trial before a
neutral court. The two countries had insisted on having the trial
in either of them.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain, who had been demanding extradition of the
Libyans to either of them, insisted that their offer is
non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
This resolution, albeit a water-downed version of the draft, is
viewed by observers as an attempt by the 22-member Arab forum to
court back Libya.
</P>
<P>
Tripoli on Sunday decided to disband its Ministry of Arab Unity
in the coming few weeks, a move revealing its grudge against Arab
failure to have the U.N. sanctions against the Afro-Arab country
lifted.

JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A Jewish settler opened
fire Thursday at Palestinian students near the West Bank city of
Ramallah, killing one of them and injuring another, Jerusalem
Media and Communication Center (JMCC) reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred near Ein Areek-Beitounia intersection,

The 15-year-old Palestinian student, Iyad Rawhi Karabesh, was
killed and 16-year-old Issa Mahamoud Jabareen wounded, the JMCC

On hearing the news, Palestinian villagers at Ein Areek were
angered and went out of control, clashing with Israeli soldiers
and police.
</P>
<P>
More Israeli security forces were sent to the village in order
to maintain order and the Israeli side did not give the reason
behind the shooting, but said it was under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Promises Efforts to Defuse Iran-Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz on Thursday promised to make more efforts to defuse
the spiraling tensions between Iran and the Afghan Taliban
militia.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi, Aziz
voiced Pakistan's readiness to make efforts to return the bodies
of two other Iranian diplomats killed by the Taliban and release
other Iranians under the Taliban's captivity.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is serious to make efforts to release Iranians
arrested by the Taliban, and I hope we will see the result in
the coming days," the Pakistani minister was quoted by the
Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived here Thursday afternoon to deliver a message from
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, in an effort to prevent a possible military
confrontation between Iran and the Taliban after Tehran built up
tens of thousands of troops along Afghanistan's western border.
</P>
<P>
Iran's supreme leader and commander-in-chief Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Tuesday ordered the Iranian armed forces to be on
the alert and maintain full readiness for "speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior
political and security authorities deem necessary and right for
the country."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also expressed hope that Pakistan and the Taliban
would take immediate measures to return the bodies of two more
Iranian diplomats, release arrested Iranian nationals, and
identify, arrest and deliver those responsible for killing
Iranian diplomats for trial.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban on Monday delivered the bodies of six Iranian
diplomats and an IRNA reporter after admitting killing nine of
the 11 Iranians captured in Mazari Sharif, northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials are under heavy pressure to take military
actions to punish the criminals, Kharrazi said, adding that
there is a limit for Iranian officials to bear the pressure and
surely the practical steps taken by Pakistan and the Taliban
would help reduce the pressure and improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian Foreign Ministry believed that before
resorting to force, a chance should be given to political and
international efforts to persuade the Taliban to revise their
past behaviors and to stop massacres in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need to set up an international mechanism to
prevent further massacres in Bamyan, the center of the Afghan
Shiite Muslims conquered by the Taliban in recent days, and
other parts of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Hold International Meeting on Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, will convene an international
meeting on Afghanistan at the ministerial level here on Monday
next week, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Invited to attend the so-called "six plus two meeting" are
foreign ministers from six of Afghanistan's neighbors, namely
China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzebekstan, plus
Russia and the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came one day after the United Nations had
agreed to send a humanitarian assessment panel to Bamiyan, an
Afghan province which fell to the militant Taliban faction last
week, on condition that the Taliban guarantee the security of the
U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting, which is being held on the sidelines of
the United Nations General Assembly, will focus on crisis
embroiling Iran and the Taliban that has threatened to flare
into war.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began with the recent killings of at least eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Taliban forces, which
control most of Afghanistan, during an attack on the Iranian
consultants in the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The proposed talks are also seen as an opportunity of the
highest-level diplomatic contact in nearly 20 years between Iran
and the United States, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Demilitarization Only Way to Cancel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The only way to cancel the
deployment of Cypriot government purchased Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missile system is demilitarization of the island,
government spokesman Christos Stylianides said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while commenting on statements by Turkish
Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan that "the only point
that would be meaningful for Turkey is the complete scrapping of
the missile order."
</P>
<P>
Stylianides told reporters that "the reply is simple. President
Glafcos Clerides has made a proposal for demilitarization of
Cyprus, and U.N. resolutions urge toward this direction."
</P>
<P>
He said that "if Turkey wishes to see the postponement of the
deployment of new armaments, this the only way."
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept anyone dictating to us our defense planning,
especially Turkey which is the only party responsible for tension
in the region and the only party creating problems in efforts for
a dialog aiming at the reduction of armaments on the island," the
spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides also pointed out that the Cyprus problem is
exclusively an international political problem and not a problem
of missiles.
</P>
<P>
"The answer to those who wish for disengagement from military
plans is demilitarization and it is on the table," he said,
adding that "what we are waiting for is the Turkish negotiator."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman called upon the international community to
realize that Turkey refuses to participate in such a dialog,
which he said is "the only reasonable and peaceful dialog."
</P>
<P>
Tensions have risen on the island ever since the Cypriot
government announced in January last year that it would deploy the
Russian missiles.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the missiles, originally scheduled for August,
has been delayed until the end of this year due to international
pressure on the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey continues to threaten that it will strike the
missiles if and when they reach Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot administration has insisted that the missile deal
can be canceled only if there is progress in the peace process
or a move toward demilitarization of the island.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Thursday reassured the European Union that Russia
would stay on the course of reform and do everything possible to
restore investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Primakov and a senior EU delegation focused
on Russia-EU relations from the perspective of supporting Russia's
restoration of social and economic stability and continuation of
reforms, the Interfax reported, quoting the Russian government
information board.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation included Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schussel, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and British Deputy
Foreign Secretary Joyce Quin, the so-called troika, and Hans van
den Broek, a member of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Primakov welcomed the EU officials, saying the visit itself was
a show of support for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The EU accounts for 40 percent of investments in Russia and 30
percent of Russia's overall foreign trade turnover.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov also were present at the talks.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Shokhin told reporters that Russia was ready
to correct the previous government's decision of August 17 to
impose a restriction on redemption of short-term treasury bonds
held by Western banks.
</P>
<P>
He said Primakov had given him the power to make such a
statement, adding that the measure was necessary for restoration
of Western investors' confidence in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The method Russia used in mid-August to try to solve its
financial problems does not conform to international practice,"
Shokhin said.
</P>
<P>
"However,, a return to the situation as it was before August 17
will not be on the agenda," he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation also held talks with Gennady Seleznyov,
speaker of the State Duma, or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said control of the use of foreign loans, including
by the lenders themselves, was crucial.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Iran in Dilemma to Revenge on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The call and support for a military revenge on the
Taliban are growing throughout the country after the paramount
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday ordered the armed
forces to be on high alert.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei called on officials of the country, including the
armed forces, to maintain full readiness for "speedy, timely and
decisive implementation of whatever decisions the senior
political and security authorities deem necessary and right for
the country."
</P>
<P>
"Blood must atone for blood" has become a common sense here as
the whole nation is angered by and can not tolerate the Taliban
massacre of eight Iranian diplomats and a correspondent of the
official news agency IRNA on August 8 in Mazari Sharif, northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces, including the army, the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC), the security and Basij (volunteer) forces,
have announced their readiness to carry out Khamenei's order
anywhere and in any conditions.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC and the Iranian army have deployed over 200,000 troops
along the 850-kilometer border with Afghanistan as tension has
been escalating between Iran and the Afghan Taliban which has
seized most parts of country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian troops has been flexing muscle these days by
launching military manoeuvers along the border and the army is
scheduled to launch another war game in the area, the biggest
after the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, later this month, apparently
getting ready for a showdown with the Afghan Taliban. The Taliban
authorities have denied any direct involvement in the killing and
flatly refused to hand over those culprits to the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
A war of some kind or a military strike seems unavoidable and
imminent, but how? Observers and diplomatic circles here believe
a limited military action against the Afghan new rulers might be
the option if no way out for the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
However, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi stressed on Wednesday
that "before taking military actions against the Taliban, a
chance should be given to political and peaceful approaches in
order to protect the country's national interests."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's remark was a clear signal that the government of
President Mohammad Khatami did not hope to be militarily
involved in Afghanistan in view of the bitter experience of
former Soviet Union in Afghanistan and nightmares of the
Iran-Iraq war in 1980-88.

<HEADLINE> The Sky Is Shrinking, Scientists Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found that the
sky has shrunk by eight kilometers in the last 40 years, British
newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge
believed that the contraction is probably a result of the
greenhouse effect, the Daily Telegraph said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The new study, which probed 40 years of data gathered at the
Antarctic peninsula and the Falkland Islands, reveals for the
first time that the shrinkage is global, Dr Jarvis, one of the
researchers, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The scientists made the discovery when they analyzed records of
40-year-old experiment to bounce radio waves off the ionosphere,
the electrically charged part of the upper atmosphere composed
mainly of ionised gases.
</P>
<P>
The radio waves have been taking less times to return than they
did in 1958, which scientists said could only be explained by a
fall in the ionosphere's height.
</P>
<P>
The effect is believed to be the carbon dioxide build-up. When
carbon dioxide accumulates in the upper atmosphere, the gas causes
the atmosphere to cool, resulting in a drop in barometric pressure
and the shrinkage of the ionosphere.
</P>
<P>
Although the drop in altitude is not in itself harmful to
people, "it is, however, another warning signal about what changes
to the atmosphere can be caused by human impact." Dr Jarvis said.

...the Iran-Iraq war in 1980-88.
</P>
<P>
Military involvement in Afghanistan might be responded
negatively by the international community and would contradict
with the policy of detente advocated by Khatami's government
since it came to power in August last year.
</P>
<P>
The world has shown its sympathy with Iran and condemned the
killing of its diplomats and reporter by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi noted that the intensive diplomatic efforts by the
foreign ministry have resulted in international pressures exerted
on the Taliban to stop massacre in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also extended a olive branch to Iran by returning
bodies of the dead Iranian diplomats and reporter and announcing
its readiness to talk with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, the main supporter of the Taliban, also expressed
hope that Iran and the Taliban would "take steps to defuse
the present tension and pursue a path to restraint, mutual
understanding, reconciliation and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, the Iranian leaders have promised the nation to take
revenge on the Taliban, and the nation is waiting to see how the
government would act.
</P>
<P>
Iran has so far exercised restraint, but its patience has
limits, Kharrazi said, expressing hope that the Taliban would
not lose the chance which would pass like a cloud.
</P>
<P>
Iran reserves the right to take any means to protect the
country's national interests, senior Iranian officials repeatedly
announced.
</P>
<P>
Iran's top policy-making body, the Supreme National Security
Council, is following the development in Afghanistan and will
make decision on how to deal with the Taliban. Even if Iran is
forced to invade Afghanistan and teach Taliban an unforgettable
lesson, it can not settle their scores once for all as their
dispute is deep rooted in religion and geopolitics.

MOSCOW, September 17 (Xinhua) -- As a devalued ruble forces
prices up daily, and sometimes hourly, the Russians will have to

MOSCOW, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto said here Thursday that Tokyo will continue to
support Russian reforms without setting conditions or interfering

</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, now senior foreign affairs advisor to the current

<P>
Hashimoto also reiterated the intention for the two countries

<P>
LUSAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
owed the public service pension board 46 billion Kwacha (about 23
million U.S. Dollars) in unremitted dues, hampering the borad's
move to invest members' contributions, board officials said.
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Donald Chanda and Secretary Offman Gondwe were
qu by Times of Zambia Thursday as saying that the board wants
to invest its members' contributions in business but could not
start because of the huge debt the government owed them.
</P>
<P>
Chanda, who is also Zambian President Frederick Chiluba's
economic adviser, said Wednesday, "we want to recreate the whole
institutions in terms of operations. We want to invest the
contributions in meaningful investment to provide growth. We want
the board to stand on its own and pay beneficiaries immediately."
</P>
<P>
Gondwe said since the new board and management took office in
June this year, a total of 4.4 billion Kwacha (about 2.2 million
Dollars) has been paid to 1,429 pensioners.
</P>
<P>
He said of the 43,000 pensioners on the waiting list, 1,580
have already been earmarked for payment as soon as the country's
ministry of finance released the money.
</P>
<P>
Gondwe said the board is also holding discussions with the
National Credit and Savings Bank and Zambia Postal Services on
the opening of new pay points in provinces and districts to make
it easier to get their money.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua)-- A Jewish settler opened
fire Thursday at Palestinian students near West Bank city of
Ramallah, causing outranges among the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The settler opened fire at a group of Palestinian students
near Ein Areek-Beitounia Intersection, south west of Rammalah, a
Palestinian self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Palestinian student Iyad Rawhi Karabesh was
killed by the fire and 16-year-old Issa Mahamoud Jabareen was
injured in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Outraged Palestinian villagers at Ein Areek clashed with
Israeli soldiers and police in protest against the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) criticized strongly
about the shooting and held the Israeli government fully
responsible for the incident, the Voice of Palestine (VOP) said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdel Rahman, Secretary General of the PNA cabinet,
criticized the Israeli government's decision to arm the settlers
and said the shooting showed the real murderousness of the
settlers.
</P>
<P>
VOP quoted Karabesh's mother as saying that the settler
began shooting at the students at random.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said they are investigating the incident and
could not give the reason behind the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Katabesh was buried Thursday afternoon by his family while
the condition of the injured Jabareen was stable after being
treated at hospital.
</P>
<P>
Mutual distrust and hatred have been mounting between the
Palestinians and Israelis as no breakthrough in the Mideast peace
process has been achieved for a long period.
</P>
<P>
On August 20, Jewish settler Rabbi Shlomo Ra'anan was stabbed
to death at his home in Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Secession Labeled as "Misdirected" by Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
described an opposition party's call for the secession of Western
Province as "misdirected and unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
Government-owned Times of Zambia Thursday quoted chief
government spokesman David Mpamba as saying in an interview in
Lusaka Wednesday that secession would not solve Zambia's economic
and political problems.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba, also Information and Broadcasting Minister, stressed
that Zambia had been a unitary state for nearly 34 years and to
call for a breakdown into tribal enclaves would not help.
</P>
<P>
Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika, president of Agenda for
Zambia (AZ) and member of Barotse Royal Establishment, said
Monday his party would consider facilitating a referendum on
former Barotseland's status because his tribesmen there had been
marginalized under tte central government.
</P>
<P>
"If tribalism is the problem, let us address ourselves to that
problem rather than destroy our country," said Mpamba.
</P>
<P>
He called on young Zambians who knew no tribal boundaries to
discard tribal sentiments and unite to build one strong Zambia
without taking people like Mbikusita-Lweanika seriously.
</P>
<P>
Western Province Minister Michael Mabenga also said Wednesday
that it was unfair for the AZ leader to guess all the people in
his province wanted to break away from Zambia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has asked the two
groups set up to resolve the political crisis in Guinea Bissau to
implement their peace plan in the country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Thursday quoted Nigerian
Foreign Minister Ignatius Olisemeka as saying in capital Abuja
that the parameters should include a time-table for negotiations
and the establishment of an observer group.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at the opening of the meeting of foreign
ministers of the groups Wednesday that the peace plan should
indicate the composition and placement of the interposition of
troops between those loyal to President Joao Vieira and rebel
leader Gen. Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two groups, the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Committee of Seven and the contact group
of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPSC), to
examine the various recommendations of their chiefs of staff and
military experts who had met earlier.
</P>
<P>
Olisemeka assured the meeting that Nigeria would continue to
work together with its partners in the search for " lasting peace
for Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigerian Head of State Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar,
ECOWAS Chairman, had expressed the hope that the on-going
deliberations would result in concrete and firm guidelines which
would provide the path for the early restoration of peace and
security to Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, Gambia, Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria and
Senegal are members of the ECOWAS Committee of Seven while
Angola, Brazil, Cape Ver'e, Portugal and Sao Tome and Principle
constitute the contact group of the CPSC.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Arab Countries to Support Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Thursday urges
Arab countries to extend support to Sudan in its struggle against
the worst floods in centuries and renewed U.S. threats of attacks.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the League Secretariat called upon Arab
countries to render aid to Sudan to help it sidestep the impact of
the floods and torrential rains that hit most parts of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The floods, which swept 10 provinces in central, northern
and eastern parts of Sudan, has inundated 119,000 houses and left
204,000 families homeless.
</P>
<P>
The league expressed hope that the Arab countries would help
alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people who are affected by
the floods.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the 22-member Arab forum Thursday
called upon its member states to rally around Sudan in face of the
U.S. threats to launch new military attacks against it.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministerial Council, in its resolution issued at
the end of its two-day meeting, said the U.S. bombing attacks
against Sudan last month "trampled on Sudan's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, violated the international laws and the
U.N. Charter."
</P>
<P>
"We support Sudan's struggle against threats to its
sovereignty, territory and national unity and its appeals to
various organizations to rule out military means as a way out to
solving problems," it added.
</P>
<P>
The resolution condemned various kinds of terrorism, whether
from "a state, a group or individuals" and called for positive
political dialog to resolve dispute.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bombardment on a chemical plant near Khartoum on
August 20 has left a number of civilians dead and flattened a
facility providing the country with 50 percent of its needs of
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched the attacks in what it claimed retaliation
for the twin bombings against its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
on August 7. It has accused Sudan of sponsoring international
terrorism and claimed the factory was manufacturing chemical
weapons agents that could be used by Islamic militants to launch
new attacks against U.S. targets.

ADDIS ABABA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Information and Culture Woldemichael Chemu Thursday urged African
countries to preserve properly their cultural and historical
heritages.
</P>
<P>
Opening a meeting here attended by curators from 13 African
countries, the Ethiopian minister said the cultural and

<HEADLINE> Britain Pushing for Moratorium of Military Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain is pushing for a
possible agreement on a moratorium of Greek and Turkish military
flights over Cyprus, a senior British official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides, Peter Rickets, senior official at the British Foreign
Office dealing with the Cyprus problem, told reporters that "what
we're doing is working up the practical arrangements that would
make a moratorium possible. That's the focus of our efforts at the
moment."
</P>
<P>
Rickets confirmed that British Defense Secretary George
Robertson had discussed this issue with his Greek and Turkish
counterparts during his visit to Athens and Ankara this week,
saying his country "will continue to press for the moratorium."
</P>
<P>
However, he refrained from saying whether the moratorium
would be internationally guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Rickets also met with Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, and he is scheduled to meet with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the Turkish-controlled
northern part of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
"We are working particularly with the American government and
in Cyprus, Athens and Ankara to reach an agreement on the
practical content of an overflight moratorium, that's where
Britain can play a particular part," Rickets said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for a moratorium of Greek and Turkish military
flights over Cyprus was put forward by the U.S. last year. The
Cypriot government, backed by Athens, however, insisted that a
no-fly zone over Cyprus should be guaranteed by international
powers.
</P>
<P>
Rickets noted that his country "remains very active in the
search for a peaceful settlement in Cyprus under the U.N. process."
</P>
<P>
"My visit here is part of that continuing efforts," he said,
adding that he had a detailed discussion with Clerides "about ways
with which we can push forward the U.N. process in Cyprus, and
Britain will continue to work actively to that end."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern one third of the island in the
wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks hit snag last summer when
Denktash walked out of a direct talks between the two community
leaders in Switzerland to protest against a European Union
decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has recently proposed a confederation of the two
communities as a basis for resumption of peace talks, but the
proposal has been rejected by the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Greece and Turkey were the guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 Treaty of Establishment of the
Republic of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> WB Ready for New Partnership With Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A top World Bank official
said Thursday that the bank is ready to form a new partnership
with Nigeria, as the most populous African country is beginning a
new political and(economic transition period.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here at the end of his five-day
visit to Nigeria, the bank's Vice-President for Africa,
Jean-Lousis Sarbid said he was "encouraged by recent development"
in Nigeria under the new leadership of General Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria has recently entered a period of transition in both
the political and economic realms," he said. "This has rekindled
hope, and the World Bank is ready to help Nigeria pursue that
hope."
</P>
<P>
Sarbib's visit is the first by a high-level World Bank
official to Nigeria in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nigeria and the World Bank has been frosty
since 1993 under the leadership of late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
From September 13 to 17, Sarbid met with Nigerian leader
Abubakar and top government officials, including the ministers of
Finance, Planning, Education, Health and Agriculture, and the
governor of the central Bank.
</P>
<P>
He also met with representatives of the private sector and
non-government organizations and visited primary schools and
health facilities.
</P>
<P>
Sarbid noted that Nigeria holds vast potential to become an
economic giant in Africa by virtue of its size, human talents,
rich resources endowment and economic capacity.
</P>
<P>
However, he regretted that "Nigeria has yet to live up to this
potential. Poor economic management, poor governance, corruption
and political instability have gotten in the way of development,
allowing poverty to spread in the midst of great affluence for a
privileged few."
</P>
<P>
Sarbid commended the recent political development in Nigeria
under General Abubakar, adding that "matching this with economic
momentum would help put the country on the road to economic
revival."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official identified economic management,
poverty, education, agriculture, health as well as the serious
world economic situation as major challenges facing the Nigerian
economy.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the bank is ready to enter into new partnership
with Nigeria, Sarbib said officials from Nigeria and the bank
will meet soon in Washington during the World Bank's annual
meeting to pick up specific priorities in which the bank might
provide assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-president, the World Bank has provided a
total of seven billion U.S. Dollars in fund commitment to
projects in Nigeria since 1958.
</P>
<P>
The bank currently has 13 projects in Nigeria in the fields of
agriculture, water, urban development, education, population,
health and roads, with a total fund commitment of about one
billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank, however, has provided no new loans to Nigeria since
1993, when relations between the two sides got sour.
</P>
<P>
Sarbid confirmed that some projects have been canceled by the
bank because of delay in implementation.
</P>
<P>
The bank would not let the fund lie there idle for as many as
seven years when there is a great demand in other African
countries, he explained.

<HEADLINE> More Ethiopians Escape from Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 38 Ethiopians
arrived in Djibouti Sunday and Monday from Eritrea, a government
spokeswoman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Selome Taddesse said in a statement that 17 of them arrived in
Djibouti by boat after escaping from Assab in south Eritrea,
while 21 of them traveled by car or on foot.
</P>
<P>
Taddesse quoted the escapees as saying that it took up to 10
days for them to reach Djibouti, and some of them had failed to
make it through the desert and have probably died there.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokeswoman, these escapees are traders,
skilled and semi-skilled laborers and drivers and they had lived
in Eritrea between three and 21 years.
</P>
<P>
The official says, "without exception they all had previously
been arrested, beaten and all had their property confiscated."
</P>
<P>
Over 15,000 Ethiopians have been expelled from Eritrea since a
border conflict between the two countries erupted in May, this
year. However, Eritrea says up to 17,000 of its nationals have
been expelled from Ethiopia since the border dispute. But the
Ethiopian government says those "deported for security reasons"
were only around 4,000.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ruble Crashes Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian ruble continued
sliding Thursday, and the Central Bank said it would print money
to pay off state debts and bail out banks.
</P>
<P>
The ruble, which lost some 30 percent of its value on the
streets of Moscow Wednesday, dropped to 15.80 to the dollar on the
SELT electronic trading system of the Moscow Interbank Currency
Exchange (MICEX), down from Wednesday's official rate 12.4509 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
A dollar was worth 6.5 rubles a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Andrei Kozlov, first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, told
a press conference that some money must be printed if GKO T-bills,
or government debts, are to be bought back.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank plans to carry out a transaction
Friday aimed at settlement of interbank payments in Moscow, the
greater Moscow Region, St. Petersburg, Samara Region, and
Sverdlovsk region, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kozlov said some money from the Mandatory Reserve Fund may be
used for the settlement, adding that the central bank, to
replenish the fund, will suggest the banks to sell their packages
of GKO and OFZ securities maturing before December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The amount of rubles to be printed will be exactly equal to the
amount the banks need to pay their payments, Kozlov said.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we will inject money into the system. The amount needed
cannot be determined and the percentage will be announced tomorrow
when the records are available," he said.

a bid to increase his country's market in Lebanon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sudan Floods Get Worse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The flooding Nile has
devastated Sudan's Northern State for more than 1,000 kilometers,
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies (IFRC) said in a statement issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"These floods are being reported as the worst since 1988 but
in many places the water is already much higher than then. These
could be the worst in living memory," Omer Osman Mahmoud, chief
of the Sudanese Red Crescent, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The flood "has engulfed villages on either bank, inundated
farmland, and left most of the rural population homeless," a
Sudanese Red Crescent field team flying over the deluge reported.
</P>
<P>
"All populated areas (were) under water and only mountainside
homes surviving," the IFRC statement quoted a team report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"In southeastern Marawi Province, no village has escaped on
the the southern bank, and few are still intact on the northern
one," it said.
</P>
<P>
In Dongola Province, much of the land lies lower than the
river and protective dikes have been washed away or are in danger
from the rising water, the IFRC statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international agency appealed to the
international community for three million Swiss Francs (about
2.13 million U.S. Dollars) to support its relief projects in
flood-hit and war-torn Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army has re-started fighting
with the Moslem-led Khartoum government since 1983 for more
autonomy and religion freedom in the animist and
Christian-dominated south.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan had announced his intention to collect the suggestions
of staff on how to improve the work of the United Nations, U.N.
Spokesman's office said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of finding better ways of conducting our work is
continuous, " Annan wrote a letter which was sent to the U.N.
staff on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"All of you are well placed to make innovative suggestions for
improving our day-to-day work," he noted, inviting staff to submit
proposals of "big or small" to an Ideas Data Bank, which will be
coordinated by the Management Policy Office in the Department of
Management.
</P>
<P>
"This means that each of you, irrespective of where you work or
what your position may be, can have a real say in how the
Organization can be made to function better," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief reviewed the major accomplishments of his reform
effort, which he said was off to "an excellent start". Among those
was the establishment of the Senior Management Group, or Cabinet,
which brings together top United Nations officials for weekly
meetings on policy coordination.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he cited the importance of the new executive
committees established to cover the areas of peace and security,
development cooperation, international economic and social affairs
and humanitarian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed the hope that his remaining reform proposals
would soon be approved by the General Assembly. "Once these
largely administrative and managerial changes are behind us, we
can turn next to focus on our substantive work, and on defining
clearly the roles the United Nations can and should play as the
world enters the new century."
</P>
<P>
The 2000 General Assembly, designated as the millennium
Assembly, would offer an opportunity to examine how the United
Nations can meet its future challenges, Annan said.

social and economic impact of globalization here.
</P>

"Multilateral cooperation, the existence of well-functioning
global rules, and a level playing field that protects the weak
against the strong, are necessary preconditions for spreading
benefits and reducing risks", she said.
</P>
<P>
The overcoming of the Asian economic crisis will depend on
actions taken by the world's leading economic powers which "cannot
afford to ignore what is happening in developing countries", she
stressed.
</P>
<P>
She said: "Even the largest economies today are increasingly
influenced by events in the poorest parts of the world. Causality
runs in both directions. And so self-interest on both sides calls
for cooperative responses to the threats which now confront us
all.
</P>
<P>
"At this juncture, the most urgent tasks are:
</P>
<P>
-- to restore market confidence,
</P>
<P>
-- to stabilize financial markets,
</P>
<P>
-- to support growth,
</P>
<P>

they require,
</P>
<P>
-- and to provide immediate protection for the most
vulnerable."

<HEADLINE> Turkey, India Vow to Enhance Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Turkey and
India Suleyman Demirel and K.R. Narayanan vowed here on Thursday
to develop bilateral ties in an all-round way, according to local
TV reports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after a meeting with his
Indian counterpart, Demirel said that there is no major problems
between Turkey and India and the bilateral ties have proceeded
smoothly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Calling India a close ally of Turkey, Demirel said that there
is great potential for the two countries to enhance bilateral
ties, particularly in economic areas.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Narayanan, who arrived Wednesday for a five-day
visit to Turkey, said that his country has always attached great
importance to its ties with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"In Turkey I really feel at home," said Narayanan, who served
as the Indian ambassador to Ankara during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Demirel, however, also made complaint over the nuclear race
between India and its rival Pakistan, saying that the contest
would cause the southern Asia more unstable.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is against the proliferation of nuclear weapons," the
Turkish president said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Indian-Pakistan confrontation in Kashmir,
Demirel called on the two countries to solve the problem in a
peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
"We wish that the problem would be solved in a way acceptable
to both sides and in accordance with the principles of
international legitimacy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Indian officials signed four agreements on mutual
protection and promotion of investments, cooperation against
drug-smuggling, improvement of exports, exchanges of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Demirel said that the
current bilateral trade volume of 360 million U.S. dollars does
not reflect the real potentialities of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Solar Spacecraft SOHO Re-points to The Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- After weeks of recovery
efforts, the SOHO solar spacecraft is once again pointing at the
Sun, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
SOHO obeyed commands that turned its face fully towards the Sun
on 16 September, a landmark day which was a culmination of complex
procedures that finally brought back the spacecraft under control.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time since 25 June, when SOHO spun out of
control and communication was lost, it points the right way." the
ESA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big step forward in our recovery plan for SOHO," says
ESA's Francis Vandenbussche, head of the SOHO recovery team.
</P>
<P>
"We were never quite sure that we would manage to make the
spacecraft point back towards the Sun, which is essential for its
proper operation."
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that the next step will be a comprehensive
check of all the spacecraft's systems and scientific instruments,
which in some cases have been through an ordeal of heat or cold,
with temperatures approaching plus or minus 100 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Dr Bernhard Fleck, ESA's project scientist for SOHO, said he
is "cautiously optimistic that SOHO can win back much of its
scientific capacity for observing the Sun."
</P>
<P>
SOHO, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, operates at a
special vantage point 1.5 million kilometers out in space, on the
sunward side of the Earth. It is a joint project of ESA and U.S.
space agency NASA.
</P>
<P>
After its launch on 2 December 1995, SOHO worked a revolution
in solar science by its special ability observe simultaneously the
interior and atmosphere of the Sun, and particles in the solar
wind and the heliosphere.
</P>
<P>
Apart from amazing discoveries about flows of gas inside the
Sun, giant "tornadoes" of hot, electrically charged gas, and
clashing magnetic field-lines, SOHO also proved its worth as the
chief watchdog for the Sun, giving early warning of eruptions that
could affect the Earth.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, SOHO's scientists celebrated two years of
successful operations, and the decision of ESA and NASA to extend
the mission to 2003.
</P>
<P>
The extension would enable SOHO to observe intense solar
activity, expected when the count of sunspots rises to a maximum
around the year 2000. It would remain the flagship of a
multinational fleet of solar spacecrafts.

<HEADLINE> Jrodan, PNA Accuse Israeli Monopoly of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian and Palestinian
government officials here Thursday accused Israel of trying to
keep monopoly over the Palestinian markets by blocking others from
conducting trade exchanges with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Obstructing implementation of the economic and trade agreements
between Palestine and Jordan is one of the ways Israel is
attempting to monopoly over the Palestinian markets, Chairman of
the Jordanian Trade Chamber Federation Haider Murad said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli obstruction keeps the volume of
Jordanian-Palestinian trade exchanges far less than expected, said
Murad at the 1998 Jordanian-Palestinian economic and trade talks
which were opened earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, the
Jordanian-Palestinian trade exchanges only reached 10 million
Jordanian dinars (about 14 million U.S. dollars), according to
Murad.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1997, only 23 million dinars (32 million dollars)
worth of Palestinian-made products were exported to Jordan and
12 million dinars (about 17 million dollars) worth of
Jordanian-made goods to the Palestinian self-rule areas, Murad
added.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Palestinian delegation Khaled Salameh echoed
Murad's view, adding that by maintaining such a monopoly, Israel
intends to strangle the Palestinian economy and make the
Palestinians wholly dependent on Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians' annual purchases from Israel are worth 2.7
billion dollars to 4 billion dollars and account for almost
95 percent of their total imports, which is an extremely
abnormal phenomenon, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are coerced to import from Israel, while
the list of goods that they are allowed to buy from other
countries like Egypt and Jordan is very limited in kinds
and quantities, Khaled added.
</P>
<P>
Even as the list is limited, Israeli soldiers usually block
most of the commodities that the Palestinians import from other
countries at the the border crossings of the Palestinian
self-rule areas, according to Khaled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jordanian and Palestinian participants of the
talks unanimously called for collective efforts to confront the
Israeli measures designed to dominate the Palestinian markets.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that this can be done through unifying both
sides' economic laws and regulations and establishing new means
for trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Khaled proposed that it will be helpful in this regard if
both sides set up a Jordanian-Palestinian land transportation
company and other joint ventures.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Jaoquim
Chissano and Namibian President Sam Nujoma Thursday expressed
grave concerns over the deterioration of the situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique here the two leaders held Jonas Savimbi,
Chairman of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) responsible for the current situation in Angola, since
"he has chosen war as a means to seize power in the country."
</P>
<P>
The communique, issued after Nujoma's three-day visit to
Mozambique, said they fully support the Renovation Committee, a
new group formed by officials from UNITA, recognizing it as the
only partner for future peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents said they have done so to seek for fair and
just solutions to the peace process and democracy in Angola.
</P>
<P>
On the Congo (K) crisis the two leaders said this issue should
be settled through negotiations and that the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of Congo should
be respected.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed their support for the resolutions reached at
the peace summit at Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe on September 9, and
at the summit of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) held in Mauritius on September 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
Chissano and Nujoma also expressed their wish to strengthen
bilateral trade ties and convene the mixed commission on
cooperation of the two couztries as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chissano premised to pay a visit to Namibia as a return for
Nujoma's visit, his first to Mozambique since he became the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Russia Against Hyperinflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- There may be
hyperinflation in Russia if it fails to control spending and to
reform its banking and financial systems, a senior U.S. official
warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The warning was made by Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers in his remarks to the House International Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"They must resist pressures to spend and lend which will doom
the economy to another bout of high, perhaps hyperinflation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Just as important, they need to take on the failings of the
financial system and finally put in place the core institutions
and policies of a private market economy," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
He said the steps Russia has taken so far to devalue and
restructure its debt are "drastic measures" that need explaining.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's authorities urgently need to clarify those steps and
begin a cooperative dialogue with official and commercial
creditors," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is difficult to shape an international effort to
help Russia through its current financial crisis because it is
unclear which direction Russian authorities are taking.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has pledged its support for Russia on the condition
that the new Russian government will continue a reform path, but
any cash aid will be made through international financial
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Census Director-Nominee Urges Quick Decision on Sampling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenneth Prewitt, the
administration's census director nominee, on Thursday told the
U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that it was crucial
that the issue of statistical sampling be settled soon.
</P>
<P>
Senators had told Prewitt, head of the Social Science Research
Council in New York, that he will face strong political pressures
regardless of how the Supreme Court rules on a disputed counting
method for the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
Prewitt said that if the Supreme Court does not rule before
March 1 of next year -- 13 months before Census 2000 -- he would
"have to convene some sort of emergency meeting" with Congress to
decide how to conduct the census.
</P>
<P>
A three-judge federal panel last month invalidated the Census
Bureau's plans to use sampling. The administration has challenged
that decision, and the Supreme Court is likely to hand down a
final ruling by next spring.
</P>
<P>
"You are going to get pressures from all sides," said Senator
Fred Thompson, a Republican and chairman of the committee. "Let me
urge you not to become too good a politician."
</P>
<P>
The ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator John Glenn,
stressed that Prewitt would have to move quickly to get more money
from Congress if the Supreme Court says sampling is
unconstitutional, "or this thing will be a big flop."
</P>
<P>
Prewitt agrees with the Census Bureau that the proper use of
sampling -- the statistical estimation of hard-to-find people _
would improve the accuracy of the count and cut the costs of the
decennial census. The 1990 census missed an estimated four million
people.
</P>
<P>
But sampling is strongly opposed by Republicans, who say the
Constitution requires every person to be counted. Census results
are used to reapportion seats in the House of Representatives and
to determine distribution of federal funds, and sampling could
raise population figures in previously undercounted urban and
minority areas that traditionally support the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Prewitt said the 350,000 people and the four billion dollar
budget needed to conduct the 2000 census would have to be
significantly increased if sampling is disallowed.
</P>
<P>
"At present the bureau is proceeding with a two-track strategy,
with and without sampling, and the sooner this key issue is
resolved, the better," Prewitt said in a written reply to
questions from the committee.
</P>
<P>
The House's census subcommittee on Thursday heard testimony
from experts who said sampling would add to the complexity of the
census without reducing the level of errors.
</P>
<P>
But it also heard from the Bush Administration Census Bureau
director, Barbara Everitt Bryant, who said sampling was needed to
improve upon the accuracy of the 1990 census. She said the
prohibition imposed by the federal court, if not overturned by the
Supreme Court, "virtually guarantees undercount in the upcoming
census."

WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will meet with Iran's foreign minister Kamal
Kharazi next week in New York, focusing on tensions between
Afghanistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the highest-level U.S. contact with Iran since the
1979 takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran, is part of an
eight-nation effort designed to head off a conflict between Iran
and Afghanistan's ruling Taliban regime.
</P>
<P>
"We obviously are concerned about what is going on between the
Taliban and Iran," Albright said Thursday in response to a
question after a luncheon speech to the Carnegie Endowment for
Peace.
</P>
<P>
Albright also reaffirmed the Clinton administration's interest
in improving relations with Tehran if it changes some of its
policies and halts what the United States says is support of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
She said she was very eager to see what Kharazi has to say in a
speech next Friday to the Asia Society in New York.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to be listening to see if there are any actions,"
Albright said, referring to new approaches by the Iranian
government that might fit the U.S. prescription for moderation.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is setting up the conference
on Afghanistan. Albright plans to attend, and she said Kharazi had
decided to be there as well.
</P>
<P>
Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, China,
the U.S. and Russia will attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Iran and Afghanistan have escalated after the

<HEADLINE> Pakistani FM Delivers Sharif's Message to Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz on Thursday delivered a written message from Pakistan's
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Iran's First Vice President Hassan
Habibi.
</P>
<P>
The message was scheduled to be delivered to Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami. The change was seen as a signal of Tehran's
anger over Islamabad's support for the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Aziz arrived here Thursday afternoon to deliver the message in
order to avoid possible tensions between Pakistan and Iran, after
Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Islamabad
of helping the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Aziz assured
Habibi in the meeting that the Pakistani government would make
efforts to speed up the delivery of the bodies of two remaining
Iranian diplomats killed by the Taliban and the release of other
Iranian nationals captured by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran occupies a special position in Pakistan's
foreign policy and Islamabad is ready to expand and promote
relations with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the killings of eight Iranian diplomats and an IRNA
reporter by the Taliban, Aziz called for trial and punishment on
those responsible for the killing.
</P>
<P>
Habibi said that the Taliban's crimes against Iranian
diplomats and other Iranian nationals, as well as massacre of
Afghan Muslim people were actions against humanity and Islam.
</P>
<P>
He expressed dissatisfaction with Islamabad's support for the
Taliban and called on the Pakistani government to use its
influence on the Taliban to stop the killings of Afghan people,
to release the captured Iranian citizens and return the bodies of
remaining Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Habibi also stressed that the Taliban should make apology to
Iran and punish those responsible for the killing of the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban on Monday delivered the bodies of six Iranian
diplomats and a reporter after admitting killing nine of
the 11 Iranians captured in Mazari Sharif, northern Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Cabinet Will Not Step Down: Vice PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy will not step down or call for new
elections as there was no elections fraud as alleged by the
opposition, Deputy Prime Minister Kalebone Maope said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Maope as saYjng South
African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi had
suggested that a meeting of all the parties in Lesotho should
take place on Sunday to discuss the way forward.
</P>
<P>
"We have all been asked (by Mufamadi) not to comment on this
until we have some discussion, so I'm surprised the opposition is
calling for us to step down."
</P>
<P>
Referring to a call that the Lesotho government should step
down so that fresh elections could be held, Maope said: "There is
no need for that."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, about 5,000 people gathered outside the
gates of King Letsie III's palace in capital Maseru, while being
briefed by leaders of Lesotho opposition parties on the contents
of the long-waited investigation report into alleged
irregularities in Lesotho's May general elections.
</P>
<P>
The crowd was told that a probe commission, which consists of
officials from South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, had found
irregularities and discrepancies in the way Lesotho's independent
electoral commission had managed the May 23 general election.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition parties have claimed the results were
rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy,
which won 79 out of the 80 National Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
However, the tri-national commission in its report said it
could not conclusively state that the elections were not valid.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Involvement in Sudan Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government
Thursday denied its involvement in Sudanese crisis by uefuting a
report that Sudanese army had killed Ugandan soldiers in the
southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Steven Kavuma, the Minister of State for Defense, said

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Fall on Dashed Hopes for Rates Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets
suffered steep losses on Thursday after sharp falls in Asia
overnight and with disappointment that U.S. Federal Reserve
chairman Alan Greenspan ruled out co-ordinated interest rate cuts
among leading central banks.
</P>
<P>
London had yet another dismal day with more than 30 billion
pounds or about 50 billion U.S. dollars wiped off the value of top
companies at one point. The FTSE 100 Index of top shares closed
down 158.8 at 5,132.9, a little above its session low of 5,101.5.
</P>
<P>
It followed overnight falls in the Far East and heavy falls in
the opening hours of trading on New York.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the gloom was the growing realization that a
co-ordinated cut in interest rates across major economic powers
was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve's chairman Alan Greenspan
said: "I think that I can safely say that at the moment there is
no endeavour to co-ordinate interest rate cuts."
</P>
<P>
The London fall came in the wake of big drops overnight in the
Far East. In Tokyo the Nikkei sank to levels last seen more than
12 years ago. Then the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below
8,000 within moments of Wall Street opening at 2.30pm London time.
</P>
<P>
The market's rally over previous days had been based on
expectations of a co-ordinated cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
News that high street sales in August were better than expected
also appeared to cut the chances that interest rates in Britain
would be taken down soon by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"This is the indication of the souffle market," said Justin
Urquhart Stewart, business planning director of Barclays
Stockbrokers. "As soon as you think it's cooked you take it out
the oven and it falls again."
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's benchmark Xetra Dax slipped nearly 5
percent, as a weaker opening on Wall Street did little to prop up
the feeble index amid ongoing market nervousness. The Xetra Dax
fell by 243.15 points to close at 4629.03. The Dax 30 index ended
the trading day down 188.5 points at 4669.5.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices closed sharply lower following an
unprecedented sell-off in Alcatel, which lost about 40 percent of
its value, dragging down other engineering, defense and telecoms
stocks and the banking sector, notably key Alcatel shareholder
Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index closed down 204.06 points, or 5.4 percent at
3,525.26.
</P>
<P>
The market fell steadily through the session after Alcatel
posted a weaker-than-expected first half income from ordinary
operations and warned that the second half figure would also be
below earlier forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Learn Computer Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans have been urged to
learn computer skills as a means of accessing and processing
information.
</P>
<P>
Professor John Sebuwufu, the Vice Chancellor of Makerere
University, made the call when opening a two-day national
workshop on computer sciences here Thursday, Radio Uganda
reported.
</P>
<P>
With the development of information technology like Internet
and E-mail, children must be assisted to acquire the skills to
access information through computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
A UNESCO official said on this occasion that Ugandans can be
part of the globap village after acquiring computer knowledge and
decided to expand Uganda's capacity in computer literacy.
</P>
<P>
Though still one of the poorest countries in the world, Uganda
has now had a booming economy which grows at more than 5 percent
annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The economic development requires advanced technology imported
from outside Uganda.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Uganda attaches great importance to
education, especially primary education, to make the young
generation more creative and productive.

<HEADLINE> 15,000 Pigs Die of African Swine Fever in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has lost about 15,000
pigs due to the current epidemic of african Swine Fever while
m~?than 12,000 pigs are afflicted with the disease, the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kesley David-West, consultant to the Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO), was quoted as saying in Abeokuta of Ogun
state that the deadly viral disease is spreading in the country,
especially in Ogun and Lagos states.
</P>
<P>
David-West who is on an inspection visit to the country noted
that although the disease is not harmful to human being, the meat
of afflicted pigs should not be eaten.
</P>
<P>
He urged law enforcement agents to ensure that diseased pigs
and pork were not transported from one country to another so as
to curb the spread of the fever in the West African0region.
</P>
<P>
The African Swine Fever was first discovered in Lagos and Ogun
states a few weeks ago, and spreading fast to other states in
Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Russia Against Returning to Soviet Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration on
Thursday warned Russia against returning to Soviet-style economic
systems and confrontation with the United States and the West.
</P>
<P>
There may be hyperinflation in Russia if it fails to control
spending and to reform its banking and financial systems, said
Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers at a hearing of
the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
Also testifying at the hearing, Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott said Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
first appointments of economic officials in his new cabinet were
cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
The new Russian government would be under pressure from the
State Duma or the parliament to shift emphasis from cooperation
with the U.S. to confrontation and defiance, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
"If that were to happen, if Russia were to move in foreign
policy in the direction they were moving in economic policy, it
would portend a double disaster for Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Central Bank earlier announced that it will print
money to pay wage and pension arrears.
</P>
<P>
"They must resist pressures to spend and lend which will doom
the economy to another bout of high, perhaps hyperinflation,"
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
"Just as important, they need to take on the failings of the
financial system and finally put in place the core institutions
and policies of a private market economy," Summers added.
</P>
<P>
He said the steps Russia has taken so far to devalue and
restructure its debt were "drastic measures" that need explaining.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's authorities urgently need to clarify those steps and
begin a co-operative dialogue with official and commercial
creditors," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was difficult to shape an international effort to
help Russia through its current financial crisis because it was
unclear which direction Russian authorities were taking.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has pledged its support for Russia on the condition
that the new Russian government will continue a reform path, but
any cash aid will be made through international financial
institutions.

Alma-Ata, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan ambassador to
China Kuanysh Sultanov said Friday that the Chinese government had
a duty to Asia and the world to maintain the value of its currency.
</P>
<P>
Sultanov said that China, in principle, could devaluate the
RMB, but doing so would trigger an economic crisis in Asia and
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
China's policy had therefore saved southeast Asian foreign
exchange markets from complete collapse, won respect and approval
from countries and international organizations worldwide, Sultanov
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that with 140.5 billion U.S. dollars in foreign
exchange reserves, China had the economic strength and independent
financial system needed to avoid economic crisis. China was
capable of ensuring the RMB value remained stable.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of Portuguese
contemporary painting works is due to open at the China Art
Gallery in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The display of 32 paintings pieces from 18 modern Portuguese
masters, will be the No.7 of the Serial Exhibitions of '98 China
Year of International Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
All the works come from the collection of the Center of Modern
Art of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Contemporary art started in Portugal early this century. Like
Ranias' geometrical cubism, Da Costa's super-realism and
Rodrigues' new way of image depiction, they all helped to form the
Portuguese contemporary arts in the course of development.
</P>
<P>
But only in recent years, Portuguese contemporary art becomes
more diversified.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the exhibition represents a major part of the
Portuguese Cultural Month, which is to be marked here in mid
October and to comprise series of displays and exhibitions
including painting works, films, photographs, books and music.

<HEADLINE> Hoddle Wins FA Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- England coach Glenn Hoddle
was given the backing of the Football Association's International
Committee on Friday despite controversy over his book about the
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
But the expected offer of a two-year extension to Hoddle's
contract, which would last until the 2002 World Cup, has been
deferred for further discussion by a six-man sub-committee.
</P>
<P>
FA chief executive Graham Kelly revealed there are areas of
concern on both sides by saying: "We are looking at the
possibility of an extension. We'll want conditions and he'll have
conditions."
</P>
<P>
He went on: "We want some continuity and that's why we're
trying to renew his contract. We are obliged to have discussions
about renewal and that's all that's happening now."
</P>
<P>
Kelly insisted that no questions were asked about Hoddle's
book or his links with faith healer Eileen Drewery during the
90-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There were no revelations in Glenn's book and no confidences
were broken," Kelly added.
</P>
<P>
"Glenn hasn't been told he can't write any more books, but the
matter will be dealt with by the sub-committee."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the committee had given Hoddle majority
support, but declined to expand on the word "majority".
</P>
<P>
Hoddle kept his views brief following the meeting, saying: "We
just discussed what was on the agenda. The meeting was shorter
than normal."
</P>
<P>
He was asked to express the FA's concern to Liverpool
midfielder Paul Ince, who appeared to make a V-sign to assistant
manager John Gorman after being sent off against Sweden, but no
further action was taken.

<HEADLINE> Carter Urges Inquiry Into U.S. Raid on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. president
Jimmy Carter has called for a technical investigation into
Washington's missile attacks on a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan,
which the Clinton Administration said was making an ingredient for
nerve gas, U.N. officials said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Thursday, Carter, who had said that
the credibility of the United States is on the line over the
attacks, said that Britain, Germany and other foreign leaders were
increasingly skeptical of American assertions about the Sudanese
factory, which Washington linked to Iraqi chemical weapons
projects.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched missile attacks on the factory on
August 20, the same day Washington sent missiles raining down on
suspected terrorist training camps in Afghanistan linked to Osama
bin Laden, whom the Clinton Administration blamed for a role in
the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Government came to the United Nations to request
an independent study of the site in its capital Khartoum, the
Shifa Pharmaceutical Inudstries plant, to prove that the factory's
only function was making medicine and veterinary supplies.
</P>
<P>
The United States argued strenuously against the request, and
the Secretary Council shelved the discussion.
</P>
<P>
"Despite early American reluctance to support this request,"
Carter said in the statement, "this is something that now needs to
be done."
</P>
<P>
"If the Sudanese are guilty, they should be condenmed both for
lying and for contributing to terrorist activities," he said.
"Otherwise, we should admit our error and make amends to those who
have suffered loss or injury."

<HEADLINE> Large Investment for Pollution Control in Southwest China Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to invest a total
of 8.568 billion yuan (about 1.032 billion U.S. dollars) to control
the growing pollution in Dianchi Lake, a well-known fresh water
lake in southwest China, an environmental official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China aims to increase the sewage treatment rate around the
lake to 85 percent and return a good ecological environment to the
lake by 2010, Wang Jirong, deputy director of the State General
Administration of Environmental Protection, told a news conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
Dianchi, covering an area of 307 square kilometers on the
outskirts of Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan
Province, is the sixth largest fresh water lake in China.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid industrial development of Kunming city, the lake
was seriously polluted in recent years. More than 2,000 mines and
factories surrounding the lake discharge over 200 million tons of
waste water into the lake annually.
</P>
<P>
Wang said a plan made by the government of Yunnan Province in
order to control the contamination to the lake and improve its
surrounding environment has recently been approved by the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 projects will be initiated, said Wang, adding
that the World Bank will offer loans of 1.43 billion yuan (about
172 million U.S. dollars), and China has yet to raise more than
6.1 billion yuan (728 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
They made the remarks following Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen's speech in Beijing Friday morning that the central
government will send an appropriate quantity of troops to Macao
after its return to the motherland in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Leong Heng Kao, deputy council director of the Macao Federation
of Neighborhood Communities, told reporters that it is a "correct
and necessary" decision for the central government to station
troops in the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"The decision entirely conforms to relevant stipulation in the
Basic Law of Macao," he said, adding that the stationing of troops
will "be of far-reaching significance for Macao's social stability
and economic growth after its return."
</P>
<P>
Ho Kam Ha, another deputy council director of the federation,
said that Macao residents are not afraid of the troops, but feel a
sense of safety.
</P>
<P>
"We visited some residents today, who all support the central
government's decision and believe that the People's Liberation
Army (PLA) troops are well-disciplined," Ho said.
</P>
<P>
There were many touching scenes showing PLA officers and
soldiers braving the floods this summer to save lives and
property of the people when some parts of China were hit by
serious flooding, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ho noted that the PLA troops stationed in Hong Kong have been
in good terms with residents there over the past year.
</P>
<P>
"The central government's decision of sending troops to Macao
is for the good of Macao people," she said.
</P>
<P>
Pun Iok Lan, vice-president of the Macao Federation of Trade
Unions, also said that workers in different sectors in Macao are
delighted on hearing the decision.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Air Force Base Chosen as Lockerbie Trial Venue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands and Britain
Friday chose a Dutch air force base as the venue for the trial of
the two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am
flight 103.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen and British
Ambassador to the Netherlands Rosemary Spencer signed the venue
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The trial venue is located at Camp Zeist within the Soesterberg
air force base close to the Hague, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the 15-member United Nations Security Council
endorsed a Britain-United States resolution to suspend sanctions
against Libya provided it handed over to the Netherlands the two
men suspected of the mid-air bombing that killed 270 people for
trial by Scottish judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1988, Pan Am flight 103, flying from Frankfurt
to New York via London, exploded over Lockerbie killing 259 people
on board and another 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Investigations led to the accusation that two Libyan airline
company staff members stationed in Malta planted the explosive
device on Pan Am flight 103.
</P>
<P>
A warrant was later issued by Britain and the United States for
the arrest of Abdel Baset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi and Al-Amin
Khalifa Fhimah who were charged with conspiracy, murder and
violation of the Aviation Security Act of 1982.
</P>
<P>
Libya, which demanded that the two suspects be tried only in a
third country, has not yet fully committed itself to extraditing
the two suspects for trial in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Refrigerator Compressor Producer in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A refrigerator compressor
producer financed by a Sino-Italian joint venture began operations
in Tianjin on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer, with an annual production capacity of three
million compressor units, is considered the largest of its kind in
China.
</P>
<P>
The company, called Zanussi Electrical Equipment Tianjin
Co. Ltd, is a joint venture of the Zanussi Group and the Haihe
Refrigerator Factory of Tianjin. The joint venture was established
in 1993 at a cost of 28 million U.S. dollars, and was then capable
of producing one million refrigerators a year.
</P>
<P>
Both partners agreed to expand production scale and raise
annual refrigerator production capacity to three million units in
1996 by adding 60 million U.S. dollars of investment to import the
world's latest technologies and equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the newly operational production
lines will be able to produce refrigerator compressors with
specifications ranging from 60 liters to 280 liters.
</P>
<P>
One estimate notes that China has a refrigerator market
potential exceeding 50 million units.
</P>
<P>
Zanussi Group is a member of Electrolux, the world's leading
home appliance producer which led the world in developing
freon-free refrigerators in 1992. Electrolux invested in China to
manufacture products including refrigerators and dust collectors.

<HEADLINE> Premier League Referees to Go Full-time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League
referees are set to be full-time, sponsored and aided by video
replays next season, the League's referees officer Philip Don
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Don indicated that full-time officials were set to be
introduced by 2000 along with video replays, which would be used
solely to rule on controversial goals.
</P>
<P>
And although the sponsorship of officials is currently
outlawed by FIFA, Don is confident that the new full-time
officials could be paid via sponsors' logos on their shirts.
</P>
<P>
"The Premier League wants to be pro-active on the issue of
professional referees," Don said.
</P>
<P>
"It's what a lot of people in the game want and we want the
referees to be assisted by technology.
</P>
<P>
"By the start of next season, we will have a number of
professional referees in the Premier League."
</P>
<P>
Don indicated that although referees' salaries were not
finalised, they would be in the region of 40,000-50,000 pounds
per year, and he added: "We have put an attractive package tog
ether to get the right referees and give them something to
justify giving up their day jobs."
</P>
<P>
Video replays would help referees with their decision-making,
Don said -- but he insisted they would only be used to determine
if a shot went in the goal or not.
</P>
<P>
"The ball crossing the goalline is fact, while the likes of
fouls and infringements are down to the referee's opinion," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Premier League spokesman Mike Lee said there had been
encouraging feedback from referees on the future of top-flight o
fficialdom.
</P>
<P>
And he added that League bosses would be contacting football's
other governing bodies for a full-scale discussion of the changes.
</P>
<P>
"The main points are the appointment of full-time referees and
video replays of controversial goals," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the proposals could be up and running for next season
but at this point they are just ideas under discussion and
nothing has been agreed yet.
</P>
<P>
"The thinking behind it all is to make sure there is
continuous improvement in refereeing standards and that we are
addressing the needs of the modern game.
</P>
<P>
"We're also taking into account much of the public debate that
goes on among fans about referees, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Seeks European Help to Resolve Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- In a letter published here
Friday, Cyprus's Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou urged his
European counterparts to pressure Turkey to work toward a just and
viable solution of the Cyprus dispute.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, which has been sent to his European
counterparts, Omirou denounced Turkey for strengthening its
forces in northern Cyprus by upgrading their armaments.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has taken over the northern third of this Eastern
Mediterranean island in 1974 after a failed coup staged by Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained a 35,000-strong armed forces in
northern Cyprus with the alleged aim of protecting the Turkish
Cypriots, who declared in 1983 the breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" that is only recognized by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Omirou called on his European counterparts to exercise their
influence over Turkey to reduce the military tension on the island
and to cooperate in settling the Cyprus issue based on
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
whose members include most Western countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite the
divided island in a bizonal, bicommunal federation through peace
talks, but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The first suspect
extradited from the United Kingdom after the handover was returned
to Hong Kong Friday.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, a 24-year-old British man wanted in connection
with drug trafficking in 1996, was escorted back from London by
two Hong Kong police officers. He will appear in Eastern
Magistracy Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The suspect was reportedly found in possession of a quantity of
cannabis resin, ice and cocaine when stopped and searched by
police officers on Hong Kong street in January 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was subsequently charged with trafficking in and possession
of dangerous drugs and granted court bail.
</P>
<P>
While waiting for hearing at the High Court, the Briton jumped
bail. He was eventually caught in England on June 25, last year.
</P>

The British authority agreed on August 19 this year to the
extradition of the suspect and formally signed the order for his

Special Administrative Region (SAR) will be conducive to lasting
prosperity and stability in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Zong Guangyao, deputy director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao

</P>
<P>
"I believe that people of various sectors in Macao will welcome
and support the central government's decision of stationing

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's meeting with his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari
Vajpayee in New York next week will focus on ways and means to
resume the stalled dialogue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz here Friday
after a news briefing on his one-day visit to Tehran on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, the foreign minister said that the
main purpose of the Nawaz-Vajpayee meeting would be to start the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and Vajpayee are expected to meet at a luncheon on the
sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session, which
would be the second meeting between the two leaders since India
and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thinks the foreign secretary-level talks between
Pakistan and India will resume after the prime ministers' meeting,
Aziz said "it depends on the meeting."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistani and Indian officials had discussed various
proposals in Durban, South Africa, which will be presented to the
two leaders.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister called for a meaningful dialogue with
India, saying that it should not only be a sitting.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretary-level talks between the two countries
collapsed in New Delhi last year due to the difference over the
Kashmir issue. Pakistan insists that Kashmir and the issue of
peace and security should be discussed separately while India
calls for composite discussion.

<HEADLINE> Allies to Stay Until Congo (K) Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has reiterated that President Laurent Kabila's military
allies would stay in the former Zaire until the situation there
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast by Zimbabwe State Television (ZTV)
Friday, Mugabe also said that more African states were ready to
back Kabila against Tutsi-led rebels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the ZTV Thursday night after meeting Namibian
President Sam Nujoma who stopped over in Harare, capital of
Zimbabwe, on his way home from a state visit to Mozambique,
Mugabe said Kaibla's allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia --
had support from around the African continent.
</P>
<P>
"Many more African countries...not just from the SADC
(Southern African Development Community) are prepared to assist
the Democratic Republic of the Congo with troops whenever
President Kabila may need that help," Mugabe said without giving
further details.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe sent about 3,000 troops backed by warplanes and tanks
to the Congo (K) to defend Kabila against a rebellion which
started on August 2, which the Congolese leader blames on Rwanda
and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe justifies his military intervention in Congo (K),
saying that he went there as a matter of principle that a
government must not be overthrown through violence.
</P>
<P>
But his critics both at home and abroad said regional peace
efforts had been blunted by Mugabe's preferen for overall
military victory over the six-week rebellion.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi told
parliament the allied troops would remain in the Congo (K) until
they were convinced that permanent peace is restored in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said he shared Zimbabwe's view
and told the ZTV "we want peace in the region so that we can
concentrate on building our economies."
</P>
<P>
He also said the allied forces would help Kabila train his
army to enable it to deal with future invasion.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, Syria Conduct Joint Naval Maneuvers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and its closest ally
Syria have conducted joint naval maneuvers with live ammunition in
the Mediterranean, Lebanon's Voice of the People radio reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted a military source as saying that the maneuvers
were conducted Thursday with the participation of a Lebanese
military unit and Syrian forces.
</P>
<P>
Gen Ali Aslan, chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces,
attended the final stage of the maneuvers and urged the fighters
to keep a high level of combat readiness to confront any
aggression wherever it comes from.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have strongly condemned the planned
Israeli-Turkish naval exercises in the Mediterranean, which were
announced following a visit by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz to Israel earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
They said that the increasing military cooperation between
Israel and Turkey constitutes a threat to Arab national security.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has stationed 40,000 troops in Lebanon, vowed to
closely coordinate its stance with its tiny neighbor over regional
issues, especially the stance toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel have been occupying south Lebanon and Syria's Golan
Heights. Meanwhile, Turkey has been pointing an accusing finger at
Damascus for the alleged Syrian support for the Kurdish rebels
fighting to oust the government.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have been developing strategic ties since
early 1996 when they signed two military cooperation deals.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has allowed Israeli pilots to use its air space for
training, and Israel has been upgrading Turkish fighter planes
with its advanced technologies.

<HEADLINE> Communist Party Members Urged to Donate Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing today urged members of both the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and the Communist Youth League of China to take the lead in
blood donation.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the call in a
letter to a national tele-conference to mark the promulgation of
China's first Blood Donation Law, due to become valid on October 1.
</P>
<P>
General public is also encouraged to donate blood to fulfil
their responsibilities and obligations as set in the law, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the law signals a major change in the
use of blood for medical purposes and indicates that China's blood
administration work has entered a new period," the vice-premier
noted.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement of the law is of far-reaching significance to
safeguarding social stability and sustainable economic growth, he
said. He voiced his hope that leading officials at all levels, as
long as their health conditions and ages permit, will take the
lead in blood donation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenkang, minister of health, announced at the meeting
that one million medical personnel will join the team of blood
donors. He also asked government employees, servicemen and college
students to take the lead in the endeavor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he acknowledged that safety problems in blood
transfusion are becoming serious because of illegal blood deals.
</P>
<P>
"Diseases transmitted through blood transfusion, such as
hepatitis B and C, and AIDS, are endangering blood users' health
at any time," he told the meeting
</P>
<P>
The work of spreading blood donation has been cited as
"sluggish" since it was launched in 1984. A wrong but deep-rooted
opinion that donating blood may be detrimantal to one's health is
blamed as the major reason.
</P>
<P>
The milestone law, adopted by the National People's Congress,
China's highest legislative body, late last year, stipulates that
donated blood is only for clincal use.
</P>
<P>
The law specifies that government employees, servicemen and
college students should set as exemplary models in blood
donation. They are estimated to provide approxmiately 250 tons of
blood used for urgent use annually.
</P>
<P>
Family members and friends of the people who are going to
undergo operations are encouraged to donate blood, according to
the law.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa reaffirmed Hong Kong's commitment to free market here Friday
when meeting with visiting Prime Minister of Ireland Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
"We have a flexible market which allows very efficient price
adjustment for major production factors. We are aware that it is
necessary to allow market forces to bring our prices to a level at
which the market can afford. We are ready to take the pain arising
from the adjustment process," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
There has been immediate and huge adjustment in the property
market, Tung said, adding the adjustment process has been
extremely efficient.
</P>
<P>
"The labor market has also been undergoing adjustment, but this
will take some time," he told Ahern. Speaking from his former life
as a businessman, Tung pointed out that "employers must be caring
to their employees in the adjustment process in order to bring the
best out of their employees."
</P>
<P>
Ahern congratulated Tung on the successful implementation of
the "One Country, Two Systems" principle as the Special
Administrative Region is stepping into its second year after
returning to China. The prime minister believed that with
efficient market system the Hong Kong economy would rebound
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Tung told Ahern that with huge reserves and in the absence of
foreign debts, Hong Kong would continue to invest heavily in
education and infrastructure, and capitalize on its links with the
Chinese mainland.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The House Judiciary Committee wrangled over whether to make
public a videotape of President Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony
in the Monica Lewinsky case and how to edit reams of pages
delivered by the independent counsel. The panel was expected to
approve the tape's release without any redactions.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia's new government indicated that it planned to satisfy
old debts and bail out old friends by printing billions of new
rubles. In Washington, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.
Summers said Russia was heading toward a return to four-digit
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The disclosure of a 30-year-ago extramarital affair by House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) provoked an
extraordinary display of acrimony Thursday as Republicans tried to
blame the tory on the White House and presidential aides
complained that they were being unfairly smeared.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Congress moved swiftly Thursday to provide stopgap
funding for the government while it tries to resolve major
disputes over spending for next year, including a bitter fight
over new U.S. contributions to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- IMF (International Monetary Fund) funding was opposed in a
229-188 House vote that could force the White House to compromise
on its request for 17.9 billion U.S. dollars to fund accounts
drained by the Asia crisis. The vote blocked IMF backers from
bringing up the request in debate on a foreign-aid bill.
Republicans are demanding an overhaul of agency procedures.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton attacked an 80 billion U.S.
dollars GOP tax-cut package as a threat to Social Security and a
possible signal of U.S. fiscal laxness, but the House Ways and
Means panel passed it 23-15. The House, worried about looming
budget fights, took steps to keep the government open.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Trade Weathers Asian Financial Crisis (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign trade have
chalked up a comparatively high growth, and basically weathered
the Asian Financial turmoil, a senior trade official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian financial crisis have impacted China's foreign trade
and resulted in weaker growth in the export business this year,
said Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, at an international seminar on China's economy and
investment climate.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added, "the growth in export is still
relatively strong as compared to the plunging export of
neighboring nations."
</P>
<P>
But Sun acknowledged that the prospect for China's foreign
trade is not so optimistic and the trade surplus is expected to
decline further next year.
</P>
<P>
"With the Asian financial crisis worsening and its impact still
spreading, it will be virtually impossible for the export sector
to maintain a high growth," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister went on to say that he expects to see a great
increase in the import business next year and, as a result of the
government's growing investment and recovering domestic
demand. And he added that the government will work to achieve a
trade balance in the import and export next year, and expect a
smaller trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China scored 179.5 billion US dollars in
foreign trade volume during the first seven months this year, up
4.2 percent over the same period last year. Export to the United
States, Europe, Africa and Latin America maintained growth of more
than 18 percent, compared to the sharp decline to eastern and
southeastern nations.

<P>
Foreign investors in Europe and America have become even more
enthusiastic to invest in China, as is indicated in the more than
39 percent growth in actual investment by 15 EU nations, US and
Canada during the first half year.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment during the January-July period
totalled 23.9 billion US dollars during the period, up 7.3 percent
from last year.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister also noted in his speech that the Chinese
government will continue implementing its opening-up, while taking
a cautious and positive approach in doing that.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China will continue to gradually open up the service
sector to investors from overseas, Sun noted, and the opening of
the financial and telecommunications sectors is also expected to
widen.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade is expected to reach 400 billion US
dollars in next three years by the end of this century, said the
vice-minister.

<HEADLINE> Exports of Ho Chi Minh City Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Exports from Ho Chi Minh City
this year are expected to drop to 3.7 billion U.S. dollars, 11.5
percent less than last year, Ho Chi Minh City trade service
reported.
</P>
<P>
Export receipts for Ho Chi Minh City, the largest economic hub
in Vietnam, in the first nine months of 1998 were estimated at 2.8
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the trade service, the fall resulted from the cut
in price of several items, especially key export items.
</P>
<P>
The price-cut caused a 400-million-dollar loss in crude
exports, 50 million dollars in rubber and pharmaceutical
materials, and 120 dollars in garments, said the trade service.
</P>
<P>
Another cause for the export reduction was the weather pattern
and natural disasters which have badly affected the output of
agro- and aqua-products.
</P>
<P>
The drop could also be attributed to the fact that Vietnam's big
export markets, such as Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, the Association
of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and northeast Asian
countries, had cut their imports from Vietnam, because of their
austerity policies or difficulties in pay.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The stock market of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
sharply plummeted Thursday to close at 4895.53 points, down 100
points from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the Abu Dhabi National Bank index that
fell below the level of 5,000 points in the past month.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts believed that the sharp fall of the UAE stock
market was largely because that a group of investors, particularly
smaller ones, had sold their stocks in order to buy new shares to
be offered to augment the capital of several companies.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Arabian stock market declined last week in
terms of both the trading volume and value, the Arabic-language
daily Al Hayat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the market closed at 163.6 points from 165.93
points last Thursday, a decline of 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only the share prices of five companies closed higher on
Thursday, and those of 18 other companies remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The market's general index has so far lost 32.33 points or 16.5
percent since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Affected by fears about the deepening world economic
crisis, Turkey's Istanbul Stock Exchange fell to the 14-month low
of 1,948 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National-100 index shed 8.4 percent on Thursday due to the
investors' frustration over the lack of a clear program to help
pull the world out of the current economic depression.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts said the share prices of many Turkish
companies have dropped by nearly two-thirds since July.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have lost at least 5 billion U.S. dollars
in Turkey alone as a result of the falling stocks.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The current account deficit in Israel fell by
almost 50 percent in the first half of 1998 compared with the
same period last year, from 2.3 billion U.S. dollars to 1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics published Friday said that Israel's overall
foreign debt grew by 2 billion dollars to stand on 17.5 billion
dollars in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in Israel in this period totaled 1.2
billion dollars, a decline of 300 million dollars compared with
the previous year. Israel's overseas investments also fell to 100
million dollars from 400 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Recent turmoil in Israel's currency markets helped
push the Consumer Price Index 0.5 percent higher in August,
bringing the annual rate of inflation to an average 4 to 5
percent, official statistics published Friday said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli currency shekel has shed more than 5 percent of
its value against the dollar during last month's global market
mayhem, plunging to as low as 3.86 shekels for one dollar.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Invasion Day of Northeast China Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- For four years running,
northeast China's Shenyang city sounded air-raid alarms for three
minutes starting at 22:20 on September 18, to remind residents of
the day of the Japanese army's invasion in 1931.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city did more to mark that shameful day by
holding a ceremony to hoist the national flag at the square before
the provincial government building at 8:00 this morning, with some
3,000 former soldiers, officers and ordinary citizens gathering
solemnly below the flag.
</P>
<P>
Also this morning, over 2,000 schools held the national flag
hoisting ceremony on campuses. Some students also made speeches
under the flag, calling on fellow students to study hard for the
grand goal of building a strong China.
</P>
<P>
"September 18 is a day of humiliation for the Chinese people,"
said Gu Tiantian, a student from the Shenyang No. 2 Middle
School. "Always remembering the national humiliation and
invigorating China is youngsters' unshirkable responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Exactly on this evening 67 years ago, the Japanese army
stationed in northeast China suddenly launched attacks against the
Nationalist government's army in Shenyang, under an excuse. With
Chiang Kai-shek preoccupied with wiping out the "communist
bandits," the whole northeast China were lost to the Japanese
within just about four months.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner to Get Award for Banning Tobacco Advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's Social
Affairs Commissioner is to get a special award for his efforts to
ban tobacco advertising and promote public health, commission
sources said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn will be presented with the award at the biannual
European Respiratory Society Conference on Saturday in Geneva
which will be attended by about 10,000 delegates.
</P>
<P>
The respiratory society is grateful to the commissioner for his
success in securing an agreement on a Europe-wide ban on tobacco
advertising and sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
Flynn's success has been described as the most positive
development in public health protection in years.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission and the European Council of Ministers
agreed earlier in the year to ban tobacco advertising and
sponsorship of sports and art events in the future.
</P>
<P>
The ban is expected to become fully effective by 2006 at the
latest.
</P>
<P>
Smoking has been blamed for killing half a million citizens
each year in the European Union alone.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to take measures to reduce that (fatality) figure,
we are failing in our primary responsibility to citizens:
protecting their health and well-being," said Flynn.

<HEADLINE> China's Market Survey Sector Grows Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China now has more than 800
market survey agencies and over half of them are based in Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou, according to official sources at a meeting
today ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, more than 700 are run by individuals, private
firms or units other than government-managed agencies.
</P>
<P>
Over the recent years, China's market surveying sector has been
growing at an annual rate of more than 100 percent. The business
volume last year was 500 million yuan, with the figure for this
year expected to reach 600-to-800 million yuan, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They noted, however, that the industry's credibility has been
affected by some non-standard practices cropping up in the process
of rapid expansion.
</P>
<P>
So it has become imperative to strengthen self-discipline
within the sector, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting was attended by representatives from more
than 200 surveying agencies and is the largest of its kind.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Use and Sale of Leaded Gasoline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The State General
Administration of Environmental Protection today made known a
State Council circular that requires the country's gasoline
producers to stop producing leaded gasoline by the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
The State Council also demands that all the gas stations
replace leaded gasoline with unleaded on July 1, 2000, and that
automobile companies produce vehicles adapted for the use of
unleaded gasoline.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to raise taxes on leaded gas
consumption and keep its price at least as high as unleaded
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jirong, deputy director of State General Administration of
Environmental Protection, told a press conference today that lead
emitted by automobiles from 1986 to 1995 exceeded 15,800 tons,
making it a major source of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the move to ban leaded gasoline will not only reduce
air pollution, but also spur China's auto industry to apply
advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
At present, 22 provinces and cities have worked out detailed
plans to abandon leaded gasoline, of which, 18 provinces and
cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, have begun using
and selling unleaded gasoline.

<HEADLINE> Australian Mining Company Asked to Leave Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian Mining giant WMC
Ltd. should pull out of the Philippines because it was doing
social and ecological harm there, a delegation told the company
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, a mining watchdog of Philippine
representatives, met WMC Ltd. officials at the company's Melbourne
office to voice their protest, the Australian Associated Press
reported from Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The delegation delivered a report by the Mineral Policy
Institute that criticizes the social and ecological impact of the
company's bid to develop Tampakan copper mine on the Philippines
island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The institute also alleges that WMC is overriding the wishes of
local people; destroying indigenous sites; leaving behind
radioactive waste; and removing native forests.
</P>
<P>
WMC Ltd. also had a poor track record for injuries and
inadequate safety at its operations in Australia and in other
countries including Papua New Guinea, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine delegate Avelino Sichon accused the company of
failing to consult local people, of misusing land and destroying
the social fabric of the area's B'Laan tribe.
</P>
<P>
Pastor Avelino of the Alliance For Genuine Development in the
Philippines, representing farmers and others, said, in an area
beset by poverty, WMC was mining about 99,440 hectares of
agricultural and forested land belonging to the indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
About 240,000 B'Laan people live on the island, with 6,000 in
the area fenced off by WMC. They fear their remaining 10,000
hectares of virgin forest in the area will be destroyed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company signed a financial and technical agreement with the
Philippine government in 1995 for the copper mining project.
</P>
<P>
"They are using the water for drilling and there is the
experience of the community that they get skin disease off their
drilling activity," Avelino said.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Drake, WMC's group manager of public affairs and
environment, attended the meeting and denied the accusations.
However, he said his company would examine the report.

<HEADLINE> China's First Blood Donation Law to Become Effective in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Health
Zhang Wenkang has urged local governments to ensure implementation
of the country's first blood donation law, due to become effective
on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Zhang today announced that one million medical personnel will
join the team of blood donors. He also asked government employees,
servicemen and college students to take the lead in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that safety problem in blood transfusion
is becoming serious due to illegal blood deals.
</P>
<P>
"Diseases transmitted through blood transfusion, such as
hepatitis B and C, and AIDS, are endangering blood users' health
at any time," he told a national tele-conference on mobilization
of the law's enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Commercial blood suppliers who are detected HCV (hepatitis C
virus) positive several times or ten-odd times the blood donors,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the law has given us a legal weapon to punish
offenders and to protect people's health," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
The work to spread blood donation has been described as
"sluggish" since it was launched in 1984. A wrong but
deeply-rooted opinion that donating blood may harm health is
blamed as the major reason.
</P>
<P>
The milestone law was passed by the National People's Congress,
China's highest legislative body, late last year, which stipulates
donated blood is clinically used only.
</P>
<P>
The law says government employees, servicemen and college
students should set a model in donating blood. They are estimated
to provide about 250 tons of blood used for urgent aims annually.
</P>
<P>
Family members and friends of people who are going to receive
operations are encouraged to donate blood, according to the law.

BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Import and Export Bank of
China (IEBC) plans to provide 3.2 billion yuan in credit loans to
two major enterprises in south China's Guangdong Province, the

the state policies regarding the industrial, foreign trade and
financial sectors, and provide strong capital support for the
export of electronics and machinery products.
</P>
<P>
The bank has financed approximately 2 billion yuan in credit
loans for the two enterprises since 1995 in a bid to stimulate
their exports.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hoddle to Extend Contract with FA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Glenn Hoddle is set to be
offered a two-year extension to his contract as England coach.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle is due to meet the Football Association's International
Committee today with his future yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
England have lost three of their last four games and Hoddle
has been widely criticised for his controversial World Cup diary.
</P>
<P>
And he has been linked with the managerial vacancy at his
former club Tottenham.
</P>
<P>
But FA chief executive Graham Kelly is confident Hoddle will
complete the job and lead England to Euro 2000: "I don't think
Glenn will walk away. As he has said he has a contract and I
don't see him walking away from that contract under any
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle will face questions from the FA about both his recent
book and the use of Eileen Drewery as the national squad's "faith
healer".
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the book will be discussed. It has contributed to a
general climate that is unfortunate," The Daily Telegraph quoted
Kelly as saying.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ince's sending off during the disappointing 2-1 defeat by
Sweden earlier this month will also be discussed by the
International Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ince appeared to make a V-sign to England assistant manager
John Gorman when he was ordered off in Stockholm -- and Kelly and
his colleagues are now demanding Hoddle "impose discipline" on
the team.
</P>
<P>
"Sendings-off occur but what happened afterwards was not
acceptable," Kelly added.
</P>
<P>
"Ince said he made a gesture to John Gorman. That, at best, is
not acceptable. I've made it perfectly clear and Glenn
understands this. I have told him this has to be dealt with,
ideally by saying to Ince it mustn't happen again, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Worries Over Its Privatization Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos has expressed deep worry over national enterprises'
competitiveness in the process of privatization.
</P>
<P>
"National enterprises have taken up strategic positions in
government's privatization policies. However, in reality,
Angolan enterprises have been excluded, leaving foreign companies
in the limelight," the president made the remarks Thursday at a
mass gathering in Ongiva, capital city of the southern Cunene
Province, to mark the "National Hero Day", according to Friday's
O Journal de Angola.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos attributed the situation to lack of local support
in loans on the part of national enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign companies now operating in Angola have
strong back-up by banks in their own countries, therefore they
enjoy much more advantages than local private companies in
bidding for the purchase of national enterprises, according to
the president.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos appealed to Angolan banks for necessary loans for
national enterprises, otherwise, he warned, "the national economy
will be in the hands of foreign enterprises in the near future."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the president said the establishment of joint
ventures with foreign companies would also be a fine solution to
the problem.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Government Rejects Opposition Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The ruling State Peace and
Development Council (SPDC) of Myanmar on Friday poured scorn on
moves by an opposition "People's Parliament" to take over the
government of the country.
</P>
<P>
An government statement issued here said, "The government of
Myanmar noted with interest the announcement by the National
League for Democracy (NLD) on September 17 that it has formed a
10-person committee that will serve as a parliament to govern
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
"It is also interesting to learn that the NLD has decided that
all laws enacted in Myanmar since September 18, 1988 are illegal,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
"It remains unclear which responsibilities of government this
new committee intends to take over, what its policies are, or how
it intends to implement those policies." it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Will the committee also serve as the judicial and executive
branches of government, or only as the legislative branch? Under
what constitution will it govern? Will it defend Myanmar
sovereignty? Will it send envoys to other countries?" it added.
</P>
<P>
"While the NLD's committee puzzles over these issues, the
current government will continue to shoulder the real
responsibilities of governing Myanmar, and will continue the
National Convention that is writing a constitution that will lead
to a stable, sustainable democracy in Myanmar," it concluded.
</P>
<P>
Although the NLD won 396 out of 485 parliamentary seats in the
1990 general election, the ruling military argues that the
formation of a new parliament requires a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
A national convention began to work on a new basic law in 1993,
but it has been suspended since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi, the general secretary of the NLD and the most
famous Myanmar dissident, was under house arrest for six years
until 1995.
</P>
<P>
Besides establishing the "People's Parliament" to exert
pressure on the ruling military, the NLD also demanded the
unconditional release of all political prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army, Navy Get New Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- General Surayudh Chulanont
and General Thira Haocharoen have obtained the nods from
Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej to become the
commander-in-chief of Thai Army and Navy respectively, local
television station Channel 9 reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the king's approval, the Armed Forces of Thailand have
completed the annual reshuffle, which involves 522 posts.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Surayudh and Gen. Thira will replace Army
Commander-in-Chief Chetta Thanajaro and Navy Commander-in-Chief
Suwatchai Kasemsuk respectively, who will both retire in October.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Gen. Surayudh as the new army
commander-in-chief is said to be a result of compromise.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Bangkok Post newspaper quoted an army
source as saying that Gen. Chetta's decision to name Gen. Surayudh
as his successor was made after consulting Supreme Commander Gen.
Mongkol Ampornpisit and Defense Minister and Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Surayudh, an army specialist, is a Chulachomklao Royal
Military Academy graduate.
</P>
<P>
If he stays on as commander-in-chief until he retires in 2003,
he would be Thailand's longest-serving army chief.
</P>
<P>
However, he has said before that he would stay in the job for
only three years before taking another post, possibly the supreme
commander.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
slightly higher Friday, but was bumped off its earlier intraday
highs due to the worsening crisis in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Problems with the Japanese government attempting to pass
legislation for its banking sector contributed to increased
selling of the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
It was not helped during the session by increased buying of the
U.S. dollar against the yen after the speech earlier this week by
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, dismissing
suggestions of an interest rate cut in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed the session at 59.12 U.S. cents,
up from 58.97 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senior manager of foreign exchange at Rothschild Australia Paul
Macarounas said the currency held up reasonably well in the face
of strong selling.
</P>
<P>
He said the market saw a range of 58.95 and 59.47 U.S. cents
and expected the Australian dollar to trade between 58.85 and
59.45 overnight.
</P>
<P>
Japanese political parties are trying to reach an agreement on
bills covering a clean-up of Japan's debt-ridden banking system.
</P>
<P>
Despite complaints from the opposition, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi hopes to have an agreement before he meets U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said the currency market was still circumspect in
the medium term, mindful that the Asian crisis has yet to fully
impact the market.
</P>
<P>
"The market is still not convinced that all is rosy and is
still very concerned about world growth and the effect on
commodities and the Australian dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the close here the local currency was trading at 78.08
Japanese yen from 79.34 and 1.0012 German marks from 0.9942.

KAMPALA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa will visit Uganda
and discuss the volatile situation in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
A press release released by the Ugandan President's Office
Friday said the two presidents will arrive Saturday morning for a
one-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders will hold private discussions on issues
concerning the current situation in the Great Lakes region.

On Wednesday, Ugandan President Museveni addressed the
parliament about Uganda's policy toward the current crisis in
DRC, saying government troops deployed in eastern Congo are
guarding the security of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
His speech was attacked by some MPs as not serious enough and
he was accused of deploying the army without consulting the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said the Tutsi-led rebels in the DRC have
admitted they are suffering a setback in battles with the
government and alliance troops.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said the Ugandan troops have not yet been involved in
the armed conflict in any manner. However, at the beginning of
the speech, he admitted that Uganda is somewhat more directly
involved in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila has been accusing Uganda and
Rwanda of fomenting the rebellion which erupted on August 2.

<HEADLINE> SADC Slammed for Rejecting U.S. Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) --The Zambia Association of
Manufacturers (ZAM) has criticized the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) for rejecting the proposed U.S.
trade policy with Africa.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Times of Zambia Thursday, which was
published Friday, ZAM Chairman Mark O'Donnell said that he felt
strange that the grouping decided to reject the U.S. trade policy
with Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the economic forum of the southern African states held last
week in Mauritius, ministers from the 14 SADC states rejected the
proposed U.S. trade-not-aid policy toward Africa, saying that the
region still needs aid for development.
</P>
<P>
He said Africans should note that the donor community was now
getting fed up with giving Africa cash handouts.
</P>
<P>
It was through trade that African countries would create more
wealth and jobs and not by being perpetual recipients of aid,
said O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
He observed that donor aid was demeaning as well as enslaving
the continent and, therefore, it is time for regional groupings
to adopt strategies which would create more wealth and jobs for
Africans to develop.
</P>
<P>
The ZAM chairman also cautioned that rejecting the idea that a
trade-not-aid policy toward Africa would just compel the donor
community to stop helping the continent.
</P>
<P>
The continent would become even poorer if it would continue
depending on aid from the donor community because aid would not
bring about sustainable economic development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade policy toward Africa, first outlined by U.S.
President Bill Clinton on his African tour earlier this year, is
designed to lessen Africa's dependence on aid money.

<HEADLINE> Massive Rally in Tehran to Mourn for Slain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
Tehranis marched along avenues and streets leading to Tehran
University Friday for a rally to condemn Afghan Taliban militia's
killing of Iranian diplomats and a reporter.
</P>
<P>
"Death with Taliban," demonstrators shouted, "No compromise, no
fear, we want to Fight."
</P>
<P>
A number of marchers carrying loaded rifles told Xinhua
correspondent that they are ready to carry out the order of the
paramount leader and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to take revenge on the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
In tears, an old woman, Zahra Mohammad Khanlu cried out "No one
in the world kill a reporter who should have freedom to make
reports, why the Taliban killed our correspondent?"
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban who committed crimes under the name of Islam are
in fact dogs which do not recognize their masters," she said,
noting "Iran has hosted several million Afghan refugees."
</P>
<P>
Eleven Iranian diplomats and the reporter had been reported
abducted by the Taliban at the militia's seizure of Mazari Sharif,
a town in northern Afghanistan on August 8. Nine diplomats and the
reporter were confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban on Monday delivered to Iran the bodies of six
diplomats and the reporter of the official news agency IRNA. But
the fate of two more Iranian diplomats reported missing was still
unknown.
</P>
<P>
An Afghan refugee, Ali Abass Hohammadeh said the Afghan
refugees living in Iran are ready to return to Afghanistan to
fight against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
At end of the rally, a resolution was read aloud inside Tehran
University where the Friday prayers congregation was held.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for immediate release of other Iranian
nationals held captive by the Taliban and clarification of the
fate of other Iranian diplomats reported missing in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged the Iranian government to arm the Afghan
refugees living in Iran to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also warned the supporters of the Taliban,
particularly Pakistan, to stop support for the Afghan
fundamentalist group.
</P>
<P>
After the Friday prayers congregation, the mass held a funeral
procession for the six Iranian diplomats and the IRNA reporter
with the participation of senior Iranian officials, including
Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and IRGC commander Yahya Rahim Safavi.

<HEADLINE> SADC Slammed for Rejecting U.S. Trade Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) --The Zambia Association of
Manufacturers (ZAM) has criticized the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) for rejecting the proposed U.S.
trade policy with Africa.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Times of Zambia Thursday, which was
published Friday, ZAM Chairman Mark O'Donnell said that he felt
strange that the grouping decided to reject the U.S. trade policy
with Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the economic forum of the southern African states held last
week in Mauritius, ministers from the 14 SADC states rejected the
proposed U.S. trade-not-aid policy toward Africa, saying that the
region still needs aid for development.
</P>
<P>
He said Africans should note that the donor community was now
getting fed up with giving Africa cash handouts.
</P>
<P>
It was through trade that African countries would create more
wealth and jobs and not by being perpetual recipients of aid,
said O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
He observed that donor aid was demeaning as well as enslaving
the continent and, therefore, it is time for regional groupings
to adopt strategies which would create more wealth and jobs for
Africans to develop.
</P>
<P>
The ZAM chairman also cautioned that rejecting the idea that a
trade-not-aid policy toward Africa would just compel the donor
community to stop helping the continent.
</P>
<P>
The continent would become even poorer if it would continue
depending on aid from the donor community because aid would not
bring about sustainable economic development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade policy toward Africa, first outlined by U.S.
President Bill Clinton on his African tour earlier this year, is
designed to lessen Africa's dependence on aid money.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospects for Irish-Chinese Trade: Irish Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Ireland wishes to develop
long-term trade relations with China and increase trade and
investment in this giant and growing market, Irish Minister of
International Trade Tom Kitt said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"While the trade figures between Ireland and China are not
strong enough, which we must improve, we do see the prospects,
particularly in the software area," he said. Ireland is the second
largest software exporter in the world, second only to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Kitt was speaking at a ceremony, which marked the completion of
Phase One of the Year 2000 upgrade program for the Water Supplies
Department (WSD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR).
</P>
<P>
Irish company Datac Control International, which had been
supplying the SAR department with related software products,
presented a Year 2000 Compliance Certificate to WSD.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the recent Asian crises, the China market to us is a
very good and stable one. We see potentials in developing
long-term relations with China, which has an eight percent annual
growth in economy and low inflation rate," Kitt said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish businessmen accompanying Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern on his on-going visit to China had developed very positive
results in their discussions with their Chinese counterparts, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are excited about this market and plan to intensify our
efforts here and increase trade and investment here, and I believe
that there is tremendous scope for Irish companies to contribute
to the continued modernization of China's economy and further step
up our already vibrant business links in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our trade with Hong Kong has been very strong and a
substantial part of our export last year to China was actually
with Hong Kong, and we are very anxious to develop further," he
added.

ISLAMABAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Ambassador to
Kabul
Aziz Khan will proceed to Kandhar Saturday to bring five Iranian
Prisoners to Islamabad, Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen about his day-long visit to Tehran Thursday,
Aziz said he had informed Iranian Vice President Hasan Habibi that
as a result of personal intervention of the Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, the Afghan
Taliban had agreed to release five of the Iranian prisoners held
by them.
</P>
<P>
On their arrival, the prisoners will be handed over to the

</P>
<P>
He noted that Habibi express appreciation for Pakistan's
efforts in this regard, particularly those of Prime Minister
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the exact number of Iranian prisoners kept by the
Taliban, Aziz said their exact number are not known. However, it
has been reported earlier that the number of prisoners may be
about 50.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Taliban Militia Are War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq Nouri on Friday called on the international
communities to treat the Afghan Taliban militia as war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in front of Tehran University before a
massive funeral procession for the killed Iranian diplomats and
reporter, Nouri said the international communities should show a
practical reaction to such crimes and do more than merely issuing
statements or resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming maneuver of the Iranian army on the
country's eastern border, Nouri termed it as a message to show
that Iran is able to defend its borders and poses no threats to
its neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
He said that the maneuver showcases Iran's national will and
determination as well as the armed forces' readiness to thwart
any possible aggression.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army has started to transfer military forces from
various provinces to the eastern border to hold a grand war game
later this month amid spiraling tensions between Iran and the
Taliban following the Muslim group's killing of nine Iranian
diplomats and a reporter in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The massive turnout of the people in the nationwide rallies on
Friday shows their all-out support for the statement of the
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Nouri added.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, on
Tuesday ordered the armed forces to be on alert to follow the
development in Afghanistan and maintain full readiness to carry
out whatever decision the country's statesmen would make.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Proposes Pakistan-Iran Commission on Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said Friday that Pakistan is ready to establish a
commission with Iran to determine the nature and level of external
interference in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after his one-day visit to Iran
Thursday, Aziz said Pakistan is ready to work closely with Iran at
the United Nations, the Organization of Islamic Conference or any
other forum to resolve the present crisis between Iran and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Iranian officials, Aziz emphasized that
"it is most important to defuse the prevailing tension that has
been created by the massing of Iranian troops along the Afghan
border."
</P>
<P>
"A conflict would have a devastating effect on the peace and
stability of the entire region and should be avoided at all cost,"
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the purpose of his visit was to have frank and
intensive deliberations on the situation in Afghanistan and to
discuss measures that would lead to an easing of the tension
between Iran and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said he was satisfied with the outcome of the visit. "It
provided a welcome opportunity to have detailed discussions on
matters of mutual concern in an atmosphere of cordiality."
</P>
<P>
He, however, told reporters that the Iranian leadership
repeated their outrage at the killing of their personnel in the
northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif and reiterated their demand
that the Taliban should render an apology for the killing,
apprehend and extradite to Iran those responsible and repatriate
the bodies of the remaining personnel killed.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that the Iranian side also expressed concern over
the reports of large-scale killing in the central Afghan province
of Bamyan and Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Iran again alleged that the recent Taliban victories were
possible only due to Pakistan's military support and assistance,
according to the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that he told the Iranian leaders that "we do not
accept their allegations that our armed forces had been involved
in the Taliban military operations. This was completely untrue."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that Pakistan's relations with
Iran are "precious" to it. "Pakistan is determined not to allow
the current situation to harm these abiding ties," he said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Guiding HK Into Tech-Driven Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Over the past six months,
Tien Chang-lin, former president of University of California,
Berkeley, USA, has shuttled between the west coast of America and
Hong Kong on a journey to explore a way out for Hong Kong's
flagging industry by injecting high technology.
</P>
<P>
That is a task Tien, now professor of engineering at Berkeley,
charged himself with in March this year when he accepted Hong
Kong's Executive Chief Tung Chee Hwa's invitation to chair the
Commission on Innovation and Technology.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Professor Tien said:
"For Hong Kong, the most important (thing) is to develop
high-value-added industries."
</P>
<P>
In his view, there are two categories of high-value-added
industries. First, innovated methods or improved technology can
help traditional industries, like toy-making and electronics, to
increase added value of the products.
</P>
<P>
But merely industrial upgrading is not enough, Tien noted. Hong
Kong needs to develop high-value-added frontier industries of the
21st century, such as biotech, telecommunications and new
materials.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy has transformed from manufacturing-based to
service-oriented over the past two decades because of the massive
shift of factories to southern China. Professor Tien said that
the economy base is too narrow to cushion itself from external
shocks like the Asia financial storm.

To be well positioned for the challenges of the knowledge-based
21st century, Hong Kong needs to promote innovation and technology
and engage in high-value-added activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The key (problem) for Hong Kong is that it has no overall
scheme of technology development; it has academic facilities,
technological center and science park, but all done piecemeal,"
said Professor Tien, who is also an adviser on the development of
Silicon Valley, the very epitome of high technology hub in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Tien said that his commission will take in experiences of
success and lessons of failure from other places, like Singapore,
Taiwan and South Korea, in drawing up Hong Kong's blueprint.

<P>
He set store by the role of government, which he said should
not intervene directly in the operation of a certain industry, but
needs to invest in physical, human and technology infrastructure
to create an environment conducive to innovation and technology
development and commercialization.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has one of the world's highest GDP per capita, but
its input in research and development (RD) only accounts for 0.2
to 0.3 percent of its GDP, far below the global average of two to
three percent. Besides, Hong Kong is a place with no RD
center. "This is an anomaly," said Tien.
</P>
<P>
He said what the government can do right now is to foster a
midstream research and development institution. "Without this
link, Hong Kong is unable to attract and accommodate talent;
without talent, innovation and technology can never come forth,"
said Tien. "The top priority is to absorb, reserve and develop
talented people."
</P>
<P>
Tien also stressed that Hong Kong must build up strong
partnership with the mainland in technology development and
application.
</P>
<P>
He was deeply impressed with a three-day trip to the Pearl
River Delta in southern China last weekend, saying: "The prospect
for cooperation between the two places is marvelous. In the
future, Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta will not only be a
financial, trade, information and operation center, but may become
a high-tech industrial hub."
</P>
<P>
Some suggestions, which can be implemented immediately, will be
put forward in an interim report the commission is to submit to
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa by the end of this month, according
to Tien.
</P>
<P>
Other suggestions that need further deliberation will be left
to a final report to be handed in no later than June next year.
</P>
<P>
"This is really an urgent business," Tien said. "We must seize
every minute and second in the fast changing market economy."
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic about the future despite the current economic
trouble," he said. "That's why I accept the job."

<HEADLINE> Tung Meets Visiting Irish Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa reaffirmed Hong Kong's commitment to free market here Friday
when meeting with visiting Prime Minister of Ireland Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
"We have a flexible market which allows very efficient price
adjustment for major production factors. We are aware that it is
necessary to allow market forces to bring our prices to a level at
which the market can afford. We are ready to take the pain arising
from the adjustment process," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
There has been immediate and huge adjustment in the property
market, Tung said, adding the adjustment process has been
extremely efficient.
</P>
<P>
"The labor market has also been undergoing adjustment, but this
will take some time," he told Ahern. Speaking from his former life
as a businessman, Tung pointed out that "employers must be caring
to their employees in the adjustment process in order to bring the
best out of their employees."
</P>
<P>
Ahern congratulated Tung on the successful implementation of
the "One Country, Two Systems" principle as the Special
Administrative Region is stepping into its second year after
returning to China. The prime minister believed that with
efficient market system the Hong Kong economy would rebound
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Tung told Ahern that with huge reserves and in the absence of
foreign debts, Hong Kong would continue to invest heavily in
education and infrastructure, and capitalize on its links with the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Irish investors are welcome to participate in the city's
infrastructure projects, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We are the most international city in Asia and are determined
to remain that way. We welcome investors to participate in our
developments from all over the world," Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
Ahern arrived in Hong Kong Thursday following a visit to the
Chinese mainland and will be leaving tonight.

<HEADLINE> China Names Top Ten Environmental Protection Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The State General
Administration of Environmental Protection today named the
10 cities which made the best contributions to environmental
protection in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 10 cities -- Guilin, Shantou, Haikou, Chengdu, Ningbo,
Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Suzhou, Yantai and Beijing -- were selected
from among 46 key coastal, opened and tourist cities, according to
an official with the State General Administration of Environmental
Protection.
</P>
<P>
The final selection was based on assessment of their
environmental quality, pollution control, as well as environmental
construction and management, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Four cities -- Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Dalian -- have been
named state model environmental protection cities, and they were
not part of this selection.
</P>
<P>
The State General Administration of Environmental Protection
today also made public details of the environmental assessment of
the 46 cities. Shantou, Chengdu, Zhanjiang, Wenzhou, Guilin,
Lianyungang, Yantai, Ningbo, Beihai and Nanchang ranked as the
cities with the best environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
Changsha and Shanghai have been most successful in controlling
pollution. Guilin and Nanjing performed best in environmental
construction, while Shantou and Haikou were the top two cities in
environmental management.
</P>
<P>
The official said China's major cities attached more importance
to and made more investment in the environmental protection last
year.
</P>
<P>
For example, Beijing has instituted a motor vehicle emissions
control program, and also plans to invest 27 billion yuan (3.3
billion U.S. dollars) to improve the city's air quality.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Finish Down But Off Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- An one-and-a-half hour delay
before the Australian sharemarket opened Friday meant investors
took a positive lead from Japan, keeping the losses on the local
bourse to a minimum, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The local market was slightly lower at the close with the all
ordinaries index ending 2.9 points, or 0.11 percent, down at
2,539.9, off a low of 2,525.6 and a high of 2,542.8.
</P>
<P>
Problems with the electronic automatic trading system stalled
the start to around 11:30 local time, but Japan was already off
its lows as was trading in the September share price index futures
contract and the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, investors switched attention from the overnight
falls on northern hemisphere stock exchanges, particularly Wall
Street, and concentrated on Japan, where Thursday the Nikkei 225
contributed to a lower close on the all ordinaries.
</P>
<P>
"Japan had already gone down by the time trading started here,"
Peter Struk of Reynolds &AMP; Co. said.
</P>
<P>
"Our futures were also a lot stronger at that point and our
dollar was picking up, so it was becoming positive before we had
even opened."
</P>
<P>
Doubts of a worldwide cut in interest rates to arrest a global
economic decline fed into the banking sector, forcing the all
industrials index to close down 9.9 points at 4,461.4.
</P>
<P>
Despite weaker base metal prices, stronger oil and gold bullion
prices helped the all resources index to finish in positive
territory, rising 3.8 points to 990.2.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was lackluster on a volume of 234.84 million
shares traded at a value of 790.31 million Australian dollars
(474.18 million U.S. dollars), with 475 falls, 369 rises and 324
stocks steady.
</P>
<P>
Topping volume was Coca-Cola Beverages with a turnover of 36.76
million shares.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Coca Cola Amatil, facing a multi-million dollar
compensation claim in the courts from former chief executive Norb
Cole, fell 7.5 cents, or 1.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gold index gained 26.2 points, 2.62 percent, to 1,026.4.
Gold bullion closed 3.35 higher at 290.40 U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Rio Tinto gained five cents and WMC was up 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
Among the banks, National Australia Bank was up 1.9 cents,
Westpac dipped 1.4 cents, ANZ dropped 30, or 3.28 percent and
Commonwealth Bank fell 20.2, or 1.03 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Stays Firm in Safeguarding Macao's Social Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen today reiterated China's firm commitment to support and
cooperate with the Macao government in its efforts to curb
rising crimes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third plenary meeting of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) that
opened in Beijing today, Qian, who is also chairman of the
Preparatory Committee, said that Macao is still facing challenges
in maintaining public security order and that the Central
Government will closely watch the situation in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in the stance and determination of the
Central Government to help safeguard Macao's social stability,"
the vice premier said, adding that Portuguese Macao authorities
should take full responsibility for local public security before
Macao returns to China in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier expressed his appreciation for what
the four work groups under the Preparatory Committee have achieved
over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
The group in charge of administrative affairs held
advice-seeking meetings between September 3-6 in Macao to solicit
opinions from people of various sectors about how to form the
Selection Committee for the first Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
This is the first activity ever staged by the Preparatory
Committee in Macao, which is democratic and open, and has
increased the understanding and exchange between the Preparatory
Committee and the general public.
</P>
<P>
It has also enhanced the Macao people's awareness of
participating in political and government affairs, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
The legal group has completed the preliminary review of 135
laws of those being enacted in Macao by the Portuguese authorities.
</P>
<P>
The economic group has studied local financial issues including
pension payment for civil servants and fiscal reserve, and the
social and cultural group has held extensive discussions about the
arrangement of public holidays in the region in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Qian praised the generous donations by people in Macao to
flooding areas in Chinese inland areas this summer, saying their
acts testify to the saying that "blood is thicker than water."
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting heard the reports by four groups on their work
progress and examined three draft resolutions concerning setting
up Independent Commission Against Corruption, auditing office and
customs office in the future Macao SAR; the pension payment for
civil servants and public holidays arrangements in the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Rejects Belgrade's Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- German officials Friday rejected
a protest by Belgrade over a statement by German Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe on the Kosovo crisis, saying that Germany will in no
way support separatist and terrorist activities in the Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government Thursday strongly protested what it
called an "aggressive statement which openly threatens to launch
military attacks on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Ruehe in an interview with the German
ZDF television network Tuesday evening, during which the defense
minister said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
could launch a military strike against Kosovo within three to five
weeks if attacks on civilians continued there.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Yugoslav Tanjug news agency, the
Yugoslav government lodged a protest with German charge d'affaires
Rolf Krause at the Foreign Ministry in Belgrade Thursday,
describing Ruehe's statement as a naked support for the Kosovo
separatists and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The German news agency DPA Friday quoted German Foreign
Ministry officials as saying that Ruehe had spoken only within the
context of a NATO debate on a possible military intervention in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
German officials noted that Bonn had also made efforts to
prevent the Kosovo armed rebels, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA),
from getting financial support from Kosovo-Albanians living in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel was also criticized by
Belgrade in the protest which reportedly said that the sanctions
against Belgrade advocated by Kinkel had destabilized the
situation in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> 27 Power Projects Underway in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven power
projects are under construction in Ethiopia to raise the country's
electric power generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper Friday quoted Sendeku Araya, official
from the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, as saying that the
construction of these projects began two years ago with an outlay
of 170 million U.S. Dollars obtained in aid and loan from the
Ethiopian government as well as foreign governments and
organizations.
</P>
<P>
After completion of construction, the projects will raise the
present nation-wide power supply of 371.6 megawatt to 675.6 megawatt,
said Sendeku.
</P>
<P>
Sendeku explained that the projects include the construction
works in the Gilgel Gibe hydroelectric project, the Fincha fourth
unit construction project and the strengthening of some other
power stations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the construction works in Tekeze, Gojeb and Tis
Abbay hydro-power generating projects are well being underway.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation has plans to
construct 12 new hydro-power stations and strengthening of five
ongoing hydro-power stations in the coming five years at a cost
of 1.5 billion U.S. Dollars.

360 million Shillings (6.05 million U.S. Dollars) in checks.
</P>
<P>
This followed a run on the bank by depositors after a company
filed Thursday a lawsuit claiming the bank was facing insolvency
and should be put into receivership, local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) moved quickly to avert the
crisis, appointing Michael Muhindi, a former senior manager with
Standard Chartered, to run the bank.
</P>
<P>
CBK Governor Micah Cheserem also confirmed Thursday that
another bank, Bullion Bank, had reported that it was facing
similar difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem appealed to the depositors - mainly Asians - not to
make panic withdrawals that could cause a ripple effect in the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"If the depositors remain calm, we can save the Trust Bank. It
has many assets and we would like to save it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the Trust Bank, plus all its branches,
will remain closed Friday until the new management takes over.
</P>
<P>
"This arrangement will allow the bank time to improve on its
liquidity through the sale of its properties as well as injection
of additional capital and/or loan recoveries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trust Bank locked out customers in all its branches at 2:00
p.m. Thursday as the directors went into an urgent meeting on the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the Bullion Bank, customers also turned away after being
told the bank was trying to sort out something with the Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Trust Bank deposits by August 31 stood at 9.3 billion
Shillings (156.3 million U.S. Dollars) with 17 branches and 622
employees across the country.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem said the new statutory manager will sell off several
of the bank's properties which should facilitate the re-opening
of the bank "at the earliest opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Reliance Bank was also put under statutory
management after it failed to pay 160 million Shillings in
overnight borrowing. Four of its directors and managers have
been charged for fraud.
</P>
<P>
There are 55 banks and financial institutions in the east
African country.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Troops to Stay in DRC: Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Namibia has confirmed that
its troops, along with troops from Angola and Zimbabwe, would remain
in the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) until the
situation there had stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma said Thursday during his stopover in
Zimbabwe that the allied forces would help train the DRC army to deal
with future invasions after the conflict, South African Press
Association reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in Harare after an hour-long meeting with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe during a stopover on his way home
from a two-day state visit to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"We want peace in the region so that we can concentrate on building
our economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to the DRC last month to
help President Laurent Kabila crush rebels, who started an uprising on
August 2 to overthrow the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said other African countries from outside the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) had expressed their willingness
to help Kabila in his fight against the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said he and Mugabe also discussed developments in Lesotho,
where allegations of electoral fraud have given rise to unrest, as
well as bilateral relations between their countries.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that some Namibian opposition parties were
agitating for the Caprivi Strip of Namibia to become part of Botswana,
the two leaders said they hoped the dispute would be solved amicably.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Big Australian Parties Cautious About Mixed Polling Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian ruling parties
and the opposition party remain cautious during their election
campaign with latest opinion poll showing mixed results.
</P>
<P>
Despite optimistic claims by commentators and analysts that
Prime Minister John Howard is expected to be re-elected, recent
opinion polls suggest a tight contest.
</P>
<P>
An AC Nielsen poll published Friday in Melbourne-based
newspaper The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald has found the
Australian Labor Party, the opposition party, in front at 52
percent on a two party preferred vote, with the ruling Australian
Liberal and National Party coalition lagging four percent behind
on 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
But exactly the opposite result was found in a Morgan telephone
poll out Friday which put the coalition ahead on 52 percent and
Labor behind on 48 percent. Both polls were taken at the start of
the week.
</P>
<P>
A second Morgan poll, taken on a face-to-face basis last
weekend, found the Labor Party at 55 percent compared with the
coalition on 45 percent on a two party preferred basis.
</P>
<P>
The coalition had led the Labor Party in opinion polls during
the first two weeks until September 15, when the nation's leading
newspaper The Australian reported 44 percent polled supported the
Labor, two percentage points ahead of the coalition in the latest
Newspoll.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the polling result, Opposition Leader
Kim Beazley said he would wait for the final poll, adding a shift
to the Labor didn't necessarily indicate the Labor would win
seats.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press said the Newspoll has the best
record of predicting election results.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard last Friday acknowledged that the
election would be a tight one after he was asked to comment on an
AC Nielsen poll showing support for the Labor dropped 3 points to
39 percent while the coalition remained steady on 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
His cautious attitude proved right Friday as the latest poll
found a surge in voter hostility to the government-proposed goods
and services tax (GST), the central piece of the government's tax
reform plan.
</P>
<P>
The Australia Democrats Party, which are widely expected to
hold the balance of power if the ruling coalition won the October
3 election, Friday declared their partial opposition to GST,
saying food should be exempted from taxation under the proposed
GST.
</P>
<P>
A report released Friday by four academics of Australia
Institute said imposing a 10 percent GST on food was unfair and
would hit poorer Australians the hardest.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party, which have been focusing their attack against
the GST and accusing the tax plan of being unfair to low-income
earners, are expected to beef up their attack in the final two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party lost the 1993 federal election because
Australian voters feared introduction of a GST proposed by the
Liberal Party would lead to price hikes, and in the 1996 election
Howard vowed "never ever" to introduce a GST.
</P>
<P>
In order to win the support of voters, both sides are so far
being extra careful about the campaign.
</P>
<P>
For the Howard camp, the key election strategy is caution and
discipline even before the election campaign began.
</P>
<P>
Howard has been careful to manage his public appearances to
limit any chance of having his message obscured by careless
mistakes or images of protests.
</P>
<P>
His camp's caution has extended to the traveling media group,
with details of the coming day's events mostly kept top secret
until only a few hours before the prime minister starts his day.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Howard has pushed the twin themes of his
campaign: the need for tax reform to provide revenue growth to
fund essential services, and his economic record which he says
makes him best qualified to run the economy in the face of the
Asian meltdown.
</P>
<P>
The Labor face an arduous task to defeat the coalition in this
election, since it must win 27 seats more than it holds at present
to gain a majority in parliament, while the coalition hold 90
seats, 15 seats more than the required half of the 148 seats in
parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Share prices nose-dived on
the Singapore Stock Market Friday as the overnight plunge on Wall
Street and pre-weekend profit-taking dampened market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) dropped 28.68 point to
end at 912.74 points with the total turnover falling to 128.74
million units worth 212.72 million Singapore dollars (about 123.86
million U.S. dollars). There were 170 losers against 33 gainers
with 220 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
OUB F was the most active stock of the day as it registered a
volume of 9.20 million stocks traded. It was followed by KepCorp
that had 7.49 million units done. TAC 200 was next with 6.90
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
CMSPort was the top gainer of the day as it gained 40 cents to
close at 1.60 Hong Kong dollars. Venture moved up 25 cents to
finish at 5.25 Singapore dollars. OUS edged up 24 cents to end at
1.14 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, SIA F was the biggest loser of the day as it
lost 75 cents to close at 8.10 Singapore dollars. Elec &AMP; E slid 44
cents to finish at 4.50 U.S. dollars. SIA shed off 40 cents to end
at 5.40 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said market sentiment was also weakened by spreading
rumors of an impending cut in the contribution to the Central
Provident Fund (CPF).
</P>
<P>
The local bourse was awash with rumors that the Singapore
government would announce a CPF cut by up to 15 percentage points,
traders said.

<HEADLINE> India Wants Currency Trade on WTO Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
considering asking the World Trade Organization (WTO) to include
currency trade on its agenda and the Planning Commission will
formulate proposals for the purpose, a government official said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
India is justified in lobbying for a global mechanism to
control currency trade in light of the Asian crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There was earlier a proposal to impose some kind of levy on
currency trade. We could ask the international community to revive
the proposal or ask the WTO to regulate currency movement in the
same manner as it does with commodities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"An attempt has been made to introduce a modicum of fairness in
the trade of commodities. But trade in currency remains free from
any restraint. Currency markets work 24 hours a day. There are no
international agreements on currency trade," he further said.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Successful in Reforming State-owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, a leading industrial base in the country, has made
substantial progress in reforming its state-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
Vice Provincial Governor Chen Chenggao said his province has
assessed the competence of directors in 90 percent of the 1,000
large and medium-sized state-owned firms in the province.
</P>
<P>
In the course of this process, 267 incapable directors were
dismissed, while 860 competent young people were promoted.
</P>
<P>
To raise funds for further development, 24 large state-owned
firms have been listed on either the Shenzhen or Shanghai stock
Exchange, raising 12.3 billion yuan over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Over 500 large and medium-sized enterprises have cooperated
with overseas partners to build joint venture projects involving
a total contractual volume of 3.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sixty key state-owned firms have been chosen to experiment in a
series of reform measures including separating production from
service, reforming the distribution system, and introducing
a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
On average, each of these enterprises will absorb at least 10
million U.S. dollars annually to upgrade technology.
</P>
<P>
The province offered new jobs to 139,000 laid-off workers last
year and for another 250,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
While invigorating large and key state-owned firms, Liaoning
allowed 57 percent of its smaller state firms to operate in a more
flexible way, such as merging with others or setting up joint
stock ventures.

TOKYO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in
Tokyo Friday on a late afternoon wave of buybacks in the wake of
Nikkei index's plunge to its lowest level in 12-and-a-half years
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 123.98 points, or 0.89
percent, from Thursday's close, to end at 13,983.12.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 4.16 points or 0.39 percent to
1,073.22.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section rose to an estimated 453 million
shares from Thursday's 411.73 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan led all shares in volume for the
fourth straight day.
</P>
<P>
Investors sought refuge in food and beverage, pharmaceutical
and other issues, which are seen as more resilient against Japan's
slumping economy.
</P>
<P>
Construction, petroleum and steel shares also advanced despite
their poor earnings forecast, hinting that government-linked
pension funds bought stocks in order to support the market, trader
said.
</P>
<P>
Most big-name exporters, however, fell after the New York and
London stock markets were hit hard Thursday due to fears over a
diminishing global economy, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,341 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
outnumbered losers 750 to 400, with 138 issues remaining
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Detained Kampala Mayor Denied Bail Again in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Mayor of Ugandan capital
Kampala Nasser Sebaggala has been denied bail a second time by
the Massachusetts district court of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came out after a 90-minute hearing late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the court is considering relaxing the conditions for
his release and the trial may take place in October, the New
Vision newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new terms, the embattled mayor has to declare before
the U.S. federal authorities all his assets and bank accounts as
a precondition for the new bail application.
</P>
<P>
Robert Wolf, the presiding judge of the court, was quoted as
saying that he was not satisfied with the 5,000-U.S.-Dollar bail
bond to guarantee the mayor's return to the U.S. for trial if he
was allowed to return to Kampala this time.
</P>
<P>
But he asked both the defense lawyers and the prosecution to
come up with a new set of conditions which might be useful for
the mayor's release.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers also asked for removal of the electronic
bracelet tied onto Sebaggala, saying that it inconvenienced the
mayor so much that it hindered him from performing religious
rites.
</P>
<P>
Before the hearing, the presiding judge received a petition
signed by over 8,000 Ugandans urging for the release of their
mayor.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, led by Theordore Chuag, opposed the five-page
document, arguing that it abuses the U.S. judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala, who was elected mayor of Kampala in April, 1998,
was arrested in New York in mid-June for making false customs
declarations and using false checks in a Boston bank.
</P>
<P>
He was reported to have gone to attend an international
meeting in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest, his opponents back home have accused him of
being without an A level certificate required of this post and
demanded his stepping down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many of his supporters have made a loud cry to the

<HEADLINE> Lusaka Court Threatens to Release Coup Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Lusaka High Court Judge
Japhet Banda has threatened to release all the 79 treason
suspects in connection with last year's foiled military coup on
constitutional bail if the state does not decongest prisons.
</P>
<P>
Banda made the threat in an interview here Thursday, the
government-owned Times of Zambia said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The judge said that he would gave the state up to 14:30 local
time Friday to explain why it was not looking into what he termed
the "poor state" of prisons failure to which he would release the
suspects on bail under the powers vested in him by the country's
criminal procedure code and the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The court can take drastic action if the state does not want
to listen to what I have said about decongesting prisons," Banda
said, adding that he has got powers to give the suspects
constitutional bail even in a treason trial.
</P>
<P>
An irate Banda said he did not want the suspects to die in
prison as he would "not try corpses."
</P>
<P>
He indicated that a report presented to the court by doctors
who conducted medical examination on the suspects at a
Lusaka-based military hospital, disclosed that many suspects were
suffering from respiratory infections and the only way to avoid
cross-infections is to decongest prisons.
</P>
<P>
Banda said that his visit to the prisons last month confirmed
there was congestion and he had since written to Home Affairs
Minister Peter Machungwa, advising the state to take some
suspects to other places of security as enshrined in the Zambian
laws.
</P>
<P>
The on-going trial of the 79 suspects who were charged with
treason has lasted for nearly five months. The process is
disrupted now and then since many suspects suffer different kinds
of diseases due to bad conditions in prison.

<HEADLINE> China's Cancer Recovery Club Gives Patients a New Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Zengguang, a 61-year-old
engineer, just celebrated his tenth birthday several days ago.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to imagine that I have already lived another ten
years since I became ill," Li said with tears in his eyes at his
birthday celebration party. He was diagnosed with cancer of the
stomach ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Li is a member of a Hangzhou cancer recovery club in east
China's Zhejiang Province. The 1,500-member club has helped many
patients prolong their lives since its establishment in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou has a high incidence of cancer. About 3,000 people are
stricken with various kinds of cancers each year there, and about
2,000 die from the disease. The club is the third of its kind in
China, along with those in Shanghai and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"It is the club and all of you, my dear friends, that have
inspired me to fight against the deadly disease.I will treasure my
new life," Li passionately told the club members.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jiapeng, the club's secretary-general said Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays are the days they meet to consult with
each other and foster mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
While the members take their prescribed medical treatments, the
club also organizes psychotherapy, holds lectures on how to fight
against cancer, and provides opportunities to exchange feelings
and experiences.
</P>
<P>
"Cancer does not necessarily lead to death. Besides medical
treatment, optimism is another important factor in conquering the
disease. We should be confident that we will win the battle," said
Wang Tingying, a club member who has been fighting against cancer
of the bladder for more than ten years.
</P>
<P>
Research on 201 cancer patients jointly conducted by the club
and Zhejiang Medical University in 1997 showed that club members
appeared more optimistic and lived longer than other patients.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Min, a club leader, said people from all walks of
life are paying more and more attention to them. And the city
government offered them a special fund earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
He said membership is always on the rise, and many of the
members have taken the club as their second home.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to help my fellow club members out of
suffering, and make the club a cosy home for all of them," said
Yuan Min, a terminal cancer patient who has lived another five
years.

JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Prices Will Not Skyrocket  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China's grain prices will not
skyrocket though they have been rising recently, and are expected
to rise further in the next few months, predicted an official of
the State Development Planning Commission here today.
</P>
<P>
"China has the ability to maintain grain prices at a rational
level," said Bi Jingquan, director of the Price Management
Department of the Commission.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the severe flooding China suffered this summer
will not affect grain production too much."
</P>
<P>
Grain output "is expected to reach the planned amount of 492.5
billion kilograms, or slightly less," according to the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China still has sufficient grain reserves of 200
billion kilograms, and an expected abundant international grain
supply will also set a strong foundation for a stable grain
market in China, Bi said.
</P>
<P>
In August, the price of rice rose in certain major cities in
the north and northeast, according to the China Price Information
Center. But later statistics show that prices have been kept
stable or have even gone down in some cities in early September.
</P>
<P>
Bi attributed the rising prices mainly to the floods, which
affected the grain supply in flood-stricken areas and brought
diminished market expectation for people in other areas.
</P>
<P>
"They believe floods will inevitably raise grain prices, but
this is not always the case," Bi said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Fall at This Week's Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices
dropped again by an average 2 percent at auctions this week,
taking the price falls to 15 percent over the nine weeks of the
selling season to date, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters
(ACWE) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its weekly market report ACWE said the eastern market
indicator declined by 10 cents to end the week at 517 Australian
cents per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
A total of 101,571 bales were offered with 14.5 percent passed
in, comprising 9.8 percent in Sydney, 11.3 percent in Melbourne
and 22.9 percent in Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
ACWE said the market was still dull and suffering badly from
lack of demand.
</P>
<P>
"There was better tone and a bit more confidence in the sale
rooms as the week progressed, reflecting increased interest from a
wider range of customers overseas, but it does need to be kept in
mind that we are talking about the lowest price levels seen for
the last four and a half years in Australian currency terms," ACWE
said.
</P>
<P>
It said many exporters continued to be plagued by contract
defaults with the problem now evident in an increasing number of
markets.
</P>
<P>
In its weekly report Wesfarmers Dalgety, one of Australia's
leading farm produce traders, said the wool prices went down
further this week after the biggest weekly offering of the season
so far hit the market but sales had stabilized by Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said the smaller quantity of 57,336 bales up for sale next
week in Newcastle and Fremantle, two coastal towns in eastern and
western Australia, should provide some support to the market.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Prices Will Not Skyrocket  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China reformed its grain marketing system beginning last May,
asking grain marketing firms to sell grain at slight profits, which
helped increased market grain prices.
</P>
<P>
China's drive against smuggling also increased prices for
edible oil, according to Bi.
</P>
<P>
The slight rise in grain prices is of positive significance, Bi
noted, adding that long-term low grain prices dampen the
enthusiasm of farmers for grain production and causes an overall
loss in the grain marketing sector.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, grain prices are below the country's demand for
slight-profit selling prices," Bi said.
</P>
<P>
Though the increase of grain prices may raise the prices of
other services and commodities, an economist from the State
Council Development and Research Center welcomed such an increase.
</P>
<P>
"It's good news for China's current economy," he said, adding
that China is facing the pressure of deflation now, as the
inflation rate has been kept negative for several months.
</P>
<P>
Analysis shows that a ten percent increase in grain prices will
directly bring the overall price index up by one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Though this is the case, China has made efforts to prevent
grain prices from becoming too high.
</P>
<P>
The commission released a notice recently urging local
governments to adopt measures to crackdown illegal grain market
activities such as windfall profits achieved by driving up grain
prices.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Nike Inc., the world
largest sport footware-maker, reported Thursday its earnings fell
35 percent in the latest quarter, which ended August 31.
</P>
<P>
The profits for the latest quarter were 163.8 million U.S. dollasr
compared to 253.1 million U.S. dollars, the sports marketing giant
said, adding that revenue fell 9 percent to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars
from 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nike also reported orders declined 15 percent to 3.2 billion U.S.
dollars for the latest quarter, compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Asian orders were down the most, 56 percent, while domestic orders
were down 7 percent and European orders decline by just 1 percent, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
Although the earnings of the latest quarter were lower than the
same period last year, it was a significant improvement from the
previous quarter, when Nike reported a 67.7 million U.S. dollars loss.
</P>
<P>
Nike blamed the drop of earnings in the latest quarter for the
continued weak sales, especially in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seals Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel Defense Force (IDF)
has placed a blanket closure on the Palestinian territories since
Friday morning to prevent possible terrorist attacks as the Jewish
new year falls, the army said.
</P>
<P>
The IDF closure on the territories will be in force until next
Wednesday and during this period, no Palestinian workers will be
allowed to go to work in Israel, with the exception of hospital
workers, journalists and those travelling for humanitarian
reasons, the Army Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Tension, already running high since Israeli forces killed two
Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) members near
Hebron last week, increased Thursday after a Jewish settler
killed a Palestinian student and wounded another near the West
Bank city of Ramallah when he opened fire into a group of
Palestinian students.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old settler reported the incident to police
Thursday evening after it had been reported in the media, saying
his car had been stoned by a group of Palestinian high school
students.
</P>
<P>
The IDF will continue to remain on high alert throughout the
new year holiday which begins Sunday, bracing for revenge attacks
as threatened by Hamas for the killing of its two members.

<HEADLINE> Makerere University Tightens Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Makerere University, the
most famous higher learning institution in Uganda, will beef up
security after the latest spate of bomb scares that have rocked
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
This security plan was announced by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor
Opio Epelu at a security sensitization seminar Thursday, the
Monitor daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Those who live on the campus will have to be inconvenienced as
they will continuously have their luggage and cars checked at the
main entrance, said Epelu.
</P>
<P>
All the university staff who own cars will get car stickers
before the end of the year for proper identification, he added.
</P>
<P>
Even these measures cannot guarantee the security of the
university which is surrounded by slums and has no perimeter
fence.
</P>
<P>
The university administration is budgeting for a six-kilometer
fence to be installed around the campus and they have also
decided to establish checking points at the entry of each
building. And all staff members will be issued with
identification tags.
</P>
<P>
Students of the fenceless university are often reported to be
robbed, raped or scared by hooligans who reside in the slums and
attack from bushes surrounding the campus.
</P>
<P>
The university, which has admitted some 8,000 privately-funded
students this academic year, has so few dormitories that most of
the students have to rent rooms outside the campus.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that many other institutions have also stepped
up security measures.
</P>
<P>
The fresh bomb scares following the bombings in Nairobi, Kenya
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, have forced some embassies and
United Nations agencies here to close down.

<HEADLINE> Thai Garment Industry Attracts Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's light industry,
particularly the garment business, was the most attractive sector
to new investors seeking promotional privileges from the Board of
Investment (BOI) in August, a BOI report available Friday said.
</P>
<P>
Some 39 projects with a total investment of 11.2 billion baht
(280 million U.S. dollars) received promotional privileges in the
month, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 10 were in light industries such as textile,
garments and toys, eight in electronics and electrical appliances,
seven in chemicals, paper and plastic products, six in services,
five in metal products, machinery and equipment and three in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Textile and garment manufacturers topped the number of
investors obtaining privileges, with projects that would create
1,266 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The industry is expected to grow further as the government has
decided to cut import tariffs on textile machinery to 5 percent
from the previous 20-30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thai garments have become increasingly competitive in
higher-end markets in the United States, the European Union (EU)
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
But for middle- and low-income markets, Thai exporters face
heavy competition from lower-wage countries such as China and
India.
</P>
<P>
The report said a major obstacle textile and garment
manufacturers are facing now is an expected decrease in import
quotas from the United States and the EU.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of the total quotas given by the United
States were used during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Another problem for manufacturers is the inability to buy raw
materials due to cash-flow problems. Many bankers are reluctant to
extend credits to exporters.
</P>
<P>
An increase in production costs due to high lending rates is
also undermining the country's competitiveness, the report said.

Ryzhkov Rejects Post of Deputy Premier
</P>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Speaker of the State
Duma Vladimir Ryzhkov has rejected the post of deputy prime
minister in charge of social issues, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the Duma,
or lower house of parliament, at the beginning of a plenary
session Friday, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin appointed Ryzhkov deputy premier on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov quoted Ryzhkov as describing the appointment as "an
arranged marriage."
</P>
<P>
"Vladimir Ryzhkov will later explain everything himself,"
Seleznyov said.
</P>
<P>
The news of his appointment reached Ryzhkov, who is also a
prominent member of the Our Home Is Russia (NDR) parliamentary
group, while he was in Strasbourg, France.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning to Moscow from Strasbourg on Thursday, Ryzhkov
told reporters that he was willing to work in the government but
had some misgivings.
</P>
<P>
"My conviction as a human being and a citizen is that whoever
can do something useful for Russia and its people must do so. For
this reason I am prepared to work in the government. I am not
shirking this responsibility or this work," the Interfax news
agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"However, I am not quite sure that this is the position where
I can be most useful," Ryzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov, born in 1966, graduated from Altai State University
and taught there after graduation. He joined the NDR in 1995, and
was elected State Duma first deputy chairman representing the NDR
in 1997.

<P>
ANKARA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- During a meeting with his Iranian counterpart K.R. Narayanan
on Thursday, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that the
nuclear contest between India and its rival Pakistan would make
the situation in South Asia more unstable.
</P>
<P>
He told the visiting Indian head of state that it is Turkey's
hope that India and Pakistan could solve the issue in a cautious
manner.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem has said that to put
pressure on the Turkish Cypriot side only could not lead to a
solution to the protracted Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cem is expected to discuss with some foreign ministers the
Cyprus issue during his attendance at the U.N. General Assembly
meeting to be held in New York late this month.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical)
</P>
<P>
-- The Afghan Taliban regime has said that it has no intention
to threaten the secular system in Turkey, but Ankara should give
up its support for the Uzbek militia leader Rashid Dostam.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has expressed concern over Taliban's control of most of
the Afghan territory for fear that it would export Islam to the
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Africa Online to Start Roaming E-Mail Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Africa Online, a leading
Internet service provider in Africa, will next month launch a new
e-mail service which will enable travelers to get their e-mail
messages and reply as they arrive.
</P>
<P>
This service is a response to the need among the firm's
customers for easy access to their electronic mail messages,
Africa Online's Product manager David Ochanda said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have grouped with a consortium of international service
providers, known as the Gric Alliance, through which the company
can provide a continuity of service for its customers wherever
they are," said Ochanda.
</P>
<P>
Using the so-called roaming service, people traveling abroad
will no longer live in fear of returning home to a stack of
unattended electronic mail, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Users will be able to access their accounts on their laptop
computers while still abroad.
</P>
<P>
The roaming service allows customers to dial into numbers of
Internet providers who have signed into a consortium in the
countries where they are visiting.
</P>
<P>
The service eliminates the need for international telephone
calls and minimizes chances of bad connections, cut-offs or
garbled messages, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The manager said the service is mainly designed for business
travelers who are out of the country for at least three to six
times a year, employees of international and multinational
organizations, as well as students studying abroad.
</P>
<P>
Previously, people traveling out of the reach of their service
providers, especially in Kenya, have had to suspend their
accounts for the duration of their absence.

<HEADLINE> Zhoushan Announces Fisheries Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The city of Zhoushan in east
China's coastal Province of Zhejiang plans to vigorously expand
its fisheries sector over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to produce 1.25 million tons of aquatic products
annually by the year 2002, with the annual output value expected
to hit seven billion yuan, according to Mayor Wang Huizhong.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed hope that science and technology will contribute
55 percent of the growth of the fisheries industry and that
related efforts will help all local fishing villages become more
affluent.
</P>
<P>
Zhoushan, a city consisting of 1,339 islets, is one of China's
major fishing grounds. The city accounts for more than 70 percent
of Zhejiang Province's total exports of aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
However, the prolonged fishing ban, shrinking fishing grounds
and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas which
went into effect in China in 1996, have made it more difficult for
the city to realize its goals, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The city has decided to follow a sustainable development
strategy based on the development of fisheries and to introduce
measures to readjust the fishing structure, introduce scientific
and technological achievements to improve related operations and
develop international and domestic markets for aquatic
products. The goal is to maintain high growth for the fisheries
sector.
</P>
<P>
Zhoushan's 12,000 vessel fishing fleet produced 1.17 million
tons of aquatic products in 1997. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Slight Increase of Foreign Capital Use in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China used 3.54 billion
U.S. dollars of direct foreign funds in August, up 0.54 percent
over the same month last year, according to statistics just

Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The amount of contractual direct foreign investment stood at

an increase of 2.4 percent over August last year.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, the amount of contractual direct

<HEADLINE> People's Daily, CCTV Join Hands to Supervise Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China's two most influential
media outlets, the "People's Daily" or organ of the ruling
Communist Party, and the China Central Television (CCTV), have
worked out a plan to jointly criticize government corruption.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, reporters from the two press
organizations will probe into social dilemmas and hot issues and
report them simultaneously in an effort to arouse greater
attention from top leaders and the public.
</P>
<P>
As a trial run, the two media giants reported on a serious case
on September 16 in their "Social Weekly" and "Focus Report"
segments, respectively. The case concerned illegal fund raising
activities during the law enforcement process at a local
anti-corruption bureau in Fuzhou Prefecture in east China's
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that superior departments and procuratorate
organizations decided to deal with the case after it was
exposed by the media.
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily" was appraised by UNESCO as one of the top ten
most influential newspapers in the world in the 1990s. CCTV,
China's leading national television station, now has about 800
million viewers across the country.
</P>
<P>
"This cooperation demonstrates our determination to carrying out
supervision of the government in an all-round way and at a
higher level," said Sun Jie, producer of the "Focus Report".
</P>
<P>
Li Youcun, director of the Readers Department of "People's
Daily," said that as the Party's organ, the paper's function of
supervising the government has not yet been fully displayed, and
its cooperation with CCTV will help push the paper's reform in
this respect.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, neither medium is satisfied with the success
they have already achieved, and they have made plans for further
actions.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Growing Miracle On Pamirs Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- "What fine wheat!" exclaims
50-year-old farmer Muala standing in a wheat field 3,600
meters above sea level on the Pamirs Plateau, northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Muala and his fellow Tajik countrymen of Budaer Township are
joyful over the 3.33 hectares of wheat maturing on the plateau,
but they are hardly aware that they have made history by
establishing a new world's record for growing wheat at high
elevations, fully 300 meters over the old mark.
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle in wheat-growing history. The limits were 3,000
meters to 3,300 meters above the sea level," noted Chen Xingwu, an
associate research fellow of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences
of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Budaer Township belongs to the Tajik Autonomous County of
Taxkorgan in Xinjiang, where inadequate grain has long been a
cause of poverty. This year, the county experimented with over 133
hectares of wheat with the help of plastic sheeting, all of which
were ripe with high yields recently.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the key to planting wheat at high elevations
lies in keeping in the warmth, and the plastic sheeting has proved
efficient.
</P>
<P>
But Muala seems to be little interested in the scientific
implications of the experiment. What delights him is that his 0.4
hectares of land reaped 1.8 tons of wheat, which is enough to
feed his whole family. Last year, the family only harvested one
ton of highland barley.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the successful experiment means a lot to this
county of 28,000 people who are still living below the
national poverty line.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to expand this wheat experiment to 1,333 hectares
within two years, and bid good-bye to poverty in the new century,"
said Rozi Gulibayi, the head of the county, who is also a deputy
to the National People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> China Can Win 20 Golds at Asian Games, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China can achieve its goal
of winning 20 gold medals from track and field in the upcoming
13th Bangkok Asian Games without coach Ma Junren's runners, a top
official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shang Xiutang, secretary general of the Chinese Athletics
Association (CAA), said that the absence of "Ma's Family Army"
will not affect China's status as Asia's leader in track and
field.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident to win 20 gold medals at the Asian Games in
December," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese athletes, who usually bury their heads in training and
adjustment after a whole year's competition in December, are
working hard to adapt themselves to Bangkok's hot conditions.
</P>
<P>
China won 22 out of 43 gold medals from track and field in the
12th Asian Games at Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994. World women's
3,000 meters record holder Qu Yunxia, a member of "Ma's Family
Army", stroke a golden double in the 800 and 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
The middle-and long-distance runners of "Ma's Family Army"
have been disqualified from taking part in the Asian Games as the
unorthodox coach Ma Junren failed to participate in any of this
season's national Grand Prix events as required.
</P>
<P>
"We will not change the rules to let Ma's team go," Shang
said.

HOHHOT, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Inner Mongolia's last
3,000-odd flood victims who were forced to live in the open
on barren hills finally left the wilderness on Thursday and
moved into newly built housing, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Heavy flooding on Nenjiang River and its tributaries in Inner
Mongolia this summer destroyed 378,600 houses and left 344,000
people homeless.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem of flood victims living in the open air
and ensure them a safe winter, the regional government
quickly distributed flood relief funds and materials among the flood
victims who are using them to rebuild houses destroyed by the
floods.
</P>
<P>
Some 288 schools which were unable to begin classes on September 1
because of the floods had all been opened to students by September 10,

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Amal Group to Reform to Counterbalance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's leading Muslim
guerrilla group Amal movement is planning to launch fundamental
reforms in a bid to counterbalance the growing influence by the
country's another important Muslim group Hezbollah, the Daily Star
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the ninth congress of the Amal movement which convenes
Friday, a series of reform will be adopted by the party aimed at
restructuring the movement and introducing new blood, the party's
political bureau member Mohammed Abdel-Hamid Beydoun told the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Amal, led by the country's House Speaker Nabih Berri and
created during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, is vying for the
dominance of the country's largest single sect of 1.2 million
Shiite Muslims with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The two groups are separately waging guerrilla wars trying to
oust 1,000 Israeli troops from south Lebanon where Israel set up a
self-declared security zone in 1985 to protect its north from
cross-border guerrillas' attack.
</P>
<P>
Achieving more victories against Israeli soldiers than the
Amal, Hezbollah gained an increasing popularity among the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Beydoun said the Amal's political bureau is expected to reduce
its number from around 25 to nine or 10 and "a quiet revolution
will take place at the top" instead of the grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
He explained that working from the top down would hasten the
necessary changes to the movement.
</P>
<P>
The paper said a political manifesto to be issued at the
end of the congress will outline the party's detailed reforms.

<HEADLINE> Another Kenyan Bank Placed Under Statutory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Trust Bank Ltd., ranked
six in Kenya's banking industry, has been placed under statutory
management of the central bank Thursday after it failed to honor
360 million Shillings (6.05 million U.S. Dollars) in checks.
</P>
<P>
This followed a run on the bank by depositors after a company
filed Thursday a lawsuit claiming the bank was facing insolvency
and should be put into receivership, local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) moved quickly to avert the
crisis, appointing Michael Muhindi, a former senior manager with
Standard Chartered, to run the bank.
</P>
<P>
CBK Governor Micah Cheserem also confirmed Thursday that
another bank, Bullion Bank, had reported that it was facing
similar difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem appealed to the depositors - mainly Asians - not to
make panic withdrawals that could cause a ripple effect in the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"If the depositors remain calm, we can save the Trust Bank. It
has many assets and we would like to save it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that the Trust Bank, plus all its branches,
will remain closed Friday until the new management takes over.
</P>
<P>
"This arrangement will allow the bank time to improve on its
liquidity through the sale of its properties as well as injection
of additional capital and/or loan recoveries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trust Bank locked out customers in all its branches at 2:00
p.m. Thursday as the directors went into an urgent meeting on the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the Bullion Bank, customers also turned away after being
told the bank was trying to sort out something with the Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Trust Bank deposits by August 31 stood at 9.3 billion
Shillings (156.3 million U.S. Dollars) with 17 branches and 622
employees across the country.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem said the new statutory manager will sell off several
of the bank's properties which should facilitate the re-opening
of the bank "at the earliest opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Reliance Bank was also put under statutory
management after it failed to pay 160 million Shillings in
overnight borrowing. Four of its directors and managers have
been charged for fraud.
</P>
<P>
There are 55 banks and financial institutions in the east
African country.

Yu Guoming, deputy director of the Public Opinions Research
Institute of People's University, said that thanks to the joint
efforts of these two big news sources, the accuracy,
authoritativeness and timeliness of the reports are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the cooperation is conducive to putting an
in-depth report and an on-the-spot interview together, which can
ensure that the report is more profound, vivid and soul-touching,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Lu Mingjun, a "People's Daily" reporter participating in the
joint program, noted that the media usually encounters many
obstacles created by various sectors and persons when they prepare
to criticize a government department for its wrong doing.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation between several news organizations will
undoubtedly strengthen their ability to endure the pressure," he
said, explaining that this case was an typical example.
</P>
<P>
The supervision of the government by the media will be a unique
way in China for exposing official misbehaviors and criticizing
social corruption, in order to guarantee the people's democratic
rights.
</P>
<P>
This issue was raised again at the National People's Congress
this year, when many deputies called for stronger supervision of
the government by the media to eradicate corruption and ensure
that the country is governed by law.
</P>
<P>
Top Chinese leaders have recently repeatedly urged that media
watch be enhanced, particularly, cooperation between news
organizations to create a healthier social environment.
</P>
<P>
Sources revealed that "People's Daily" is conducting some
reforms, including a new column aimed at encouraging more people
to voice their views in the paper.
</P>
<P>
CCTV made some changes earlier this year to update its "Focus
Report" by including more sensitive subjects and cover a wider
range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Journalists Association established a special
committee last month to safeguard the rights of reporters and
editors and encourage them to deal with problems more boldly.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Yu, the supervision of the government by
the media has become commonplace nationwide, and China is entering
a period of stronger confidence, freer speech and more
transparency.
</P>
<P>
"However, the media is not the solution to every problem. We
still need a more tolerant social atmosphere, as well as a more
open and law-abiding system," he added.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Stresses Importance of Hosting APEC 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister

Jenny Shipley Friday stressed the importance of hosting next
year's
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings by her country,
saying the meetings "will set the eyes of the world on New
Zealand."
</P>
<P>
"APEC 1999 is a tremendous opportunity for huge numbers of
people
from around the world to view New Zealand and our region -- either

directly as visitors, or through international coverage," Shipley
said while speaking on the occasion of launching the official
branding for APEC 1999 at Auckland's Mt. Roskill Grammar School.
</P>
<P>
According to a media statement released here by the Office of
the
New Zealand Prime Minister, Shipley said, "APEC has a combined
population of nearly 3 billion people and represents more than
half
of the total world income and half of world trade."
</P>
<P>
"Chairing APEC gives New Zealand an unprecedented opportunity
to
influence the shape of this forum's work on trade and economic
cooperation. We are looking forward to hosting 21 of the world's
most
powerful leaders, more than 11,000 delegates and the international

news media during APEC."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shipley said the APEC logo will either be in
black
or in white with the New Zealand Way fern incorporated into it and

has nine distinctive New Zealand colors and images attached to it.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has some of the best scenery, food, culture,
products
and businesses in the world and APEC will be an unparalleled
opportunity for New Zealanders to showcase their corner of the
world,
Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
According to a schedule recently released by New Zealand
Minister
of Foreign Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon, the APEC Leaders'
Meeting
will be held on September 12 and 13, 1999, in Auckland, and more
than
10 related meetings to prepare for the leaders' meeting are
scheduled
to be organized in Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch and Rotorua
next year.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Government Urged to Ban Trout Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Party, the major

opposition party in New Zealand, is proposing legislation to
overturn
a government decision to allow the importation of raw trout meat.
</P>
<P>
Wellington-based Evening Post reported Friday that the bill
would
be drafted by Mark Burton, a member of the parliament from the
Labor
Party.
</P>
<P>
The action of the Labor Party seems to be a response to
complaints
about a recent decision to lift restrictions on imported trout and

salmon, which were published Friday in The Dominion, another
Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted some New Zealand salmon farmers as saying the
decision of the New Zealand government would give Australian
exporters free rein in New Zealand markets but New Zealand salmon
farmers were banned from exporting to Australia.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand King Salmon company chief executive Paul Steere
said
the New Zealand industry generally supports free trade, but not if
it
meant "we've invited the Australians to come and play on our field

but we aren't allowed to have a return match."
</P>
<P>
It is "silly" that it is illegal to farm trout in New Zealand
but
Australian trout farmers could export trout to New Zealand to be
sold in competition with New Zealand salmon, he added.
</P>
<P>
Benmore Salmon farm manager Brian Hutton said the decision to
lift
the ban on fresh trout and salmon imports would lead to "one way
traffic" in the fresh salmon trade with Australia.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Australia has blocked fresh salmon
exports
from New Zealand and other countries on the grounds that the fish

could introduce disease.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tanzanian Govt Vows to Control Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Gu Ming)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government vowed to keep down the alarming rate of road accidents
which killed five people and injured 34 others daily on average
across the country.
</P>
<P>
During last three years, 5,098 people were killed and 37,624
others were injured in more than 42,000 road accidents in the
country, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has said.
</P>
<P>
The accidents have caused huge losses to people's lives and
property, wasting resources that could be diverted for economic
development, Sumaye deplored.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents, a pain in the flesh of the government, have
become a leading killer in the east African country together with
AIDS, malaria and cholera.
</P>
<P>
Even with relatively fewer motor vehicles, Tanzanian drivers
caused 23 times more accidents than their British counterparts --
and also beat Swedish drivers 16 times, said Chairman of the
Tanzania Roads Association (TRA), Alloyce Mushi, late last month.
</P>
<P>
About 54 percent of road accidents have been caused by
reckless driving, Sumaye said on Monday while launching a
national road safety week in Mbeya in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanians still have a fresh memory of this year's biggest
road accident in which 70 people were killed and 25 others
injured.
</P>
<P>
The reckless driver on May 3 ran the risk of bringing an
overloaded bus, christened "No Challenge," onto a flooded bridge
in the northern region of Tanga. Unfortunately, it was washed
away by turbulent into the middle of the river, causing a tragedy
that shocked and saddened the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
Drunk driving, haphazard issuance of driving licences by
corrupt policemen, poor performance of second-handed automobiles
and rough roads have also been cited by TRA as main causes of
accidents.
</P>
<P>
To bring road carnage under control, the government has
pledged to enforce traffic rules, inspect vehicles to make sure
that they are roadworthy and educate drivers as well as
vulnerable groups such as pupils, cart pullers and cyclists on
road safety.
</P>
<P>
A booklet containing "goals, responsibilities and strategies"
for enhancement of security awareness was circulated to the
public by the Dar es Salaam Road Safety Committee this week.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents have also been under fire of the local
newspapers these days, which described the road as a "death trap"
and urged the government to find effective ways in controlling
the chronic problem.
</P>
<P>
The government has raised a goal to reduce senseless road
accidents by 20 percent in six years.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Elections in 11 districts
in mid-western development region of Nepal began Friday morning
with no report of violence so far.
</P>
<P>
Chairman, vice chairman and members will be elected for the
district development committees (DDC) in Dolpa, Mugu, Humla,
Jumla, Kalikot, Dang, Piuthan, Banke, Bardiya, Dailekh and
Surkhet.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Election Commission said that there is no
report of violence so far and the elections are going on
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Political parties are said to form alliance with one another in
the elections, which are crucial for them in the general elections
due to be held before November 1999.
</P>
<P>
DDC elections could not be held last year in these districts
because elections for village development committees (VDC) there
were not completed due to violence by ultra-leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
They were not held as well in Jajarkot, Rukum, Sallyan and
Rolpa, the other four districts in the mid-western development
region, and Gorkha, Arghakhanchi in western Nepal, Ilam in eastern
Nepal and Parsa in central Nepal, because VDC elections could not
be held there.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Election Commission said that elections
in most VDCs in the four districts in mid-western region and
Gorkha and Ilam are scheduled for September 26.
</P>
<P>
VDC polls and DDC polls have been completed this year in
Arghakhanchi and Parsa respectively.
</P>
<P>
Polls were held last year respectively for VDCs and
municipalities in May and DDCs in July in 56 of the 75 districts
in Nepal, in which the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) won a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
But most of the mayors, deputy mayors, DDC chairmen, vice
chairmen and members elected at that time have joined the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML), which broke
away from the CPN-UML in March this year and joined the government
in late August.

<P>
DHAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- About 11,000 industrial units
have been badly affected by the severe floods that gripped
Bangladesh for over two months, and the losses to the sector will
exceed 20 billion taka (425.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Bangladesh Chamber of Industry (BCI)
President Sharif Afzal Hossain while apprising the representatives
of donor countries and agencies of the flood damage to the
industrial sector at a meeting here Thursday, The Bangladesh
Observer daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The loss to the garment sector would be more than six billion
taka (127.7 million dollars), small and cottage industries over
5.7 billion taka (121.3 million dollars), and other industrial
units would incur a loss of about eight billion taka (170.2
million dollars), according to a preliminary assessment of the
damage by the deluge, he told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The BCI chief urged the donors to provide soft-term loans to
the private sector for the post-flood rehabilitation programs,
particularly in the infrastructure and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank replied that the donor agencies would assess the extent of

<HEADLINE> Experts Expect Reverse of Bulgaria's Tumbling Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite plunge in Bulgaria's
stock prices and trade volume on Thursday under influence of the
Russian economic crisis, experts foresee a market reverse soon.
</P>
<P>
Stock prices may see a reverse tendency and may even double
within a month or two, said experts of the Bulgarian Association
of Licensed Investment Intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are not expected to show interest in
Bulgaria in the following month, but a possible additional release
of securities may attract their attention. A new issue would also
boost trade, but this effect cannot be achieved by Bulgarian
investors alone, the experts believed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Board of Directors of the Bulgarian Stock
Exchange (BSE) is expected to adopt Association-drafted rules of
procedure of a new market, which will not require the presence of
the brokers on the Exchange, according to Kamen Kolchev, chairman
of the governing board of the association.
</P>
<P>
The rules, to be included in the BSE articles, have already
received unofficial approval from BSE leadership. A second stage
of the project involves building up information channels between
the BSE and each of the investment intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
The new market would not differ from the currently operating
free market from the point of view of the clients, said Kolchev.
</P>
<P>
One of the rules involves introducing a 10 per cent barrier
for the daily fluctuation of prices. Currently this barrier equals
5 percent on the official market while on the free market trading
is unrestricted.
</P>
<P>
The association also insists on abandoning the practice of
frustrating deals. Under the law, the stock exchange is
irreversible; it is the brokers who carry the responsibility for a
wrongly struck deal, said Kamen Kolchev. In his view, a frustrated
deal is used to manipulate the market.

</P>
<P>
Mrs Stoyanova said the forum seeks to emphasize the working of
non-political channels toward understanding in the region.
</P>
<P>
It also seeks to launch a dialogue on sustainable development
in southeastern Europe, to improve the image of the region and
promote the role of non-governmental organizations and society.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the conference plan to discuss the issues on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the forum will include women working in the
fields of public opinion as well as the wives of the political
elite in Balkan countries.

Bulgarian opera singer Raina Kabaivanska, and jazz singer Jildaz
Ibrahimova are also expected at the forum.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italy's Fiat Auto Company Not to Change Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Southeast Asian financial
crisis will not lead Italian auto company Fiat to change its plans
to penetrate global markets, Fiat top executive said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the world launch of the Alfa Romeo's new luxury
saloon, the 166, Fiat Auto Managing Director Roberto Testore said
the Italian car maker's global reach had been proven by the 166's
predecessor, the 156, which was sold in 57 countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that this figure would be outstripped by the new model,
which is expected to be sold in 60 countries starting in late
October.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis would not affect Fiat's global plans. "Fiat
Auto has made a precise choice to make its industrial and
commercial efforts in countries like Brazil, Argentina, Poland,
Russia, Turkey, India and China," Testore said.
</P>
<P>
Investing in these markets means investing in the future, the
managing director said. He expected the sales to Latin America,
East Europe, India and China would rise by 50 percent by the year
2007.
</P>
<P>
Although those markets have been affected by the financial
turmoil, he stressed that Fiat would succeed in handling the
current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic market, Testore said car sales will fall from

<HEADLINE> Armed Group Members Surrender in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 members of anti-
government armed groups laid down their arms to the government in
August, The New Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
These armed group members, which include those from the ethnic
Kayin National Union (KNU), Shan State United Revolutionary Army
(SURA) and the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF),
"exchanged arms for peace" with the government at different
military command areas.
</P>
<P>
In armed opposition to the Myanmar government, the KNU and the
ABSDF reportedly operate on the Myanmar-Thai border, while the
SURA is based in its region in eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
In April, former KNU Central Committee member Phado Aung San
defected to the government side with more than 200 of his men in
Hpa-an, the country's Kayin state, as part of KNU's surrender.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, a total of 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups in
the country have made peace with the government, leaving the KNU,
led by Bo Mya, still in insurgency on the Myanmar-Thai border
although four rounds of peace talks have been held between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The government said it still permits the turned-in armed groups
to retain their arms for "self-protection and area-defense".

<HEADLINE> Thailand Asks to Join Disarmament Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has applied for full
membership in the Conference on Disarmament so as to play a bigger
role in the disarmament process, a Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Kitti Wasinondh, deputy Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the
application had already been forwarded to Britain's permanent
representative to the United Nations, Ian Soutar, as that country
is chairman of this year's conference, the Nation newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand, which is now an observer to the Conference on
Disarmament, applied for full membership because it recognizes the
importance of the conference. It comes at a time when the
international community, including the Southeast Asian region, is
encouraged to disarm," Kitti said.
</P>
<P>
He said Soutar has agreed to forward the Thai application to
the 60-member conference. Thailand is among 24 countries that have
applied for full membership.
</P>
<P>
Three countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) -- Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam -- are members of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
However, Kitti said the conference has agreed that it will put
a moratorium on new members for a while and it has not yet said
when it would resume consideration. Thailand hopes its application
will be considered when the conference decides to accept new
members.

<HEADLINE> People's Parliament Formed in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A People's Parliament Elected
in the 1990 Multi-Party General Election of Myanmar was formed
unilaterally here Thursday, according to an announcement of the
Representing Committee of the Parliament Elected in the Election
(RCPEE) available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The RCPEE, at its first meeting held Thursday, elected U Saw
Mya Aung, chairman of the Rakhine League for Democracy (RLD),
chairman of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The duration of the parliament will last until a state
constitution is prescribed by it, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The convening of the parliament was supported by organizations
including four ethnic armed groups of Shan, Kayin, Kayan and Mon,
three of which have already made peace with the present military
government, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), it
said.
</P>
<P>
It also stated that all laws, decrees, orders and directives
issued since September 18, 1988, when the former military
government, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC)
took over the power of state, shall be unlawful until approval by
the People's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the RCPEE meeting demanded unconditional
release of all political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
It called on the Armed Forces to protect the state and the
people, safeguard the constitution and carry out purely the
national defense duty, upholding people's desire.
</P>
<P>
The RCPEE will work for the successful convening of a People's
Parliament Elected in the 1990 Election, the announcement added.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member RCPEE was formed Wednesday with Chairman of the
National League for Democracy (NLD) U Aung Shwe as its chairman, U
Than Tun and U Aye Tha Aung as secretaries. Other members include
U Tin Oo, NLD vice-chairman, and Aung San Suu Kyi, NLD general
secretary.
</P>
<P>
So far, the SPDC has no reaction upon the announcement of the
RCPEE.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 general election, participated in by 93 political
parties, the NLD won 396 out of the 485 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
But no parliament has emerged since the end of the election,
the RCPEE announcement said.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Terrorist Group ETA Announces fresh Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The armed Basque separatist
organization ETA announced an indefinite ceasefire on Thursday, to
which the Spanish government reacted cautiously.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published in a Basque newspaper, ETA said its
attempts to gain "autonomy" through violence have failed and that
giving up violence would be the only chance to win its rights.
</P>
<P>
However, ETA will not lay down its arms nor dissolve its
logistic and defense structure, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
ETA, set up three decades ago as an underground resistance
group to the Franco regime, intends to win autonomy for the Basque
region, a place in northern Spain sharing a border with France.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the 1970s, it was becoming a terrorist group posing
danger to society.
</P>
<P>
In its bloody drive for independence, ETA has killed 768
people, more than half of them Spanish security forces. It has
also made attempts to assassin King Juan Carlos I and current
Prime Minister Jose Aznar.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government expressed cautious welcome to the ETA
ceasefire announcement, saying that ETA must match its words with
deeds.
</P>
<P>
ETA had made similar statements in its 30-year history, but it
resumed violence before long.

<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province, an economic
powerhouse in east China, plans to introduce the management system
used at the Suzhou Industrial Park, a Sino-Singapore joint venture
established in 1994, to other development zones in the province.
</P>
<P>
Vice Governor Wang Rongbing said the park has made outstanding
achievements in building a lean, but nonetheless efficient
administrative and civil service departments. Wang pointed out
that the park has also established a planning system based on
related laws and regulations, formed both a public welfare service
system and residential areas similar to those found in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The park has combined economic development with overall urban
planning and management in line with Singaporean practices.
</P>
<P>
The city has completed first phase construction of an eight
sq.km. section of a new industrial park which is scheduled to
enter full-scale operations early next century.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the zone is home to 127
foreign-funded enterprises, including 109 high-tech
manufacturers. The zone has attracted foreign investments of over
4.25 billion US dollars, with the average project investments
approaching 30 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kings Name Eighth Coach Since 1985 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Rick Adelman signed as
the head coach of the NBA Sacramento Kings on Thursday in
Sadramento, California, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
This is the eighth head coach for the Kings since 1985 and the
team hopes Adelman can repeat his feat that helped Portland to
the NBA Finals twice.
</P>
<P>
"With my experience and with a good staff, we can make
something happen here," Adelman was quoted as saying. "There's a
young group of players here that can only get better."
</P>
<P>
The Kings have not had a winning season since moving to
Sacramento in 1985. The coaching post has heen vacant since
August 18, when the team fired Eddie Jordan, who left with a
33-64 career record. Adelman said he will begin an immediate
search for a coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody I've coached I tell him, whatever their history,
we start today," Adelman said. "I'm usually very up front with
them. And I find that players respond to that. Most players want
to feel not only can the team succeed but can you help me succeed
too."
</P>
<P>
Adelman has a 357-252 record in six seasons with Portland and
Golden State. He had two seasons left on a four-year,
4-million-dollar contract with Golden State when he was fired
after the 1997 season.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian industrial
output will drop 0.6 percent this year because of the economic
chaos caused by the international financial crisis, the press here

</P>
<P>
Myriam Thereza Ferreira, who conducted the survey, said that an

percent growth, said the IBGE.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Said to Manipulate Sri Lanka Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's economic experts
have charged that foreign interests are manipulating Sri Lanka's
stock market, the local newspaper The Island reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Colombo's stock market suddenly took an upward surge on the
first three days of this week but slumped on Thursday. Analysts
here see this as a manifestation of profit-taking by foreign
interests who have manipulated prices.
</P>
<P>
The All Share Index (ASI) fell on Thursday by 7.19 points and
the Sensitive Index came down by 11.77. The ASI which was 506.97
on Wednesday came down to 499 Thursday while the Sensitive Index
which was 779.86 Wednesday dropped to 606.78 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the surge was due to three large parcels of prime
stocks changing hands. Also on Wednesday foreign buying amounted
to 16.36 million rupees (some 250,000 U.S. dollars) and sales went
up to 43 million rupees (650,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday foreign buying was limited to only 1 million
rupees while sales amounted to 15 million rupees (227,000
dollars). This meant there was an outflow of 14 million rupees
(210,000 dollars) in foreign money from the market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile economists and analysts have questioned how the
economy could be said to be surging when the Central Bank itself
has downgraded the gross domestic product growth this year from 6
to under 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The analysts also said the reason for the stagnant economy is
the artificial maintenance of the Sri Lankan rupee's value. What
they said is required is to bring down interest rates together
with a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
To make Colombo a free investment center, they added, the rupee
 should be allowed to find its level by trading in the market.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Toronto Service Tamil Task Force
have recently arrested a Sri Lankan Tamil rebel leader, according
to reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Muralitharan Nadarajah, a leader of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been charged with impersonation,
obstruction of justice and having false documents and functions in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He was under investigation by the RCMP Militant Immigration and
Passport section for allegedly being in Canada under false
identification and for his alleged leadership role in LTTE
activities in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Nadarajah was produced before the Scarborough Court on
September 16.
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland, he had been arrested with 16 LTTE activists in
1996 for being the organizer of a criminal organization extorting
money from Tamils. He was later released on bail pending further
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a civil war against the Sri Lankan
government since 1983 for a separate state in the country.

<HEADLINE> German Minister's Statement Angers Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government
Thursday lashed at what it called an "aggressive statement which
openly threatens to launch military attacks at the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia" from German Defense Minister Folker Rije.
</P>
<P>
A strong protest was lodged when the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
summoned German charge d'affaires ad interim Rolf Krause to
deliver him a note of protest.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yugoslav official Tanjug news agency, the
official note sees the "intimidating" statement as naked support
for the Kosovo separatists and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The note said that some people in Germany have not only
provided financial support to the Kosovo separatists and
terrorists but also kicked up systematical propaganda against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The note also stressed that Yugoslavia has suffered enormous
economic loss from German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's
instigation in the European Union to impose sanctions on the
Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's stance has helped boost the morale of the Kosovo
separatists and terrorists, the note said.
</P>
<P>
Such statements by the German foreign and defense ministers are
not helpful to the stability of Europe and the Balkan region in
particular, the note said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Voices Concern Over Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A visiting U.S. official has
voiced worries over the perspective of trade liberalization in
Asia which is reeling under an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The worsening economic situation in Asia means the United
States will not only sell less to the region, it will also find it
harder to press Asian economies to open up their markets, U.S.
Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade David L. Aaron
said in a statement available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aaron is leading a trade mission to Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines and Thailand. The mission, the first high-level U.S.
trade delegation to Asia since the crisis erupted last year, will
end its visit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis can't be used as any kind of an excuse for backing
away from trade liberalization commitments," Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
He said the crisis has also impacted on the United States,
whose exports, after years of substantial growth, were up only 1
percent in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. Congress will consider an additional
subscription of 14.5 billion U.S. dollars to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in support of hard-hit economies and stressed
that the IMF's funding is essential to countries such as Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when many nations throughout Asia are in need of
capital to restructure their economies, measures that make
countries less attractive to foreign investors are likely to carry
a significant cost," Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
He praised Thailand for its firm commitment to trade
liberalization and cited Malaysia's recent imposition of exchange
controls as a threat to globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand does a good job in difficult times," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Thailand could be the very first nation to
recover from the crisis as it has adhered to economic reform
measures.
</P>
<P>
He said the recovery of the Southeast Asian nations will
largely depend on Japan and the growth of the region's hi-tech
industries. However, he said it is hard to predict when the
economies will rebound.
</P>
<P>
The trade delegation includes representatives from 12 U.S.
companies in telecommunications, information technology and
environment. No concrete business deals with Thai companies were
announced during the trip.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Sees Arresting Berisha As Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini said Thursday that it would be "a mistake" of the
Albanian government if it authorizes the arrest of former
president and opposition leader Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
Dini told journalists in Bologna that arresting Berisha would
"only increase the difficulties and the tensions" currently
plaguing the Adriatic nation.
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly a measure that we've all strongly discouraged
them from taking, but we are not the Albanian government or
parliament," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted in Albania following Sunday's murder of the
popular deputy leader of Berisha's Democratic party Azem Hajdari.
</P>
<P>
Parliament has ordered a criminal investigation of Berisha and
his top aides, accusing them of trying to launch a coup by
fomenting this week's rioting.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Opposition Stages New Protest, President Urges Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Albanian opposition staged a
new demonstration on Thursday morning pressing their demand for
the resignation of Socialist Prime Minister Fatos Nano, while
President Rexhep Mejdani urged his compatriots to show restraint.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 supporters of former president and Democratic Party
(DP) leader Sali Berisha gathered at the Skanderbeg square in
central Tirana, shouting slogans for Nano's ouster, in response to
Berisha's call for daily mass protests in defiance of a police ban.
</P>
<P>
Special army units stationed near parliament and government
offices, radio and television stations and banks have reportedly
received orders to "fire without warning on armed bandits" if they
attack state institutions.
</P>
<P>
No incidents were reported during the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, President Mejdani again appealed for calm in the
country, urging Albanians to show restraint so that a peaceful
solution could be found to the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The appeal followed the approval by a parliamentary committee
of the state prosecutor's request to strip Berisha of his
parliamentary immunity on charges of masterminding armed riots.
</P>
<P>
Tirana was rocked by bloody turbulence on Monday during a
funeral procession for leading DP deputy in parliament Azem
Hajdari, who was slain by unidentified gunmen last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The motion to lift Berisha's immunity will be decided in a vote
on Friday by the full assembly, where Socialist deputies enjoy a
majority.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary committee meanwhile announced that the office
of the attorney general has the right to issue an arrest warrant
for Berisha without prior parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
Berisha reacted by ignoring the whole process, saying that he
did not "recognize the immunity at all because this parliament is
illegal."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, the Albanian government issued a statement
denouncing the DP for its role in an armed attack Wednesday night
on a police station in Lezhe some 50 kilometers north of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
During the 40-minute clash, three of the 80 assailants were
killed by police.
</P>
<P>
In related events, two high-tension wire poles near Tirana were
destroyed by bombs on Wednesday, causing the paralysis of several
private television stations.
</P>
<P>
The government warned Berisha and other DP leaders against the
use of more violence, reiterating that they would be punished if
they do not surrender their weapons.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Protests Against Britain's Flight Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia lodged a protest
Thursday against Britain's decision to impose an immediate flight
ban on Yugoslav carriers landing at its airports.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made by British Secretary of State for Foreign
and Commonwealth Affairs Robin Cook, the British government
ignored the fact that Yugoslavian authorities and the Republic of
Serbia were requiring Kosovo refugees to surrender their weapons
and return home, the protest note said.
</P>
<P>
Also in his statement, Cook claimed that the crackdown against
ethnic Albanians was still going on, but kept silent on armed
Albanian terrorist activities, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
quoted the note as saying.
</P>
<P>
Summoning British Ambassador Brajan Doneli, the Yugoslav
Foreign Ministry said Cook's statement was utterly groundless and
would not benefit the settlement of the Kosovo crisis but would
only be welcomed by the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Britain Wednesday joined a European Union ban on Yugoslav
airlines JAT in sanctions against Belgrade's use of force in
Kosovo province, where 90 percent of the population are ethnic
Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Textile Industries in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Textile industries in the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur) countries are going through many
difficulties because of competitive Asian textile products, local
newspapers reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's textile production dropped 12.7 percent during the
first seven months of this year compared to the same period in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's cotton spinning output dropped 10.5 percent, and
woven-fabric production 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Its synthetic and artificial fiber production, however,
registered a slight increase.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's textile production shrank by 10 percent during the
first half of this year, while the footwear industry suffered a
54.7 percent reduction. Garment manufacturing dropped 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The leather and pelts industry, as well as knitted fabrics and
hose, registered a growth of 2.6 percent and 4.6 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the reduction is that Mercosur countries lost
their competitiveness in the face of widespread devaluation of
Asian currencies, the newspapers concluded.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Industries Expanding Fast in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- High-tech industries have
emerged as new economic powerhouses in Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the city chalked up 39.9 billion
yuan in the output value of high-tech manufactured goods between
January and August, up 35 percent over the same period last year
and accounting for 38.8 percent of Shenzhen's total industrial
output value.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city produced 47.5 billion yuan worth of
high-tech goods, accounting for 35 percent of the city's total
industrial output value, placing it first in the country.
</P>
<P>
The city is now home to high-tech companies in industries such
as computers, telecommunications, micro-electronics, new
materials, bio-engineering, integration of machinery and
electronics, and laser, with an application rate of scientific and
technological achievements amounting to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fast expansion of high-tech industry in this southern
Chinese city is attributed to policies and a series of
preferential measures introduced by the city to encourage the
growth of these industries.
</P>
<P>
The city has also instituted a wide range of local laws and
regulations on the protection of technologies, evaluation of
intangible assets, and technologies as a form of shares.
</P>
<P>
While increasing fiscal allocations for developing science and
technology, the city government has also been active in
constructing technological markets and setting up intermediary
organizations such as technological evaluation and arbitration
agencies. Preparations are also underway to establish a risk
fund-raising organization in the city.
</P>
<P>
The increasingly improved environment has attracted domestic
and overseas high-tech investors as well. In the first seven
months of this year, Shenzhen approved 438 overseas-financed
technology-intensive businesses, with contracts involving the use of
516 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Domestic companies such as Founder Group, a computer company
attached to Beijing University, have plans to expand into
Shenzhen. In the meantime, the city has also signed letters of
intent with 65 major universities and research institutes which
will in turn provide technical support to the development of
Shenzhen's high-tech industries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Active in Foreign Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been following an
active and independent foreign policy in accordance with the
principles of the United Nations (UN) Charter, the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence and Non-Aligned, maintaining friendly
ties with all nations in the world, particularly with neighboring
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with its relations with other countries, Myanmar
gives priority to the maintenance of world peace and security,
mutual respects and equal rights despite differences in political
and economic systems of different countries.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Myanmar has established diplomatic ties with 72
countries in the world, opening up nearly 40 embassies and
consulates-general.
</P>
<P>
In the period of the State Law and Order Restoration Council
(SLORC) (from 1988 to 1997), which was renamed the State Peace and
Development Council (SPDC) in November 1997 with major reshuffle
of the government cabinet, Myanmar established ties with more
countries such as Peru, Venezuela, Columbia, Papua New Guinea,
Brunei, Brazil, South Africa and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In order to carry out tasks of foreign affairs on a broad
scale, Myanmar formed in October 1992 the Foreign Affairs Policy
Committee, headed by Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first
secretary of the then SLORC and the present SPDC, deliberating and
coordinating important policies regarding foreign relations and
overseeing their implementation.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, Myanmar leaders have exchanged visits
with those of Asian countries including Brunei, China, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
These visits brought about further enhancement of their
bilateral friendly ties and trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, which became a U.N. member in April 1948, takes an
active part in the U.N. General Assembly sessions and other
conferences held by the U.N. in accordance with the principles
contained in the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar became a member of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament
in 1962 and acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The country also acceded in the year to four Geneva Conventions
of 1949 regarding humanitarian treatment in the midst of
hostilities and the instruments of accession became effective in
Myanmar in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar also expanded economic contacts with foreign countries
and international financial and economic organizations with which
the country sought monetary aid and loans as well as technical
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Various projects on education, health and agriculture are among
those jointly implemented in Myanmar with aid from a number of
U.N. agencies such as UNDP (United Nations Development Program),
UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), WHO (World Health
Organization), FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), UNESCO
(United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)
and ESCAP (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar was one of the co-founders of the Non-Alignment
Movement (NAM) established in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1961. The
country once suspended its participation in the movement in 1979
but resumed the activities beginning with the 10th NAM Summit in
Indonesia in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
As for regional cooperation, Myanmar has also been actively
participating in the activities and cooperation of some regional
groupings especially the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
into which the country was integrated in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
In August the same year, Myanmar joined again a new South Asian
sub-regional economic grouping, the BIMST-EC (Bangladesh, India,
Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand - Economic Cooperation), bordering
the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar actively cooperates with countries in the world in the
fight against narcotics. So far, it has bilateral agreements on
this respect with neighboring Bangladesh, China, India, Laos,
Vietnam and Thailand as well as the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Sub-regional cooperation in combating narcotics has also been
carried out under separate agreements with China and Thailand
involving the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP).
</P>
<P>
For five decades since its independence, Myanmar has adhered to
 the U.N. Charter in its foreign relations, opposing
neo-colonialism and hegemonism and adopting a non-interference
policy. The country reiterates that "it will never interfere in
the internal affairs of others and will never tolerate any outside
interference".

<HEADLINE> Home Service More Alluring in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The home service industry in
Beijing is expected to become more attractive both as a job and as
an industry.
</P>
<P>
Resistance to home service work is melting away from minds of
the city's laid-off workers, today's China Daily quoted sources
from the Beijing Municipal Committee of Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference as saying.
</P>
<P>
The conference also suggested the establishment of municipal
centers which supervise property management, household mending and
installation, and house keeping services.
</P>
<P>
Modern city life is creating a need for industrializing home
services. This will create job opportunities for laid-off workers,
said Geng Changbao, vice-director of the social judicial committee
of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Geng said that local residents' demand for home service is
expected to drive new economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the increasing demand for home service, many
local people have complained with the poor service which have been
mainly done by rural girls who are not quite familiar with city
life.
</P>
<P>
Gao Yufang, 44, a pioneer in doing home service, set a good
example for other laid-off women workers in the city.
</P>
<P>
She sells Beijing Morning Post in the mornings, and works at
two households in the afternoons. She earns 1,000 yuan (120.5 US
dollars) per month, enabling her to pay her daughter's tuition at
a univerity in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
There were 30,600 jobless in the city by the end of June. Most
of them are women in their 40's.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Three pairs of rare animals
including red kangaroos and red guenon monkeys from the Tennoji
Zoo in Osaka, Shanghai's sister city, were presented to the
Shanghai Zoo recently.
</P>
<P>
The two cities have exchanged animals every two years since
1974 when the Tennoji Zoo presented a pair of sea lions and two
pairs of penguins to Shanghai. About 100 pairs of animals of 30
different species have been swapped during the last 24 years.
</P>
<P>
Many of the animals from Osaka have become accustomed to their
new environment and have bred in the Shanghai Zoo. There are now
12 family members of the two giraffes who settled in Shanghai in
1979. And the penguins presented by Osaka last year have just had
three babies.
</P>
<P>
Pandas, Chinese alligators and other animals given

<HEADLINE> Palace Museum to Build New Exhibition Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 ( Xinhua ) -- Beijing's famous Palace
Museum recently announced a three-year plan to build an
underground exhibition center to house cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Curator Tan Bin said the 20,000-sq.m. center will
consist of two floors. The lower floor will feature exhibits of
gold ornaments, jewelry, diamonds and jade, with the upper floor
dedicated to paintings, calligraphy and bronzeware.
</P>
<P>
Tan said the Palace Museum, also known as Forbidden City, now
houses 930,000 cultural relics in nine categories, with 8,000
pieces exhibited each year.
</P>
<P>
He said the hall will feature the same architectural style of
the museum and will be equipped with fire prevention, air
conditioning and various other systems to protect cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The Palace Museum served as the imperial palace during both the
Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. The complex,
which covers 720,000 sq.m., was constructed in 1420, and is the
largest and best preserved ancient building in China.

<HEADLINE> BBC ' Will Fight to Save Match of the Day' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The BBC is ready to challenge
Rupert Murdoch's proposed takeover of Manchester United, in an
attempt to save Match of the Day, according to local reports on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Corporation is concerned that BSkyB's buy-out could
threaten the future of BBC1's flagship football program.
</P>
<P>
And management are considering submitting a report to the
Office of Fair Trading listing their objections to the satellite
station's moves.
</P>
<P>
The BBC feels Sky's 623m takeover of United could prevent it
showing highlights of the club's Premiership games at Old
Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement of the BBC's annual promises,
Corporation chairman Sir Christopher Bland said: "We would
obviously be concerned if any change in ownership in a football
club resulted in a monopoly or near monopoly.
</P>
<P>
"We would be interested to see the OFT have a long and hard
look at this issue."
</P>
<P>
But Match of the Day, which has been a fixture in the BBC
schedules for more than 30 years, broadcasts highlights of all
top-flight matches every Saturday, as part of a 73m contract with
the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
The BBC's Chief of Broadcasting Will Wyatt said: "We do not
compete with BSkyB for revenue but we compete for rights.
</P>
<P>
"We have no aspirations to take the Premier League live
contract off them but we do want to be able to renew Match of the
Day.
</P>
<P>
"Anything they got unfairly in the way of that would be
absolutely not in the interest of the public."
</P>
<P>
Mr. Wyatt added that there was a potential conflict of interes
ts in a TV company owning a football club and then selling
broadcasting rights to itself.
</P>
<P>
"Our concerns are that we will have one company sitting on
both sides of the negotiating table - and perhaps excluding
others.
</P>
<P>
"That would be absolutely anti-competitive, against public
interest and plainly wrong," he added.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Tumen River Valley Attracts Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 18 (Xinhua) --The Tumen River Valley in
northeast China's Jilin Province has become an attractive location
for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, investors from 22 countries and
regions have started 735 businesses in the area, involving a total
investment of 900 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The river serves as a borderline between China and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and flows into the Sea of Japan
close to Russian territory.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Jilin Province has made painstaking
efforts to improve the infrastructure in the valley, which falls
mainly within Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Yanbian, with
Hunchun City as the focus of development.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial official, the Tumen River Valley is
now blessed with a newly completed 84-kilometer-long railway line
from Tumen to Changlingzi via Hunchun, 56 kilometers of which is
operational, an extended airport 115 kilometers from Hunchun, and
a number of high-grade highways connecting major cities of the
area.
</P>
<P>
Additional highways are now under construction, and railway
lines provide tours from Tumen to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The region is also connected to Russia, the DPRK and the
Republic of Korea (ROK) through three international
telecommunications lines, fiber-optic cables, and ground satellite
telecommunications station, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The city of Hunchun has installed program-controlled
switchboards capable of handling 40,000 telephone lines and a
mobile phone network capable of servicing 20,000 mobile
subscribers. With improved telecommunications facilities, Hunchun
is able to reach 180 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The city also has a power station with a designed generating
capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts. The station, with two
operational 100,000-kilowatt generating units, has started
constructing two new 300,000-kilowatt generating units.
</P>
<P>
According to a development and construction plan drafted by the
United Nations Development Program, the Tumen River Valley should
be able to attract investments of 30 billion U.S. dollars over the
next two decades.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Sends More Police to Prevent Border Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexico has sent more
policemen to the border city of Juares in a bid to prevent more
killings among drug smugglers, reports here said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of two people shot in an execution-style killing
were found earlier this week in the northern city of
Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that was a settling of accounts between drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Another alleged drug smuggler whose body was ridden with 13
shots was also discovered in Tlaquepaque, a village near the city
of Guadalajara, in the western state of Jalisco, according to
Thursday's "Mexico City Times."
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two execution-style killings have been reported this
year in the state of Jalisco.
</P>
<P>
Last week, former military and police commander Jose Arriaga
was killed when he was taking his four-year-old son to school.
</P>
<P>
Following the killing last week of Rafael Munoz Talaverta, head
of the Juarez drug cartel, more policemen were sent to the border
city of Juarez, in an effort to prevent more killings.

<HEADLINE> Bean Can Post No Challenge to Holyfield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bean takes a 32-1 record into his title bid against the heav
yweight champion, but only seven of those 33 opponents had
winning records at the time they fought him.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old failed in a bid for the IBF title when he lost
to Michael Moorer on a decision March 29, 1997. He then stopped
his next four opponents and earned a mandatory challenge to
Holyfield as the IBF's No. 1 contender. The WBN title also will
be at stake.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, who weighed in officially at 217 pounds, retained
the WBA title and won the IBF title by stopping Moorer in the
eighth round in his last fight November 8. Bean weighed 231
pounds.
</P>
<P>
Butch Lewis has set up two title shots for Bean and the fights
are just keep him on winning. Bean said:" I just do my job and
leave the rest of it to Butch."
</P>
<P>
Lewis said that he need to keep winning to get title shots and
lucrative television matches have had a lot to do with Bean's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Although he lost to Moorer, Bean said: "I learned a lot in the
Moorer fight for this fight. I could have thrown more punches.
It's important to be busy, to keep your hands moving."
</P>
<P>
Bean has 25 knockouts, the same as Holyfield (35-3). More than
26,000 tickets have been sold for Holyfield's first fight in his
hometown since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Fate to be Decided on Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson will have to
explain to the men deciding his fate why he bit Evander
Holyfield's ears on Saturday in a hearing.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's chances of regaining his boxing license are small, and
the Nevada boxing authorities may keep him out of boxing for at
least one more year.
</P>
<P>
"The whole issue is his temper and self-control," said Nevada
Athletic Commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem. "Everything that
has happened since we revoked his license we have to find out
about."
</P>
<P>
Tyson is expected to get some help from a Denver
psychotherapist who has been meeting with Tyson the past week and
probably will appear to lobby on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old has begun training, and tentative plans call
for a late November or early December fight that would be
televised on pay-per-view and make Tyson earn millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
But first Tyson has to convince the same commission that had
no trouble banning him from the sport that he should be allowed
to return. He must answer question about charges two men filed
that they were attacked by Tyson following a car accident in a
Washington suburb.
</P>
<P>
The commission has only three real options: approve Tyson,
reject him or ask that he return at a later date when he can
better answer questions arising from the traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
If Tyson is rejected, he can't apply again until September 19,
1999.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta's High-rise Buildings Urged to Check Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The management of high-rise
buildings in Jakarta are urged to keep their buildings fire-proof,
since the existing fire fighters cannot possibly handle too many
fires all by themselves.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot count on us too much because the Jakarta fire
fighting service is not able to control all of the fires," chief
of the Jakarta fire fighting authorities H. Suharso was quoted by
Antara News Agency Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
When asked if it was necessary for a regular inspection of the
readiness of high-rise buildings in coping with a fire, Suharso
said that it is quite a remote possibility.
</P>
<P>
The local government has very limited capacity in fire fighting
because of inadequate equipment and resources.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Suharso urged the management of high-rise buildings
to conduct their own inspection on a weekly or monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
According to him, only 389 of the 864 existing high-rise
buildings in Jakarta are adequately equipped for fire fighting.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in 1997 a total of 84,629 fires broke out
in Jakarta, and 764 fires this year.

XI'AN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Asia's largest natural gas
purification factory went into operation recently in Jingbian
County, Shaanxi Province in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Changqing gas field in northern Shaanxi, the
facility has a designed capacity to purify three billion cubic
meters of natural gas a year. With verified reserves of 130
billion cubic meters, the field is one of the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to pipe 1.5 billion cubic meters of
purified natural gas a year to Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an and Yinchuan,
and has already begun sending gas to Beijing and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
In line with the standards set by the state authorities, gas
produced by the Changqing field must be purified before being sent
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to further alleviate air pollution
in large cities such as Beijing, Tianjin and Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Dismisses Littlejohn Bid as "Fantasy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- English Premier league club
Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar dismissed as "fantasy" a
bid, headed by journalist and TV celebrity Richard Littlejohn, to
buy into the club.
</P>
<P>
Littlejohn, a lifelong Spurs fan who hosts a phone-in program
on BBC Radio Five Live, said earlier this week he had discussed
with a group of businessmen a plan to buy 29.9% of the troubled
north London club.
</P>
<P>
Sugar, who took over at White Hart Lane seven years ago, has
come under increasing pressure this season from fans who want him
to quit the club.
</P>
<P>
Sugar, a multi-millionaire who founded the Amstrad computer
company, has indicated he would consider selling his controlling
stake in Spurs for an appropriate offer.
</P>
<P>
But earlier this month he turned down an 80 million pounds
offer from leisure group ENIC.
</P>
<P>
Sugar rejected the bid by the Littlejohn consortium and said:
"Contact has been made but this is a football fan's fantasy dream
and has not been given serious attention by the board."
</P>
<P>
With BSkyB offering 623 million pounds for Manchester United
and Carlton reportedly negotiating a 275 million pounds takeover
of Arsenal, Sugar may well believe bidders are underestimating
Tottenham's worth.
</P>
<P>
Sugar has set up a new independent phone-in line at Tottenham
to"tell fans the truth" about press stories.
</P>
<P>
He has handed control of the Media Monitor service to new
director Martin Peters, a former Tottenham and England star.
</P>
<P>
Spurs have won only once this season, have twice lost 3-0 at
home this year and if they lose against bottom-of-the-table
Southampton on Saturday, Sugar could find the crisis spiralling
out of control.

<P>
MADRID, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Gianni Bugno claims a
convincing win on the 12th stage of the Tour of Spain on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He broke away in the final third of the 187 kilometers stage
from Benasque to Canfranc. Spain's Santi Blanco finished second,
one minute 48 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
The main pack, which included race leader Abraham Olano of
Spain, were more than nine minutes behind Bugno.
</P>
<P>
Olano was still the first overall because none of the eight
riders ahead of him were a threat.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- A misread message on a Perth computer screen led to Prime
Minister John Howard being asked the bizarre question about his
tax plan and heroin prices Thursday, which angered the prime
minister and rocked the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,
forcing the national broadcaster to issue an embarrassing apology
to Howard.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Labor Party, the nation's opposition party,
has seized the initiative in the election campaign, with a new
Herald-AC Nielsen poll showing its primary vote climbing by four
percentage points over the past week and leading the ruling
parties 43-42 on base votes and 52-48 after a spread of
preferences.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- A surge in voter hostility to the government-proposed goods
and services tax has helped the Labor Party jump to a clear lead
in the third week of the federal election campaign, the latest
Age/A.C. Nielsen poll has found.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's ruling coalition was attacked Thursday on the
key issues of tax reform and the economy, with a jump in long-term
unemployment, fresh doubts cast on its growth forecasts and a new
study claiming its tax package would mean soaring prices and
higher joblessness.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ministers Under Soeharto's Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- All ministers under
Indonesian former president Soeharto's New Order government must
disclose details of their personal wealth, Justice Minister Muladi
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The mistakes of the New Order cannot be blamed just on
Soeharto. All ministers and high-ranking officials under Soeharto
must also be investigated, including President B.J. Habibie,"
Muladi was quoted by the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto stepped down on May 21 during the country's worst
political and economic crisis in decades. He was replaced by his
running mate Habibie, one of the longest serving ministers of the
Soeharto regime.
</P>
<P>
After taking office, President Habibie pledged sweeping
economic and political reforms in a bid to create a clean
government, free from the corrupt, collusive and nepotistic
practices that flourished during Soeharto's 32-year reign.
</P>
<P>
"President Habibie must also fill in the form," Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the investigation into the wealth of
ministers would not be conducted in haste. The first priority was
to investigate the wealth of the former president.
</P>
<P>
Local as well as foreign media have accused Soeharto, his
children and other relatives of illegally amassing wealth during
his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is also accused of issuing decrees and instructions
that benefited his children and close friends.
</P>
<P>
The government announced Wednesday it had set up a three-member
team to probe Soeharto. Led by Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib,
the team comprises the chief of the Indonesian Police and head of
the state auditing body.
</P>
<P>
Muladi Thursday also announced the establishment of a new team
focusing on probing Soeharto's overseas wealth. The team would be
headed by Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision and
Administrative Reform Hartarto Satrosoenarto and Attorney General
Ghalib.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident of the government's political will to probe
Soeharto's wealth and that they will do their best. Otherwise, it
will mean the government is lying to the people. Our side is
confident there is the possibility Soeharto may be jailed if proof
of criminal acts and abuse of power is found," Muladi said.
</P>
<P>
On a separate occasion, State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tandjung
said Hartarto and Ghalib will soon meet Soeharto at the latter's
residence to seek confirmation and clarification about his recent
statement that he did not have "a single cent" in any bank account
abroad.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast by his daughter's television station
early this month, Soeharto said he did not have a single cent in
savings abroad. He also challenged anyone to prove allegations
that he had a personal fortune both overseas and at home.
</P>
<P>
American magazine Forbes estimated in July that Soeharto
amassed a fortune worth 4 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE>   Chelsea Wins Opening Match at Cup Winners's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Chelsea
had a hard work to beat Swedes Helsingborg 1-0 in the opening
match of the European Cup Winners' Cup on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The London club were not alone in struggling against
lowly-ranked opponents.
</P>
<P>
Italian big-spenders Lazio, German representatives MSV
Duisburg and Paris St Germain were all held 1-1 at home by teams
who rarely feature in the later rounds.
</P>
<P>
Mallorca of Spain bucked the trend with a well-earned 1-0 win
in Scotland against Hearts while Heerenveen flew the Dutch flag
with a 3-1 win over Amica Wronki of Poland.
</P>
<P>
No team has ever retained the Cup Winners' Cup but, in what
could be its last year of existence, Chelsea would have fancied
their chances looking at this season's threadbare field.
</P>
<P>
But they had only Franck Lebouef's 43rd minute free kick to
show for their efforts against a team who knocked Aston Villa out
of the UEFA Cup two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Italian international Pierluigi Casiraghi hit a post with his
first touch after coming on as a second-half substitute but
Chelsea deserved little more.
</P>
<P>
Lazio, runners-up in last season's UEFA Cup, spent close on
100 million U.S. dollars in the close season but made a
disastrous start against Lausanne Sports when young midfielder
Dejan Stankovic was sent off after just two minutes for handling
a goal-bound shot.
</P>
<P>
Fabio Celestini's resultant penalty was saved by Luca
Marchegiani and Lazio then went ahead when Pavel Nedved headed
home a Marcelo Salas cross in the 37th minute.
</P>
<P>
But the Swiss grew in confidence after the break and in the
54th minute, Philippe Douglas side-footed in a cross from Marc
Hottiger for a deserved draw.
</P>
<P>
Duisburg, back in Europe after a 19-year absence, needed an
83rd minute goal by substitute Marcus Wedau to salvage a draw
against 10-man Genk.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians had midfielder Marc Hendrikx sent off in the 57th
minute but went ahead four minutes later with a header by Finland
midfielder Juha Reini from a corner.
</P>
<P>
PSG, winners in 1996, were lackluster throughout as they were
held by Israel's Maccabi Haifa.
</P>
<P>
The Parisians, who were also losing finalists in 1997, opened
the scoring with a Marco Simone penalty in the 82nd minute but
the Israelis hit back five minutes later thanks to gifted striker
Yosi Benayoun.
</P>
<P>
Mallorca made a flying start to their first season in Europe,
beating Hearts with a messy goal in the 17th minute when home
'keeper Gilles Rousset punched a corner straight on to the chest
of Elena Marcelino and saw the ball bounce into the net.
</P>
<P>
Heerenveen beat Amica Wronki 3-1 with goals from Jeffrey
Talan, Dumitru Mitrita and Boudewijn Pahlplatz. Grzegorz Krol's
reply kept the Poles in the tie.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle, like Chelsea, face an awkward second leg after
scraping a 2-1 home win over Partizan Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Alan Shearer put Ruud Gullit's side ahead after 12 minutes but
a Vuk Rasovic penalty levelled in the 68th. Greek defender
Nikolaos Dabizas headed the winner three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Austrian side Ried marked their European debut with a 2-0 home
victory over MTK Budapest. Gerald Strafner and Ronald Brunmayr
stunned the 20-time Hungarian champions.
</P>
<P>
Goals by Yevgeny Kharlachev and Zaza Dzhanashia gave Lokomotiv
Moscow a comfortable 2-0 win at Ukrainian side CSKA Kiev.
</P>
<P>
Lokomotiv, semifinalists last season, controlled the match and
had too much experience and pace up front.
</P>
<P>
Besiktas of Turkey beat Spartak Trnava of Slovakia 3-0, FC
Copenhagen collected a useful 2-0 away win against Levski Sofia
and Panionios Athens beat Finnish side Haka Valkeakoski 2-0.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Capture Strategic Sheber Pass: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
captured a strategic pass Thursday from the opposition Northern
Alliance in central Afghanistan, a report Radio Shariat said.
</P>
<P>
After two days of heavy fighting, the Taliban advanced on the
strategic Sheber Pass from the central province of Bamyan and
joined up with another force in the adjacent Ghorband Valley
further east, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Radio Shariat as saying that "in its
operation, the mujahideen of the Islamic emirate cleaned up vast
areas around Sheber and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy."
</P>
<P>
Ghorband cuts off Bamyan from Parwan province which is still
held by former Afghan defense minister Ahmadshah Masood.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Taliban will continue through Ghorband
Valley to attack forces loyal to Masood on its eastern flank,
putting pressure on his troops in Parwan.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Brigadier-General Ove
Johnny Stromberg of Norway had been named as head of the United
Nations Preventive Force (UNPREDEP) in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He will succeed Brigade-General Bent Sohnemann of Denmark on
September 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
UNPREDEP, which consists of 716 members, was deployed in 1992
to deter the spread of fighting in other parts of the former
Yugoslavia to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Despite plans to withdraw the force earlier this year, its
mandate was extended because of the volatile situation in the
neighbouring Serbian province Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian
majority wants independence from Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Most Americans Favor Full Payment of U.N. Dues, Poll Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Most Americans asked
in a recent poll disagreed with the U.S. lawmakers' failure to pay
U.S. back dues, and said that the United Nations is doing a very
good job, so they wanted Washington to pay an estimated 1.6
billion U.S. dollars in arrears.
</P>
<P>
By a three-to-one margin, those Americans polled favored
Congress paying the money the United States owes. And 49 percent
of those advocating payment are so concerned about the issue that
it would affect their vote for lawmakers, said the poll sponsored
by the United Nations Association (UNA) of the USA.
</P>
<P>
"The public supports the United Nations more eagerly and with
more enthusiasm than Congress does," John Whitehead, chairman of
the UNA, said. "There's some kind of disconnect between public
opinion about the United Nations and the voting record of
Congress, at least in recent years."
</P>
<P>
Support for the United Nations among Americans has risen an
average of 10 percentage points since the previous poll which was
conducted two years ago, Whitehead, a former deputy secretary of
state, said.
</P>
<P>
The UNA was founded about the same time as the United Nations
was founded some 50 years ago. A national organization to educate
the people about the importance of the United Nations, it
advocates that the Clinton administration should pay back dues in
full, on time and without condition.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the group Wirthin Worldwide, came at
a time when the United States is a main contributor to the current
financial crisis in the United Nations and threatened with a loss
of its vote in the General Assembly if it fails to pay a chunk of
the money it owes.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 60 percent of respondents said that the
United Nations is doing "a very good job," the organization's
highest approval rating since 1959 and up from 49 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two percent said that they saw the world body as "very
important" for American policy engagement, up from 54 percent in
the 1996 survey. In sharp contrast, the ratings for other
international organizations such as NATO and the World Bank remain
unchanged, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
Eight percent of Americans surveyed voiced their rejection of
condition being attached to the due payment, and 43 percent of
those asked approved the job performance of United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, it said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congressional leaders have in the past linked
legislation that would pay off U.N. arrears with conditions that
the world body conduct reform under America-favoring programs. The
U.S. failure to pay back its dues in full, on time and without
condition has been met with strong criticism from among a majority
of U.N. member states.
</P>
<P>
At the current session of the General Assembly, the financial
crisis in the U.N. and Washington's unwillingness to pay its
outstanding contributions are expected to be high on the agenda
during the general debate, which will kick off on September 21.

<HEADLINE> Mechanism Proposed to Monitor Financial Flows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- An international
mechanism has been proposed to monitor financial and monetary
flows to fence off negative effects of globalization, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks on behalf of the group of 77 developing
countries and China at the U.N. high-level meeting on
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Since there is the World Trade Organization for matters of
international trade, a financial monitoring mechanism is
reasonably needed to help mitigate the unpredictability and dire
effects of globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the United Nations should remain a vital and
effective instrument of international cooperation for
"people-centered and people-driven" development.
</P>
<P>
Didier Opertti, president of the U.N. General Assembly, told
the meeting that within the present framework, the U.N. dialogue
on globalization reflects the need to coordinate new international
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that international financial institutions have
not been able to prevent the current crises and other mechanisms
including those at the United Nations have not been successful,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Georg Lennkh, speaking on behalf of the European
Union, said market forces alone would not resolve the problems of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Universal acceptance of certain societal values are required
and the United Nations provides a unique platform for such "global
housekeeping", he said.

<HEADLINE> International Cooperation Important: Qin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Economic globalization
is inter-dependence in the real sense of the term, said Chinese
Permanent Representative to the U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the high-level meeting of the U.N. General
Assembly, Qin said that in the tide of globalization, the
sustainable development of the world economy cannot be achieved
without deeper and wider international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The execution of responsible economic and financial policies by
the major developed countries holds the key to the stability and
growth of the world economy, he said, adding that this should
become an important component of international cooperation in this
new era.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the developing countries are striving to join the
process of economic globalization from a position of disadvantage
and under unequal conditions. With a weak capacity to withstand
the hazards in the financial and other fields, they need
meaningful international support, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, inequality still exists in international
economy relations, the new "rules of the game" in the
international economic, trade, environmental and other fields have
not reflected the interests of developing countries in an
equitable manner.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the developing and developed nations has not
shown signs of narrowing, and some developing countries are in
real danger of being marginalized in the globalization process, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In formulating new "rules of the game," efforts should be made
to guarantee the effective participation of the developing
nations, and sufficient consideration should be given to their
specific problems, Ambassador Qin noted.
</P>
<P>
The financial, technical and other kinds of assistance to
developing countries should be strengthened to boost their
capacity building, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the Asian economic crisis, Qin said the most
important task before the United Nations now is to help those
countries hard hit by the crisis to resume healthy economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the Asian financial crisis is global and it will
require concerted efforts by the world community to fully
eliminate its consequences, the Chinese representative said.
</P>
<P>
Major developed nations with significant influence on the
economy of the Asian region should take constructive policy
measures as early as possible by contributing to the stabilization
of the situation and rejuvenation of the economy in the region,
Qin said in conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Third Suspect in U.S. Embassy Bombing Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal complaint
said here Thursday that Hroun Fazil from the Comoro Islands was
the third suspect in the August bombing of the U.S. embassy in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The man in his mid-20s helped conspire the bombing and rented a
Nairobi villa for three months prior to the incident to make the
bomb, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
On the day of the bombing, Fazil who has remained at large,
drove a white pickup truck to the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, with
another vehicle carrying the bomb following, it added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Expert: Greece Has About 80,000 Drug Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- There were some 80,000 drug
addicts in Greece and the number of drug users aged under 18 rose
about 15 percent in the 1994-1998 period, a Greek expert said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki, forensic scientist Mattheos Tsoungas said that the
age at which Greeks first try drugs was falling to as low as 10,
the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In Thessaloniki alone, he said, there were 10,000 addicts and
there had been 30 drug-related deaths since the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
He added that the figure of 30 drug-related deaths did not
include those addicts who died of aids or hepatitis or those
killed in road accidents while under the influence of drugs.

<HEADLINE> UN: Corruption Undermines Countries, Discourages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Bribery and corruption
threaten developing countries, destabilize governments and
discourage badly needed investment, said a U.N. report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, Corruption and Integrity Improvement Initiatives in
Developing Countries, was prepared by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
It was drawn from case studies and aimed at creating global and
national strategies that can be used to fight corruption.
</P>
<P>
"When corruption is associated with organized crimes,
legitimate business and private sector development are discouraged
and a government's political legitimacy is compromised," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report listed successful anti-corruption programs and gave
information on the latest policies followed by OECD members to
control corruption in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
As an example of how it is working to fight corruption, the
UNDP said that in Pakistan, the UNDP produced a learning guide and
study course for U.N. staff to train Pakistanis to spot and deter
corruption.

The rebels also claimed that they have encircled Kindu, the
capital of Maniema Province, which is considered an important
military base in the region.

The rebels are pushing toward Lubumbashi, and are meeting very
little resistance from Kabila's forces and their allies.
