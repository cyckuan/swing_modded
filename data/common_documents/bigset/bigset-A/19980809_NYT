FOR VICTIMS' KIN, THE BAD NEWS IS SUDDEN AND SHOCKING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all needing)  
 (SUBS to refine, add info)   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Friday mail brought a flimsy letter from Africa to the home
of Delbert and Mary Olds in Panama City, Fla. It was from their
daughter, Sherry, and inside the envelope was a Post-It sticker. It
read, ``Will E-mail you soon.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday evening, two Air Force officers arrived with another
letter. It informed the family that Sherry Lynn Olds, a senior
master sergeant with the Air Force, had died earlier in the day
after a terrorist bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a beautiful girl,'' said Pat Casey, the victim's aunt,
who spoke for the parents. ``She was very special to her parents.
It is a devastating loss to them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the families of the victims in various parts of the country,
there was no good way to learn the bad news. The phone rang before
sunrise at Bonnie Hobson's home in Lamar, Mo. Her son, Sgt. Kenneth
R. Hobson, Jr., 27, had been killed. Her daughter-in-law, Debbie,
was calling from Nairobi, sobbing uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the telephone call that did not come that worried friends
and relatives of Molly Huckaby Hardy, 51, a State Department
employee from Valdosta, Ga. They had seen the bombings on
television. ``When we hadn't heard from her, we knew something had
happened,'' said Marsha Bates, a childhood friend of Ms. Hardy's.
``If she could have crawled to a phone, she would have let us know
she was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The American death toll was not yet clear, but by Saturday
night, the State Department had identified five of the victims.
They are Master Sergeant Olds; Hobson; Ms. Hardy; Sgt. Jesse N.
Aliganga, 21; a Marine from Tallahassee, Fla.; and Arlene Kirk, 50,
a Defense Department budget officer who had just returned to
Nairobi from home leave in South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also released the names of four other
Americans killed: Prabhi Kavaler and Michelle O'Connor of the
General Services office; Tom Shah, an employee of the political
section; and Jean Dalizu, an employee of the Defense Attache's
office. The Associated Press added two more: Jay Bartley, son of
Consul General Julian Bartley, and Louise Martin of Atlanta, an
employee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin worked for the health agency in Kenya with her
husband, Douglas Klaucke. She would have turned 46 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bryson of Lawrenceville, Ga., said of Ms. Martin, her
sister: ``I still don't believe it's real. She died in a country
she loved, she died doing the things she liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kirk and her husband, Robert, 50, a project development
officer for the U.S. Agency for International Development, had
planned to extend their stay at home for several days, said Ms.
Kirk's sister, Katherine Wright, from South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kirk worried that her bosses wanted her back to work
sooner, her sister said, so the couple and their 14-year-old son,
Robbie Jr., flew back, arriving in Nairobi early Friday morning.
``They were both exhausted,'' Ms. Wright said. ``She went home and
then was rushing to get to work. She went to work late. We think
she went into work just before the bomb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   During her six weeks in South Bend, Ms. Kirk cared for her
elderly parents, Frederick Arthur, 84, and Mary, 83. ``She was busy
trying to get them enrolled in some exercise classes,'' said Ms.
Wright. ``She took them to the doctor. Their health is not that
great.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of six children, Ms. Kirk met her husband at
Indiana University. After graduating from Indiana University
business school, they went to South Africa, where Kirk taught
democratic principles to township mayors. During the next 25 years,
they worked for the federal government in various positions in
Botswana and Egypt and, for the last three years, in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The couple lost a young daughter, Kamilah, to cancer in 1992.
Their oldest child, Maisha, 23, attends Tuskegee University in
Alabama. Family members said the couple planned to move back to the
United States next year. ``It's a bitter pill to swallow,'' Ms.
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   After a State Department career that spanned more than two
decades, including posts in Brazil and Laos, Ms. Hardy had told
friends and family that she also planned to return to the United
States, possibly next June, to work as an instructor for State
Department employees. Her childhood friend, Ms. Bates, described a
woman who loved the adventure of her job. Her family had recently
received letters and photographs of her remodeled home in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just loved being there, I think,'' Ms. Bates said. ``She
found it a beautiful place. Molly was fun-loving, just great _ an
intellectual that everybody liked.''
</P>
<P>
   While working in Laos in 1973, Ms. Hardy became pregnant, Ms.
Bates said. Like other civilian employees, she was ordered to
evacuate, and her only child, Brandi Plant, was later born in
Washington. Ms. Hardy and her former husband were later divorced.
Her last visit to Valdosta had come in April 1997 to attend the
funeral of her sister, who had died when her car collided with a
dump truck that had crossed the center line of the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Ms. Hardy apparently had a potential brush
with danger. ``A plane went down in South Africa that Molly was
supposed to have been on,'' said Ms. Bates, noting that Ms. Hardy
ended up catching a different flight.
</P>
<P>
   While riding on the second flight, Ms. Hardy called to tell her
mother and daughter not to worry. When a similar call did not come
on Friday, her family feared for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Olds had returned to Nairobi in June after spending two
months in Birmingham, Ala., taking courses to qualify for a
promotion to become a chief master sergeant. Her aunt, Ms. Casey,
said that Sergeant Olds passed the test and was expected to receive
her promotion in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Olds had joined the Air Force out of high school,
following the footsteps of her father, who is now a retired civil
servant. Ms. Casey described her niece as a ``free spirit'' who had
also served in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   During her coursework in Alabama, Sergeant Olds also spent a
week with her family in Panama City, engaging in her favorite
hobby. ``Shopping,'' said her aunt with a gentle laugh. ``That
sounds very strange, but that was her favorite pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   On one shopping spree, Sergeant Olds purchased boxes of corn
meal and grits _ the ingredients of some of her favorite Southern
dishes _ and mailed them to her address in Nairobi. She often sent
her family presents of African jewelry, amber and carved wooden
games.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sergeant Olds, Hobson joined the military as a ticket to
see the world. ``He knew there was more to life out there, and he
was determined to see it,'' said his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a modest blue house behind a sturdy old maple
tree, he was known as a talented and popular boy. He loved to
debate world affairs and play tennis, act in school plays, go
hiking, cook gourmet meals and paint.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, the son of a Vietnam veteran, dreamed of retiring from
the Army at age 37, attending culinary school and then opening a
bed and breakfast, his mother said.

BELL ATLANTIC WORKERS ON STRIKE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of workers at Bell Atlantic walked off the
job Sunday morning as the telephone company and two unions failed
to reach agreement before the workers' old contract expired at
12:01 Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The workers began their strike after a day of tense talks
between Bell Atlantic and the two unions, the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers. The two sides voiced optimism Sunday morning that they
might still be able to reach an agreement on Sunday and thus keep
the strike very short and the disruption to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to keep negotiating,'' Jeffrey Miller, spokesman for
the communications workers said just after midnight. `` The talks
haven't really broken off. We just ran up against the deadline, and
our members are adamant that they're not going to work without a
contract. So therefore we're on strike. We hope to keep negotiating
and work out a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike by 85,000 workers is not expected to disrupt normal
telephone service for Bell Atlantic's 26 million customers from
Maine to Virginia. But the strike will cause delays in reaching
directory assistance, in making operator-assisted calls, in
contacting business representatives and in having telephone service
repaired or new lines installed.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the main sticking point was the union's
efforts to get Bell Atlantic to stop expanding its nonunion
subsidiaries and to stop moving work done by unionized workers into
those subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said: ``The main problem area remains that whole area of
the jobs of the future at Bell Atlantic and whether there's going
to be good high-skill high wage jobs or whether the jobs of the
future are going to be marginalized and substandard.''
</P>
<P>
   The union also said that shortly before midnight it reached a
tentative agreement with Bell South. The settlement, reached in
Atlanta, averted a strike that was scheduled to begin Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that the phone company workers have a long tradition
of walking out as soon as their contract expires, unless a new
agreement has already been negotiated. He said repair workers and
operators began picketing this morning at a Bell Atlantic building
at 40 West Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Phone company and union officials said that two sets of
negotiations were held Saturday in New York City and in the
Washington area. The negotiators have been seeking to reach a
single contract, although there will be some separate contract
language for employees who worked for Nynex and employees who
worked for Bell Atlantic, before the two companies merged.
</P>
<P>
   In attacking Bell Atlantic's growing use of nonunion operations,
officials in the communications workers union complain that
two-thirds of the new jobs added by Bell Atlantic over the past
three years have gone to nonunion workers, who are generally paid
less than the unionized workers. The nonunion workers do
telemarketing to sell phone company services, handle some accounts
and install advanced phone lines for Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   According to union officials, one of the company's nonunion
subsidiaries, Bell Atlantic Plus, based in Norfolk, Va., has 700
employees and is seeking an additional 1,400 employees. Union
officials said that Bell Atlantic had transferred some work done by
unionized workers to that new subsidiary, a move the union fears
will jeopardize the job security of union members.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials defend these new subsidiaries on the
ground that they have lower labor costs that unionized operations
</P>
<P>
   Other issues of contention include wages, Bell Atlantic's use of
forced overtime, its employing temporary workers and the terms of a
long-delayed financial package to encourage workers to take early
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   To step up pressure on the phone company, thousands of Bell
Atlantic workers staged a wildcat walkout for two-and-a-half hours
on Friday throughout New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the communications workers reached a tentative
agreement with Southern New England Telecommunications, which
provides service to most of Connecticut, averting a strike against
SNET that was to begin today.
</P>
<P>
   In that contract, SNET agreed to give the 6,300 unionized
workers an 11 percent raise over the 32-month contract and to
eliminate any obligation for them to pay premiums toward their
health insurance.

   Editors, The New York Times moved the following stories on
Saturday for its Sunday editions in connection with the terrorist
attacks on the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam:
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-BOMBINGS (Nairobi, Kenya) _ Volunteers continued a slow,
desperate effort Saturday to save people still trapped under tons
of rubble from a terrorist attack on the U.S. Embassy here, as
American medical teams and FBI investigators began to arrive in two
East African capitals. The death toll from the simultaneous
car-bomb explosions, here and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, rose
above 90 people and is likely to rise even higher. Streams of
wounded overwhelmed the city's hospitals, where more than 500
people have been admitted and more than 4,200 treated in less than
two days. By James C. McKinley Jr.

Friday. By Tim Weiner.

RAIDERS SLAM STUMBLING COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys flashed back to the woeful days of
1997 last night at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In a 16-3 exhibition loss to the Oakland Raiders, a handful of
mental bloopers and a lack of production in some key positions
reminded fans how far coach Chan Gailey's crew still has to go this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman ran for his life and Emmitt Smith had nowhere to run
behind the first-team offensive line; the Cowboys went
three-and-out in their first four possessions that netted minus-6
total yards.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, ends Kavika Pittman and Greg Ellis underscored a
first-team unit that provided no pass rush, and allowed the Raiders
to sprint for 176 total yards in the first quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   The lousy elements, which included a fumbled punt, botched snaps
in the shotgun, and two penalties for illegal formation, combined
to compromise any momentum built from what had been a productive
training camp for Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a poor showing for us,'' Gailey said. ``And it proves
to me that we have a lot of work to do. I knew we did. But this
just proves it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard night had by all on the offensive line came as somewhat
of a surprise, because the unit had shown promise with the addition
of rookie Flozell Adams, the improved conditioning of Nate Newton,
and the improved strength of center Clay Shiver. But against a
Raiders defense that ranked last against the run and the pass in
1997, it suffered a meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The misery began on the Cowboys' first offensive play. A mixup
in the middle of the line, a line that included Adams making his
first start at guard in place of the injured Everett McIver,
allowed former Cowboys defensive lineman Russell Maryland to run
untouched through the middle to bury Aikman. Two plays later,
Raiders tackle Darrell Russell plowed through the Cowboys middle to
force Aikman into a incompletion from his own end zone.
</P>
<P>
   With little time to throw against the stunting Raiders
defenders, Aikman completed was 1-of-6 passing for 6 yards. His
night mercifully ended after he was sacked a second time _ this
time by linebacker Greg Biekert _ who blew by the overwhelmed
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came after us pretty good with some of the types of
stunts and blitzes that you see in the regular season,'' Newton
said. ``But I'll make no excuses. Those are the things we work on
in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The running game was equally inept. Smith gained 3 yards on four
carries. Chris Warren had two carries for 7 yards. And Ernie Mills,
who is the favorite to start at wide receiver with Michael Irvin,
failed to catch a pass for the second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman and Ellis have also been shut out this summer in a key
statistic, sacks registered. Neither came close to quarterback Jeff
George last night, as Raiders tackles Pat Harlow and Lincoln
Kennedy provided sturdy pass protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get off the ball as well as I should have,'' said
Pitman. ``My strength is my quickness and speed and when I don't
have it those big lineman can get on me and it makes it tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The only pressure the Cowboys could muster was with the blitzing
Randall Godfrey, who got to George once. Yet this strategy cost the
Cowboys when George correctly read a blitz and tossed a 33-yard
touchdown pass to Terry Mickens, who was so wide open, because of a
Cowboys mixup in the second-team secondary, that he practically
fair-caught George's pass.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman left the game with a sprained left ankle. The severity
of his injury is unknown. Any missed time would deplete the club's
depth at a position that is primarily manned by Ellis, Pittman, and
free agents Hurvin McCormack and Herman Smith.

   ``We looked bad,'' said Irvin. ``You're going to have setbacks
in training camp. You hope they're baby steps. The step back we
took today was a giant step.''

MONDESI CLEARED TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Glenn Hoffman has used up more than his share of
lineup cards in his short career as Dodgers manager, adjusting to a
never-ending string of injuries. But he was all too eager to tear
up the lineup card Saturday less than an hour before the first
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   And he was more than happy to scribble Raul Mondesi's name in
the No. 3 slot on the new lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, out the last two games and parts of the previous two
with a lower back strain, was cleared to play by the Dodgers
medical staff after an MRI and bone scan showed no serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   He was designated day-to-day in the early afternoon, and Hoffman
figured to have his center fielder back by perhaps Tuesday. Mondesi
joked to reporters early in the day that he might play Saturday
night. ``Pinch hit, you never know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he stopped joking and started taking hacks in an
indoor batting cage in front of Hoffman and team trainers and
declared himself ready to play. Team officials were loath to argue
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman thus had his preferred 3-5 hitters _ Mondesi, Gary
Sheffield, Eric Karros _ for the first time since Tuesday. Mondesi
replaced Trenidad Hubbard in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good news. Very good news,'' Hoffman said of Mondesi's medical
report.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively speaking, it was about the best news he's had in a
week in which both Jose Vizcaino (torn ligaments, right ankle) and
Ismael Valdes (strained stomach muscle) were reported to be behind
schedule in rehabilitating their own injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real concerned. Backs are real tricky,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi was relieved when tests taken late Friday came back
negative Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was nervous,'' he said. ``The doctors said it was
nothing serious. After that, I felt better. My mind just cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   And his back? ``Much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: Lakers forward (and now free agent) Rick Fox took a
break from the NBA lockout to participate in Saturday's annual
Hollywood Stars game. A player rep for the union, Fox said
negotiations with the owners look bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way: If it keeps going the way it's going,
I'll be shooting `Oz,''' he said, referring to his part-time acting
job on the HBO series.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers pitcher Darren Dreifort, asked if he'd play in the Stars
game: ``You gotta be a star. I just play for the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Multimillion: The Dodgers passed the 2 million mark in
attendance Friday night, surpassing the mark for the 25th straight
season and 33rd time in history, the most by any major-league team.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes progresses: Valdes threw on flat ground for about 10
minutes for a fourth straight day and increased his velocity.
Hoffman called the outing encouraging but offered no timetable for
Valdes to throw off the mound. &QL;

RANGERS TUMBLE BUT INCREASE LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This must be the the Rangers' month.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox dealt the Rangers their first August loss,
yet the American League West leaders extended their lead to three
games over the second-place Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Chicago White Sox's doubleheader sweep of the
Angels earlier in the day made last night's 11-1 loss to the Red
Sox at The Ballpark in Arlington easier to digest.
</P>
<P>
   At least it beat the steady diet of knuckleballs Red Sox
right-hander Tim Wakefield fed the Rangers during his eight-inning
appearance. Wakefield (14-5) surrendered only one run on seven hits
and two walks for his third consecutive victory and eighth in his
past 10 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a pitch you don't get to see every day,'' Rangers
first baseman Will Clark said. ``It's one of those things you
really can't get in a groove with or get used to hitting because
you just don't see it very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing the Rangers aren't seeing very often are quality
starts from right-hander Aaron Sele, who surrendered seven runs on
10 hits and two walks. Sele (13-9) failed to pitch at least six
innings for the third time in six starts since representing the
Rangers at the All-Star Game. He is 1-4 with an 8.04 earned-run
average in his past five appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Sele's latest downfall began with the game's third pitch. Red
Sox right fielder Darren Bragg _ who entered the game 4-for-7 with
a double, two home runs and two walks in his career against Sele _
sent a 2-0 fastball 418 feet for a leadoff home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I needed the ball down, I kept getting it up,'' Sele
said. ``When I needed it inside, it was right over the plate. It
was just a case of me not making it very difficult for them to hit
the ball. I got behind a lot, and then I would put it right over
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive two-out singles by left fielder Troy O'Leary and
designated hitter Mike Stanley gave the Red Sox a two-run lead
after the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sele retired the first two batters in the second inning, but
Bragg collected a two-out single and scored on the ensuing home run
by third baseman John Valentin. It again would be a case of Sele
failing to locate his fastball on an 0-1 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was missing with some pitches up in the zone a little
bit,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``I just don't think
tonight we threw enough quality strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who failed to record an out in the fifth inning, departed
with a four-run deficit and the bases loaded. Reliever Al Levine
allowed all three inherited runners to score.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored their run in the sixth inning. First baseman
Will Clark reached on a one-out single and advanced to third on a
double by catcher Ivan Rodriguez. Only a two-out single by right
fielder Roberto Kelly separated the Rangers from a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield afterward called the Red Sox's victory ``a very big
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It terminated their two-game losing streak and the Rangers'
six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Rangers chose a most opportune evening in
August to lose.

Error, hit batter in 9th lift Astros
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Rookies don't catch many breaks. When they do, it's usually of the
painful variety.
</P>
<P>
   A tough first season got a little tougher for center fielder
Richard Hidalgo on Saturday night. Philadelphia reliever Mark
Leiter hit Hidalgo with the bases loaded in the ninth inning as the
Astros staged one of their familiar comebacks, earning a 7-6 win
before 42,523 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The two-run, ninth-inning rally was the Astros' second of the
night. Earlier, two home runs helped erase a 5-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The injury did not appear to be serious. Hidalgo, 23, will be
evaluated before today's series finale against the Phillies. He
missed 40 games earlier this season after separating his right
shoulder in a collision with the outfield wall at Denver's Coors
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too bad because it didn't hit me in the knee,'' said
Hidalgo, who was hit on the right leg and had a noticeable limp
after the game. ``I'm sore, but I'll be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo was filling in for regular center fielder Carl Everett,
who has missed the last two games with a strained left quadriceps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what we're going to have,'' manager Larry Dierker
said of his center-field options for today's game. ``It's going to
be one of those get-here-and-see-how-everyone-feels type lineups.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Astros were feeling pretty good after
rallying for six runs in the final four innings for their 18th
final at-bat victory this season.
</P>
<P>
   The victory boosted the Astros' lead over the Chicago Cubs to 6{
games in the National League Central with their 34th
come-from-behind victory this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros trailed 5-1 in the sixth and 6-5 in the ninth after
Bobby Estalella put the Phillies back in front with his second home
run of the game, a solo shot off Doug Henry.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella, who had only two hits in his last 29 at-bats and was
batting .152, went 3-for-4 with two home runs and three RBIs. He
also homered in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Henry picked up his eighth victory _ all of them coming in last
at-bat victories for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros down 6-5, Bill Spiers led off the ninth inning
with a double down the left-field line and Derek Bell, whose homer
in the seventh had tied the score at 5, singled to put runners at
the corners with none out.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell, who extended his hitting streak to eight games,
drove in Spiers with a fielder's choice ground ball and reached
second base on a throwing error by third baseman Scott Rolen. Rolen
was trying to stop Spiers, the tying run, at home and his throw
sailed far wide of Estalella.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter intentionally walked Moises Alou to load the bases before
throwing a sinker that hit Hidalgo in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the whole thing was ugly,'' Leiter said. ``That guy
(Spiers) has got to be hitting .500 against me. He does that all
the time. I can't make a better 0-0 pitch as far as the sinker goes
without throwing a ball, and he hit it right down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed the whole situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolen said, ``I made a bad throw and it cost us the game. We got
the play that we wanted and we were going to go home but I made a
bad throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bagwell of the Astros' late heroics, ``It's not something
we want to continue to do because chances are you're not going to
do it often. We've had some luck. The main thing in a comeback win
is the leadoff guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the leadoff guy gets on you always have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Berry began Saturday's rally with a two-run pinch homer in
the sixth inning off Phillies starter Carlton Loewer. Bell's solo
shot in the seventh, his 17th, came off reliever Wayne Gomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was gone as soon as I hit it, but I was so excited I
couldn't slow down,'' Berry said. ``You know what they say about
speeding up the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Jose Lima didn't pitch a complete game, as he had
in his previous two starts, but he overcame a rocky start to keep
the Astros in striking distance. Lima pitched six innings, allowing
five runs and six hits while striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia jumped out to a 4-0 lead off Lima on Estalella's
first homer and a three-rally in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rolen and Rico Brogna led off the fourth with singles and
former Astro Bob Abreu walked. Mark Lewis hit a sacrifice fly for
one run, Estalella doubled one in and Jon Zuber's RBI grounder made
it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Abreu hit his eighth home run of the season _ a solo shot _ in
the sixth inning to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The six-inning outing by Lima was only the third time in his
last 10 starts he failed to pitch at least seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was named National League Player of the Week on Monday after
allowing only two earned runs and striking out 16 in consecutive
complete games against Florida and Pittsburgh. He was bidding to
become the first Astros pitcher to throw three straight complete
games since Doug Drabek in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I gave up the home run, I told myself to keep the ball
down and keep the team in the game,'' said Lima, whose RBI single
in the fourth pushed across the Astros' first run. ``I think six
innings is good for the bullpen. They can do the job.''

<P>
   CARLSBAD _ The best thing about women's tennis is the
second-ranked player whose tense victory over Monica Seles on
Saturday set up a Toshiba Classic final against Mary Pierce today,
giving our hero a chance at back-to-back tournament championships,
since she beat Steffi Graf and Venus Williams last weekend at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing is the fact that unless you follow the sport
closely, you know all about Seles, Pierce, Graf and Williams but
you have no idea who I'm talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about women's tennis is Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing is the fact that because she is not the focus of
glamour photographers or lunatic fans, because she's merely
articulate but never boastful, and because her most eye-catching
decoration isn't hair beads but the little cross on her necklace,
No. 2 in the world gets about as much attention as No. 102.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Lindsay Davenport is that she wouldn't
dream of complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the position I'm in,'' said Davenport, who defeated
Seles 6-4, 2-6, 7-5 at the La Costa Resort &AMP; Spa. ``I don't really
love the spotlight. I don't want a great deal of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Newport Beach resident, who will be in Manhattan
Beach for the Acura Classic starting Monday, is the Stealth Bomber
of women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy for a second-ranked player to avoid detection by
press and public radar. It's not easy for a 6-foot, 2{-inch woman
to get lost in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But when Davenport puts her mind to it, she can accomplish
anything.
</P>
<P>
   She yearns for the days, earlier in her five-year professional
career, when she could wander among the back courts during idle
hours, watching other players.
</P>
<P>
   She's a little too well-known to do that now without attracting
a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it when I'm eating and people come up to me,''
she admits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's nothing compared to the crowds some of her rivals
attract.
</P>
<P>
   Women's tennis, and even men's tennis to an extent, discovered
years ago that sex and soap opera sells. Never, though, has the
emphasis been on appearance and personality to as embarrassing a
degree as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are to blame, journalists are to blame and the tennis
industry is to blame. The attitude is: If people watch in part
because of Graf's legs (guilty), Martina Hingis' mischievous grin
(guilty) or Pierce's pout (guilty), that's better than if they
didn't watch at all.
</P>
<P>
   There's a gossipy tennis magazine, Tennis Match, that makes
Tiger Beat look like The Economist. As far as Tennis Match is
concerned, Anna Kournikova and Patrick Rafter are Hall of Fame
shoo-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is the antidote to all that.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, during Wimbledon, an English tabloid published
a photo of a perspiring Davenport next to a photo of an equally
disheveled Meatloaf. One of those ``Separated at Birth?'' jokes. If
that struck most readers as cruel, picking on Davenport's generous
physique, it seemed to affect her not at all.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, since 1995 Davenport has shed 25 pounds. She
admits a weakness for her mother's beef Stroganoff, but jokes that
she has learned how to share.
</P>
<P>
   She's No. 2, and she looks harder. She says the leaner body is
quicker on the court, though ``I'm never going to be Arantxa
(Sanchez Vicario) or Amanda Coetzer'' when it comes to speed.
</P>
<P>
   As it also happens, Davenport's rise was overshadowed by the
arrival of the Hingis-Williams-Kournikova generation of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about Davenport that she doesn't complain when
they get all the magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all exciting, they're all outspoken and they all have
distinct personalities,'' she said of the younger women. ``They're
very much out there, kind of in your face.... They're all really
confident, like, `Hey, I'm the best.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty quiet. I keep to myself. I really like it at the
Grand Slams. The first couple of days I'm not bothered by the press
at all. All the other players are the favorites. But then I wind up
in the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Since climbing to No. 2 in February, Davenport has drawn within
587 ranking points of No. 1 Hingis, a margin she could wipe out at
the U.S. Open, which starts Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a modest seven-match winning streak on her beloved hard
courts since she was knocked out of Wimbledon in the semifinals by
Nathalie Tauziat, Davenport thinks this Open might bring her first
Grand Slam tournament victory.
</P>
<P>
   Root for her because of what !ital!won't!off! happen if she
wins.
</P>
<P>
   To those who have made fun of her body and her old immobility,
she will speak no I-told-you-sos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd ever come up to someone and say, `This is to
you guys!''' she said this week. ``I think if I win a Grand Slam,
I'll probably go in the room and say (to herself), `I did it!'''
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, it will surprise nobody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's just a balanced person,'' Seles said Saturday.
``She has a normal life. She's not just tennis, tennis. You can
talk to her about other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``(From) the players, she definitely has a lot of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   For once, the other players are worth listening to. &QL;

Cowboys' offense sputters against Raiders
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IRVING _ Despite last year's horrific outcome, the Cowboys came
into this season with only a few starting jobs up for grabs. After
Saturday night, most of them should be.
</P>
<P>
   If last year's 6-10 record still gives Cowboys fans fits,
Saturday night's 16-3 preseason loss to the Oakland Raiders should
give them nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey's new offense didn't sputter; it died. The
Cowboys' first team ran a grand total of 12 plays in four
possessions, taking them one minute into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came after us pretty good with some of the types of
stunts and blitzes that you see in the regular season,'' guard Nate
Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   Which wouldn't seem to bode well for the upcoming regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make no excuses,'' Newton said. ``Those are the things
that we work on in practice _ and we have a lot more work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to determine which part of the Cowboys' game looked
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   They had a total of minus-six yards with the trio of Troy
Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman completed only one pass in six attempts for a total of
six yards.
</P>
<P>
   Smith carried four times for three yards.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin had only one catch for six yards.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line allowed two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   There was one fumble.
</P>
<P>
   There were no first downs.
</P>
<P>
   And that was all in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like anything but the same offense that was touted
last week after scoring a touchdown on its second possession
against Seattle. The first-teamers also scored against Oakland in
Thursday night's scrimmage in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a poor job of handling the blitz,'' Gailey said. ``We
did not run the ball effectively. It was just a poor showing for us
and it proves to me that we have a lot of work to do. I knew we
did, but this just proves it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offensive line, which was still without guard
Everett McIver, was manhandled. Former Cowboy Russell Maryland
easily broke through against center Clay Shiver to sack Aikman for
a loss of eight yards on Dallas' first play of the game. Aikman was
later sacked in the shotgun formation as Greg Biekert got past
rookie Flozell Adams to knock Aikman for a seven-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Cowboys surrendered too many big plays. On the
Raiders' first possession, Jeff George connected with free-agent
acquisition Terry Mickens on a pass of 18 yards. Olanda Truitt then
burned Darren Woodson for a catch of 43 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' second-team secondary didn't fare any better as Truitt
later slipped by Kenny Wheaton for a catch of 24 yards. Mickens
went deep for a 33-yard catch, then trotted into the end zone with
the nearest Dallas defender a good 15 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   It was a comedy of errors, beginning on only the third play of
the game when Woodson was flagged for illegal contact. The Cowboys
then drew whistles on their first and second possessions for
illegal formations as they struggled to get the right personnel
into the right places for their new plays.
</P>
<P>
   It was second-team quarterback Jason Garrett who eventually led
the Cowboys to their only score, a 22-yard field goal by Richie
Cunningham, the scapegoat last week after missing the game-tying
extra point against Seattle. The Cowboys' second team scored on its
first trip downfield after Garrett completed his first four passes
to spark a nine-play, 40-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The halftime statistics were embarrassing. The Raiders had 253
net yards to Dallas' 46. The biggest distinction came in passing
yards, where Jeff George and Rice-ex Donald Hollas combined for 202
yards. Aikman and Garrett threw for only 23.
</P>
<P>
   As for the positions that were up for grabs, nobody made much of
a case for themselves. The Cowboys are still looking for a No. 2
receiver, but a woeful offense made it difficult for anyone to
stand out. Billy Davis caught back-to-back passes from Garrett for
14 yards in the second quarter. Ernie Mills was shut out and Jimmy
Oliver left the game with injured ribs after his only catch, which
netted 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The other hottest contest is at free safety, where Omar
Stoutmire is battling George Teague and Wheaton. Stoutmire was
beaten by Mickens, but later redeemed himself by batting away a
long pass at the Dallas 40. Wheaton also was burned on a pass and
Teague played sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys scrimmage the Saints on Tuesday night in Shreveport,
La., then travel to Mexico City for an exhibition game against the
Patriots on Aug. 17. They travel to St. Louis and Jacksonville for
their final two preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good wakeup call for us,'' Gailey said. ``No, this
was a bad wakeup call for us.''

COWBOYS NO CLOSER TO ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said his football team
faces more questions in 1998 than at any time since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Two games into the preseason, the Cowboys are still looking for
answers.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the team seemingly took a step backward
with an uninspired effort in last night's 16-3 loss to the Oakland
Raiders at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Any progress made in the preseason opener against the Seattle
Seahawks and in the past week of practice was seemingly lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves we got a lot of work to do,'' Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey said. ``We've got to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's collective ``we'' was directed at the entire team, but
it especially held true for the areas the Cowboys had the most
questions going into training camp: at right guard, second receiver
and defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth second-round pick Flozell Adams, the rave of training
camp since taking over for injured starter Everett McIver, looked
like an untutored rookie.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a few missed assignments, the 6-foot-7,
335-pounder was embarrassed by Greg Biekert when the Raiders'
linebacker beat him inside for a sack on Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' spotty play and McIver's absence from practice the past
week after he sustained a cut on his neck in a dorm incident have
raised more questions about the offensive line. McIver remains the
starter. But it's unclear how much the layoff has impeded his
development and the line's cohesiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders took advantage of the lack of continuity with
several successful blitzes and stunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things we work on in practice, and we have a lot of
work to do,'' Cowboys guard Nate Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive ends Greg Ellis and Kavika Pittman have yet to prove
that they can rush the passer in the NFL. Neither came close to the
quarterback last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are looking to address the problem with a free-agent
addition.
</P>
<P>
   The battle at second receiver between Billy Davis and Ernie
Mills proved inconclusive for the second consecutive week. Mills,
signed as a free agent during the off-season, is considered the
favorite because of his familiarity with Gailey's offense from his
days in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But after looking great in training camp, Mills has disappeared
during the preseason games. He went without a catch against Seattle
and duplicated the performance against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has had minimal impact as well. His two catches for 14
yards last night give him four for 23 yards in two preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also hoped to take a look at former TCU speedster
Jimmy Oliver as a possible replacement for Herschel Walker at
kickoff returner. However, Oliver's presence was brief.
</P>
<P>
   After returning one kick 17 yards in the first quarter, Oliver
sustained bruised ribs on a reception and didn't return to the
game. The injury added to concerns about Oliver's durability.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver has yet to play a down in the NFL after being drafted by
the San Diego Chargers in 1995. He missed his rookie year with a
separated shoulder. A knee injury sidelined him in 1996. He was
released in 1997.

Astros reliever Henry feasts on team's ability to score in last
at-bat
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Doug Henry has acquired a nickname that's not particularly
flattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry's the `Vulture,''' Astros manager Larry Dierker said
after his team beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-6 on Saturday night
in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, a righthanded reliever, entered a tie game in the ninth
inning and gave up a home run to a .200-hitting rookie catcher,
Bobby Estalella.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros came back to score two in the bottom of the
ninth, giving Henry his eighth victory of the season _ all
delivered in the Astros' last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the nickname ``Vulture,'' which in baseball parlance is a
reliever who picks up what others have left for him, without having
to work hard for his meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could argue with him,'' Henry said when informed of
his new nickname. ``I don't want to be a vulture. But I can't argue
with him tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker actually is happy to have a vulture because it means his
team is coming from behind, snatching victory when it appears lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``You often find one on a team that comes back to win a lot of
games,'' he said. ``I remember in '86 we had Charley Kerfeld. And
then another year we had Juan Agosto.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker is beginning to think of Henry as a good-luck charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he comes in, we score runs,'' Dierker said. ``Some games
he hasn't pitched well and we still win. Some games he's pitched
well and he hasn't gotten the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Henry, a free-agent acquisition in the offseason, has
been effective. He has a 2.92 ERA and has held opponents to a .210
batting average. His only problem has been home runs: nine in 52
innings.
</P>
<P>
   He throws reasonably hard _ 92 mph _ but he has a tendency to
use the fastball too often and to leave it too high.
</P>
<P>
   Estalella had pounded a fastball for a home run off Jose Lima in
the third inning, so Dierker was expecting Henry, 34, to try a
different strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking he'd throw some breaking balls to Estalella,''
Dierker said. ``But he threw four straight fastballs and one of
them went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry didn't think it was the wrong strategy; he just didn't put
the pitch where he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   With the count 2-1, he said he ``was trying to throw a fastball
away, and it ran up and in. It was a terrible pitch. It was so bad
he shouldn't have swung at it. He should have let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   He let it go, all right. Over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made some excitement for the fans,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The Astros rallied, as they often do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting on the bench, the maddest guy in the stadium,''
Henry said. ``But if you keep these boys in the game, they're going
to find a way to win. We've gotten to quite a few closers this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   This time their victim was Mark Leiter (6-3), who has saved 20
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happened to be at the right place at the right time,''
Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   But he wanted the record straight on his 8-2 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've only vultured two wins all year,'' he said,
referring to games in which he's given the opponents a lead and
wound up claiming the win.
</P>
<P>
   It also should be pointed out that while his teammates often
help Henry, he has been brilliant at bailing his fellow pitchers
out of jams. Of the 26 baserunners Henry has inherited, he has
allowed only six to score.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that when he's in a game, the Astros usually
win it. On a baseball team, a vulture is no albatross.

SMITH VISIT POSTPONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Defensive end Fernando Smith, who was released
by the Minnesota Vikings this spring, has postponed his visit to
work out with the Cowboys until tomorrow. Smith worked out with the
Washington Redskins yesterday and was scheduled to visit the
Cowboys today, but moved the workout back a day to tomorrow because
of scheduling problems, his agent, Jeff Durand, said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is expected to meet Smith in Wichita
Falls. If the workout goes well, Jones has indicated that he would
rework several contracts in an attempt to fit Smith under the
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Durand said his client wants to play for a team that would give
him a chance to start. He also said Smith would not accept a
contract offer less than the $1.3 million he was scheduled to earn
with the Vikings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he had surgery to repair a hernia, which limited his
effectiveness in 1997, Durand said. Since word of the hernia
operation became public, Durand said the Vikings have considered
re-signing Smith, who had his finest season for the club in 1996
with 65 tackles, 9.5 sacks, three forced fumbles and two fumble
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was misdiagnosed,'' Durand said, ``I don't think anyone
knew what was wrong with him. The Vikings want to talk to him. And
there is no animosity here. But they are on the list like the rest
of the clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Redskins, Smith already has visited Jacksonville,
Atlanta, Chicago, and New Orleans. Durand said several of these
clubs have told him they would meet Smith's asking price. He said
his client probably won't make a decision until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Lyons Sanders makes impact In his first game action of
the preseason, Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders wasted no time
making an impact. On last night's first snap against the Raiders,
Sanders, often criticized for avoiding contact, lowered his
shoulder and dropped the Raiders' Napoleon Kaufman for a loss with
a solid hit on a flare pass to the left flat.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, recovering from off-season ankle surgery, was held out
of the preseason opener against the Seattle Seahawks on July 31 and
the contact portion of Thursday night's scrimmage against the
Raiders as a precaution. He played the first three series and was
not tested by Raiders quarterback Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andy Friedlander Woodson looks rusty In his first preseason
action of the year, Cowboys Pro Bowl safety Darren Woodson looked
out of place during the first series of last night's game. After
committing an illegal contact penalty on the third play, Woodson
was beaten by Raiders receiver Olanda Truitt for a 43-yard
reception two plays later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joel Anderson Raiders rookie sees action Raiders first-round
draft pick Charles Woodson made several brief appearances last
night. Woodson, who is competing with six-year veteran James Trapp
for the starting left cornerback position, deflected one pass.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joel Anderson Hemsley impresses Second-year linebacker Nate
Hemsley had an impressive series of downs on a goal-line stand late
in the second quarter. The Raiders had a first down from the 2-yard
line, but Hemsley was involved in three consecutive tackles that
forced the Raiders to settle for a 20-yard field goal. Hemsley, a
member of the Cowboys' practice squad last season after being
signed as a free agent out of Syracuse by the Tennessee Oilers,
left the game in the third quarter after sustaining a sprained left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joel Anderson Oliver down on his luck Former TCU receiver
Jimmy Oliver, who has endured a string of injuries in his first
three NFL seasons, was taken to the locker room for X-rays after
sustaining bruised ribs. Oliver was injured on a reception. He did
not return to the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joel Anderson Dawson in home state Dallas native and former
University of Texas kicker Phil Dawson made a homecoming of sorts
yesterday evening. Dawson is in a three-way battle with incumbent
Raiders kicker Cole Ford and veteran Greg Davis for the starting
position. Dawson connected on an extra-point in the first quarter,
but missed a 47-yard field-goal attempt in the third.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joel Anderson Penalty problems After struggling with penalties
against Seattle last week, the Cowboys had their problems again
last night, drawing five flags in the first half, including two for
illegal formation on consecutive third-and-long plays in the first
quarter. Both were declined after the Cowboys failed to make the
first down. In addition, the Cowboys were called for late-hit
personal fouls against Darren Hambrick and Harold Gragg.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andy Friedlander Shotgun blunders The much-discussed shotgun
formation misfired time after time last night, leading to fumbled
snaps by reserve quarterbacks Jason Garrett and Josh LaRocca from
center Steve Scifres. Another Garrett fumble was negated by an
Oakland penalty, and Troy Aikman had to pick a low snap from Clay
Shiver off his shoetops.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andy Friedlander McIver to practice Cowboys guard Everett
McIver, who sustained a deep cut in a training-camp dormitory
incident on July 29, will return to practice for the first time
tomorrow. He will not play in Tuesday's scrimmage against New
Orleans in Shreveport, La., the Cowboys said, but is expected to
play in the Aug. 17 exhibition game against New England.
They said it.
``Ya'll \Rthe media\S are working harder than the police to put me
in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin, reacting to reports he was
involved in the dormitory incident where guard Everett McIver
sustained a neck wound.

NO LOVE LOST FOR BONDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Barry Bonds might be a three-time National League
Most Valuable Player, but he also is baseball's most hated player.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds started a bench-clearing brawl last week between the San
Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies by charging the mound
after he was struck by a pitch from Ricky Bottalico. During the
fight, both sides said Bonds is just a bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took exception to Bonds stealing second base in the
fifth inning with the Giants leading 9-2 in a game they'd
eventually win 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   After Bonds and Bottalico were ejected, Bonds exchanged words
with Phillies ace Curt Schilling on his way back to the Giants
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were exchanging words,'' Schilling said. ``But I wasn't
saying anything his teammates weren't saying about him on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   One Phillie said Giants right-hander Danny Darwin told him that
he hated coming out in defense of Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy (Bonds) is a first-ballot Hall of Famer,'' Schilling
said. ``No doubt. But when you don't play the game right, bad
things happen. And he deserved what happened. There's no excuse for
anybody at this level to play the game the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that the Giants had blown big leads in each
of the first two games of the series. Bonds, in fact, did note
exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only the fifth inning and they'd come back on us two
days in a row,'' he said. ``Where do you draw the line? For the
first five innings, you play the game out. After that, you give the
other team common courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't matter to Phillies reserve infielder Alex Arias, who
was ejected after taking a few steps toward the mound after he was
struck by a Kirk Reuter pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitcher's got to do what the pitcher's got to do,'' Arias
said. ``If he's told to throw at me, I don't care. It was Barry who
started the whole thing. No doubt he's a great player. But do you
want to be great piling up stats that don't mean anything? I'm sure
half his stolen bases came that way. I've never had respect for
that guy. Ever. Even though he's a great player. He's a stats guy.
That's all he's worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Phillies rookie catcher Bobby Estalella got in on the Barry
bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to look up to these guys, but what he did today makes
you not want to respect him at all,'' Estalella said.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Bonds described anybody who ripped him as
``chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody has a problem with me,'' he said, ``I'll give them
my phone number. We can meet in person and handle it.'' &QL; 
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza has told at least two teammates that he's finished
with the New York Mets, and will leave as soon as the season is
over. Piazza has been booed loudly for failing to live up to the
public's expectations after the Mets won nine straight following
Piazza's acquisition on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, when contract negotiations broke off, Piazza was
hitting only .208 with runners in scoring position, and he wasn't
in the top ten among NL hitters in home runs, RBI or slugging
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   This week Piazza has turned so sour he distanced himself from
virtually all his teammates, with the exception of John Franco and
Al Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Said one teammate: ``(Piazza) basically told me to have fun
without him next year.''
</P>
<P>
   This obviously is no longer a problem for the Dodgers, who
offered a six-year contract worth $85 million before trading him
May 15. But as Piazza turns 30 in September, he is another year
older without a championship. That has made his place as one of
baseball's most feared hitters seem a little hollow. He is not
expected to get anything near the money the Dodgers offered.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was angry with the Dodgers then and he is mad at the Mets
now.
</P>
<P>
   New York never made much of an attempt in the last 2{ months to
begin negotiations with Piazza. They kept waiting, trying to
determine whether Piazza's presence would jump-start the Mets into
the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   He did that, but more importantly, the Mets wanted to see if
Piazza's presence would bring fans to the park. The Mets were
averaging 20,000 a game before Piazza arrived; 27,000 a game since.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last week, Piazza and the Mets officially put an end to
the talks that never really started, tabling the matter until after
the season. GM Steve Phillips said, ``we decided to wait, at Mike's
request.'' &QL; 
TROUBLE IN CLEVELAND
</P>
<P>
   While the New York Yankees went after Seattle left-hander Randy
Johnson to keep him away from Cleveland, the Indians really needed
him. Now he's in Houston and Cleveland's pitching staff is in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the All-Star break, the starting rotation of Jaret
Wright, Bartolo Colon, Dave Burba, Charles Nagy and Dwight Gooden
was one of the team's strengths. But fatigue and injuries have
become a problem. The Indians are especially concerned that
youngsters Wright and Colon may have been overpitched in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Since the break, Colon, who had five complete games in the first
half, has pitched eight innings only once. In Wright's last two
starts, he has allowed 14 earned runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' said Wright, who will start today at Tampa Bay.
``I don't know what having a dead arm means. I'm just tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden went into the break strong but was 0-3 in his next four
starts and the Indians were actively shopping him before the
deadline. Chad Ogea was ready to take Gooden's spot in the rotation
but developed a sore knuckle on the middle finger of his right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to acquiring Johnson?
</P>
<P>
   According to GM John Hart, Seattle asked for Burba, reliever
Paul Shuey, infielder Enrique Wilson and Brian Giles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not tear the heart out of our major-league club to get
a guy who would be here for only 60 days,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Houston acquired Johnson for prospects, Hart said: ``We
were baffled. Whenever we talked to Seattle it was about a
major-league trade for star-quality players. We barely talked about
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart would have liked to have had that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was nowhere for us to pick up a deal because we'd
hardly ever talked about prospects with the Mariners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said the Mariners tried to pit the Indians and Yankees
against each other to drive up the price for Johnson. ``But neither
team blinked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Johnson. But I haven't lost a minute of sleep because
of the price being asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder how he will feel in the postseason. &QL; 
TRADE QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   There appears to have been some panic involved in the Cubs'
trading last year's No. 1 pick Jon Garland from Kennedy High School
to the Chicago White Sox for middle reliever Matt Karchner. They
also traded right-hander Todd Noel, their top pick in 1996, along
with one-time starting third baseman Kevin Orie and right-hander
Justin Speier (son of Chris Speier) to Florida for Felix Heredia
and a minor-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts are saying that was too much potential for not much
talent. Heredia is 22 and made a reputation by throwing 51/3
scoreless innings last year in four World Series appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Karchner, on the other hand, is 31 and has been on the DL in six
of the last nine seasons, including once this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs need for relief pitching is critical. They entered the
weekend with a 2{ game wild-card lead, then dropped the first two
games of the series in St. Louis 16-3 and 9-8. Now, the Cubs' lead
has been cut to a half-game over the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox seemed overwhelmed that they could land Garland
for Karchner. In his White Sox minor-league debut last Monday,
Garland allowed two hits and struck out 11 in six innings for
Single-A Hickory (N.C.).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people I've talked to in other organizations are
impressed with Jon,'' GM Ron Schueler said. ``Everybody I talked to
(after the trade) said, `I had no idea he was available.' They just
couldn't believe they would part with the kid. I hope he's as
special as they think he is.'' &QL; 
JACK WILL BE BACK
</P>
<P>
   The Reds offered manager Jack McKeon a one-year contract
extension Monday _ over the phone. McKeon, who says he wants to
stay, was surprised by the call and wanted to wait to accept until
this weekend when he and GM Jim Bowden could sit down and talk.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt both men will make sure they're still on the same page
in terms of the rebuilding process. Both know they must continue to
build with young players, but McKeon wants to make sure there are a
few veterans in the mix. Bowden will likely advocate playing more
kids next year.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon has a reputation for being good with young players, and
some, like 24-year-old rookie Sean Casey and 24-year-old Dmitri
Young, agree. McKeon stuck with both even when Casey struggled at
the plate (1 for 29 before a short trip back to the minors after
his eye surgery) and Young had trouble learning to play left field
when Casey took over in Young's natural position, first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a fine manager for us,'' said Young, who thought
Tony La Russa wasn't patient enough with young players like him
last year in St. Louis. ``He's been a great influence on me. He
gives you a chance to play and learn from your mistakes. It's a
learning process for all of us. You've got to be patient, and he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are watching the Reds because of the All-Star break
trades that sent top prospect Paul Konerko and left-hander Dennis
Reyes to Cincinnati for closer Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko has since been sent to the minors, but Reyes was
recalled from Triple-A this week and has won his first two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Where do they fit into McKeon's plan? Too soon to tell.
</P>
<P>
   There are many in the Reds' clubhouse who think McKeon's
reputation for patience is undeserved. He has been harder on some
players _ like 25-year-old second-year pitcher Brett Tomko, deposed
first baseman Eduardo Perez and 25-year-old third baseman Aaron
Boone _ than his favorites like Casey and Young.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon says the criticism reflects the job of dealing with 25
personalities. ``That's natural,'' he says. ``You've got 25 guys on
a team, maybe 17 or 18 like you and five or six (you) don't.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon says he's been patient this year, but as the kids grow
up, his tone may have to change a little. He says he's had some fun
this year, though it has often been a tough season. ``I try to be
understanding to a point,'' he said. ``Sometimes I get riled up and
have to bite my lip. Sometimes I want to jump on them, but the more
they play, the fewer mistakes they'll make. I don't know if there
will be more pressure next year, but I wouldn't expect to be as
patient. I'd be disappointed if some of the same mistakes went on
next year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
This week's series between Florida and the Dodgers will be more
than a homecoming between Gary Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Charles
Johnson and Jim Eisenreich and what little remains of the Marlins
championship team. Florida's Mark Kotsay, who grew up in Santa Fe
Springs, has bought 110 tickets for Tuesday's game at Dodger
Stadium, and 110 more for Wednesday night's game. He's also rented
a city bus to take them all to the games. &QL; 
ROTISSERIE WATCH &QL; 
The White Sox's Albert Belle leads the major leagues with 17 homers
(in 26 games) since the All-Star break. He has 35 homers and 97
RBI, which puts him on a pace for 50 homers and 138 RBI. The White
Sox records are 41 homers by Frank Thomas in 1993 and 138 RBI by
Zeke Bonura in 1936. &QL; 
STAT OF THE WEEK &QL; 
Astros second baseman Craig Biggio didn't play in Wednesday's game,
his first day off after 494 consecutive games, which was the
second-longest active consecutive-games streak in the majors (well
behind Cal Ripken's ongoing record of 2,593 entering today.) On
Saturday, Biggio, who last missed a game on July 31, 1995, was in
the on-deck circle in the seventh inning, but manager Larry Dierker
sent up Brad Ausmus instead. &QL; 
THE BUZZ &QL; 
Right-hander Orlando Hernandez has lost 15 pounds in two months,
causing concern among Yankees officials. El Duque reported to the
big leagues at 218 pounds but dropped to 203 during last week's
West Coast trip. Hernandez, a heavy smoker, will see a specialist
this weekend in New York, although coach Jose Cardenal believes the
problem can be traced to stress: Hernandez left two daughters and
most of his family in Cuba when he defected on a raft last
December. &QL; 
QUOTABLE &QL; 
``There's nothing wrong with my arm. There's nothing wrong with my
arm. Print that. There is nothing wrong with my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Cubs rookie Kerry Wood, after he was routed by Arizona on
Wednesday amid reports that he had a tired arm. If Wood, who starts
Tuesday in San Francisco, stays on track, he will face Houston's
Randy Johnson on Aug. 22 at Wrigley Field.

TEXAS DROUGHT TAKES HEAVY TOLL ON FISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB HOOD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fish kills such as one discovered last week on the Nueces River
near Corpus Christi might become even more common statewide if
prolonged hot temperatures and lack of rainfall continue to lower
the levels of lakes, rivers and streams, Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to see fish kills pop up all around the
state,'' said Larry McKinney, the department's senior director for
aquatic resources. ``In most instances, they have been caused by
low oxygen levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The water levels on many freshwater lakes have dropped eight to
10 feet since mid-March, and many rivers and streams have dried up
or become shallow pools, forcing fish to crowd into smaller areas
where they face steadily declining oxygen levels.
</P>
<P>
   Hit hardest by the drought have been Falcon and Amistad
reservoirs, on the Rio Grande River. Falcon is 90 percent empty _
more than 51 feet below its conservation pool elevation, or full
level. Amistad, which when full spreads across 67,000 acres, has
shrunk to 21,000 acres, about 6,690 acres smaller than the size of
popular Lake Fork in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the fish kills have occurred in rivers and
streams, where water flows have ceased. Fish kills on major
freshwater lakes have not reached a critical stage statewide,
officials said, but they have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The Nueces River fish kill involved species sought by anglers,
including flounder, according to biologist Ken Rice, who is
monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found southern flounder, striped mullet and thousands of
Gulf menhaden,'' said Rice, a parks and wildlife department
biologist. ``Basically what happened is that there has been no flow
from Lake Corpus Christi above the area,'' Rice said. ``Then there
was a discharge from a waste-water unit into the river, causing a
big algal bloom. With no tidal movement or flow, the nutrients
began to collect and not mix in. The big algal bloom just sucked up
all of the oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   Another creek in the Rio Grande Valley has also experienced the
deaths of menhadens, and some ranch country lakes, such as those
behind San Jose Island, have experienced deaths among fish stranded
by lowering water levels, Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 4, the death of an estimated 1,800 largemouth bass at
Sam Rayburn Reservoir was blamed by the department on heat-related
stress, which possibly occurred after fish were released into
warmer-than-usual waters by anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Another freshwater fish kill occurred at Lake O.C. Fisher near
San Angelo, where mostly rough fish such as carp began dying in the
North Concho River on the extreme upper reaches of the lake a few
weeks ago. That fish kill began to spread to the main lake,
however, as levels of dissolved oxygen began to decrease, killing
game fish, including sand bass.
</P>
<P>
   Fish kills are expected annually, especially during hot, dry
summers in areas of West Texas where such weather conditions are
more common than elsewhere in the state. However, biologist Joan
Glass of Waco said those deaths, which normally occur in inlets and
small streams as levels begin to dwindle, started showing up about
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always expect to see some die-offs during the summer in
small streams,'' Glass said. ``But they usually don't start
happening until after August. This year, they started showing up
about one month early.''
</P>
<P>
   One area that is being closely monitored is the Canadian River
north of Amarillo. Home of the largest population of Arkansas River
shiners in the United States, a fish proposed to be added to the
endangered species list, the Canadian River has no flow and has
dried to pools.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said some fish species are more tolerant to river flow
variations and are able to bounce back when the flows return.
</P>
<P>
   Many area lakes have suffered from a lack of rain. Lakes
Grapevine, Whitney and Lewisville were five to eight feet above
their full marks March 18. This week, Lewisville's level had
dropped more than three feet below its full capacity, Whitney's
level had fallen 51/2 feet below full, and Grapevine stood at
almost three feet low.
</P>
<P>
   Although low water conditions have created water hazards such as
stumps, rocks and sand or gravel bars that a few months ago were
far enough under the surface for safe boating, fishing success has
actually increased on some lakes by concentrating the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they predict that more fish deaths will occur if
hot, dry conditions continue through September, especially in
tributaries and rivers.

TYSON'S VALUE TO BOXING WELL-DOCUMENTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOEL ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson, the one-time ``Baddest Man on the Planet,'' has
experienced more triumphs and tragedies than a year of daytime
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   He's an ex-heavyweight boxing champion and million-dollar
moneymaking machine for former promoter Don King. He's also a
convicted rapist, and the man who bit Evander Holyfield on the ears
in a heavyweight title fight.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of his many conquests and controversies, Tyson
is the sport's greatest attraction since ``The Greatest of All
Time,'' Muhammad Ali, boxing insiders and fans say.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson sparked another drama last month when he applied for a
license to box in New Jersey. His boxing license was revoked after
he gnawed Holyfield's ears in their heavyweight title rematch in
June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Jersey hearing, Tyson lost his composure amid more
than 40 minutes of questioning. He accentuated the outburst with an
expletive.
</P>
<P>
   Such sensational and provocative behavior expands the list of
compelling arguments against licensing his return. But consider
this:
</P>
<P>
   Boxing without Tyson means ``marquee'' matchups such as George
Foreman vs. Larry Holmes, two middle-age, overweight heavyweight
champs from the '70s and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing without Tyson yields less than half the pay-per-view
revenue than it does with him.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing without Tyson means that celebrities and gentry alike
won't plunk down $1,500 for a ringside seat at Caesar's Palace.
Pay-per-view operators gleefully charge $49.95 for the show. Even
nonboxing fans are eager to catch whispers of Tyson's return.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps boxing ``does'' need this man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings interest into boxing,'' said Jeff Pomeroy, publicist
for Showtime Sports and Event programming. ``Not many boxers can
bring in many other people besides the fight fan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ``the'' box office draw in boxing,'' said Ferdie
Pacheco, analyst for Showtime's Championship Boxing series.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers seem to bear out that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and Holyfield's second fight in the MGM Grand Garden, the
highest grossing fight in boxing history, raked in $14 million at
the gate and $2 million in pay-per-view sales, said Marc Ratner,
executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission. The
commission revoked Tyson's license for a year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Holyfield-Michael Moorer match four months
later at the Nevada-Las Vegas campus earned $5 million to $6
million at the gate and $600,000 to 700,000 in pay-per-view sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's staggering ... He's the biggest draw the sport has,''
Ratner said. ``When Mike fights, it's a front-page story, whereas
most other fights are just on the sports page.''
</P>
<P>
   When estimating Tyson's financial worth to boxing, consider that
in his first fight after being released from prison, Tyson earned
$25 million _ the largest purse ever at the time _ to fight the
less-than-formidable Peter McNeeley.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson fought six times in that two-year period for no less than
$10 million, earning a total of $140 million _ including $30
million to fight Holyfield twice.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawsuits filed against King, Tyson's former
promoter, 50 percent of Tyson's purses and contracts with Showtime
TV and MGM Grand Hotel-Casino came to $106 million.
</P>
<P>
   Said promoter Scott Sherman: ``A promoter can make money with
Tyson. He's important to boxing in that he's very controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Tyson manager Bill Cayton said he agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's important to the boxing business,'' Cayton said.
``He's by far the top-seller in pay-per-view history.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pomeroy: ``When Mike is fighting, the world watches.
There's not many boxers who can bring the ratings he can.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pomeroy, Tyson has been a part of seven of the top
10 pay-per-view events in history.
</P>
<P>
   How is Tyson's immense attraction explained? If he's so
undesirable to so many people, why do they continue to watch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because people like train wrecks,'' Pacheco said. ``I've yet
to see anyone turn off TV because they didn't like someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Charley Steiner, an ESPN boxing analyst, said interest in Tyson
is not because of his fighting skill, or because he is a fan
favorite. Instead, it's because of ``a morbid curiosity about
Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what he's going to do,'' Steiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco added, ``He hasn't shown that he has the capacity to
take stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said Tyson is not the fighter he once was, making him
less important to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the greatest attraction in all of sports,'' Steiner
said. ``But he's not as good a fighter anymore. People will tune in
to Tyson no matter what. Sadly, even Joe Louis was an attraction
past his prime. With Tyson you never know what you're going to get.
Who would have thought Tyson would be in this predicament now?''
</P>
<P>
   But can he be replaced?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody needs anybody. We are all replaceable. Life goes on,''
said Angelo Dundee, who trained Ali and Sugar Ray Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the sport survived the loss of Ali, Ratner noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened after Muhammad Ali?'' he said. ``The sport will
go on. The sport has to be bigger than its athletes.''

WITHOUT HELP, THESE ANGELS HAVE NO PRAYER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels appear to be a team ready to fall apart. If
the Rangers can survive the next two weeks against the Yankees, Red
Sox and Indians, they could win the American League West going
away.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, disappointed that general manager Bill Bavasi failed
to make a significant move before the deadline, took another shot
when popular first baseman Cecil Fielder was designated for
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Fielder had been in a slump lately but he's a veteran with
playoff experience and had emerged in his first season with the
Angels as an important clubhouse leader. His departure upset
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things \RFielder\S does in this clubhouse
that people don't know about,'' catcher Phil Nevin told the ``Los
Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking away our best leader. He's the only guy who's
been through the wars of the World Series and won it. They brought
him in here to hit and for his leadership, and he's done both. I
don't know what else he could have done for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielder was a big part of the Angels winning 22 of 28 in June,
as he hit .295 with 12 homers and 29 runs batted in. But he was
batting .214 with three homers and 12 RBI in 25 games since.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, trying to shake things up, brought up third baseman
Troy Glaus from the minor leagues and moved Dave Hollins to first.
Fielder signed with the Angels to be their designated hitter, but
Tim Salmon is limited to that duty because a foot injury prevents
him from playing the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are in the division race because of what they did in
June. But outside of that month, they are 38-47 and have definite
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, their starting pitchers had a combined earned-run
average of 4.81 and only Chuck Finley, 8-5 with a 3.06 ERA, has
kept the rotation from falling apart. The Angels were hoping to
trade for pitching help in Tim Belcher or Juan Guzman before the
trade deadline. Instead they settled for Jeff Juden, and they're
hoping Ken Hill can have an impact when he comes off the disabled
list at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill, 8-5 with a 5.15 ERA, didn't exactly inspire confidence
when he tried to deflect that pressure, saying, ``Who knows? I
could pitch worse.''
</P>
<P>
   A trade for Belcher is a possibility. He would have to clear
waivers but the Angels have the right to claim somebody before any
team with a better record, and it's unlikely a team out of
contention would claim Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have a terrific outfield with budding superstar Darin
Erstad, Jim Edmonds and Garret Anderson. But their infield is
mediocre, especially without Fielder, and the best they could do to
help their catching was pick up Charlie O'Brien from the White Sox.
He's on the disabled list with a bad thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we have to do some things to shake things
up a little bit,'' Salmon said. ``This team needs to do something
to get it turned around. Everybody knows how badly we need to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody except Disney, apparently. The entertainment giant
that runs the Angels seems content to concentrate on marketing and
promotion and not to worry about the product. There has been talk
they'll pursue Mike Piazza in the off-season, but the Disney track
record makes that seem laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the Rangers barely fought off the late-season
charge of the Seattle Mariners to win the division. This season,
even as tight as things seem, they could win it without a fight
unless the Angels do something to get their snoozing franchise
turned around.
POP UPS
Tribe troubles
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians have serious concerns about their starting
rotation. Going into the weekend, pitchers Jaret Wright, Dwight
Gooden, Bartolo Colon, Charles Nagy and Dave Burba were a combined
6-12 with a 5.62 ERA since the All-Star break. The Indians are
particularly concerned that Wright and Colon might have pitched too
much in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   There are few alternatives beyond reliever Steve Karsay. Chad
Ogea, who has been on the disabled list twice this season, was
optioned to Triple A, where he has developed a sore knuckle on his
pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians pursued Randy Johnson but general manager John Hart
said the Mariners wanted Burba, reliever Paul Shuey, infielder
Enrique Wilson and outfielder Brian Giles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not tear the heart out of our major-league club to get
a guy who would be here for only 60 days,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said the Mariners tried to pit the Yankees against the
Indians, ``But neither team blinked.'' Hart said he was surprised
that the Astros got Johnson for prospects, something he hardly
talked about with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers fans should watch the Indians carefully, particularly if
the Red Sox win the wild card. If the Rangers and Indians win their
divisions, the team with the better record will play the Red Sox in
the first round. The loser gets the New York Yankees. If the Angels
win the wild card, the Rangers will play the Indians in the first
round.
Piazza unhappy in NY
Mets catcher Mike Piazza seems determined to get out of New York as
a free agent at the end of the season. He has been booed by fans
and criticized severely by the local press for not driving in more
runs. He's also not happy the Mets haven't made an effort to
re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a tough town,'' Mets assistant general manager
Omar Minaya said. ``But we're going to try and re-sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza isn't talking but teammates have been telling New York
writers that he's gone. There's also the belief that the Mets gave
reliever John Franco a two-year, $6 million extension to soften the
blow of Piazza's departure.
Padres go all-out
</P>
<P>
   The Padres showed again what a crucial season this is for them
by acquiring pitcher Randy Myers from the Toronto Blue Jays on
Thursday. The deal, for two minor-leaguers, committed them to $12
million the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are hoping their terrific season convinces voters to
approve a $411 downtown million ballpark in November. The Padres
should win the National League West, but getting Myers the day
after he blew a save against the Rangers was done with an eye
toward postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Myers gives the Padres a good left-handed reliever to go with
closer Trevor Hoffman. The trade also keeps him away from the
Atlanta Braves, who are desperate for relief pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, because the Braves have a better record, had first
shot at claiming Myers off the waiver wire. They were worried that
if they didn't claim him, Atlanta would. That could have been the
difference should the teams meet in the postseason.
The Buzz
</P>
<P>
   Tigers general manager Randy Smith offered closer Todd Jones and
center fielder Brian Hunter to the Braves for troubled outfielder
Andruw Jones and was turned down. ... Pat Gillick is expected to
step down as Orioles general manager at the end of the season and
manager Ray Miller is campaigning for assistant GM Kevin Malone to
get the job. But Reds general manager Jim Bowden is also being
mentioned as a possibility. ... Power pitchers still create the
most excitement. Boston loves Pedro Martinez, the Astros are
ecstatic about getting Randy Johnson and Cubs rookie Kerry Wood has
been a huge hit this season. But Greg Maddux, on his way to a fifth
Cy Young Award, remains the best pitcher in baseball...
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals are a troubled franchise. None of the
prospective owners has offered the minimum $75 million purchase
price. Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, who everybody was hoping would save
the franchise for Kansas City, has offered $52 million, with $25
million contingent upon improvements to Kauffman Stadium. ... The
Montreal Expos are encountering difficulty in getting a new
stadium. They sold fewer than 5,000 personal seat licenses in a
13-month period. They were hoping for 12,000 to 13,000. ...
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman and general manager Ed Lynch had
their contracts picked up for 1999. But when Lynch included two
former No. 1 draft picks, pitchers Jon Garland and Todd Noel, in
deals for relievers Felix Heredia and Matt Karchner, it was a sign
he knows he must win soon or else. ... The Reds are close to
signing manager Jack McKeon to a one-year contract extension,
believing he is the best man to oversee their youth movement. ...
</P>
<P>
   Indians outfielder Brian Giles was sidelined last week after
being bitten five times in the left leg by what is believed to be a
spider. ... The second longest active consecutive games played
streak ended when Astros manager Larry Dierker sat Craig Biggio on
Wednesday night. Biggio, who had played in 494 consecutive games,
said, ``I took a lot of pride in it. I'm not going to lie and say I
wasn't disappointed it came to an end.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez has lost 15 pound since coming
to America, saying he has had trouble acquiring an appetite for
American food. His brother, Livan, was the opposite when he
arrived. He scared the Florida Marlins when he binged on Burger
King food before learning what a salad is. ... Phillies pitcher
Curt Schilling struck out at least 10 batters in 10 of his first 16
starts, but just twice in his past nine. During that stretch he is
3-4 with a 4.97 ERA. ...
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays pitchers Tony Saunders and Bryan Rekar are the latest
to complain about Tropicana Field, which is a lousy facility. But
manager Larry Rothschild wasn't happy with the complaining, saying,
``If there are people who don't want to play here, all they have to
do is come in here and I'll give them their check and we'll get
them out of here. If they truly feel like they don't want to be
part of what we're trying to build here, then we'll do the best we
can to accommodate them.''

   To Willie Shaw, the Raiders' new defensive coordinator, Charles
Woodson, Eric Allen and Darrell Russell represent more than merely
the recent Heisman Trophy winner, a six-time Pro Bowl cornerback
and a future standout at defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   They represent ants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the ghetto,'' Shaw said to a reporter days before
the Raiders played the Cowboys in an exhibition game last night.
``And when I came home at night and turned on the light, the
roaches would scramble for cover. But the ants never stopped
marching. If you brushed them off the counter, they just climbed
back up and kept marching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I want, players that just keep coming at you. I
don't want roaches, looking for excuses and blaming others.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Raiders coach Jon Gruden appointed Shaw to clean up a
Raiders defense that was always running for cover in 1997. The
Raiders allowed more yards rushing and passing than any team in the
NFL. They were 28th in points allowed.
</P>
<P>
   If we continue with Shaw's crude example, the roaches are
leaving Oakland. Malcontent defensive lineman Chester McGlockton,
troubled cornerback Larry Brown and aging cornerback Terry McDaniel
were released after the season.
</P>
<P>
   In their stead is Woodson, expected to win a starting cornerback
job; Allen, who came by trade from the Saints and is expected to be
the other starting corner; and Russell, the No. 2 pick in the 1997
draft who coaches say can be a star at defensive tackle after
spending his rookie season out of place at defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of roaches in the league,'' Shaw said. ``We're
going to be the ants.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Raiders, in the AFC West this season,
Denver and Kansas City are the anteaters. Bring on the Browns The
Cleveland Browns franchise can begin stocking players in February
to prepare for the 1999 season. The club can sign at least 30
veteran players from other NFL rosters in what is being called an
access draft. They'll be given 14 selections in the regular 1999
draft, including the first pick in each round, and a second pick in
rounds two through seven after all teams with a 1998 regular-season
winning percentage of less than .500. They will also get the final
selection in round seven.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the team needs an owner. The league is reviewing
applications from several bidders. The price is expected to near $1
billion. And if we're talking money alone, the favorite to own the
team is Alfred Lerner, 65, chairman of MBNA Corp. credit card
company.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner, who has teamed with former 49ers general manager Carmen
Policy, has a net worth that has been estimated at $2.5 billion.
His first job was selling furniture that paid him $75 a week. He
was a minority partner with Art Modell in the former Browns
franchise, and the deal to move the team to Baltimore was made on
Lerner's private jet.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates to own the Browns are lawyer Larry Dolan,
67, whose ownership group includes entertainer Bill Cosby and
former Dolphins coach Don Shula; Cleveland Indians owner Richard
Jacobs, 73; Howard Milstein, 47, a New York real-estate developer
and part-owner of the New York Islanders whose partnership includes
Cowboys director of player development Calvin Hill and former
Browns wide receiver Paul Warfield; Thomas Murdough, 59, founder
and chairman of Cleveland-based toymaker Step 2 Co. who has asked
Michael Jordan to join his ownership group; and real-estate
developer Bart Wolstein, 71, who is backed by Hall of Fame running
back Jim Brown. Briefly The Tennessee Oilers announced recently
that they will change the team's name before the 1999 season. Club
owner Bud Adams will pick the name after a statewide advisory
council sorts through suggestions from fans statewide and after a
review by the NFL. ``The fans have shown us some tremendous
support,'' Adams said. ``They deserve this. We will have a new name
in 1999. It will truly be a Tennessee name.'' The name change will
mean a new logo and team colors. ... If you were not one of the 10
people in this region who checked out the Bengals-Giants preseason
game last night, you missed an oddity. They played the game at
Giants Stadium on grass. Real grass. The Giants and Jets will play
home games on the natural surface for the remainder of the
preseason schedule. The surface of Giants Stadium has been
artificial turf since it opened in 1976. Stadium officials one day
want to see whether the grass can withstand the rigors of a
Northeast winter. More than 6,000 plastic trays of grass weighing
1,100 pounds each were laid on the stadium's artificial surface.
The grass will be removed at the end of August in preparation for
the regular season.

DODGERS RALLY IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The back was intact, and so Raul Mondesi was back,
but as much as the Dodgers were thrilled with that fact, the
question remained: Could Mondy pick up the slack?
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi returned from a two-game absence Saturday and returned
the heart of the Dodgers lineup to full strength, but his presence
against the Pittsburgh Pirates was felt mainly on defense. The
offense came from Eric Young, whose one-out single in the bottom of
the ninth inning drove home the game-winning run in a
come-from-behind 2-1 victory before 45,187 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi went 1 for 4 with three strikeouts, was caught stealing
on the back end of a double-play and made a pair of aesthetic
catches in center field. But he also committed a costly throwing
error in the sixth inning that allowed the Pirates to take the 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that iffy lead would hold up for the win until the
ninth, when the Dodgers finally found their offense.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros led off with a single up the middle off starter Jon
Lieber. Pinch-hitter Trenidad Hubbard struck out against reliever
Jason Christiansen, and Adrian Belte followed with a one-out single
to shallow left field. Charles Johnson drove in the tying run with
a single to shallow right field off Christiansen (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates intentionally walked Roger Cedeno to load the bases,
and Young _ hitless until that point _ made them pay with a single
to shallow right center field off Mike Williams. The hit made a
winner of reliever Antonio Osuna (7-0).
</P>
<P>
   Cleared to play less than an hour before game time, Mondesi's
sore lower back held up for a pair of running, lunging catches. In
the fourth inning, Mondesi made a charging snag of Jose Guillen's
sinking liner into shallow center field, then doubled Kevin Young
off first base to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   He followed with a highlight-reel catch in the fifth, making a
sliding grab of Lieber's line drive into left-center field that
ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Mondesi contributed to the Dodgers' worst defensive display
of the evening, and it cost them.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 0-0 and no outs in the sixth inning, the
Pirates' Tony Womack walked, then stole second base. Catcher
Johnson's throw skipped into center field, and Womack, barely
hesitating, headed for third, testing Mondesi's cannon arm. But
Mondesi misfired, and the throw bounced past Beltre and into the
Dodgers dugout, sending Womack home.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers managed 11 hits despite the scoring struggles and
had scoring opportunities in the eighth inning. The eighth-inning
threat was ended by a spectacular play by Pirates left fielder Al
Martin. With two outs and Mark Grudzielanek on second base, Gary
Sheffield hit a 320-foot foul ball, but Martin made a flying,
Fosbury-flop catch in the first row of seats to end the inning and
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, the Dodgers got a quality start
from an unheralded pitcher, this time right-hander Dave Mlicki.
Mlicki _ like Friday's winner Brian Bohanon also a journeyman
acquired from the New York Mets in June _ pitched seven-plus
innings, allowing four hits and four walks and the error-aided
earned run. He threw 98 pitches, 57 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had their preferred heart of the order _ Mondesi,
Sheffield and Karros _ back together for the first time in four
days, following Mondesi's back problems and Sheffield's three-game
suspension for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But the trio went quietly against Lieber, going 2 for 12 as a
group. But Karros' lone hit was a big one, starting the
ninth-inning rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had runners at first and second with one out in the
third but failed to score. The fourth inning began with promise,
Mondesi leading off with a double, but Sheffield struck out behind
him, and Mondesi was gunned down by Jason Kendall on the steal
attempt for the double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates wasted a scoring opportunity in the third inning,
failing to bring home Aramis Ramirez from third base with one out.
Lieber grounded out, Tony Womack walked and Jason Kendall ended the
threat with a weak infield popup.

RANGERS DON'T FEAR BRACKET CREEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL and T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's luxury tax will not prevent the Rangers
from absorbing additional salary during the season's remaining
seven weeks, general manager Doug Melvin said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   President Tom Schieffer expects the Rangers' 1998 payroll _
which also includes signing bonuses, incentives attained and player
benefits _ to approach $65 million with the July acquisitions of
right-handers Todd Stottlemyre and Esteban Loaiza, third baseman
Todd Zeile and shortstop Royce Clayton. Those four additions
escalated the payroll approximately $2.78 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Rangers _ barring further additions _ expect to
avoid the luxury tax, assessed against the major leagues' five
highest payrolls. Avoiding the luxury tax, though, will not come
``at the expense of winning,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a level where you've got to be careful, though,'' he
said. ``It depends on the who the player is and what kind of impact
he would have.''
Trade upset Tatis
Fernando Tatis is trying to get over being traded by the Rangers
and adjusting to life with the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get mad about it,'' Tatis said. ``When I first
heard about the trade, I couldn't believe it. I was in shock. ... I
didn't want to get traded. I wanted to play in Texas. But you don't
know where you're going to be in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatis and pitcher Darren Oliver were traded to the Cardinals for
pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and shortstop Royce Clayton on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I feel a stranger here,'' Tatis said Friday night
after getting three hits in the Cardinals' 16-3 victory against the
Chicago Cubs. ``I still hope the Rangers win. I hope they make the
playoffs and win the World Series because that's what we were
looking forward to doing.''
Replacing Stevens
Matchups will dictate how manager Johnny Oates utilizes the at-bats
that usually would go to designated hitter Lee Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers placed Stevens (strain, right oblique muscle) on the
15-day disabled list yesterday and purchased the contract of
outfielder Warren Newson from Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The reserves _ outfielders Roberto Kelly, Mike Simms and Newson,
infielders Luis Alicea and Domingo Cedeno and catcher Bill Haselman
_ will share the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play everybody,'' Oates said. ``Everybody has
contributed, and this is a way to keep everyone sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who entered last night hitting .429 (3-for-7) with one
home run during his career against Boston right-hander Tim
Wakefield, started in right field. That allowed Oates to utilize
right fielder Juan Gonzalez as his designated hitter.
Searching for Angels
Right-hander Jeff Juden, whom Anaheim acquired Friday from
Milwaukee, will join the rotation, Angels manager Terry Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, though, whom Juden (7-11, 5.53) will
replace. The candidates include right-hander Steve Sparks, Omar
Olivares and Jason Dickson and left-hander Allen Watson.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, who received $20,000 and a player to be determined
for Juden, exposed the hard-throwing 6-foot-8 right-hander to
waivers because ``he just wasn't getting the job done,'' Brewers
manager Phil Garner said. Nevertheless, the New York Yankees also
claimed Juden.
Farm report
</P>
<P>
   Triple-A Oklahoma (Pacific Coast League): The RedHawks (61-53)
swept a double-header of seven-inning games from New Orleans on
Friday. Right-hander Terry Clark and left-hander Ricky Pickett
pitched complete games for the 4-1 and 4-0 victories, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Double-A Tulsa (Texas League): Left-hander Corey Lee (8-8, 4.87)
surrendered only three hits, but he allowed five runs and issued
six walks in 72/3 innings as the Drillers (62-57) lost to Arkansas,
5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Savannah (South Atlantic League): The Sand Gnats (58-62)
beat Columbus, 5-4, as second baseman Jason Romano went 3-for-4
with a run batted in and scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski (Appalachian League, rookie): The Rangers (19-29) beat
Princeton, 11-7. Center fielder Corey Wright went 3-for-5 with two
triples and two RBI and scored four times.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Coast (Gulf Coast League, rookie): The Rangers (24-19) beat
the Pirates, 16-2. Left fielder Cody Nowlin went 2-for-5 with four
RBI.

RED SOX BATTERS FIND RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Faced with the prospect of taking on Texas's
All-Star starting pitcher, Red Sox batters practically raced each
other to the plate in an 11-1 win over the Rangers Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Aaron Sele's name evokes something less than fear
from those who know him best.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Bragg led off against his former mate with a home run _
the first time this season a Red Sox hitter has opened a game by
going deep. An inning later, John Valentin hit a two-run homer, and
Sele was gone before the end of the fifth as the Red Sox won at The
Ballpark in Arlington for the first time in five tries this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg, Jimy Williams's choice to lead off with Darren Lewis
being given the night off, homered again in the eighth inning off
Rangers reliever Al Levine, capping the biggest offensive night of
his career. He went 4 for 6, scored four runs, and hit two home
runs in a game for the first time. Bragg singled in the second and
doubled in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg came to the plate in the ninth with a chance for a fifth
hit, but Rangers third baseman Todd Zeile made a diving stop and
threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already tough to live with,'' said Sox designated hitter
Mike Stanley. ``He told us he's not making enough money to do this
every night. I told him if he did do this every night, he would
make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   All in jest, of course, as the victory did wonders to raise the
level of levity in the Red Sox clubhouse. Stanley, Mo Vaughn, and
Nomar Garciaparra had three hits apiece as Boston broke loose for
18 hits after scoring just 10 runs in its last four games. The Sox
ended the AL West-leading Rangers' six-game winning streak and now
hold a 7 1/2-game lead over both Anaheim and Baltimore in the
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield, meanwhile, assured the Red Sox of returning home
with a winning record on this 14-day, 12-game trip, shutting out
the Rangers through five innings while his teammates built an 8-0
lead against Sele and Levine. The win gave Boston a 7-4 record on
the trip, with only Sunday night's game here left to be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a long road trip,'' said Wakefield, who despite
a game-time temperature of 94 degrees pitched eight innings,
allowing just seven hits and two walks. ``It's wearing on a lot of
guys, especially me. I'm looking forward to going back to Boston.
This was huge, especially this late in the year, that we've picked
up as many wins as we have on this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was Wakefield's eighth in his last 10 decisions and 14th
of the season, only two shy of his career best in 1995, when he
went 16-8. That puts him within talking distance, at least, of the
first 20-win season of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The last knuckleballer to win 20 in a season was Joe Niekro of
the Astros in 1980. Wilbur Wood of the White Sox, who won 20 or
more in four straight seasons (1971-74), is the last American
League knuckleballer to win 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be nice, but I'm not thinking about that right
now,'' Wakefield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's possible,'' said Stanley, assessing Wakefield's
chances at 20 wins. ``You talk to anybody around the league _ when
we were in Seattle I heard Jay Buhner say he was so glad he didn't
have to face him. He'd rather face Pedro Martinez. When he's going
this good, nobody wants to face him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sele, who opened the season 8-2 and was 12-5 when
selected to the All-Star team, has lost four of his last five
decisions, none of which have been pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg has been Sele's principal tormentor on the Red Sox. He's
batting .600 (6 for 10) against the righthander with three home
runs and two doubles. In his first at-bat Saturday night, he leaped
on a 2-and-0 fastball, driving it onto the putting green beyond the
center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen him pitch,'' said Bragg. ``We know what he's got.
When he makes his pitches, he's tough. But he fell behind me a
couple of times and threw me pitches to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   One out after Bragg's home run, Vaughn followed with the first
of his three singles and came around on singles by Troy O'Leary and
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin made it 4-0 in the second, following Bragg's single
with his 14th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Sele's night came to an abrupt end in the fifth, which opened
with singles by Vaughn and Garciaparra. Pitching coach Dick Bosman
paid a visit to the mound, but his advice obviously went unheeded
as Sele walked O'Leary on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who had three RBIs Saturday night in his best game
since being reacquired, greeted Levine with a two-run single that
made it 6-0, and Donnie Sadler's double brought home O'Leary with
the seventh run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I needed the ball down, the ball was up,'' Sele said.
``When I needed the ball in, the ball was out over the plate. This
was just a case of not making it very difficult for them to hit the
ball.''

CREW CRUSH REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Two Revolution rejects in Columbus Crew
uniforms contributed to New England's worst loss of the season
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stern John, a 21-year-old Trinidadian striker, scored twice and
Andy Williams, a 20-year-old Jamaican, sparked the midfield as the
Crew took a 6-1 victory before 13,712. Both failed Revolution
tryouts, John before the 1997 season and Williams in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have the worst record in Major League Soccer,
with 19 points in 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night they contributed to their downfall by failing to
build on their positive play in Wednesday's 3-0 victory over San
Jose. They failed to play through Colombian midfielder Oscar
Pareja, partly because of the small Ohio Stadium field, and also
because of their tendency to lose patience.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Crew solidified their third-place Eastern
Conference standing, improving to 30 points in 21 games. The
Revolution could not match the midfield magic of Williams, the
striking dynamics of John and US national team forward Brian
McBride, or the defensive organization of the Crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an old-fashioned spanking and because of our record,
it gets magnified,'' Revolution coach Thomas Rongen said. ``Every
team is a recipient of a spanking like this. We got our asses
kicked in all departments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will likely have to win in regulation time at
Tampa Bay Friday to remain in playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go forward,'' Rongen said. ``What else can you do?
I've seen games like this before because we become very
helter-skelter, and that havoc can lead to a lot of goals. We felt
good going into the game. We made two lineup changes, but that was
not the reason for what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were missing two starters from the San Jose game
_ Mike Burns (right hamstring) and Janusz Michallik (left foot
sprain) _ but the others who had keyed that victory were
ineffective. They might have had difficulty adjusting to the field,
but that does not explain the effectiveness of Williams, who was
making his home debut.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Farrell scored the first goal, curling a 30-yarder from
the left into the far upper corner as goalkeeper Ian Feuer held his
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's dribbling set up a corner kick by Robert Warzycha
that was headed in for a two-goal lead by John in the 32d minute.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes later, New England's Richard Goulooze and Dahir
Mohammed failed to connect on a clearance, and McBride headed in
another Warzycha corner for a 3-0 halftime edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had several chances but did not seem as dangerous
as the Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dooley headed in a short corner from Williams early in
the second half, and Rob Smith and John stretched the Columbus
advantage to 6-0 before Raul Diaz Arce scored his 16th goal of the
season in the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one area that surprised me was dead-ball situations,''
Rongen said. ``We had strength and players who are very good in the
air in the game. But they scored on corners, and that changed the
course of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Revolution can match the creativity of the Williamses
of the MLS, they are going to struggle. Williams, who played for
Jamaica in the World Cup after attending the University of Rhode
Island, performed with confidence and poise and constantly
frustrated the Revolution. Williams disoriented the Revolution with
quick touches and changes of direction, and his teammates
responded.

FAN REACTION TO JOHNSON IS ASTRO-NOMICAL
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With the great left-hander pitching, the Astrodome was
sold out. Hotel rooms were scarce. The city was abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   I remember it like yesterday. We were kids. My best friend's dad
had just driven four of us for six hours in a Plymouth Fury without
air conditioning. We trudged from ``No Vacancy'' sign to ``No
Vacancy'' sign for two hours, until we found a far-too-princely
room at the posh Shamrock Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   My friend's dad was still wincing as he came back to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, that June 22, 1966, night still represented
the largest regular-season crowd ever to witness a baseball game in
the Astrodome. The audience, we all knew, wasn't there so much to
see the still-expansion-pained Astros, but to view first-hand lefty
Sandy Koufax and the star-studded Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But so has been the journey of the starship Astros.
</P>
<P>
   For 36 years, they have been the other guys. It was their
siblings in the 1962 expansion, the New York Mets, who rose from
futility to snatch the Cinderella slipper before the Astros. It was
the Astros who were always headed to Virginia. It was the Astros
who lost Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   In June of this season, Astros players marveled at the nightly
crowds that flocked to see Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let me tell you the big difference tonight,'' first
baseman Jeff Bagwell said, as he stood at his locker before
Friday's game with the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, people are coming to watch one of our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-10, and armed with the wingspan of a left-handed
pterodactyl, Randy Johnson is a lot to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes before game time Friday, Johnson slowly walked to
the bullpen to begin his pregame warmups. Suddenly, bodies began to
rise from their seats and a crescendo of applause started to rain
down. Johnson was getting a standing ovation _ just for leaning
over, stretching.
</P>
<P>
   In the field-level seats, Carol Weatherly of Lake Charles, La.,
sat with her boyfriend and her 9-year-old son, Thomas. They had
driven from Louisiana that afternoon. They had trouble finding a
hotel room. They, too, were there to see a sensational left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas held a freshly printed Randy Johnson pennant and Carol
clutched a folded navy blue T-shirt with Johnson's lanky silhouette
and his nickname, ``The Big Unit,'' loudly splashed across the
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been Astros fans since the Jose Cruz and Terry Puhl
days,'' Weatherly said. ``We come once every year in June.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Weatherly and her boyfriend Jim heard on the radio that
Johnson was pitching Friday, they looked at one another and said,
``We have to go.'' She called the doctor's office where she works
and faked a sore throat and fever.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson Fever. Houston never felt so good.
</P>
<P>
   Even to the Astros players, his coming had seemed like a dream.
Outfielder Moises Alou went to bed early on the night of the
trading deadline, July 31, and didn't hear about the deal with
Seattle until he got on the team bus the next day in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Sure, right,' '' Alou recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Craig Biggio had given up the vigil and turned
the TV channel. The hotel alarm clock read 12:15, 15 minutes past
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up,'' Biggio said. ``Then somebody called me and said,
`Well, you've got Randy Johnson.' I said, `Get outta here!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was so staggering _ the players figured that Johnson
would be dealt to the Yankees or Indians _ that two days later in
Pittsburgh, they found it odd to believe that the stork-like No. 51
wearing an Astros uniform was actually one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the attention I'm getting is kind of embarrassing,''
Johnson confessed Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Astros fans were just as curious. The crowd to watch his
Astrodome debut Friday, 52,071, broke the record as the largest to
ever see a regular-season Astros home game. At 9 a.m., there were
fans standing in the rain outside the Astrodome, waiting to buy the
few remaining tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Astrodome vendors stocked 15,000 additional hot dogs in
anticipation of the big crowd. In the dome gift shop, racks of new
shirts hung waiting. For $190, you could get the official home
jersey, replete with Johnson's name and number. For those with a
more Marlinesque budget, there were eight new styles of Johnson
T-shirts. Three colors of caps. Souvenir picture baseballs. And the
pennants.
</P>
<P>
   There were peanuts but, curiously, no elephants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd call it a little bit of a circus atmosphere,'' Johnson
observed.
</P>
<P>
   After his route-going, five-hit, ovation-studded outing, Johnson
was quick to embrace a broader perspective. Though the reception as
he went to warm up made him ``feel like a rock star,'' Johnson
stressed later that his new team is not a one-man gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little overwhelmed by all the attention this has
gotten,'' he said, humbly. ``But whether I'm here or not, the fans
should be coming out and supporting this team, because this is a
championship-caliber team.''
</P>
<P>
   He had heard the stories about Houston attendance, too, it
seemed. The Astros have been the class of the National League
Central this season, but before Johnson arrived, they had performed
in front of a home crowd in excess of 40,000 only five times.
</P>
<P>
   Astros fans, Houstonians say, are waiting for the playoffs. Or
they are waiting for the year 2000, when the downtown,
retractable-roofed The Ballpark at Union Station will open its
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Bagwell. ``Fan support has been better
this year. You've got to win. But even if you're winning during the
regular season, don't automatically assume that they're going to
come out and watch you play.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, it has been suggested that Johnson was acquired
more as an Astrodome drawing card than anything.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson half-winced. ``If that was the case,'' he said, ``then
I'd almost feel like a freak show.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that he is the center of all this commotion seems to
unsettle Johnson. He says he's a quiet, shy guy _ ``People say I'm
a loner'' _ and doesn't like to call any attention to himself.
</P>
<P>
   But he tried to go out to dinner Thursday night in Houston and
soon found himself signing autographs. He also attempted to browse
The Galleria anonymously. For obvious reasons, that didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a haircut, so it couldn't have been the hair,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, his new teammates have welcomed him warmly. Since when
don't we all love a circus, Biggio suggested?
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a No. 1 horse here,'' Biggio said. ``Now we've got
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unique,'' said fellow pitcher Jose Lima. ``That's why
he's The Big Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting quietly at his locker after Friday's dominating shutout,
Johnson was gracious to his former team, the Seattle Mariners,
thanking the fans and praising the likes of Junior Griffey and
Edgar Martinez. But the talk about the contract, Johnson admitted,
had become a season-long distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like night and day,'' he said. ``Now I can focus.
Not that I wasn't trying to focus in Seattle, but there was a lot
going on. I feel bad for the fans and for my teammates back there,
because there was _ not a dark cloud _ but something hovering over
the team all year. Where is he going to go? Is he going to go?
</P>
<P>
   ``But that part is over now. I'm a Houston Astro. I'm proud of
putting this uniform on.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, like the Astros franchise, longs for the elusive. He
says the ultimate would be a World Series. No one Friday night
dared remind him that, for want of a fat contract, Johnson left
what was supposed to be a Series contender in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The night was too filled with history, too illuminated by
flashbulbs, to dwell on that. Johnson lingered for nearly an hour,
answering a handful of reporters' questions, taking care to say the
right things.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of history in this dome,'' the lefty said. ``You
feel pretty excited about pitching on the same mound where some of
the people I've looked up to have pitched _ people like J.R.
Richard and Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching out there tonight was very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The night had been a loud reminder of what the Astros had done.
They had pulled off the trade deadline's most technicolor coup.
</P>
<P>
   They are armed for the Braves, for the Padres, maybe even for
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe just for the circus.

FAN REACTION TO JOHNSON IS ASTRO-NOMICAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With the great left-hander pitching, the Astrodome was
sold out. Hotel rooms were scarce. The city was abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   I remember it like yesterday. We were kids. My best friend's dad
had just driven four of us for six hours in a Plymouth Fury without
air conditioning. We trudged from ``No Vacancy'' sign to ``No
Vacancy'' sign for two hours, until we found a far-too-princely
room at the posh Shamrock Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   My friend's dad was still wincing as he came back to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, that June 22, 1966, night still represented
the largest regular-season crowd ever to witness a baseball game in
the Astrodome. The audience, we all knew, wasn't there so much to
see the still-expansion-pained Astros, but to view first-hand lefty
Sandy Koufax and the star-studded Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But so has been the journey of the starship Astros.
</P>
<P>
   For 36 years, they have been the other guys. It was their
siblings in the 1962 expansion, the New York Mets, who rose from
futility to snatch the Cinderella slipper before the Astros. It was
the Astros who were always headed to Virginia. It was the Astros
who lost Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   In June of this season, Astros players marveled at the nightly
crowds that flocked to see Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>

Friday's game with the Philadelphia Phillies.

   At 6-foot-10, and armed with the wingspan of a left-handed
pterodactyl, Randy Johnson is a lot to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes before game time Friday, Johnson slowly walked to
the bullpen to begin his pregame warmups. Suddenly, bodies began to
rise from their seats and a crescendo of applause started to rain
down. Johnson was getting a standing ovation _ just for leaning
over, stretching.

CONNORS HURT; LECONTE, GOMEZ IN FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
 TOURNEY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ Jimmy Connors, the No. 1-ranked player on the
Nuveen Tour for players age 35 and older, dropped out of the Sprint
PCS tennis tournament at Babson College Saturday night, minutes
before he was to face No. 4 seed Andres Gomez in a semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy has plantar fasciitis,'' said Glen Hunt, the event's
trainer, describing the soft tissue inflammation of Connors's left
foot. Connors reported the injury Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Connors earns $12,500 for reaching the semifinals. The
tournament winner will get $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Vilas, who had lost to Connors in a quarterfinal
Thursday, was originally pegged as Connors's replacement, but tour
officials could not locate Vilas, so No. 3 seed Mansour Bahrami,
another quarterfinal loser, went against Gomez _ and lost before
1,782 fans, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez will go for the championship Sunday against Henri Leconte,
who defeated Johan Kriek, 7-5, 6-4, before 1,337 in the afternoon
session of the hardcourt tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Leconte, who turned 35 July 4 and was playing his first American
event on the Nuveen Tour, used a clever service-return game to
frustrate the serve-and-volley game of Kriek.
</P>
<P>
   The key to playing Kriek, according to Leconte, is to not simply
sock his serves back at him. ``He plays solid and has a nice
game,'' said the Frenchman, a 1988 French Open finalist who last
month won his first senior tournament, in Aland, Finland, with a
three-set win over Bjorn Borg. ``He loves to hit the ball, so you
have to mix it up. You have to spin, throw in a lot of slices, go
with the topspin, and you have to change the pace all the time. He
loves to win when you hit the ball hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Kriek was having problems with the serves themselves.
``If I had served better, I would have won,'' said Kriek, who
reached the Nuveen Masters Championship final last year. ``He was
ripping on my second serve. I served in spurts _ well for two or
three games and then I had a bad game. When you think too much
about your serve, there's no rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   The first set had five breaks, three by Leconte. ``We didn't
serve very well,'' Leconte said, ``with the balls flying towards
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The final break was in the 11th game. Leconte went ahead, 0-40,
and after he missed on a backhand return that floated wide, Kriek
double-faulted, making it 6-5. Leconte served for the set for the
second time, this time successfully.
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, Kriek surrendered another key break, in the
fifth game. Leconte took the game by belting a forehand into the
open court, prompting a forehand from Kriek that was long.
</P>
<P>
   That opened the door for Leconte to take the match in straight
sets, and he finished the job in the 10th game, belting a forehand
winner up the line and following it with a backhand volley winner.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Connors has had to drop out of a
Nuveen Tour event. In March, at the Masters Championship in Naples,
Fla., he dropped out because of upper respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Connors has won three Nuveen tournaments this season: the Trigon
Champions in Richmond, Va., the BTI Champions in Raleigh, N.C., and
The Challenge in Newport Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Connors cofounded the Nuveen Tour in August 1993 _ he sold his
ownership interest last year _ and has played since its inception.
He has won 30 senior events following a regular men's tour career
in which he captured 139 singles titles. At one point, he was
ranked No. 1 on the men's tour for 268 weeks. Last month, he was
inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Connors is expected to begin treatment immediately so that he
can compete in the Nuveen Tour's next event, the Citibank Champions
Aug. 11-16 in Purchase, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``My foot's not good,'' Connors said from his hotel room, ``and
hopefully in a couple of days it will give me a chance to play in
New York.''

DODGERS RALLY IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Raul Mondesi's return boosted the Dodgers' hopes
Saturday, but it was Eric Young's clutch hitting that lifted their
spirits when Mondesi and the rest of L.A's designated run producers
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers headed into the bottom of the ninth inning facing a
1-0 deficit and a potentially morale-crushing loss to the
Pittsburgh Pirates. But a better-late-than-never offense arrived at
Dodger Stadium around 10 p.m., with Young delivering a
game-winning, one-out RBI single to clinch a 2-1 victory before
what was left of a crowd of 45,187.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would have been hard to bounce back the next day.
That would have been a tough loss,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a potentially devastating loss turned into a positively
inspiring victory, as the Dodgers won their second straight to move
within four games of the Chicago Cubs in the National League
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose 1-0, it would have been a tough loss,'' said
Dodger starter Dave Mlicki. ``Anytime you can win in the bottom of
the ninth, it's a good feeling. Everybody leaves the park with a
good feeling, everybody's excited to come back (the next day).''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki felt pretty good despite failing to get a decision. The
right-hander pitched seven-plus strong innings, giving up four
hits, four walks and one earned run.
</P>
<P>
   He was matched pitch for pitch by Pirates right-hander Jon
Lieber, who saw his eight innings of solid work go to waste when
relievers Jason Christiansen (2-3) and Mike Williams surrendered
the clinching hits.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros led off the ninth with a single up the middle off
Lieber. With one out, Adrian Beltre singled off Christiansen, and
Charles Johnson drove in the tying run with a single to shallow
right field.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates intentionally walked Roger Cedeno to load the bases,
and Young _ hitless until that point _ made them pay with a single
to shallow right center off Williams, making a winner of Dodgers
reliever Antonio Osuna (7-0).
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't expect they would need a come-from-behind
victory when manager Glenn Hoffman put together the lineup card.
Mondesi, recovered from a sore back, returned from a two-game
absence and returned the heart of the Dodgers lineup to full
strength for the first time in four days.
</P>
<P>
   But 3-4-5 hitters Mondesi, Gary Sheffield and Karros managed
only two hits in 12 at-bats. Mondesi's presence was felt mainly on
defense, and not always for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi went 1 for 4 with three strikeouts, was caught stealing
on the back end of a double play and made a pair of aesthetic
catches in center field. But he also committed a costly throwing
error in the sixth inning that allowed the Pirates to take the 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the game locked in a scoreless tie and no outs in the sixth
inning, the Pirates' Tony Womack walked, then stole second. A
Johnson pickoff attempt skipped into center field, and Womack,
barely hesitating, headed for third, testing Mondesi's cannon arm.
But Mondesi misfired, and the throw bounced past Beltre and into
the Dodgers dugout, sending Womack home and providing a 1-0 lead
that nearly held up.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose that way,'' Mlicki said, ``would have been a tough
thing to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleared to play less than an hour before game time, Mondesi's
sore lower back survived a pair of running, lunging catches. In the
fourth inning, Mondesi made a charging snag of Jose Guillen's
sinking liner into shallow center field, then doubled Kevin Young
off first base to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi followed with a highlight-reel catch in the fifth,
making a sliding grab of Lieber's line drive into left-center field
to end that inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman admitted some trepidation, especially since it was
Mondesi, not the medical staff, who gave the back a passing grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking to see if he got up,'' Hoffman said of the two
catches.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers managed 11 hits despite the scoring struggles and
had a scoring opportunity snuffed in the eighth inning. With two
outs and Mark Grudzielanek on second base, Sheffield hit a 320-foot
foul ball, but left fielder Al Martin made a flying, Fosbury-flop
catch in the first row of seats to end the inning and the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also had a chance in the fourth inning, when Mondesi
led off with a double. But Sheffield struck out and Mondesi was
gunned down by Jason Kendall on the steal attempt. &QL;

 BAKU, Azerbaijan: Caspian region.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some American companies see Iran, one of five countries that
border the landlocked Caspian Sea, not only as a place for
exploration but also as an economic route for transporting energy
to Western markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has put considerable diplomatic effort
into promoting countries that were once part of the Soviet Union _
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan _ as new sources of energy
that bypass both Russia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, oil companies that have already started extracting
oil and gas from the Caspian are questioning the wisdom of an
administration-backed plan that would put oil in a lengthy and
expensive pipeline from Baku to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The administration likes this idea because it anchors Turkey, a
NATO ally, in the quest for oil and avoids Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing the growing disquiet about the proposed pipeline, an
American oil executive here said, ``We don't want to be stuck with
a white elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of the complexities of the questions, the
administration has appointed a coordinator for Caspian Sea issues.
He is Richard Morningstar, who has been director of American aid in
the countries of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil and Conoco have led the effort to persuade the
administration to be more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco has proposed that American companies be permitted to
invest the same amount as foreign companies _ $20 million each
annually.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Mobil sponsored advertisements in two newspapers asking
that U.S. companies be permitted to ``swap'' oil with Iran _
deliver Caspian crude for use in Iran's northern cities, then pick
up an equivalent volume at the country's southern port of Kharg
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements also suggested that the companies be allowed
to negotiate deals with Iran, with the understanding that these
would remain unconsummated until sanctions are lifted _ a precedent
established in Vietnam before the trade embargo there was abolished
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the advertisements asked for the repeal of a ban on the
use of Iranian equipment on the Caspian, a move that would free
American companies to participate with partners who use
Iranian-supplied equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders have been watching the progress of an
application for the swap waiver that Mobil made to the Treasury
Department in April, perceiving it as a bellwether of
administration policy.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat, the under secretary, said the application had not yet
been considered at the highest levels. But he said swaps were not a
``simple solution'' to the Caspian's transportation problems, and
asserted that they ``could create a dangerous dependency on Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States appears unlikely to budge much, oil
industry analysts said the pressure will continue to build.
</P>
<P>
   They cited a recent trip to Tehran by Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi, followed by a delegation of top European Union
leaders. Industry analysts expect more European leaders to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Both British Petroleum and Shell operate offices in Tehran.
Recently BP also sent crude oil samples from Azerbaijan to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco officials said they were not entirely pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that, in her overture to Iran, secretary Albright
spoke of the need for a ``road map'' to the development of
relations between the United States and Iran, the same language
that Conoco's Dunham employed in his earlier appeal to Clinton.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Aug. 1, 1998,
at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a
book.

   CASTRO _ CUBA-CASTRO _ MIAMI _ Summer is always the time for
feverish speculation about the health of aging Cuban President
Fidel Castro, who turns 72 on Aug. 13, and this summer is no
exception. Just a few weeks ago, a Cuban doctor-turned-defector
living in Costa Rica claimed that Castro suffers from a fatal brain
disorder. There was a barrage of similar ill-health rumors last
summer, some even announcing Castro's death. But, if anything,
Castro appears more robust than ever. He appears to be traveling
more these days than at any time in his 39 years in power. He
continues his commitment to communism, even as he's been striking a
conciliatory tone towards President Clinton. (Emling, Cox News
Service).

   POVERTY- WASHINGTON _ Poverty in the United States may be more
of a trap door than a revolving door, with Americans falling into
poverty for months at a time during any year, only to pull out
again at a later point, according to a new report from the U.S.
Bureau of the Census. (Shepard, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   GA-RUNOFF _ ATLANTA _ What's the expected voter turnout for
Tuesday's primary election runoffs? Only 22 percent of registered
voters cast ballots on July 21. With the governor's race all but
decided, will two hotly-contested runoffs for lieutenant governor
generate much interest? Any hot metro county races?( Atlanta

   &UR; TRAIL FEVER: SPIN DOCTORS, RENTED STRANGERS, AND THUMB
WRESTLERS ON THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Michael Lewis. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting on the 1996 presidential campaign, the author
details the nearly farcical demands of politics in the television
age and discovers more wisdom and bravery among those at the bottom
of the political food chain than at the top. The result is
``deeper, funnier and more edifying'' than the usual insider
account of life on the hustings, Phil Gailey said in the Book
Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REALITY AND DREAMS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Muriel Spark. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A hopelessly spoiled film director is tempted to play God, with
ruinous results _ not for him but for his extended ``family.'' Dame
Muriel Spark, through the voice of her all-knowing narrator, is
``as relentlessly observant of human habits and unguarded moments
as she has ever been,'' Penelope Fitzgerald wrote here last year.
An earlier novel,  &UR; THE GIRLS OF SLENDER MEANS &LR;  (New Directions,
$10.95), follows the escapades of a varied group of young women
living at a ladies' hostel in London after the Allied victory in
Europe. In 1963 our reviewer, Virgilia Peterson, praised the
author's ``absolute pitch in dialogue, her economy of style and her
sedulous avoidance of sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEWS OF A KIDNAPPING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Gabriel Garca Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Translated by Edith Grossman. Penguin, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 Nobel laureate in literature chronicles the brazen
series of crimes committed by Pablo Escobar's Colombian cocaine
cartel as it sought to undermine efforts to extradite Escobar and
his fellow drug lords to the United States. Last year our reviewer,
Robert Stone, said the author had ``a quick eye for the
illuminating detail and a capacity for assembling fact.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TUMBLE HOME: A NOVELLA AND SHORT STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Amy Hempel. Scribner, $10.
</P>
<P>
   This slender collection features minimalist stories about
parenthood, death and breakups, written as if assembled from
fragments of conversation. ``Hempel writes with an effortless wit
... showing us the larger shapes of our lives by capturing their
most fleeting and fragmentary moments,'' Elizabeth Gleick wrote
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: A PEOPLE'S HISTORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Howard Zinn. Harper Perennial, $15.
</P>
<P>
   In this abridged version of ``A People's History of the United
States'' (1980), which has been updated into the Clinton years, a
scholar takes sides with the losers, the downtrodden and the
underdogs, arguing that too much history is written from the point
of view of governments and elites. In his review of the original,
Eric Foner found the approach to be limited, but said ``Zinn writes
with an enthusiasm rarely encountered in the leaden prose of
academic history.'' The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE AMERICAN
CENTURY: VARIETIES OF CULTURE IN MODERN TIMES &LR; , by Norman F. Cantor
($16), a sprawling guided tour of the century that was first
published in 1988 and has also been revised and updated. In
managing to cram in just about every notable trend, event and
discipline, this is an ``opinionated, idiosyncratic and thoroughly
entertaining'' survey, Hal Goodman said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CARSON VALLEY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Barich. Vintage Contemporaries, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Set against the shifting economic landscape of the wine country
of northern California, this love story centers on a troubled young
woman who returns from New York and has an affair with the manager
of her father's vineyard. In 1997 our reviewer, Linda Gray Sexton,
admired the author's ``easy grace'' and ``elegant sleight of
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LADY WHO LIKED CLEAN REST ROOMS: THE CHRONICLE OF ONE OF
THE STRANGEST STORIES EVER TO BE RUMOURED ABOUT AROUND NEW YORK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By J.P. Donleavy. St. Martin's Griffin, $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn Guenevere Marchantiere Jones, a fresh-mouthed
43-year-old Scarsdale matron and Daughter of the Confederacy, finds
herself slipping down the social ladder after her husband deserts
her for a bit of ``fresh flesh.'' Her travails make for a ``rich,
ribald and touching creation,'' Nina Sonenberg wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOEL COWARD: A BIOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Philip Hoare. University of Chicago, $18.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on both careful research and gossip, the author
maintains that the public image of Noel Coward as a languid
hedonist was a fiction _ the actor, playwright, songwriter and
world-class wit was driven by an intense passion for fame. ``One of
the many merits of ... Hoare's book is to remind us of the man's
self-discipline, his rigorous professionalism and his courage,''
Miranda Seymour wrote here in 1996.  &UR; IN GHOST OF A CHANCE: A
MEMOIR &LR; , by Peter Duchin with Charles Michener (Random House,
$16.95), the last society bandleader tells the bizarre story of how
he was left by his father, the bandleader Eddy Duchin, to be raised
under the privileged wing of Averell Harriman. In 1996 our
reviewer, George W.S. Trow, called this a ``brave and stylish''
book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CALCUTTA CHROMOSOME: A NOVEL OF FEVERS, DELIRIUM &AMP;
DISCOVERY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Amitav Ghosh. Bard/Avon, $6.99.
</P>
<P>
   This mazelike thriller about weird science projects and global
mind control begins when a computer programmer in 21st-century
Manhattan stumbles onto the damaged ID card of a former colleague
who disappeared in Calcutta in 1995. Last year our reviewer, James
Saynor, called this ``a finely carved mystery.''

   NAPALM-DISPOSAL (Deer Park, Texas) _ Four months ago, after
local residents and politicians screamed bloody murder, a train
carrying 22,000 gallons of napalm en route to an Indiana disposal
facility was abruptly halted and turned back to California, where
it had been moldering since the end of the Vietnam War. In July,
another toxic waste company inherited the napalm disposal contract.
But this time the company, GNI Group, is situated along Houston's
heavily industrialized Ship Channel, one of the globe's largest and
densest concentrations of petro-chemical facilities. The result was
that very same shipment of napalm eased its way into Texas three
weeks ago with only the briefest flurry of complaint.

   MARKET-SMALLSTOCKS (Undated) _ While the larger, well-known
stocks of companies like Coca-Cola and Philip Morris have been
battered for much of the last month, the stocks of smaller
companies have suffered much more. The Dow Jones industrial
average, a large-stock gauge, fell about 9 percent from its high in
mid-July, while the Russell 2000 index of small stocks fell nearly
20 percent from its high in April. A study by Salomon Smith Barney
showed that the vast majority of small issues, with market values
of less than $250 million, had fallen 45 percent on average from
their peak through Aug. 4. The mounting evidence has prompted some
Wall Street analysts to talk about a darker side of the bull market
and even to suggest that a bear market is in the offing. By David
Barboza.

   NAPALM-DISPOSAL (Deer Park, Texas) _ Four months ago, after
local residents and politicians screamed bloody murder, a train
carrying 22,000 gallons of napalm en route to an Indiana disposal
facility was abruptly halted and turned back to California, where
it had been moldering since the end of the Vietnam War. In July,
another toxic waste company inherited the napalm disposal contract.
But this time the company, GNI Group, is situated along Houston's
heavily industrialized Ship Channel, one of the globe's largest and
densest concentrations of petro-chemical facilities. The result was
that very same shipment of napalm eased its way into Texas three
weeks ago with only the briefest flurry of complaint.

WAR MOVIES: THE HORROR AND HONOR OF A GOOD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Restoring the nation's heroic image of itself probably wasn't
what Steven Spielberg had in mind when he was preparing and
directing ``Saving Private Ryan.'' It's more likely that he simply
wanted to make an accurate, entertaining movie about a war the
country could be proud of. The film was to be a tribute to the
courage and sacrifices of those American soldiers who, along with
(mostly unacknowledged) Allied forces, swarmed up the beaches of
Normandy on June 6, 1944, to begin the final phase of World War II
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The completed movie is all Spielberg could have hoped it would
be, and more. Once again he has made a connection to the American
public of almost messianic proportions. Among other things, he
seems also to have fulfilled a national longing that maybe even he
wasn't aware of: to wipe clean the collective American conscience
after the trauma of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing he has even revived a type of patriotic war movie
you might think went out of fashion for all time with ``Heartbreak
Ridge.'' That was Clint Eastwood's gloriously foolish attempt to
celebrate the 1983 American landings on the sleepy little island of
Grenada as the equivalent to the invasion of Iwo Jima.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, war movies for every occasion: gung-ho
movies designed to keep the home front united behind the fighting
men, peacetime war movies that are all rousing action and
adventure, and the occasional pageantlike spectacles, exemplified
by ``The Longest Day,'' that re-create the war as a huge,
impersonal diorama, populated by Hollywood A- and B-list actors
representing historical personages and the little guys who are
history's pawns. The rarity: the maverick movie that shows the
waste of war (``All Quiet on the Western Front,'' from 1930, and
``Paths of Glory,'' 1957).
</P>
<P>
   As melancholy and as skeptical as those two films are, neither
comes close to dramatizing the dubiousness of war as it's seen in
the best of the Vietnam movies, but they have something going for
them that no other American war movies ever had: They are about a
war that was lost even before it got going, that was waged in
behalf of a cause never made comprehensible and that promised a
victory impossible to achieve. The war itself was a bestial
metaphor for all wars, even those that are won.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Saving Private Ryan,'' war is good again.
</P>
<P>
   Gone as if by absolution are the nightmare memories of our
involvement in Southeast Asia. So, too, apparently, are the
memories of four haunting, shame-inducing films made about that
war: Oliver Stone's ``Platoon'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
Stanley Kubrick's ``Full Metal Jacket'' and Brian De Palma's
``Casualties of War,'' the only profoundly angry antiwar films ever
produced within the American filmmaking establishment.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an accident that none of these films was made until
the second half of the 1980s. By that time, Vietnam was behind us,
and one could recognize the idiocies of that war without feeling
guilt that one might be betraying the troops. They were
exceptionally good films, respectfully received, but maybe more
important, they also served as a kind of public penance. (Try as
John Wayne did with his 1968 cry from the heart, ``The Green
Berets,'' not even he could persuade Americans to swallow the idea
that Vietnam was the last chance to stop a communist assault on
Southern California.)
</P>
<P>
   How war movies are accepted by the public reflects the times in
which they're released. ``The Green Berets'' flopped because
audiences in 1968 were more into flowers than defoliation. Even
``Heartbreak Ridge'' was something of a disappointment considering
the enormous popularity of its star. But that was in 1986, in the
high-flying, luxe-loving Reagan era. If audiences at that time had
any image in their minds of Grenada, it was of a pretty little
Caribbean island where you might once have headed if you couldn't
get reservations on Mustique.
</P>
<P>
   The box-office success of ``Saving Private Ryan'' sends out
mixed signals, and mixed signals are the order of our day. The
first hour tells us that war is insupportable, while the remaining
two remind us of our moment of glory.
</P>
<P>
   Most people _ certainly those of us who were in World War II _
go along with the idea that in particular circumstances war can be
a reasonable, even moral response. What's astonishing about
``Saving Private Ryan'' is the unqualified praise that has greeted
a film that, with adjustments, could have been made 50-odd years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   True, the dialogue is realistic in a way that no World War II
audience would have tolerated. It's also true that, near the
beginning, there's an extended battle sequence of such merciless
detail and intensity that it would have been judged un-American
while any war was being fought.
</P>
<P>
   After that, for all of its blood and guts, ``Saving Private
Ryan'' depends increasingly on the sorts of comforting narrative
formulas that have made war movies such an enduring genre. The
ending is a second elaborately staged battle sequence, but one very
different from the first. A small, poorly equipped American unit
defends a strategic bridge against a much larger, far better
equipped German force. Though the mood is desperate, the manner
realistic and the body count high, the conclusion is a
soul-satisfying triumph, almost miraculous in the way of something
in a fantasy war film like ``The Guns of Navarone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' even suggests _ without irony, if
obliquely _ that Mom and apple pie were what Americans were
fighting and dying for.
</P>
<P>
   The mission at the center of the film: the assignment of eight
soldiers, still stunned that they survived the carnage of Omaha
Beach, to find and remove from harm's way one Pvt. James Ryan,
whose three brothers have been killed in action.
</P>
<P>
   Ordering the mission is no less than the Army's kindly, sober
chief of staff, Gen. George C. Marshall. On the first or second day
after the general helped to start the biggest, riskiest military
operation in the history of the Western world, his Washington
office is as serene as that of the dean of a small New England
college on a midsummer afternoon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Marshall gives his aides their instructions, it's clear
that he has been browsing through his Bartlett's, as may be his
wont. He sends the aides off after quoting the letter Abe Lincoln
wrote to Mrs. Bixby, a mother who lost five sons in the Civil War:
``I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which
should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like that, which can't be mocked, load the scene with
secondhand feeling. Yet Lincoln's letter could be another,
subliminal reason why ``Saving Private Ryan'' is being found so
irresistible. Here we have evidence that the world's most powerful
country has a heart. The nation is being run not by scalawags and
rascals, the kind Henry Adams wrote about in his still-pertinent
1880 novel ``Democracy,'' but by towering father figures, men firm
of purpose, measured in their conduct, who grieve as we grieve.
</P>
<P>
   We're back watching the kind of movie Hollywood turned out with
a patriotic vengeance after Pearl Harbor. Among such films: ``The
Sullivans'' (1944), about the five brothers from Waterloo, Iowa,
who were lost when their light cruiser, the Juneau, was sunk. ``The
Sullivans'' is not an overt war movie. There are no big battle
sequences. Instead, it concentrates on five prototypical small-town
boys and how they grow up in Small Town, USA, eventually to give
their lives for their country.
</P>
<P>
   The gallantry of the Sullivan family is one of the inspirations
for ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Indeed, Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks), the
officer who leads the mission to find the young man, is initially
sarcastic about his objective, which he sees as a time-wasting
public-relations gesture when there's a war to be fought. But,
being a good officer, he follows orders. As it turns out, he
continues to fight the war nobly even while carrying out the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   To call ``Saving Private Ryan'' antiwar is wishful thinking.
After all, it recalls the good war. No matter how graphic World War
II movies are, they inevitably celebrate war by softening through
sanctification the pain and suffering of those fighting the war. No
bridge is too far, no sacrifice too extreme for these fighting men.
</P>

   The difficulty is that movies glorify whatever they focus on.
It's the curse of their Midas touch. Movies can replicate the
surfaces of things, sometimes, like ``Saving Private Ryan,'' with
astonishing verisimilitude. Yet, without the doomy context of what
we know about, say, the Vietnam War, they don't often capture the
smell, taste, feel, boredom and sense of utter, no-way-to-get-out
desolation.
</P>
<P>
   Some World War II novelists succeeded in doing this by climbing
inside individual characters and isolating their experiences: I
think of Norman Mailer (``The Naked and the Dead'') and James Jones
(``The Thin Red Line''). But reading is a private matter, far more
personal than the communal activity of watching movies. Good
writers take you down dark corridors of the mind no cameras can
penetrate. When you read, you travel solo, carrying only your
secret luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 30-minute battle montage that helps to open ``Saving
Private Ryan'' is a singular piece of filmmaking: a magnificently
photographed and edited sequence that initially looks as if it had
been composed of documentary clips, shot by perhaps a dozen or so
anonymous cameramen at Omaha Beach on D-Day, but only now liberated
from the censors.
</P>
<P>
   Each split-second image is seen as if out of the corner of the
camera's eye. Bullets, bodies, panic, confusion. A face looks
startled one moment and is dead the next. Through the chaos of
bewildered soldiers and beached equipment, a man in mid-distance
lurches across the sand, carrying his severed arm. The din is
unimaginable, its Gotterdammerung effect augmented by the digital
sound, which separates every skull-blasting thud, whine, crack,
whoosh and boom.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way Omaha Beach must have looked and sounded. So it
goes for five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes and on.
</P>
<P>
   But then you, too, begin to suffer your own kind of shell shock.
You are, after all, watching a movie. You can see the red exit sign
at the side of the screen. You smell the aroma of the simulated
butter on the popcorn being wolfed down by the person next to you.
You become conscious of the editing, of the technology of the aural
effects, of the fact that the gruesome images aren't much different
in degree from those featured in commonplace, R-rated slasher films
made for teen-agers. There are just more of them, packed more
closely, and, unlike those in slasher movies, you're supposed to
believe them.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a way to escape the emotional effects of what you
have been experiencing. It doesn't necessarily diminish the art of
it. Not until you have seen the rest of the film do you realize
that nothing that comes after this montage is really worthy of the
aspirations of the people who put the sequence together. ``Saving
Private Ryan'' is otherwise a gung-ho movie wrapped in reassuring
truisms.
</P>
<P>
   It restores our self-image, but does it have anything to do with
our values, with the content of our lives as we live them today?
Not much. It shows us as we might like to be. Meanwhile we sit in a
gaudy meeting house where desires are instantly gratified, and
death has no consequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is a shrewdly, sometimes boldly
conceived entertainment film, but it's no more antiwar than the
dear old ``Sullivans.'' It's anti-getting shot, maimed,
dismembered, disemboweled, blown up and killed.
</P>
<P>
   In an imperfect world, that seems to be the most we can hope
for.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, when the World Wide Web had no commerce to speak of, a
group of computer and credit card-processing experts banded
together and formed a company built around high-security technology
for safely transferring money on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The product failed to find a market. Yet, four years later, the
company, Cybercash, has survived by adapting to the less
sophisticated but far more flexible security technology that was
eventually embraced throughout the Web. And though it is still in
the red, Cybercash has managed to take its stock public and to grow
by merging with a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Cybercash offers a vivid example of how difficult
it can be for any company to steer proprietary standards into the
unpredictable currents of the Internet _ even when the technology
in question is widely acknowledged to offer a superior product. It
is also a lesson in survival.
</P>
<P>
   That survival has exacted a price. When it became clear that
revenue for the second quarter, which ended on June 30, would be
lower than expected, the company, which is based in Reston, Va.,
laid off 20 percent of its staff, including one founder who
volunteered to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining group of about 200 has sharpened its focus on
areas that already produce revenue. It has moved development of
more ambitious technologies for the next century to the back
burner.
</P>
<P>
   Cybercash's original product was a ``digital wallet,'' a piece
of software intended for home computers, with the idea of keeping
bank accounts and credit card numbers handy and secure. No one
would need to enter a credit card number to buy something because
the wallet would keep it encrypted.
</P>
<P>
   To further reduce fraud, the wallet would hide credit card
information even from merchants, making the system in some ways
more secure than standard retail transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But users shunned the product and gravitated toward a simpler,
nonproprietary alternative known as Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, a
straightforward system intended to scramble all data passing
between a customer and a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   SSL did not provide any of the digital wallet's sophisticated
features for electronic commerce, but it did offer adequate
security for most transactions. What is more, it was flexible
enough to encrypt everything, including entire Web pages that held
sensitive data.
</P>
<P>
   In a nimble move, Cybercash modified its back-office processing
software for merchants to handle orders generated by SSL. Although
the company did not generate the revenue it had hoped to make with
the wallet concept, it did grab a piece of the action for handling
transactions between online merchants and their banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very nice service,'' said Michael Salim, president of
American Data, a North Carolina company that rents Web space to
retailers and resells Cybercash's processing services to his
customers. ``It really makes the use of credit cards easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Salim said, Cybercash's original wallet, which
denominated deposits on hand as virtual coins, ``operated with some
funny money; no one liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Loftus, a senior vice president of Cybercash, said the
company was trying to build on that sort of response. But she said
that instead of abandoning the wallet concept, the company would
alter the wallet's design and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, it was a container for electronic cash,'' Ms.
Loftus said. ``Going forward, we're going to concentrate on making
the buying experience easy, consistent and secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The new wallet, she said, would be more tightly integrated with
the browser and would not require the customer to spend any extra
time to install it.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Condon, Cybercash's chief operating officer, said one
important lesson in the company's evolution had been that the
consumer generally was not greatly concerned about security because
the banks and the merchants pay losses incurred in fraud or theft.
The consumer, he said, was primarily interested in convenience and
in saving time.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants and credit card companies, on the other hand, are
eager to reduce fraud. In an SSL-based system, a user can type any
credit card number, including a stolen one. In such cases, it is
the merchant, not the credit card company, that sustains the loss.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Cybercash will introduce a new generation of
its wallet later this month. Designed to the greatest degree
possible to be transparent to the consumer, it will also
incorporate the new Secure Electronic Transaction standard, or SET,
that is being pushed by the credit card industry.
</P>
<P>
   All the sophistication is aimed at reducing credit card fraud by
distributing electronic identification files known as certificates,
which act like driver's licenses or passports. The certificates
allow computers to generate digital signatures that the credit card
companies hope will weed out the most common types of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, introducing any new standard is filled with danger. In
this case, the most serious challenge will be finding ways to
distribute the certificate files to everyone's home computer. So,
while the next version of Cybercash's wallet product will be
engineered to use certificates, Condon said, the feature will not
be built in.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the company is investing money and resources in
the back-office software that generates most of its revenue. On
April 30, Cybercash completed a merger with a onetime competitor,
IC Verify, a company built on credit card services for
brick-and-mortar merchants. IC Verify had recently begun expanding
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Goldberg, a former IC Verify executive who is now a
Cybercash vice president, said that the goal of the companies'
merged operations was to provide merchants with a single tool for
transaction processing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Today, she said, many traditional merchants are opening Web
sites, and she expects that in the future, Web-only retailers like
Amazon.com might open stores, in much the same way that J. Crew
migrated from catalogs to shopping centers. The merged version of
Cybercash is aiming to unify its product line to dominate both
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also expanding its solutions for making it easier
to pay recurring bills on time. The costs for companies to mail
credit card, phone and utility bills each month is substantial, and
Cybercash intends to provide a simple, one-step tool that will
allow customers to go to a Web site, examine their bills and then
authorize payments.
</P>
<P>
   One of Cybercash's strongest assets is its perceived leadership
in these kinds of secure transaction technologies. Michael
Schneider, a vice president at IMC On-Line, an Atlanta-based
company that rents Web space, said the availability of Cybercash
was often crucial in persuading businesses to choose his service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love the idea of the technology,'' he said, ``and they
get all caught up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch: Most merchants, he said, discovered that
their sites did not generate enough business to justify the cost.
``For four or five transactions, having a separate statement, it
just wasn't worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schneider predicted that more businesses would eventually
adopt the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchants are scared about the transactions coming in and
knowing whether they're bogus or not,'' he said. ``They're scared
about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Cybercash, it is fear of the unknown that drives
sales of security technologies.

   NAPALM-DISPOSAL (Deer Park, Texas) _ Four months ago, after
local residents and politicians screamed bloody murder, a train
carrying 22,000 gallons of napalm en route to an Indiana disposal
facility was abruptly halted and turned back to California, where
it had been moldering since the end of the Vietnam War. In July,
another toxic waste company inherited the napalm disposal contract.
But this time the company, GNI Group, is situated along Houston's
heavily industrialized Ship Channel, one of the globe's largest and
densest concentrations of petro-chemical facilities. The result was
that very same shipment of napalm eased its way into Texas three
weeks ago with only the briefest flurry of complaint.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few would call Dick Snyder humble _ except, perhaps,
the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Richard Snyder who, before his unceremonious
ouster in 1994, long held sway over Simon &AMP; Schuster, where he was
noted not only for publishing prestigious authors like Bob Woodward
and Mary Higgins Clark but also for reigning with a certain
imperiousness. The last two years, however, have found Snyder
struggling to make a career comeback in a part of the book world
better known for Kmart racks and $1.99 classics like ``The Poky
Little Puppy'' and ``The Saggy Baggy Elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great sense of humility,'' Snyder, 65, said of his
efforts to turn around Golden Books Family Entertainment Inc., the
largest publisher of children's books in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong brand identity of its little volumes with
their signature gold-foil spines, an integral part of American
childhood since the 1940s, Golden Books has also been hampered for
years by distribution and sales problems. And the company's already
lowly financial state has only further deteriorated since an
investor group led by Snyder acquired Golden Books in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was far more difficult than my experience had led me to
believe,'' he said last week. ``But some things take a little
longer to straighten out.''
</P>
<P>
   But new-found humility, or even a company with an increasingly
negative net worth and a stock price that has plummeted 80.4
percent since he became chairman and chief executive, has not
prevented Snyder from renegotiating a rich compensation package _
one that makes him one of the most highly paid executives in the
book world, with perks that include a chauffeur. Only the chiefs of
two far larger _ and profitable _ book companies, Barnes &AMP; Noble
and McGraw-Hill, are better paid than Snyder, according to a 1997
survey by Publisher's Weekly, the trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the financial pressure to reduce the company's payroll
to 1,000 from 1,600 deter Snyder from bringing in highly paid
executives with scant experience in the company's mass-market
business. Moreover, in the face of layoffs, it irritated some
employees that he hired a corporate chef when the company moved to
its commodious headquarters on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, after
its lease on Third Avenue expired last fall. Although Snyder
dismissed the chef in January while imposing a partial salary
freeze, the episode left a bad taste in many mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Other flourishes that have rankled some employees include
Snyder's hiring of his wife, Laura Yorke, as an editor-at-large and
using the corporate jet for vacations _ even if, as Snyder hastens
to point out, his wife was a seasoned Simon &AMP; Schuster editor and
he reimburses the company for any personal travel.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if Snyder, whatever the circumstances of the
book company, is intent on re-creating the prestige of mighty Simon
&AMP; Schuster, which he had built into an industry power before Viacom
Inc. pushed him out after acquiring it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's management of Golden Books ``is the 20th-century
version of an Emperor Nero act _ fiddling while Rome burns,'' said
Graef Crystal, who publishes a newsletter on executive
compensation. ``He came to a little tiny company and brought an
imperial style that is not appropriate for the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances grew gloomier last week when Golden Books
reported a second-quarter loss that brought total losses for the
first six months of the year to $51.2 million _ more than double
the deficit in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Books has been using cash at the rate of about $20
million a quarter and has only $16 million left on its balance
sheet, with the ability to tap $35 million more from lenders.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing losses, meanwhile, have wiped out shareholder
equity, which has dropped to a negative net worth of $112.7 million
_ meaning that the value of Golden Books' assets might be
insufficient to cover obligations to creditors if the company were
to go out of business. So unhappy are investors that Golden Books
said last week that it had hired the investment bank Allen &AMP; Co. to
explore a possible sale or merger.
</P>
<P>
   How different the prospects seemed in May 1996 when Snyder _ in
a partnership with Warburg Pincus Ventures LP and the media mogul
Barry Diller _paid $65 million to acquire the 37 percent
controlling stake of Golden Books from its former chairman, Richard
Bernstein, who remains a shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder came to Golden Books with ambitious plans to make over
the ``handyman's fixer-upper,'' as he described it, in part by
giving it the gloss and glamour of a trade publisher _ the kind,
like Simon &AMP; Schuster, that sells higher-quality books at steeper
prices than mass-market publishers like Golden Books can command at
Kmart or Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in his starkly modern office with its panoramic
views of Central Park, Snyder said last week that when he arrived
at Golden Books he did not realize the depth of its problems.
Relations were tense with crucial discount store chains because the
company's distribution and tracking systems had grown so antiquated
that it could successfully fill orders only about half the time.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he conceded, he was not schooled in the high-volume,
low-margin world of mass-market children's publishing, a business
that views books not as literary properties but as low-margin
consumer products. Upstart rivals like Landoll's Inc. were gaining
market share by keeping prices so low that Golden Books could not
raise its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to learn a totally new craft, and I think many of us
did,'' Snyder said. ``I think that caused the turnaround to be
delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder said he thought then, and still does, that the brand
awareness of Golden Books set it apart from the competition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In initial efforts to revive the company, Snyder spent
aggressively. His competitors were stunned, for example, when he
paid $47.5 million last year for a new five-year license with Walt
Disney Co., on whose characters and films Golden Books has been
basing books since 1932. Not only was the price more than any
company had previously paid for a licensing deal, but it came as
the popularity of Disney's children films like ``Pocahontas'' was
falling short of previous hits.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder defended the arrangement, saying the company has
never lost money on a Disney deal.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has also been criticized for bringing in top executives
at salaries two to three times the average in the children's book
industry, which he said was necessary to attract talented employees
from more stable companies _ even if they had no experience in
Golden Books' end of the market. From Simon &AMP; Schuster, for
example, he hired Willa Perlman, head of the children's division,
to become his children's publisher at a base salary that grew to
$400,000 plus bonus and options.
</P>
<P>
   He also hired Robert Asahina, a respected Simon &AMP; Schuster
editor, to head a new adult imprint that specializes in family and
motherhood topics. Asahina was given a base salary of $200,000 and
the potential for an unusually high annual bonus of 200 percent of
his salary.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the adult imprint has stumbled. In one case, the
author Judith Resnick was paid $750,000 for a financial advice book
for women titled ``I've Been Rich and I've Been Poor and Rich is
Better.'' But because of distribution delays, the book was not yet
in the stores when Ms. Resnick went on tour, and Snyder now
describes the entire deal as ``a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of Snyder's problems discouraged the Golden Books
board, which voted last September _ with the company's stock
already down 21 percent since his arrival and heading further south
_ to double his salary, to $937,885.
</P>
<P>
   Among other provisions in the pay raise, Snyder also received a
$500,000 signing bonus for agreeing to extend a five-year contract
to seven years. This, on top of an earlier guarantee of a pension
of $250,000 a year, payable even if he was dismissed. And Snyder
had also received a generous stock option plan upon joining the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a low-risk, high-reward pay contract,'' Crystal said.
``For the board to renew his contract on the basis of abysmal
performance, it is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder characterized criticism of his compensation as petty,
saying his pay was commensurate with the challenge facing him. ``My
compensation is a matter of public record,'' he said. ``You can
look it up and it is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   H. Brian Thompson, vice chairman of Qwest Communications
International, who is member of the Golden Books compensation
committee, defended the pay package by saying Snyder ``had
performed stunningly to take a difficult situation and get things
under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Snyder's pay package in the proxy statement, the
compensation panel said he had ``recruited an outstanding new
senior management team.'' But, in effect, Snyder has been rewarded
for revamping a management structure that he himself had fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, more than 30 executives and managers have been
laid off or left the company _ many of them people Snyder had
hired, including Ms. Perlman. They have been replaced by a new core
of executives with a very different view of its segment of the book
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with product that is sold for under $1.50;
that's not literature,'' said Eric Ellenbogen, the new president of
Golden Books.
</P>
<P>
   Ellenbogen, previously chief executive at Broadway Video, which
Golden Books acquired in 1996, also takes a practical view of the
adult imprint. Asked whether publishing trade books was a
distraction, Ellenbogen replied: ``We're looking at all our
options. Nothing is sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, meanwhile, says his company's losses are not a
reflection of high salaries or overhead costs. ``The lack of the
success of this company is due strictly to the lack of sales,'' he
said, predicting that they would begin to improve in the second
half of the year. Under Ellenbogen's supervision, he said, the
company is filling orders much more efficiently, with a fulfillment
rate approaching 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even if sales improve, one person close to the company said,
Golden Books' financial situation is now so badly deteriorated that
the only real solution might be a merger with another, more viable
publisher. ``The cost side can only come down so much,'' this
person said. ``We will never have that much volume.''

   CASTRO _ CUBA-CASTRO _ MIAMI _ Summer is always the time for
feverish speculation about the health of aging Cuban President
Fidel Castro, who turns 72 on Aug. 13, and this summer is no
exception. Just a few weeks ago, a Cuban doctor-turned-defector
living in Costa Rica claimed that Castro suffers from a fatal brain
disorder. There was a barrage of similar ill-health rumors last
summer, some even announcing Castro's death. But, if anything,
Castro appears more robust than ever. He appears to be traveling
more these days than at any time in his 39 years in power. He
continues his commitment to communism, even as he's been striking a
conciliatory tone towards President Clinton. (Emling, Cox News

 &HT;    Bulldogs are underdog threat in SEC
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The four-year contract extension Jackie Sherrill received at
Mississippi State last year was a surprise to some throughout the
SEC ranks. After all, the Bulldogs played themselves into position
to win the SEC West with late consecutive road wins at Auburn and
Alabama, but then fell to inferior opponents Arkansas and Ole Miss,
playing themselves out of a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   In seven seasons in Starkville, Sherrill has a 41-37-2 record,
including a mediocre 24-30-1 mark in the SEC. But in reality, last
season may have been Sherrill's best coaching job at Mississippi
State, considering the tragic drowning death of star running back
Keffer McGee shortly before preseason camp started a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the death and a rash of injuries to several starters,
Sherrill rallied his squad to a 7-4 record. That's the main reason
the Bulldogs enter this season as a darkhorse in the SEC West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be our best team at Mississippi State,'' Sherrill
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs will be led by arguably the SEC's most underrated
player in senior tailback James Johnson. Johnson, a former
junior-college star who was thrust into the starting role last
season by the death of McGee, became just the fourth back in school
history to rush for more than 1,000 yards. In 11 games, he rushed
for 1,069 yards and 12 touchdowns on 217 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in, Coach Sherrill was telling me, 'Well, you know
we've got Keffer McGee,''' Johnson said. ``Obviously, I didn't
expect to make that kind of an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson figures to play an even more prominent role this season,
following the departure of tailback Robert Isaac, who started eight
games last year. Johnson, who started just four games as a junior,
weighed as much as 238 pounds last season. But he started a diet in
the offseason and worked with a State track coach to improve his
speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of his mind, he thought he had to get big to play
in the SEC,'' Sherrill said. ``Now, he's down to 228 pounds and
only has four-percent body fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson should benefit from one of the league's largest
offensive lines. All-SEC candidate Eric Allen returns at center,
along with senior Anthony Kapp at right tackle and seniors Craig
Moore and Randy Thomas of East Point at guards. Promising sophomore
Floyd ``Pork Chop'' Womack takes over at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the most athletic offensive line we've had,''
Sherrill said. ``We'll still be very big and strong, but this
offensive line can run.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill is hoping returning quarterback Matt Wyatt also will
run more. Wyatt was the SEC's worst-rated quarterback last season,
completing just 45 percent of his passes with only six touchdowns
and 15 interceptions. Sherrill hired former State quarterback John
Bond as a graduate assistant in the offseason to help with the
quarterbacks' mobility. Wyatt could be pushed by redshirt freshman
Wayne Madkin and true freshman Brandon Butler in two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback has to be a better player,'' Sherrill said.
``I called Matt in before spring practice and told him it's his job
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Bulldogs lost their top three playmakers from
last season _ end Greg Favors of Atlanta, safety Eric Brown and
cornerback Izell McGill of Rex. State used a 4-2-5 alignment last
season, but coordinator Joe Lee Dunn has switched to a more
conventional 5-2-4 this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers Barrin Simpson and Jamaal Dinkins and JUCO defensive
linemen Darius Brown and Alvin McKinley will be counted on heavily.

`SUMMER OF DELIVERANCE': SPIRIT OF SELF-DESTRUCTION BEHIND
BARE-CHESTED VERSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review. 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two ways to read the title of Christopher Dickey's
racking yet compelling new book, ``Summer of Deliverance,'' a
memoir of the author's cyclonic relations with his father, the poet
James Dickey. In one sense, the title refers to the father's
best-selling novel, ``Deliverance,'' and the summer of 1971, when
the book was made into an almost equally successful movie.
</P>
<P>
   This was the high point of James' life, his son writes. He was
writing the kind of poetry he had always striven for, with a
``fast, athletic, imaginative and muscular vigor that I want to
identify as my particular kind of writing.'' He was a star on the
reading circuit, commanding fees high enough to keep his family
comfortable and to collect the books, watches, guitars, bows,
arrows, knives, canoes, typewriters, cameras, televisions and
sextants (``Are we lost?'' the author's son asked) that were his
obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   Life magazine had recently declared Dickey ``a god,'' his son
reports, ``this `athlete, pilot, ad man and fresh, emerging
literary voice.''' He had distilled into ``Deliverance'' the
essence of his macho fantasy of the wilderness, in which men
confronted nature in the hope of overcoming it, if only to dream
more peacefully. And now he would capture those dreams in what he
saw as his film.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the summer of ``Deliverance'' was a low point for
the author. He was bitterly angry at his father for what he saw as
a withdrawal of love from both himself and his mother, who was
turning to drink for comfort. He also felt that his father was
betraying himself, by giving up his dream of being a first-rate
poet and by accepting a second-rate version of himself dependent on
adulation and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the author was struggling to break free of his
father, to do something worthwhile on his own terms, not just as
the son of his father. Yet he could not resist the lure of watching
the movie of ``Deliverance'' being made, even though his role was
to serve as a stand-in for positioning the actors, most
disturbingly for Ned Beatty as his character is about to be raped.
</P>
<P>
   The other possible meaning of the title is the summer of 1996, a
half-year before James Dickey's death in Jan. 19, 1997 (two weeks
shy of his 74th birthday), when his son returned to Columbia, S.C.,
from his job as a foreign correspondent for Newsweek magazine to
help his father in his decline. By this time the author's
premonitions of 27 years earlier had been realized with a
terrifying vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey had succumbed so completely to alcoholism that his health
was severely impaired. His wife had died of drink at the age of 50.
He was remarried, to a former student, Deborah Dodson, who after
bearing him the daughter he had always wanted had turned out to be
a drug addict filled with such murderous rage that Dickey told his
son he feared for his life.
</P>
<P>
   The author had eventually intervened by persuading Deborah to
move out, by arranging for her daughter to attend boarding school
and by nudging his father toward sobriety. Now, in the summer of
1996, he was keeping his father company in his lonely and broken
old age, and at last getting some response to the love he had for
so long hopelessly given.
</P>
<P>
   One reads Dickey's account of all this with pity and fear: pity
for the suffering visited on a family that had been given so much
in the way of talent and success; fear of the destructive forces
Dickey unleashed in his quest for an ecstatic vision. Yet, oddly,
the book offers incomplete catharsis.
</P>
<P>
   The author's emotions are too much a tangle of resentment,
yearning, jealousy, competitiveness and pride. He reports that he
has spent his adult life fighting to be free of his father, a
struggle that in part explains why he became a foreign
correspondent traveling so far away from home. Yet in the act of
writing ``Summer of Deliverance,'' he becomes once again a
stand-in, once again the mirror of his father that he fears he was
trained to be. As a result, one doesn't take entirely seriously the
ending of the book, in which father and son appear to be united
again, recalling the good times of the past and declaring their
love for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dickey has done a remarkable job of picking his way
through a minefield of emotions, knitting together a dangerous
present and a painful past. His father often comes to life here in
sharply etched anecdotes. We see how he grasped fear and daring and
built out of them a myth that he was almost, but not quite, able to
enact.
</P>
<P>
   In a transcript of a tape recording made near the end of James
Dickey's life, the author quotes his weary father speaking to his
students about the poet's vocation. ``I don't mean to sell the poet
so long or at such great length, but I do this principally because
the world doesn't esteem the poet very much. They don't understand
where we are coming from. They don't understand the use for us.
They don't understand if there is any use. They don't really value
us very much. We are the masters of the superior secret, not they.
Not they. Remember that when you write.''
</P>
<P>
   In this wrenching memoir of his father and himself, Dickey tells
us both the use of a poet and where he was coming from. As his
father wrote in ``The Owl King,'' written in the 1950s:
</P>
<P>
   ``The breath falls out of my voice,
</P>
<P>
   And yet the singing keeps on,
</P>
<P>
   The owls are dancing, fastened by their toes
</P>
<P>
   Upon the pines. Come, son, and find me here,
</P>
<P>
   In love with the sound of my voice.''

carrying 22,000 gallons of napalm en route to an Indiana disposal
facility was abruptly halted and turned back to California, where
it had been moldering since the end of the Vietnam War. In July,
another toxic waste company inherited the napalm disposal contract.
But this time the company, GNI Group, is situated along Houston's

it had been moldering since the end of the Vietnam War. In July,

CONTENTIOUS LAWMAKERS APPROVE ARAFAT'S CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian lawmakers voted Sunday to approve a new
cabinet appointed by Yasser Arafat, but only after two days of
vocal debate in which a loud minority criticized what they called
his disdain for the Legislature's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-28 vote brought a tense conclusion to a long dispute
between Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and the Palestinian
Legislative Council, whose members had urged him for more than a
year to make far-reaching changes in order to combat corruption and
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat instead announced last Wednesday that he had decided to
keep his cabinet, or executive council, virtually intact, and it
was that decision that won endorsement Sunday. But the episode has
ignited an unusually public airing of dissent by Palestinian
lawmakers at what many regard as Arafat's high-handed style and his
inattention to his government's flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of Arafat's cabinet, including Hanan Ashrawi, a
prominent international figure, have resigned over his cabinet
action. And as it became clear that Arafat would nevertheless win
the day, one critic, Hassan Khadr, a member of his Fatah
organization, nearly set off a brawl at a legislative council
meeting this weekend. Khadr proposed sarcastically that lawmakers
might just as well go one step further and declare the Palestinian
leader ``God of the Palestinian people forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a parliamentary probe last summer found evidence of
widespread graft and waste within the Palestinian Authority,
lawmakers had been pressing Arafat to dismiss ministers suspected
of corruption. But none of those ministers were dismissed as part
of the changes he announced, whose main effect was to add 10 new
members to what had been an 18-member cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the new members were chosen from the Legislature,
where they continue to hold seats and where their votes helped
Arafat to win a clear majority Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's critics have called the cabinet expansion a transparent
attempt to co-opt his critics. But some of the newly appointed
ministers contend that it reflects Arafat's recognition of the need
for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opposed all of the mistakes of the executive authority, and
now we will struggle to correct the way,'' said Saadi al-Krunz, the
new industry minister, who had served on a parliamentary committee
that compiled a report on high-level corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat did not attend the session.
</P>
<P>
   Those who called on lawmakers to reject the new government
included Mrs. Ashrawi, who served as spokeswoman for the
Palestinians during the 1991 Middle East peace conference in Madrid
and who had been minister of higher education since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled for a long time to get the voters' confidence,
and for the Palestinian Authority to respect the Legislative
Council, and now we should respect ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Khadr, the Fatah member who ridiculed Arafat during Saturday's
debate, told reporters after Sunday's vote: ``This is a very
dramatic end to a great political institution. I feel very let
down.''

   CLIMATE-DISEASE (Undated) _ Scientists have long theorized that
climatic changes related to global warming could unleash new
outbreaks of diseases like malaria, dengue fever, cholera and heat
stroke. But with the modest amount of warming experienced so far,
they have been unable to produce much hard evidence. But in the
belief that 1997 and 1998 may provide a taste of what is to come,
those who pay attention to the health effects of climate are now
pulling together data about weather-related illness and death in
recent months. While most of the evidence is circumstantial,
consisting of correlations and coincidences, it suggests that amid
all the scientific smoke there is some fire to be concerned about.

   INDIAN-MUSEUM (Mashantucket, Conn.) _ A new museum, opening

Connecticut's largest individual source of revenue, allows the
Pequots to live like sheiks, with tribal housing and free college

   MARKET-SMALLSTOCKS (Undated) _ While the larger, well-known

companies have suffered much more. The Dow Jones industrial
average, a large-stock gauge, fell about 9 percent from its high in
mid-July, while the Russell 2000 index of small stocks fell nearly
20 percent from its high in April. A study by Salomon Smith Barney
showed that the vast majority of small issues, with market values
of less than $250 million, had fallen 45 percent on average from
their peak through Aug. 4. The mounting evidence has prompted some
Wall Street analysts to talk about a darker side of the bull market
and even to suggest that a bear market is in the offing. By David
Barboza. With graphic and photo.

IN WASHINGTON, MEMORABILIA OF WARTIME RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By MELISSA McNAMARA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of Hitler's uniforms and the Soviet flag that
flew over the Reichstag after the fall of Berlin are among some 500
World War II artifacts on display for the first time in the United
States in a new exhibition at the Ronald Reagan Center for
International Trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``World War II Through Russian Eyes'' includes photographs,
documentary film footage, battlefield maps and personal mementos of
those Russians who fought and died during the war. The exhibition,
which is free, is the result of a collaboration between Kermit
Weeks, president of the Historical Artifacts Museum near Orlando,
Fla., and Col. Alexander Nikonov, director of Moscow's Central
Armed Forces Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Also being shown in this country for the first time are three
Soviet documentaries made between 1941 and 1945. ``The Great
Patriotic War,'' an eight-part series directed by Roman Karme;
``The Battle for Berlin,'' a two-part series; and ``The Siege of
Leningrad'' will run continuously during the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege of Leningrad,'' directed by Alex Temin, includes
rare scenes of the composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who was nicknamed
the ``Fireman of Leningrad,'' conducting his Symphony No. 7 before
a malnourished, frostbitten audience in that beleaguered city.
These films were widely shown in the Soviet Union during the war,
but have been kept in the Moscow museum since then. Many of the
cinematographers involved died in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors enter the exhibition, designed by Alexander Okun,
through a 50-foot ``tunnel of history'' in which paintings and
photographs, along with replicas of Leningrad street signs and
soldiers' bunkers, recreate the atmosphere of the war years.
</P>
<P>
   Original game pieces that Russian soldiers carved from wood to
entertain themselves and even a handmade marionette of Hitler, used
to entertain Soviet troops, are also on display. Mark Talisman,
director of the exhibition, said the artifacts provide Americans
with ``new insight into the depth of the war and the way in which
it touched every Russian family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With this exhibit,'' he added, ``history has come full
circle.'' Talisman said the show would go to New York after it
closes here on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Nikonov said some artifacts, like the swastika flag that
belonged to Hitler's personal guard unit, have not left Moscow
since the war. ``Americans and Russians were partners during World
War II,'' he said, ``and now, more than 50 years later, we are
partners once again in exhibiting and viewing this history.''

 &HT;    Brazilians visit the South to get in touch with their past
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dead bodies sprawl everywhere. Puffs of white smoke
belch from countless rifles. Men and young boys are bent over in
agony, and scores _ perhaps hundreds _ are aiming guns straight at
Jose Padoveze, 17, and his twin brother, Joao.
</P>
<P>
   So they immediately do what any right-thinking kid would in the
midst of such a swirling, chaotic, horrific battle. They hit the
dust, writhing and howling _ in hysterical laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The boys and three other young Brazilians, all descendants of
unrepentant Confederates who left the Union-occupied South after
the Civil War, are visiting the Atlanta Cyclorama, a diorama of the
Battle of Atlanta that includes a huge round painting fronted with
128 small statues of soldiers in blue and gray.
</P>
<P>
   But though they engage for a few minutes in a little spontaneous
play, the youths didn't visit the Cyclorama, or come to America, on
a lark. They came to learn about their Southern roots. And because
of who they are, they're allowed to tread where few live men ever
do _ on the dusty floor of the majestic display.
</P>
<P>
   Their four-week trip takes them to many real battlefields, from
Chickamauga in North Georgia to Gettysburg, Pa. And also to Robert
E. Lee's crypt at Washington &AMP; Lee University in Lexington, Va.,
and to Stonewall Jackson's grave there. To still pristine rebel
fortifications at Kennesaw Mountain, just north of Atlanta. To
Jefferson Davis' digs in the White House of the Confederacy in
Richmond. To shopping malls, the Hard Rock Cafe and Six Flags.
</P>
<P>
   And it ends with a bang, literally, a trip to the Civil War
museum at the Atlanta History Center, where outside, dozens of
re-enactors fire ancient guns and lecture on soldiering. Before
returning to Brazil, they also attended an Atlanta Braves baseball
game and had a private audience with former President Jimmy Carter,
whose wife Rosalynn's great uncle, W.S. Wise, is buried in the
teens' hometown of Americana, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   As the twins and the two other boys, Ricardo Silva and Raphael
Romi, both 16, play war and play dead at the Cyclorama, lying among
some of the plaster statues, Anna Lee Carr de Muzio, 19, a
second-year law student, surveys the pseudo-carnage, her lips
trembling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe our ancestors, they were here,'' she says
in Portuguese-accented English. ``It must have been terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys seem moved, too, not just to horseplay but by history.
They came to learn about the Civil War's grim realities, but they
still had a ball on their event-crammed trip, ``despite so much
riding,'' Silva says.
</P>
<P>
   That's echoed by Dan Coleman, 53, a financial planner from
Smyrna, Ga. and official of the Georgia division of the Sons of
Confederate Veterans. He kept a couple of the kids in his home and
drove them in a van all over Georgia, northern Virginia, Maryland
and Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the Cyclorama officials who treated them like
royalty. Everyone did, Coleman says, when they found out the youths
are descendants of the 40,000 people who fled the shattered
Confederacy in the largest exodus ever from a country famous for
immigration, not migration.
</P>
<P>
   Most went to Brazil, and by the turn of the century _ 35 years
after Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House _ many had
returned. But others stayed and intermarried, and, it's estimated,
150,000 Brazilians today could claim Rebel kin.
</P>
<P>
   Many have lost touch with their antecedents, but this group of
kids is different. They're among an estimated 1,000 Brazilians who
call themselves Confederados and who can even name the Rebel
soldiers from whom they are descended. Anna and all four boys were
reared on Deep South traditions and tales passed down from
ancestors who ``fought the damn Yankees,'' Romi says with a laugh.
They're descendants of about 2,000 former Southerners who founded a
town they named Vila Americana _ American Town _ where it's no
coincidence that lots of people, like Anna, still have ``Lee'' in
their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very proud of our American roots, our Confederate
heritage,'' says Anna, whose grandmother's first language was
English, though she was born in Brazil. Even Anna's father _ whose
great-granddad, Pvt. Albert G. Carr of the 56th Alabama Partisan
Rangers, fought in the battles of Peachtree Creek and Atlanta _
speaks almost flawless English.
</P>
<P>
   Their city was founded in 1868, a few years after Georgia
planter William Norris, a retired Mexican War colonel whose four
sons fought for the Confederacy, led the migration to what is now
Americana, a city of 160,000 about 80 miles northwest of Sao Paulo.
The city holds Confederate festivals four to six times a year near
Campo Cemetery, where many of the original Southern settlers and
their descendants are buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate and remember where we came from,'' says Anna.
</P>
<P>
   At the festivals, women wear antebellum-style ball gowns, males
don gray uniforms, and thousands come from around Brazil to watch
bowing gentlemen and curtsying belles doing the Virginia reel in a
cleared area in the middle of thousands of acres of sugar cane.
Fried chicken and grits are popular at the gatherings, though the
Confederados, like most Brazilians, prefer Brazilian fare.
</P>
<P>
   Though the festivals are popular, like ethnic heritage
celebrations in Atlanta, many parents of the kids of Anna's
generation worry that their Southern roots will be forgotten. And
that's why Anna's father, Daniel Carr de Muzio, came up with the
idea to send youths to America every summer, starting this year. He
broached the idea during a business trip to Florida after meeting
Darryl Brock, an agricultural scientist in Valdosta and
self-described Hispanic member of the Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Brock contacted Coleman and Allen Trapp Jr., a 45-year-old
Carrollton, Ga. lawyer and commander of the Georgia Sons. Coleman
and Trapp flew to Brazil last November to set up the trip, which
the Sons sponsored and arranged. The kids' parents and host
families around Atlanta paid most of the expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They learned and saw an awful lot,'' Coleman says. ``They
learned to eat a lot of fast food, and they wanted to stop at every
Wendy's between here and Gettysburg. They sang. They tried to play
baseball. And they took part, wearing wool uniforms and sleeping on
the ground in tents, in the biggest Civil War re-enactment ever,
with about 38,000 other people in the July heat refighting the
Battle of Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the trip was fun, it was also emotionally wrenching, Anna
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was a little child I went to the Campo Cemetery in our
meetings and festivals,'' she says. ``It was all wonderful. But I
had special feelings when I was in Gettysburg. There I could see
how it is, sleeping in tents, no bath. We saw the re-enactment. It
was like if I was seeing my ancestors fighting, a really emotion
moment. Another emotion moment was in the laser show in Stone
Mountain. When I listened to Elvis Presley singing `Dixie,' my eyes
were wet and I cried for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Twins Jose and Joao say the trip made them understand why it's
important to remember their Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian kids had a harder time trying to understand racial
attitudes in America, however. In Brazil, long known for racial
tolerance and intermarriage, everything is different, says Ricardo,
who notes that within a couple of generations, Confederados were
marrying whomever they fell in love with, including Indians,
blacks, Arabs, Italians and Germans.
</P>
<P>
   The twins' father, Jose Antonio Padoveze, says he wanted his
sons to learn more about ``the spirit of our cousins. Their duty
now is to give to the other teenagers a few of these spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are at least 1,000 people in Americana who're aware
of their Southern roots, only about 350 are members of the
Fraternidade Descendencia Americana (Fraternity of American
Descendants). Even fewer are members of the Sons' Brazilian
division, headed by Daniel de Muzio. That's why he feared the
younger generation might forget, even though Americana's Southern
heritage is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Most Confederates who went there were lured by Emperor Dom Pedro
II, who opened recruiting offices as far north as New York and
offered subsidized passage and land with rich, red soil like
Georgia's for 22 cents an acre. He was intent on making Brazil a
major player in world agriculture, and his investment paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Americana has the highest per capita income and
educational levels of any city in Brazil, in part because those who
went set up schools, stressed education and imported preachers and
newfangled steel plows, not to mention baseball, watermelons,
pecans, sewing machines, fried chicken, peaches and pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   They also established their own burial ground, Campo Cemetery,
where a 25-foot granite obelisk, emblazoned with a Confederate
flag, lists names from Ayees to Yancee. About 400 tombstones carry
English epitaphs, including some defiant ones, like ``Once a rebel,
twice a rebel, forever a rebel.'' And Americana's city crest
incorporates the Confederate battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   Still, kids like Anna and her friends consider themselves
Brazilians, not Confederate-Brazilians, and are more curious than
obsessed about the Confederacy, says American historian Eugene
Harter, a former U.S. diplomat descended from Confederados who
returned to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, they have solved the race problem,'' he says. ``But
in Americana, though there are no race problems, it is still
different in a tiny way from the rest of Brazil. The people are
still paler. They married among themselves for three generations
and spoke only English before starting to mix with others. Now race
isn't an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids, before going back home, made that point clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about Gettysburg, what it was like,'' Anna says of the
re-enactment. ``When the battle is over, the Yankees and
Confederates shake hands. In Brazil, we all shake hands. There is
no difference.''

 &HT;    Hospitals testing various security options
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Modern technology enables doctors to detect a baby's
sex within weeks of conception, save the life of high-risk newborns
and perform other feats for infants that would have been unheard of
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What it can't do is guarantee that parents take their baby home
from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Baby switching and snatching rarely occur. But hospital
officials admit that no technology exists to eliminate the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent publicized switch, at the University of Virginia
Medical Center, attests to that.
</P>
<P>
   There have been four baby switches and seven abductions in
hospitals since 1995, when the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations in Chicago began tracking them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to commit a criminal act, he or she will find
a way to do it,'' said Dr. Henry Schaeffer, chairman of the
American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Hospital Care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't conceive of a system that's going to be foolproof
unless you literally handcuff the baby to the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have, however, adopted ways to protect babies.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta lets mothers and babies room
together at all times. The hospital doesn't have a nursery. ``It's
just to make sure that those types of things don't happen to the
babies,'' said Rashel Stephenson, a Crawford Long spokeswoman.
``It's absolutely impossible for someone to get out of the unit
with the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Many facilities use identification bracelets that are
pre-stamped with numbers to reduce the possibility of tampering.
Two bands are placed on the baby and one on the mother. If the
bands are cut or torn apart, they cannot be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make sure Mama sees the banding done,'' said Patsy
Hammonds, clinical coordinator of Piedmont Hospital's newborn
nursery in Atlanta. ``The bracelets are checked on every visit to
Mama's room. If that baby and Mama don't match, the baby comes back
to the nursery.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, many metro hospitals have installed
another protective device to safeguard newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Baby LoJack'' after a car anti-theft system, the
device is similar to one used for merchandise in retail stores.
Alarms sound and elevators stop working when a baby is taken to a
restricted area.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Northside Hospital, which delivered 13,000 babies in
1997, has increased the number of closed-circuit cameras around
rooms with mothers or babies. It also requires those with access to
delivery areas to carry special cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can use the nursery is to provide an access
card, and that provides an audit trail of who's coming into the
nursery,'' said John McDonald, Northside's security director.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledges there is no 100 percent guarantee the system
would prevent a staff person from switching babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's difficult. Anytime you're an insider, you have
information that other people don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best safeguard against swapping, advises Schaeffer,
is to look for identifying marks on the baby immediately after
delivery, such as a dimple or birthmark.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Schaeffer said correctly identifying a baby could be
tricky, especially after a long, hard labor. ``If I brought you a
baby two hours later I'm not sure you would necessarily know if
there were no real distinguishing characteristics.''

   NAPALM-DISPOSAL (Deer Park, Texas) _ Four months ago, after
local residents and politicians screamed bloody murder, a train
carrying 22,000 gallons of napalm en route to an Indiana disposal
facility was abruptly halted and turned back to California, where
it had been moldering since the end of the Vietnam War. In July,
another toxic waste company inherited the napalm disposal contract.
But this time the company, GNI Group, is situated along Houston's
heavily industrialized Ship Channel, one of the globe's largest and
densest concentrations of petro-chemical facilities. The result was
that very same shipment of napalm eased its way into Texas three
weeks ago with only the briefest flurry of complaint.

   MOSCOW _ Take the highway out of Moscow toward Ukraine and about
a dozen miles outside the city you will find Aras Gusyonov, a
mechanic from Azerbaijan, crouched by a 6-foot-square metal pen,
specially built to hold 15 tons of watermelons.
</P>
<P>
   By his reckoning, those 15 tons will be sold in as many days _ a
brisk turnover compared with that of Nina Yegorova, 37, a factory
worker with a degree in economics, who sits a few hundred feet away
hawking the two tons of watermelons she and her husband brought in
a van from a vacation in southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, about a dozen watermelon vendors set up their
stands _ sometimes pens twice the size of Gusyonov's, packed
shoulder-high with great green globes _ along a 10-mile stretch of
the same highway, peddling the bumper crop of watermelons flooding
in to Moscow from all corners of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Nature has much to do with the glut. A heat wave in southern
Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Azerbaijan helped produce a
particularly rich harvest early this summer. But Moscow's crowded
watermelon market also owes something to the kind of hit-or-miss
farm-to-market trading that makes capitalism, Russian-style, a
unique experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good business,'' Mrs. Yegorova said with a sigh,
her arms and shoulders browned from days spent on the roadside,
reading a book. ``There are too many competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijani fruit and vegetable traders like Gusyonov have long
had a near-lock on the lucrative Moscow market. This year's glut
has opened up space to newcomers like Mrs. Yegorova, who thought
they had found a good way to earn extra money.
</P>
<P>
   But after two trips down to the Astrakhan region of southern
Russia, where they bought watermelons for one ruble a kilogram (or
8 cents a pound), and several weeks sitting by the highway selling
them for the going price of two rubles a kilogram (17 cents a
pound), all Mrs. Yegorova had to show for her initiative was the
equivalent of a month-and-a-half's salary _ 3,000 rubles, or $500 _
at a nearby aviation factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you consider the gas, the time, and the weariness, it isn't
worth it,'' she said. Next year, she'll stick to selling the
potatoes grown in the backyard of her family dacha, or country
house.
</P>
<P>
   Roadside vendors, particularly non-Russians, are easy prey for
bands of young toughs, or even local policemen who swoop by in
their cars, collect armfuls of watermelons and drive off in a cloud
of dust. Gusyonov, who lives in a tent pitched in a forest off the
highway, lost two tons of watermelons to one such raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has happened three times in two weeks,'' said Sveta, a
25-year-old visitor from the Siberian city of Novorossisk, where
she said people work but do not get paid. She earns $12 a day at
another roadside stand.
</P>
<P>
   For traders and seasonal workers, Moscow remains a magnet.
``Moscow has high salaries, people here have money,'' Mrs. Yegorova
said. ``That's why people come here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How many tons of watermelons are being sold now in the Russian
capital is anybody's guess, since no one is really keeping track.
Local regulations mandate a vendor's license, which in Mrs.
Yegorova's case costs about $17 a year. For Gusyonov, who is not a
Russian citizen, a temporary residence permit is required, which he
says he has.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the brisk watermelon trade has neatly
bypassed Moscow's major fruit and vegetable wholesalers, who supply
produce stores. There, as in Soviet times, watermelons appear only
sporadically, and at higher prices than on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the watermelons come from Astrakhan, best known for its
fast-dwindling supply of black caviar and the sweetness of its
watermelons. According to Nikolai Chelobanov, president of the
Astrakhan Farmers' Association, his members are happy to sell to
private traders who pull trucks and vans right up onto the fields,
and avoid the wholesalers who take a layer off their profit.
</P>
<P>
   Chelobanov says most Astrakhan watermelons are now being grown
by private farmers, who according to official figures cultivate
only 8 percent of the region's plowed land, but account for 19
percent of local agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added quickly, those figures are not to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers prefer not to give the whole picture,'' he said.
``They only show about 20 percent of what they produce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, they would be cleaned out,'' he added, in a cryptic
reference to Russians' fears of higher taxes and greedy local
officials who might be tempted to expropriate produce for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he said, Astrakhan farmers have focused on cash
crops for the Moscow market, which in addition to watermelons
include tomatoes, eggplants, peppers and, most recently, onions.
</P>
<P>
   But of all their crops, the watermelon is king _ a traditional
summer treat for Russians who have even been known to preserve them
until winter by waxing them, or by pickling them, to be eaten as an
accompaniment to vodka.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you eat a ripe Astrakhan watermelon, you don't want to
stop eating,'' Chelobanov said, his pride crackling over the
telephone line. ``You know the best way to eat an Astrakhan
watermelon? Without a shirt or a T-shirt, so that juices run down
your chin and onto your belly.''

   NAPALM-DISPOSAL (Deer Park, Texas) _ Four months ago, after
local residents and politicians screamed bloody murder, a train
carrying 22,000 gallons of napalm en route to an Indiana disposal
facility was abruptly halted and turned back to California, where
it had been moldering since the end of the Vietnam War. In July,
another toxic waste company inherited the napalm disposal contract.
But this time the company, GNI Group, is situated along Houston's
heavily industrialized Ship Channel, one of the globe's largest and
densest concentrations of petro-chemical facilities. The result was
that very same shipment of napalm eased its way into Texas three
weeks ago with only the briefest flurry of complaint.

   MARKET-SMALLSTOCKS (Undated) _ While the larger, well-known

mid-July, while the Russell 2000 index of small stocks fell nearly
20 percent from its high in April. A study by Salomon Smith Barney
showed that the vast majority of small issues, with market values
of less than $250 million, had fallen 45 percent on average from

WHEN DINING ITALIAN, TALK THE GOOD TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have a favorite Italian restaurant, try this phrase on
your waiter when he delivers an order of ``polmone in umido.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Da quanto tempo e morto questo?''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, that waiter will think you're smart. However, the chef may
attempt to remove your necktie with a meat cleaver. Because the
English interpretation of the above phrase is, ``How long has this
been dead?'' Since you have just ordered stewed veal lung, that
question may be essential to your survival.
</P>
<P>
   And survival is what Rick Steves teaches. An Edmonds, Wash.,
travel writer, tour leader, PBS television celebrity and the author
of several pocket language guides, Steves has a grasp of varied
dialects. He also has a sense of humor. As his student, you can
only hope the food servers you encounter are also of a jolly
disposition.
</P>
<P>
   Another helpful phrase Steves offers, to anybody visiting a fish
restaurant in Italy, is this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Solo la testa, per favore.'' You are asking the waiter to
bring you ``just the head, please.'' What you will probably get is
an astonished look from your food server.
</P>
<P>
   Steves is blessed with a disarming smile. That must be
particularly helpful when he concludes his meal abroad by asking in
Italian, French or German, ``Do any of your customers return?''
</P>
<P>
   However, his phrase books also show you how to make new friends.
The chapter on ``chatting'' includes the foreign translations of
these helpful exchanges:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just be friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like a massage?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Darling, will you marry me?''
</P>
<P>
   See? Steves eliminates a lot of non-essential dialogue. That may
be why every third American we encounter while touring aboard seems
to be clutching one of the 16 guide books he has written.
</P>
<P>
   With just such a traveling aid, we located a classic cliffside
hotel in Sorrento charging less than $80 a night for a double room
with breakfast served on a terrace overlooking the Gulf of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   In his guidebook Steves advised that the hotel is located in a
neighborhood ``drunk with character.'' It was not another Rick
Steves joke. But until we checked in, we suspected he might be
directing us to a neighborhood full of drunken characters. In which
case we had made a pledge.
</P>
<P>
   No massages!
</P>
<P>
   Fagioli con Tonno
</P>
<P>
   1 14-ounce can white beans
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   One-fourth cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 red onion
</P>
<P>
   1 7-ounce can solid pack white tuna
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   Drain and wash the beans. Dry, plunk them into a bowl and add
the oil and vinegar. Mix in the sage leaves and let sit for an hour
or so while you reconsider that pledge about massages.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile peel and thinly slice the onion. Chill in ice water
for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   OK, divide the beans onto four plates as an appetizer (or two
plates as a main dish). Divide the tuna also, then top with onion
slices. If you want, you can drizzle each dish with a bit more oil
and vinegar. Add salt if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Mussels and Pasta
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces pasta pieces, cooked
</P>
<P>
   1 anchovy fillet
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon capers
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon oregano
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 14-ounce can chopped tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds mussels
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   I used small penne for this dish, but you could use bow-ties or
any pasta of similar size. Cook until barely done in salted water,
wash with warm water and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In a cooking pot heat the olive oil. Chop together the anchovy
fillet and capers and add to the pot along with the garlic, oregano
and cayenne. Cook one minute, then add the tomatoes, wine and
washed mussels. Cover and steam 10 minutes, until the mussels open.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the shells from most of the mussels and discard. Return
the mussels to the pot along with eight or nine unshelled but
opened mussels. Add the cooked pasta and simmer five minutes. Add
salt if needed and serve the mussels, pasta and sauce in bowls to
three or four guests. And pass some crusty Italian bread for
dunking.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember one thing. If you want some mussels in Italy you
order ``cozze.'' If you mistakenly ask for ``muscolo'' you will get
a Sicilian weight lifter in a tight T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, and in case you do order stewed veal lung, the
guidebooks advise that the Italian phrase for ``yuck'' is ``che
schifo!'' And in France you turn your head to one side and explode
with an indignant, ``Pouah!''
</P>
<P>
   Bon appetite!

<P>
   MASHANTUCKET, Conn. _ A scent machine spews eau de smoky
campfire, and an escalator ride through a fiberglass glacier
includes geologic crunching and a 30-degree drop in temperature.
But in this museum built with a blank check, the final display is a
rickety yellow trailer with a shower head out back and a dented
kettle on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   It was in just such trailers that the remnants of the
Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation spent a dozen hungry years
repopulating a nearly abandoned Indian reservation _ only to become
millionaires with an Oz-like casino so tall it twinkles with red
lights to ward off airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   That teal-and-plum castle, Foxwoods Resort Casino, is now
Connecticut's largest individual source of revenue and allows the
Pequots to live like sheiks, with tribal housing and free college
tuition for all. The casino also supplied $193 million _ roughly
four months' take from the slot machines _ for the museum, opening
Tuesday, which celebrates the tribe's resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   The Pequots, once denied loans even for salt-box houses, are
rich. Now, they want respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just doing this to pay back what happened to native
people,'' said Theresa Hayward Bell, the museum's executive
director, who once lived in one of those trailers. ``This is
something that native people should always have been able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, what $193 million can do. The nation's museum
professionals are watching with awe _ and envy.
</P>
<P>
   Furs and replicas of tools, bones and a soapstone bowl are put
out where visitors can touch them; when they're worn, they'll just
be replaced. Base boards are slate, inlaid with Indian basket
designs. Display cases are solid elm and ash instead of the museum
norm, laminated plywood.
</P>
<P>
   A diorama of a caribou hunt, 50 feet in diameter, is accompanied
by a touch-screen program that allows an exploration of the
strategy of the kill. One life-size caribou seems to lunge with
shock and fear as an Indian spears him in the right side with a
flint-tipped spear (reusable, the program explains). Convincing ice
and moss roost in crevices of the boulders. A cook fire glimmers,
waiting for the first slabs of meat.
</P>
<P>
   In a 22,000-square-foot Indian village nearby, real water rushes
in the riverbed, and a computer linked to 110 speakers constantly
remixes the sounds of dogs, geese and crickets. The 50 trees have 5
million green polyester leaves, hand-painted with yellow, ivory and
bronze. To recreate the perfect American chestnut tree, artisans
traveled to Wisconsin to make a latex mold of a 23-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a 185-foot tower of stone and glass soon will give
visitors a pilot's eye view of the cedar swamp that sprouted the
largest casino in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   W. Richard West, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of the American Indian, said the Pequots' museum
was tremendous poetic justice for ``a people and a culture that had
been left for dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pequots were, historically, one of the most potent
political and military forces on the East Coast,'' he said. ``Now,
they've come full circle. No one can say the glory of native
culture is a past phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Williams, the acting president of the American
Association of Museums, said it is a rare luxury for a group to
have nearly unlimited resources and the chance to build an
institution from scratch. ``They've done everything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Banging down finishing touches this week, workers said they
never expect to work on such an opulent job again. Jim Spillson, a
carpenter, stroked the hangings and cases as if he were in church.
``Big bucks,'' he said, rubbing his thumb against the inside of his
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian village, designed to recreate the scene on a summer
afternoon in 1550, is encircled by a 600-foot mural, blown up from
a photograph of an oak and hickory forest. Fifty-one life-size
figures, each molded from sketches and measurements made of living
native Americans, weave mats, fashion arrows and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men sport elaborate geometric tattoos, which would
have been made by pricking soot and charcoal into their skin. Two
gulls hover over a garbage mound of shells.
</P>
<P>
   A recreated farmstead, like the ones Pequots built when furry
animals became scarce, includes a two-acre orchard where the stone
paths and manicured trees unintentionally evoke a formal English
garden. The log cabin is so snug that one construction worker, John
Melgey, joked that it was nicer than his own house. ``This is
comfy,'' he joked. ``I've been looking for a place.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The museum, though, is much more than a physical triumph. With
its Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, the tribe is
renewing the truism that the victor writes the history. This time,
it just took awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Pequot, translated for centuries in European histories as
``destroyer,'' here is rendered as ``the people of the shallow
water.'' Instead of conquering tribes that competed in
wampum-making, the Pequots now are on record as having ``gained
control of neighboring Native groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum sits within sight of Foxwoods and its 5,567 slot
machines, 24 restaurants and three hotels.
</P>
<P>
   At the museum, a visitor's journey begins in a model of the
glacier that once covered the reservation, and ends with displays
heralding the two elderly Pequot women who found themselves alone
on the reservation in the 1970s, holding the land for the
descendants who would engineer the tribe's comeback. With the
modest dream of self-sufficiency, they cut wood, grew lettuce and
boiled sap. And then they tried bingo.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and fall, the Pequot tale will be soaked up by 60
school groups consisting of more than 2,000 pupils.
</P>
<P>
   With the slogan ``Our Legacy Is Yours,'' the museum is being
advertised with posters at Metro-North commuter rail stations in
the New York City suburbs, and on buses in Providence, R.I.
Advertising is running in magazines like Smithsonian, Yankee and
Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $10 for adults and $6 for children, and the tribe
projects annual attendance of 350,000. The museum gives the
550-member tribe a chance to lure youngsters and other nongamblers
to the reservation, but that could cause problems with the Pequots'
neighbors. Already, many resent the 175 buses and 50,000 people
that the casino draws to the area each day.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expensive technology, Pequot officials are eager to
portray the museum as a home for serious scholarship, and a place
to dispel stereotypes about Indians from European histories and
Hollywood portrayals. Indeed, the museum was dreamed of long before
the tribe went into the gaming business: The collection has its
roots in the archeology, genealogy, oral history and other
information gathered during the process of gaining sovereign status
from the federal government, which was completed in 1983. The first
casino opened in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's 150,000-book research library emphasizes the 20th
century native American experience. ``We want to provide the tools
to allow people to write the books, make the videos and write the
poems that will introduce people to the truth about native
Americans,'' said Cheryl Metoyer, the museum's Director of
Information Resources.
</P>
<P>
   James Wherry, an anthropologist who has served as an adviser to
the Pequots' Tribal Council for 15 years, wrote in a tribe history
that the museum was planned with the aim of ``debunking some of the
more odious popular misconceptions of Pequot history and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum also is a chance for the Pequots to ease tensions
with their modern neighbors, who are resisting the tribe's effort
to annex new land for the reservation. Several local officials,
used to battling the tribe in court and at zoning hearings, said
they were pleasantly surprised to receive invitations to Monday's
ribbon-cutting ceremony for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Chairman Richard (Skip) Hayward, who once curled up on
the floor during a lobbying trip to the Bureau of Indian Affairs in
Washington because he could not afford a motel room, will introduce
a video greeting from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Johnson, the mayor of Ledyard, a town of 15,000 that
surrounds the reservation, said many of his constituents resent
what they consider the ``special privileges'' that the federal
government has conferred on the Pequots. But Johnson said he
believes the museum will be a big step in improving relations.
``They're here and we're here, and we're going to have to live with
each other for many years to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wherry, the tribal adviser, said area residents would be
mistaken if they thought the Pequots were interested only in good
will, though. ``Some of these town folk still think of the tribe in
the old ways,'' he said. ``They long for the good old days when
they could depend on the tribe for low-cost farm labor. This is our
answer. The Pequots have arrived.''

BOEING WOULD ASSEMBLE FIGHTER JET IN ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Joint Strike Fighter, one of the biggest military
procurement projects ever, will be assembled in St. Louis if The
Boeing Co. wins the competition over Lockheed Martin in three
years, the Post-Intelligencer has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts could be built in Seattle and shipped to St. Louis
for final assembly, though that is still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department currently plans to buy nearly 3,000 of
the stealthy strike fighters by 2020 at a cost of $219 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some military experts have said the program could be worth as
much as $300 billion when potential foreign sales are included.
Lockheed Martin executives have described the project as a ``must
win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest defense program out there in the entire
world,'' said Bert Cooper, a military aircraft analyst with the
Congressional Research Service in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Where Boeing would build its fighter should it win the
competition has been the subject of much speculation because of the
promise of thousands of aerospace jobs the project would mean.
</P>
<P>
   California has lobbied hard behind the scenes to have the
winning fighter entry built in that state, where the aerospace
industry has been hard hit by defense consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement that Boeing has picked St. Louis for assembly of
the Joint Strike Fighter is expected soon, and could be made
Thursday when Boeing will reveal the next round of its facilities
consolidation, sources said. Boeing is streamlining its commercial,
space and defense facilities in the wake of last year's merger with
McDonnell Douglas and the acquisition of Rockwell International's
military and space business.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is expected to announce Thursday that it will start
another next generation 737 production line at the under-used
Douglas factory in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year's merger with McDonnell Douglas, St. Louis has
become the headquarters of Boeing's military aircraft and missile
systems. Boeing builds the F-15 Eagle, the F-18 Hornet and the F-18
Super Hornet in St. Louis, as well as the T-45 Goshawk jet trainer
and the re-manufactured Harrier II Plus for the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Without new foreign orders, the F-15 production line will shut
down next year, and the F-18 Hornet line in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If Boeing wins the Joint Striker Fighter competition, St. Louis
would have the two biggest U.S. fighter projects well into the next
century. The Navy will buy a minimum of 548 of the new F-18 Super
Hornets. The first operational Super Hornet is scheduled to be
delivered later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is now building two demonstration Joint Strike Fighters
that will compete against two from Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Although sections of the demonstration fighters are being
fabricated in Seattle and St. Louis, final assembly is taking place
at Boeing's plant in Palmdale, Calif., which is also where the
rollout, ground testing and first flight will occur.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent flight testing will be at nearby Edwards Air Force
Base, and later at the Navy's Patuxent River test facility in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The first Boeing demonstration fighter should be finished by
late 1999 or early 2000. The second should roll out of the Palmdale
plant a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is scheduled to select the winning design in spring
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is also building its two demonstration fighters
in Palmdale, at its famed Skunk Works plant. Lockheed Martin
executives have not said where the Joint Strike Fighter would be
built if the company beats Boeing. Lockheed Martin now builds its
F-16 fighter at a huge plant in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Intended to serve the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and British
Royal Navy, the Joint Strike Fighter will be the first fighter
required to perform such multiservice roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy wants a fighter that can land and take off from an
aircraft carrier. The Marines and Royal Navy want a fighter that
can replace Harrier jets, which are capable of short takeoff and
vertical landing. The jet must also be stealthy so it can evade
detection by air or ground radar.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the research and
development costs of the project at $22 billion. The actual cost of
each plane would be $28 milion to $38 million in fiscal year 1994
dollars, depending on the version.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Boeing beat out an entry from McDonnell Douglas to
join Lockheed Martin in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Many military experts believe that the project is so important
to the overall U.S. defense industry that there will be no
winner-take-all decision by the Pentagon. Boeing and Lockheed
Martin will share the lucrative contract, these experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Even Norman Augustine, the recently retired chairman of Lockheed
Martin, told reporters at last year's Paris Air Show that he
thought both Boeing and Lockheed Martin would emerge as winners in
the fighter competition.

PATENTS: GETTING MORE PROMOTIONAL TIME FROM TV; USING TV SETS TO
TRACK PEOPLE AND PETS; LIVE TV IN AIRPLANES; THREE-DIMENSIONAL TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if there were not enough commercials already, an Israeli
inventor has patented a system to squeeze even more promotional
time out of every moment a television set is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Tsuria, of Shoham, Israel, won a patent for inserting what
he calls ''informational messages'' into the small pockets of empty
air time created when television channels are switched.
</P>
<P>
   His invention is intended for one- or two-way pay-television
systems that rely on cable, satellite or television networks or any
combination of those. Such systems offer dozens of channels,
sometimes as many as 150.
</P>
<P>
   When a viewer scrolls through the channels, it takes the
television set's decoder about one second to tune in each new one.
No picture or sound is transmitted during this interval, which is
known as zapping time.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuria believes that when a viewer scrolls through many channels
at once, an unpleasant and unproductive amount of zapping time
results. He proposes to fill that time with messages.
</P>
<P>
   His invention includes a decoder to receive an incoming
television signal, a multichannel display and a channel changer. A
predetermined message can be sent with the television signal. When
the system senses that a channel is being changed, the message
signal is decoded and displayed during the zapping time.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuria intends for the message to be somehow associated with the
channel involved _ either the one that was being viewed when the
channel changing commenced or the one being tuned in. But his
patent does not specify whether the message should be commercial,
promotional or public service.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuria received patent 5,786,845 and assigned it to News Datacom
Ltd. in Berkshire, England, which is a subsidiary of News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Set to Check on Fido's Whereabouts
</P>
<P>
   Television owners may soon be able to use their sets to track
people, pets and vehicles. James Reynolds of San Jose, Calif., has
patented a system that uses land-based or satellite radio
navigation systems like the Global Positioning System to pinpoint
people or objects and display their location on a television map.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' system needs a television cable company and phone line
to make it work. A radio transmitter is attached to a vehicle or
pet, or carried by a person, and sends a signal to the navigation
system. The signal can include longitude, latitude, altitude,
velocity and time. The data are then transmitted via a
communications service provider to a local television cable
company.
</P>
<P>
   A person at home who wants to find a pet, a relative or a car
driven by someone else can call the cable company and request the
location information. Soon a map is displayed on that person's
television set, with an icon representing the sought-after person
or object on the image to show the exact location. Reynolds
received patent 5,774,825.
</P>
<P>
   With Dish on the Plane, Fliers Can See TV Live
</P>
<P>
   It is common for planes to offer in-flight entertainment that
includes taped episodes of television shows and newscasts. Soon,
however, passengers may be able to watch live television. Richard
Sklar, Lawrence Girard, Ralph Phillipp, David Frankenback, Dickey
Berry and Jim Williams have won a patent for Raytheon's Hughes
Aircraft Co. of Anaheim, Calif., that uses an antenna mounted on an
airplane to pick up satellite television transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   The antenna picks up signals that are part of a direct broadcast
satellite system, the network used to transmit television signals
to the popular 18-inch dishes set up outside about 7 million homes
across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A controller and interface unit steer the antenna and lock it
onto a satellite's RF signals. Those RF signals carry television
channels and are decoded to turn them into video and audio signals.
The signals are routed to monitors inside the plane so passengers
can watch live programming.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors received patent 5,790,175.
</P>
<P>
   Taking TV 3-D From Inside the Set
</P>
<P>
   Watching television is still a passive activity, in spite of all
the hype about interactive TV. Sheldon Zelitt of North Gower,
Calif., hopes to enhance the experience somewhat with his invention
of three-dimensional television that does not require broadcasting
pictures in strange colors or wearing funny glasses.
</P>
<P>
   In his patent, Zelitt says he produces his 3-D images from a
two-dimensional display by ``varying the apparent distance of the
image from the viewer on a pixel-by-pixel basis.'' He inserts an
optical element next to each pixel. Each element is elongated so
that light can enter at different points. The place where the light
enters determines the illusion of the visual distance of its pixel
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology can be used for computer monitors, film and
still photography, Zelitt says. He received patent 5,790,086.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop along much of
the East Coast from Maine to South Carolina on Monday as a pair of
jet-stream disturbances approach. With ample moisture in place
through a deep layer of the atmosphere as well as weak winds aloft,
thunderstorms will persist long enough in a few areas to induce
local flooding.

   Farther west, isolated thundershowers will plague the upper
Tennessee and Ohio valleys and the southern Great Lakes states as a
cold front advances southward.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the cold front, bright sunshine and lowering humidity
levels will grace the Upper Middle West and northern Plains.
Temperatures will still be quite warm behind the front, especially
in the Dakotas and Montana where highs will be in the upper 90s in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine and hot conditions will also scorch much of central
Texas and Oklahoma as high pressure at 18,000 feet builds over the
region. High temperatures will eclipse 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   A compact but vigorous disturbance will spawn showers and heavy
thunderstorms with gusty winds and hail from eastern Kansas to
central Arkansas. Additional thunderstorms will percolate in the
torrid air over Florida and along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Copious moisture associated with the remnants of Tropical Storm
Frank will aid in the development of showers over the deserts and
plateaus of the Southwest and Rocky Mountains. Meanwhile in the
Pacific Northwest, low clouds will cling to the coast while
sunshine and seasonable heat dominate east of the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Upwelling
</P>
<P>
   When this month began, the temperature of Lake Ontario near
Rochester, N.Y., was hovering near its seasonal peak of 70 degrees.
By early Saturday, the water temperature had plunged to a bracing
46 degrees. The profound chill came from waters that were drawn
from deep below the surface of the lake. An unusually persistent
air flow from the south has been pushing the surface waters of Lake
Ontario toward the northern shores. In order to compensate for the
northward flowing water, cool water has been rising from below
along the southern side of the lake in a process called upwelling.

<P>
   LANDSTUHL, Germany _ Fifteen people seriously wounded in the
bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, were flown to
hospitals in Germany on Sunday by the United States Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 evacuees were a Marine Corps guard, nine civilian State
Department employees and five Kenyan staff members. The only
patient identified by military officials here was Mary Ofisi, a
46-year-old examiner who worked in the financial management center
on the first floor of the embassy. Ms. Ofisi, a Kenyan, said in an
interview in the U.S. Army Regional Medical Center here that she
heard three explosions on Friday morning before she found herself
on the floor with a thick, warm liquid _ her own blood _ covering
her face and upper body.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found myself, I was down under chairs, pieces of
computers, and I called to my friends and there was no sign,'' she
said. ``I knew then that I was alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Her left eye was covered with gauze, her face was cut and
scratched and her voice trembled as she said that she believed that
most of her closest co-workers had died. She and the other blast
victims were met by military ambulances at Ramstein Air Base when
they arrived at 12:10 p.m. after a 9{-hour flight on a gray Air
Force C-141B Starlifter.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kenyan employee of the embassy who was also on the
flight was carried, attached to intravenous tubes, on a stretcher
by 10 Air Force crew members to an Army helicopter for transfer to
a German university neurosurgery clinic in Homburg for intensive
care of his head wounds. The others all rode in ambulances the few
miles to the Army medical center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took these 15 because they were the most critically
injured,'' said Col. Lawrence Whitehurst of the Air Force,
commander of the 86th Medical Group at the base.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehurst said other victims who had been flown from Nairobi to
South Africa for treatment needed more immediate care.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said none of the Americans were able and
willing to talk with reporters on Sunday night. None of the 15 were
in danger of dying, officials said, but several were taken to the
emergency room for surgery for wounds like thigh and hip fractures,
punctures from shrapnel and eye damage.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ofisi said the U.S. ambassador in Nairobi told her on
Saturday that she would be flown to Germany for an operation to
repair fractures around her eye. Mrs. Ofisi said she had heard
three explosions on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sounded like gunshots,'' she said. ``The first was a big
noise, and we thought a tire had burst, and then immediately there
were two short ones.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I feel good that the Lord spared my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on where to send embassy personnel from Kenya and
Tanzania are under the control of the United States Central
Command, based at McDill Air Force Base, Fla., the U.S. military
authority for operations in Africa below the Sahara, Whitehurst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Russ Turner of the Air Force, chief flight surgeon of
the medical team that accompanied those who arrived on Sunday,
said, ``This is a seriously, seriously injured group of people who
are very traumatized, mentally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of the 43,000 American military personnel stationed in
Ramstein, Landstuhl and nearby Kaiserslautern lined up in an
auditorium near the commissary on Sunday to give blood for the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that brought them had flown 172 units of blood,
transfusion and intubation equipment and other medical supplies to
Kenya on Saturday. Another C-141B sent from Ramstein with more
medical equipment and blood supplies on Saturday night is expected
to return by Monday with a few additional wounded victims.
</P>
<P>
   Turner described the wounded Marine guard who was brought here
as a hero in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young marine was very severely injured,'' he said. ``He
got temporarily patched up and then signed himself out against
medical advice to go back and help others who had been hurt. There
were just heroic efforts on the ground.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Max Rodel, a 55-year-old chemist and investment fanatic, is
agonizing over his stock portfolio and feeling a bit rotten about
the way his small-company stocks have cratered in the last few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been absolutely miserable, not only for the last few
weeks but for the last few years,'' he said in a bout of
frustration. ``I'd invested in small caps for years and done well.
But I'm having a very bad year investing, one of the worst in 25
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rodel, who works part time, took a few days off from
his consulting practice in Mill Valley, Calif., last week to glue
himself to CNBC financial news and to peruse his subscription of
Oberweis, a newsletter about small-company stocks. But as the stock
market swooned, he watched helplessly as some of the stocks in his
portfolio plummeted as much as 80 percent from his purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? While the stocks of large, well-known companies
like McDonald's and Boeing have been battered for much of the last
month, the stocks of smaller companies have been hit even harder.
For instance, the Dow Jones industrial average _ a gauge of larger
blue-chip stocks _ has fallen 9 percent from its high in mid-July,
while the Russell 2000 index of small stocks has dropped 19 percent
from its high in April.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a study by John Manley, a securities analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney, showed that the majority of really small-company
issues _ 5,464 stocks with market values of less than $250 million
_ had fallen 45 percent on average from their peak through last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence has prompted some Wall Street analysts to talk
about a darker side of the bull market and to even suggest that a
bear market is in the offing. Despite solid gains in many blue-chip
issues, they say, the broader market is much sicker than many
investors realize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just semantics, just a word game,'' said Gail Dudack,
chief investment strategist at Warburg Dillon Read. ``Most everyone
owns stocks, and no one wants to hear the words bear market. But
this is a bear market that's been working its way from the bottom
up, and that's classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, few on Wall Street are willing to view the recent
selloff as the prelude to a stock market crash, noting that the
economy is still growing and that foreigners continue to be eager
buyers of American stocks. Meanwhile, many analysts simply see a
new paradigm _ powered by baby boomers pouring money into
retirement plans _ that favors index funds of the big blue-chip
companies over small-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, sharp declines in smaller stocks have not always
infected the broader market, and on Thursday and Friday both the
small and big stocks rallied, ending one of the nastiest selling
bouts in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the downturn in small-company stocks is difficult to ignore.
Their weakness can be glimpsed in what market analysts call the
advance-decline line, a measure of how many stocks rise versus how
many fall over a given period. In the 30 days ended last Tuesday,
9,394 more stocks fell than rose, one of the worst performances in
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   That selloff caused blue-chip stocks to decline nearly 10
percent from their records, a sizable drop that analysts generally
consider a market correction. A bear market is defined as a 20
percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the misfortunes of smaller company stocks have
any greater significance in the current bull market, their weakness
has many on Wall Street paying heed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this says is that the bull market has become increasingly
narrow,'' said Claudia Mott, who tracks small-company stocks at
Prudential Securities. ``There's so much to be said for the
bargains in the small-stock sector, but the money is going into the
big names.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it? According to analysts, the performance gap
between large and small stocks is approaching the levels of the
Depression. The disparity, however, is not new. Since early 1994,
stocks of big companies have vastly outperformed stocks of smaller
companies. In April 1997, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index had
risen 19.8 percent in the previous 12 months, but the Russell 2000
index of smaller stocks had fallen 5.1 percent _ creating a spread
of about 25 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, the chasm between small and large stock
performance widened once again, to 17 percentage points. And
perhaps more important, the Russell dropped into negative territory
at its low on Wednesday, showing small stocks down 8.7 percent on
the year while the S&AMP;P 500 was up 11.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is close to the largest spread we've seen since October
1929 and October 1937,'' said Theodore Aronson, an analyst and
principal at Aronson &AMP; Partners, a money management firm in
Philadelphia. ``You can drive the proverbial truck through that
spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Such disparities exist despite studies that have shown that
smaller-company stocks generally outperform blue chips over the
long haul. In his book ``Stocks for the Long Run,'' Jeremy Siegel,
a professor at the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania, says that going back to 1925, small stocks have
produced a compound annual return of 12.5 percent compared with 11
percent for the S&AMP;P 500. To be sure, Siegel and other studies note
that if the data exclude certain unique periods, large stocks
outperform smaller stocks by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller-company stocks have also had a relatively strong track
record in earnings growth. Ms. Mott of Prudential said smaller
companies outpaced larger companies in earnings growth for five
consecutive quarters, a trend expected to continue well into 1999.
In the second quarter of 1998, she said, small companies had profit
gains of about 10 percent, compared with just 2 percent for S&AMP;P 500
companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, smaller-company stocks are at or near historically
low valuations. So investors are paying relatively little per share
for each dollar of earnings growth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cheap as the shares may be, investors want to see appreciation
over time, and over the last few years investors like Rodel have
watched their shares slip and slide while blue chips have soared.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for underperformance are many. But chief among them
seems to be the growing popularity of index funds that mimic the
performance of the S&AMP;P 500. Millions of investors, eager to ride
the bull market of blue chips, have tied their fortunes to such
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio managers, fighting a losing battle against the index
funds, often find themselves riding the same stocks, trying to keep
pace, which creates a kind of blue-chip buying frenzy. And
foreigners, increasingly eager to invest in American companies, are
buying into the safest, most heavily traded stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This has helped push blue chips to record highs. In fact, much
as happened with the Nifty Fifty stocks of the 1970s, buying power
is being concentrated in an ever smaller group of stocks. For
instance, in the first half of this year, the top 10 stocks in size
in the S&AMP;P 500 had an average gain of 24.9 percent, while the
smallest 200 gained just 6.5 percent, on average.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of buying does not sit well with Jim Oberweis Sr.
Since 1976, Oberweis, whose office is in North Aurora, Ill., has
run the Oberweis small-stock newsletter and a mutual fund that
boasts an annualized return of about 25 percent over the last
decade. This year, however, his portfolio of small stocks is
lagging badly behind the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have clients scratching their heads saying, `Why do I go
through the effort to find good companies with good earnings and
then they don't do well?''' he said. Meanwhile, ``Coca-Cola is
selling at 50 times earnings with revenues growing 7 percent.
That's asinine. It may be a great company, but it's not a great
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   For many on Wall Street, the debate over small stocks comes down
to this: Is this a new era in which investors simply favor blue
chips in a global marketplace, despite higher prices and concerns
about Asia, or are investors signaling a bearish downturn by
retreating from a broad segment of the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, the deterioration in small stocks
usually signals a sharper downturn for the broader market. In 1929
and 1972, small-company stocks began to deteriorate well ahead of
larger stocks, until the market behemoths collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   There have been exceptions, notably in 1997, when sharp
slowdowns in smaller stocks did not lead to a bear market, but
analysts say that more often than not, bear periods follow broader
meltdowns. And although this bull market _ now one of the longest
in history, having begun in October 1990 _ has defied many
historical markers, a growing number of analysts are concerned
about its longevity, particularly now that earnings growth has
slowed drastically for big companies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Farrell, a longtime analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., noted
last week that some 70 percent of all over-the-counter stocks were
down 30 percent or more from their all-time highs, and he said this
weakness was a sign of bearishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a bull market in the sense that the big major stocks
haven't come down 10 percent,'' he said. ``But if you were told 50
percent of your portfolio was down 40 percent, it would be hard to
argue you weren't in a bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more, once-bullish market commentators like Ralph Acampora,
a technical analyst at Prudential Securities who once predicted the
Dow would reach 10,000 by 2000, are turning bearish. Acampora's
bearish words on CNBC last Tuesday helped send the Dow plunging
299.43 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Aronson said that despite the bearish signals, nothing was
exact in the global marketplace, which depends on emotions as much
as calculations. ``None of these statistical relationship are
anything approaching `E equals MC squared,''' he said. ``There's no
formula. A lot of it is market psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Rodel, he is going to wait and hope that this is not the
onset of a bear market, but a cycle that could end with small
stocks taking back a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who only invest in the S&AMP;P 500 funds, and they
kind of tease me,'' he said. ``But I think I'm going to stick to my
guns.''

PENN &AMP; TELLER'S NEXT TRICK: REVIVING THE VARIETY SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Penn &AMP; Teller's Sin City Spectacular,'' a variety show
premiering Monday on the FX cable channel, won me over before the
talking dog.
</P>
<P>
   But every good variety program needs a showstopper act, and Todd
Oliver and his stubby-legged mutt, Irving, are the stunner Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Left My Heart in San Francisco'' has been sung better, but
rarely outside the human species. At least it seems the dog sings
and talks. Never mind, just see it for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   When Irving started recalling how he'd spent his day, I was off
the chair and on the floor. See, it's not all (set ital)that(end
ital) hard to amuse a critic.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Carey, Lou Reed and Rob Schneider are on the show too.
Also, an acrobatic troupe, the Pavlovics.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Penn &AMP; Teller, a couple of brainy entertainers
who happen to be the Grand Guignol of modern magic.
</P>
<P>
   For the next several weeks, at least, ``Penn &AMP; Teller's Sin City
Spectacular'' _ the show is taped at the Luxor in Las Vegas _ will
try to revive a TV genre that's as old as Milton Berle's ``Texaco
Star Theater.'' The variety format is so antiquated that it seems
new again.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Jillette and his publicly silent partner, Teller, have
shaped the weekly series as a sort of homage to the variety shows
of the Ed Sullivan era. That means respect for the specialty acts
as well as the headliners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was just wonderful to have a plate spinner and
James Brown on the same show in Ed Sullivan's time,'' Jillette said
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping there are some people (who) would like to see a
show that treats everybody in show business with respect and is, at
the same time, funny.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a decent goal. And, at least in the first show, nicely
realized.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Penn &AMP; Teller's Sin City Spectacular'' isn't Sullivan
redux. Big Ed might have spun on his axis and breathed flames if
he'd seen this ``really big shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn and Teller indulge us with a cheesy showgirls-and-neon
opening. When Schneider makes his appearance, it's in the guise of
Dean Martin, saying, ``You know, most of your kids' music you
listen to today is crap, and I'd like to sing some of that crap for
you right now.'' Carey learns a trick that involves Teller's caged
head and hungry rats.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``Sexual Magic'' number, with Penn belting
suggestive lyrics while Teller beds down with a lightly attired
showgirl for a scorcher of a card trick.
</P>
<P>
   Clever stuff, mind you, but we aren't talking Topo Gigio.
</P>
<P>
   Irving the conversational dog, however, works clean. He'd do
Senor Wences proud. S'all right? S'all right.

CHANCE, AND LUCK, IN BOMBING AT U.S. EMBASSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: AFRICA-BOMBINGS, AFRICA-VICTIMS, AFRICA-U.S.,

 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ An Air Force employee lost a chance to spend
Thursday night in Amsterdam, and lost her life when she went to
work on Friday. A 21-year-old Marine guard would probably have
lived if he had been at his post, in the front of the U.S. Embassy.
But he had just gone to get money for the weekend at the cashier's
office, in the back of the embassy, and was killed.
</P>
<P>
   By design, terrorist attacks are ruthlessly indiscriminate. The
blast that tore through the embassy here was no exception, taking
and sparing lives at will as it shattered the belief that any U.S.
outpost could be a low-security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Kenyan victims had gone to the embassy early Friday
morning with the hope of getting a visa or job.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, timing blessed the embassy's most senior
diplomats, who were attending their weekly meeting in the
ambassador's spacious office on the embassy's fifth, and top,
floor, where the blast's impact was the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``That saved my life,'' said William Barr, the embassy's chief
spokesman, who had been thinking that he might slip away a bit
early on Friday, for a round of golf at the Muthaiga Club, the
fabled colonial hangout.
</P>
<P>
   For unknown reasons, Julian Bartley, the embassy's general
consul, was not at the meeting, as he would normally be. On Sunday,
he was the last of the dead American diplomats to be identified.
His son, Jay, a university student who had a summer job at the
embassy, was also killed in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   At the senior officers' meeting, one main item of discussion was
security. The senior diplomats tossed around ideas on how to impart
to this summer's new arrivals at the embassy the need for prudence
in this mile-high capital on the Equator that has been gripped by
street crime, while avoiding a siege mentality that would keep them
locked behind high walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rather ironic,'' Donald Mackenzie, regional director
for the U.S. Agency for International Development, recalled on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to tell them, `Kenya is really a marvelous place,
you can enjoy yourselves,''' said Mackenzie, who first began to
appreciate the country as a Peace Corps volunteer here 28 years
ago. ``This has traditionally been a place with a low terrorist
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   But at 10:35, as the meeting was nearing the end, there was a
loud thud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some one next to me said, `That's an explosion,' '' recalled
Paul Peterson, who arrived here only three weeks ago, as the State
Department's regional security officer. ``I knew instantly it was a
bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 seconds later came the second, and far more powerful,
blast _ the one that tore through the embassy, leveled the building
next door, and blew out every window to the top of the 22-story
Cooperative Bank building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first one out of the room,'' Peterson said. ``I saw
bloody people everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened is still far from clear. It appears that a vehicle
loaded with explosives drove into a parking lot behind the embassy.
There have been reports in the local papers that gun shots were
heard before the explosions, but these have not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The blast knocked Mackenzie, who was sitting near a window, out
of his chair, and he suffered minor cuts on the back. He picked
himself up, and quickly followed the others out of the room. They
started down the stairwell, now without any light. And with the
walls crumbling, debris turned the stairs into something more akin
to a slide, Mackenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dust was just horrible,'' he added. ``A lot of us were
fearing that we could not go on breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there was no panic, not even screaming inside the
embassy, several diplomats recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But there was random death.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unfortunate were those embassy employees who, with the
weekend approaching, had gone to the cashier's office and the
Citibank branch to get money. They are located in the back of the
embassy, on the first floor, which took the brunt of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Jesse Aliganga, a Marine sergeant from Florida,
was killed, said Peterson, the embassy security officer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a strike at Kenya's commercial banks, the secretary
for Barr, the embassy spokesman, asked for time to go from their
offices, about a half-mile from the embassy, to transact business
at Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went down and she didn't come back,'' Barr said. He asked
that her name not be published because the Kenyan government had
not released the names of the Kenyan victims.
</P>
<P>
   Fate also dealt cruelly with Arlene Kirk, an Air Force employee
at the embassy, and Robert Kirk, who worked for the Agency for
International Development. The couple were returning to Nairobi
from vacation. Their flight from Amsterdam was overbooked and the
airline asked for volunteers to forgo their seat, in exchange for
some money and a free night in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirks decided to take it, Barr said. But by the time they
got to the counter, enough other passengers had volunteered. So the
Kirks got on the flight, and returned to work on Friday, where Mrs.
Kirk was killed.

MARKET PLACE: SEC SIGNALS CONCERN AS INTERNET COMPANIES' STOCKS
KEEP RISING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Has the Securities and Exchange Commission begun
voicing subtle warnings about the unusually high prices of Internet
industry stocks?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the SEC would never tell investors not to pay
sky-high prices for the stocks of young, money-losing companies.
Nor can it stop companies from buying each other at equally high
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency can send some signals through its regulation of
how those acquisitions are accounted for on the buyers' financial
statements. And at the root of recent fights the agency has picked
with companies that try to write off most of the price of their
acquisitions up front is a sense that the prices of technology
companies just cannot be reconciled with conservative accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent example is America Online Inc., which was not
able to release its quarterly and full-year earnings last week
because it is still wrestling with the SEC over the accounting for
two recent acquisitions: Netchannel, for which it paid $29 million,
and Mirabilis, acquired for $287 million. The issue is how much of
the price that the online service paid for the acquisitions can be
written off now _ a one-time hit investors tend to dismiss _ versus
how much must be deducted over many quarters, a weight on profit
that more investors would be likely to heed.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rules force companies to add up the apparent value of
the assets in companies they acquire _ both tangible things like
real estate and intangibles like patent rights. If they paid more
for the company than the value of its assets _ and most do _ the
excess is classified as good will, which must be charged against
earnings over a period of three to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since many companies do not want that continuing drag on
profits, they look for ways to reduce good will charges, and
technology companies in particular have latched on to an obscure
rule that allows them to write off immediately the value of
continuing research and development activities in the companies
they buy. (Completed research, on the other hand, is considered
intellectual property that must be accounted for as an asset on the
company's balance sheet.)
</P>
<P>
   Many technology firms now argue that most of the prices they pay
for their acquisitions represent continuing, or incomplete,
research, and thus can be written off as an expense right away.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Worldcom Inc. said it would write off $6 billion to
$7 billion of the $37 billion it had agreed to pay for MCI
Communications Corp., because that was the value of MCI's
continuing research. And other companies, including Microsoft Corp.
and Cisco Systems Inc., have written off the bulk of their
acquisition costs as in-process research.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that this rule is being abused and that future
earnings at some companies are thus being overstated.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC have
started looking more closely at the research write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company puts value into the research and development
that should be in good will, it can drastically affect what
earnings they will report to investors in the future,'' said Lynn
Turner, the SEC's chief accountant. He argued that since technology
stocks in particular were trading at very high multiples to their
earnings, even relatively small accounting changes could have a big
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a high-tech company trading at 40 times earnings, a
write-off that increases earnings by $20 million a year can
increase the company's market cap by $800 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner declined to discuss the specifics of America Online's
proposed write-offs. But he did say that often the question of
whether a write-off is fair comes down to how soon the research
will produce a marketable product and thus contribute to earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people ascribe a high value to research that is early on in
its development, the commission staff would raise questions,'' he
said. ``There may be a high degree of uncertainty about whether it
will be completed, and so it should have a lower value.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the case of America Online, both of its recent acquisitions
are far from certain moneymakers. In April, the company acquired
Netchannel, a company that introduced and then withdrew a service
that connected television sets to the Internet. When announcing the
acquisition, America Online defended it as a way of hiring
Netchannel's management to develop an entirely new service.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June, America Online bought Mirabilis, a company begun
18 months earlier by four young Israelis. Mirabilis is a perfect
Rorschach test for how different investors value Internet
companies. To bulls, Mirabilis has vast potential because it
developed a chat service that has attracted 12 million members who
spend hours a day on line. But skeptics note that Mirabilis has
never generated a dollar in revenue and that America Online's plans
to turn it into an advertising medium are unproven.
</P>
<P>
   For America Online, this represents another accounting cloud
that darkens what many investors see as one of the great business
growth stories of the decade. The company was long criticized for
its delay in taking charges for marketing expenses, a move that had
the effect of making the company appear more profitable in its
earlier growing phase.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it reversed that practice. And indeed the more recent
accounting imbroglios relate to practices that have the opposite
effect _ of taking charges for expenses faster, depressing
near-term earnings but leaving future earnings free to grow faster.
But the SEC then forced America Online to restate its earnings _ in
part because it had taken $26 million in expenses too soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, with its research write-off, America Online says it is
hardly trying to pick yet another fight with regulators.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought this issue to the attention of the SEC, and we are
confident that it will be worked out,'' said Tricia Primrose, a
spokeswoman. She said the company set the value of the research
done by Mirabilis and Netchannel according to calculations of an
independent appraiser and that such write-offs have become standard
in the industry. For example, IBM wrote off as research $1.8
billion of the $3.4 billion it paid for Lotus Development in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The excuse that ``everybody is doing it,'' does not calm the
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These write-offs should be very minimal, at best, because when
you give management the right to wipe out future expenses all on
one swoop, they tend to abuse it,'' said Brad Rexford, an analyst
with the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a research
firm in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most investors and stock analysts argue that these fine
points of accounting are not related to the financial health of the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good will is noncash and doesn't effect the cash-generating
capacity of a company,'' said Shaun Andrikopoulos, an analyst with
BT Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   If technology companies are forced by the SEC to reduce their
initial write-offs and take more of the cost of their acquisitions
as charges to earnings for continuing good will, analysts will
simply ignore the reported earnings, Andrikopoulos said. In media
companies, which often have a lot of good will charges, analysts
look more to earnings before income taxes, depreciation and
amortization than to net profit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that tightening rules on research write-offs will
inhibit technology companies from pursuing acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the SEC cracks down, it will have an effect on the whole
sector,'' said Walt Price, who runs a technology mutual fund for
Dresdner RCM Global Investors. ``In the case of Mirabilis, the only
way that acquisition is going to make sense is if you write off the
very large purchase price and then figure out how to turn it into a
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Could that be exactly what the SEC has in mind? &QL;

REGULATORS TARGET ENTERTAINMENT-RELATED INVESTMENT SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is too late to invest in ``Titanic,'' but how about a chance
to invest in the films of Lyman Dayton, a producer and director who
won prestigious awards at the Cannes Film Festival and whose
previous projects gave investors profits of 500 percent?
</P>
<P>
   That sales pitch attracted plenty of investors, according to the
Federal Trade Commission. But while Dayton was real, his supposed
awards were not. The returns to investors in his films were far
smaller and substantially more investors were allowed in than the
sellers had claimed. While Dayton was not charged with wrongdoing,
the commission has won more than $12 million in judgments from
several telemarketers who sold the film partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many Americans track weekend box-office grosses
with a fervor matched only by their obsession with the stock
market, investment scams have found a new and apparently fertile
field: entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, state and federal securities regulators have
filed a growing number of enforcement actions against individuals
and companies that have sought to raise money for investments in
film, television or other entertainment projects.
</P>
<P>
   Now, intent on fighting back even harder, regulators are joining
forces. On Tuesday, senior officials from the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the North
American Securities Administrators Association, a group of state
regulators, will announce a joint crackdown on fraudulent
investment opportunities in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people selling these investments read the headlines and
glom onto whatever is hot,'' said Mark Beauchamp, a spokesman for
the state regulators group. ``We've seen deals involving supposed
movies, television shows, cable investment opportunities,
infomercials and theme restaurants. There's a fair bit of it out
there, and they're selling it through the Web or through
old-fashioned boiler room tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   While regulators say they have seen isolated cases of
entertainment-related fraud over the years, its prevalence, and the
amount of money its perpetrators have been able to raise from
investors, has increased markedly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The deals recycle many of the usual tactics of investment fraud.
Sometimes, state regulators shut down an operation in one state
only to see it move to another. Last year, Wisconsin regulators
undertook an enforcement action against a film company called
Desert Gold Partners of Hollywood for selling unregistered
securities. The action followed similar filings against the same
company by regulators in Texas, Iowa, Kansas and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Other entertainment ventures appeal to gullible investors who
see them almost as charitable causes. Regulators in Arizona and
Arkansas recently brought actions against an outfit called kidZtime
TV, which was accused of selling unregistered partnership units in
a company that claimed it would obtain the broadcast rights to
nonviolent children's programing on cable television systems.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has also sharpened its focus on entertainment ventures
that end up defrauding investors. The commission is pursuing
regulatory actions against former insiders at First National
Entertainment, which produced a feature-length animated film called
``Happily Ever After'' that fell far short of the returns it had
projected.
</P>
<P>
   ``People read how motion pictures like `Titanic' make $1
billion,'' said David Cohen, supervising attorney in the
enforcement unit of the Wisconsin division of securities. With oil
and gas prices cheap, investment opportunities in that
traditionally fraud-ridden field are less attractive. And
regulators have been fairly successful at alerting investors to the
dangers of high-technology ventures, like wireless cable deals.
Therefore, Cohen said, ``I guess they need something else to
sell.''

WAS VOTING IN CAMBODIA REALLY FAIR? NEW DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
 POLITICS-NYT  (ll) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ As bargaining continued over the shape of a
coalition government in Cambodia, new reports emerged on Sunday
that the ruling party, headed by the apparent winner of last
month's election, Hun Sen, has been harassing political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, the monitoring group based New York, issued
a statement saying it had found evidence of ``a wave of reprisals
and threats by officials or security forces affiliated with Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one had been killed, it said, members of Hun Sen's
party were forcing members of opposition parties to flee their
villages by threatening and sometimes shooting at them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it said, some members of the ruling party who had
failed to deliver the vote in their areas last month were also
being threatened by fellow party members. Separately, an official
of the International Republican Institute, a private group
affiliated with the American Republican Party, which helped monitor
the election, said on Sunday that the group was still receiving
reports of a variety of electoral abuses and was withholding
judgment on the fairness of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   These statements added to a growing sense of unease about the
quality of the election, held on July 26, in which Hun Sen's party,
according to the official count, won a majority of seats in
parliament, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   But the election committee that organized the balloting, and is
conducting the count and hears complaints about abuses, is
controlled by Hun Sen's party, as are most municipalities, police
departments and other government agencies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulating reports of abuses suggested that in a number of
instances _ and perhaps in a systematic way around the country _
the governing party had employed its powers to manipulate the
election's outcome. But it was impossible to tell whether any such
manipulation affected the overall result, as the second and
third-place finishers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy,
have complained.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Grove, the director of the International Republican
Institute's Asia division, offered an assessment of the voting, the
mood two days later and the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I clearly saw the enthusiasm and euphoria on election day,''
Grove said. ``By Tuesday morning, this euphoria had turned into
despair and now, I am hearing from my Khmer friends, that despair
is turning to anger.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Washington, Grove said he had
witnessed the unannounced removal of ballot boxes from a precinct
to the central counting center at 4 a.m. on the night after the
election, and had been illegally barred from observing what became
of them.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, a number of foreign diplomats based in Cambodia
have commented that there are no true democrats in Cambodia's
competition and that there is no guarantee that the parties of
Ranariddh or Sam Rainsy would have acted any better if they had Hun
Sen's power.

     AN HOUR WITH PHIL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Paul Hartmann &LR; ((cq)), brother of the late comedian  &UR; Phil &LR; 
 &UR; Hartman &LR; , has asked Dr.  &UR; Gene Schoenfeld &LR;  to review and interpret
toxicological reports and medical records of  &UR; Brynn Hartman &LR; , who
killed her husband and herself. Her body was found to contain
evidence of cocaine, alcohol and Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, who often serves as a forensic consultant on the
effects of psychoactive drugs, says he was stunned when Hartmann
came to his San Francisco office carrying a small wooden box of his
brother's ashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartmann family is large, explained Paul, and each of Phil's
siblings was given a portion of the c &LR; remains. ``I thought you
might want to be with Phil for a while,'' said Paul, handing the
box to Schoenfeld to hold during their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul has since returned to Southern California with the little
wooden box,'' says Schoenfeld. ``I was truly pleased and deeply
touched by this encounter.''

<P>
   &UR; Allen &LR;  and  &UR; Linda Anderson &LR; , publishers of the Minneapolis
newsletter Angel Animals and a forthcoming book on spiritual
lessons taught to humans by animals, will present a San Francisco
workshop Monday for the Learning Annex. Among the stories that have
appeared in their inspirational newsletter:
</P>
<P>
   ``A Rabbit Helped Me Take My Next Spiritual Step'', ``Learning
Patience From My Cockatiels'', ``How a Fish Connected Me to My
Spiritual Ministry'' and ``A Cat Showed Me How to Get Pregnant.''

<P>
   - Food for the party  &UR; Kim Basinger &LR;  and  &UR; Alec Baldwin &LR;  threw for
the Clintons last week in the Hamptons was supplied by 24 local
restaurants, one of which was planning a contribution the
animal-loving Baldwins couldn't accept. The hosts became ``very
upset,'' reported the New York Post, when they learned that foie
gras -- made from force-fed ducks and geese -- was on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin called someone high up in the Democratic Party and
insisted that the delicacy not be served.
</P>
<P>
   - The California Cigar Association and the San Francisco Giants
co-hosted a $15-a-head pregame cigar party Friday night to
celebrate what CCA president  &UR; Nick Nikkah &LR;  referred to as ``the
perfect melding of two American pastimes: baseball and the
enjoyment of a fine cigar.'' The CCA describes itself as a
``statewide association dedicated to combat unnecessary laws''
about cigar smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Lest the pro-cigar event lead people to the conclusion that the
Giants are pro-tobacco, fans at Monday's game will be given flyers
educating them about the evils of chewing tobacco. Ten thousand
will be handed out.
</P>
<P>
   Although smoking is banned in the stands at 3Com Park and team
trainer  &UR; Mark &LR;   &UR; Letendre &LR;  is heavily involved in the campaign
against chewing tobacco, the Giants have no official anti-tobacco
policy, the team's  &UR; Blake Rhodes  &LR; told Personals.
</P>
<P>
   - Before Sunday's Pretenders and B-52's concert at Shoreline
Amphitheatre, lead singers  &UR; Chrissie Hynde  &LR; and  &UR; Kate Pierson &LR; 
sponsored a signature drive for a petition urging the University of
California to cancel experiments in which monkeys will be subjected
to deafening levels of sound. Learning of &UR; Paul &LR; 
 &UR; McCartney &LR; 's recent letter asking that the experiments be called
off, Hynde had written to UC officials last week to add her voice
to his plea.

   -  &UR; Heidi Fleiss &LR; , the Hollywood madam serving time in the
federal prison in Dublin, says in an interview to be broadcast
October 19 on A&AMP;E's ``American Justice'' that's she's bitter that
 &UR; Charlie Sheen &LR; , a former client who testified against her, was
``treated like a superstar.'' She went to jail, she said, while he
signed autographs for FBI agents. ``I don't know,'' said the
feminist entrepreneur. ``It's a man's world.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ On Friday morning, Jack Omukhani paid a visit
to his wife at her job in the switchboard room of the Ufundi
Cooperative Building.
</P>
<P>
   He had time to spare because he was on strike from his bank job.
They talked of little things. His wife, Elizabeth Akino, insisted
that he stay for a cup of tea to brace him against the chilly
weather. He left just after 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he picked up her mangled body from the city morgue. A
half-hour after they parted, Ms. Akino was killed by the
terrorist's bomb aimed at the American Embassy next door, which
caused even worse devastation at the Ufundi building.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akino was among at least 155 Kenyans who were killed in an
act of terrorism that investigators say appears to have nothing to
do with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for me, it was actually by the grace of God I survived,''
Omukhani said, as he fought back tears outside the City Council
Mortuary, the main morgue, where he had found his wife's body on
the floor. ``I had just seen her, and we had talked.''
</P>
<P>
   As the death toll from Friday's bombing continued to rise, the
families of victims turned to the grim tasks of burying their dead
and rebuilding their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The blast ripped through a busy downtown district dominated by
banks and government offices at 10:30 a.m. Many of the people who
died were educated, middle-class Kenyans: office workers, bankers,
engineers, accountants.
</P>
<P>
   In a country like Kenya, where jobs are scarce and the average
income is less than $260 a year, the effects of Friday's carnage
will spread far beyond the immediate families of the dead, like
rings in a pond, to hundreds of dependents living in rural areas,
Kenyans said.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who survived the blast and the storm of flying
glass and shrapnel that followed, life has been forever altered.
More than 500 people were hospitalized for wounds. Scores were
blinded or permanently scarred, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Many relatives of victims expressed a quiet outrage that Kenyans
were paying with their lives for American foreign policy decisions.
Some expressed the opinion that the American marines and officials
had done too little to help dig out victims from the rubble of the
Ufundi building in the crucial early hours of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a war between the Americans and other people, they
should take the war elsewhere,'' said Dr. Charles Onudi, who was
waiting for a relative's body outside the morgue. Lots of innocent
lives are being lost.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the City Council Mortuary on Sunday, lines of relatives
snaked slowly through the horrifying rooms of disfigured and
mutilated bodies. Most had been searching city hospitals since the
blast in a desperate attempt to find their missing relatives alive.
Every few minutes, there were muffled cries, followed by the sound
of weeping, as people discovered their kin.
</P>
<P>
   On the front gate was a list of 34 names of people already
identified by the police, scrawled in felt pen on a paper bag.
</P>
<P>
   No. 28 was John Ouko Onyango, a 33-year-old engineer who worked
at the Kenya Power and Lighting Co. He was a polite, religious man
who seemed to have a bright future ahead of him, friends said. His
wife is a nurse at the Nairobi hospital. They had two small
children, the second only a month old.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Onyango purchased a new car, a sign he was coming up
in the world. A cautious man, he went to the Ufundi Cooperative
Building on Friday morning to buy more automobile insurance, his
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the person who was well-off in the family,'' said his
cousin, Apollo Abiero. ``He was the bread-winner. He supported four
brothers and a sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Further up on the list was Caroline Ndolo, a lively 29-year-old
single mother who worked as a clerk at the Ufundi Cooperative
Savings and Credit Society. Her brother, Frederick, a father of two
young boys, also worked at the bank. He is missing and presumed
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Friends described Miss Ndolo as a talkative and independent
young woman who liked to go dancing in Nairobi nightclubs and
enjoyed her single life. She had been pleased to discover that she
was pregnant last year. Her baby boy is three months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was happy about the baby,'' her father, Michael Opondo
Ndolo, a retired civil servant, said as he waited for his
daughter's body to be loaded into a hearse. ``She had a plan of
opening a small shop, a boutique.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the sentiment of many grieving family members here,
Ndolo said the American Embassy should be moved far from the center
of town.
</P>
<P>
   Naftali Muyonga, a senior official in the Foreign Ministry, came
to the morgue to take care of arrangements for his brother-in-law,
Moises Ashton Mwani, who was a high-ranking civil servant in the
Teachers Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Mwani, 50, was killed by shrapnel from the blast as he sat in a
meeting on the fourth floor of a building next to the Ufundi
building, Muyonga said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we fail to understand is why the terrorists should pick
on a peaceful country like Kenya,'' Muyonga said.
</P>
<P>
   At about noon, Omukhani and his friends carried the body of his
wife, Elizabeth Akino, out of the morgue on a stretcher and into a
van. Half her face and head had been destroyed by shrapnel. The
hearse took the body to a funeral home in Nairobi's center, to keep
until the family can collect enough money to transport her body to
western Kenya for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akino's death was a heavy blow for her family. She has two
children, an 8-year-old boy, Marvin, and a 3-year-old girl. Her
husband has been on strike from the Kenya Commercial Bank for a
week, along with thousands of other bank employees. The striking
workers were dismissed by management last week, and it is unclear
if they will be allowed to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be worried,'' Omukhani said. ``I don't know my fate
as of now. I'm just wishing that all will go well and I'll go back
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akino's older sister, Tereza Okidi, 45, said she was worried
the family would not have enough money to support the children. Ms.
Okidi, a former secretary, said she had recently started a small
restaurant in a marketplace. But she has two grown children of her
own, both unemployed, and her earnings will not stretch far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to start life with these small children,''
she said. ``I can't neglect my sister's children. I can't run from
the responsibility. It has found me and it is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friends and relatives described Ms. Akino as a strong,
athletic woman. She played semiprofessional volleyball for the
Kenya Commercial Bank team for several years before she gave it up
to devote herself to her children, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Nairobi, Ms. Akino was the sixth child in a family of
nine. Her father was a mechanic. She attended public schools and
finished high school, but never had enough money to go to college,
relatives said. She was studying typing and shorthand and dreamed
of becoming a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, she had grown more religious. She loved gospel
music and spent much of her spare time working with women's
organizations and church groups. Though she was not garrulous, she
had many friends. Her desk at work was a magnet for people on their
coffee breaks, so much so that her boss sometimes complained.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akino and her husband and children lived in a one-room
apartment in a barracks-style public housing project in Bahati, a
working-class neighborhood. She talked often to friends about her
desire to move into a bigger house, buy a car and have a third
child.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the tiny home are decorated with banners from
volleyball tournaments. There is a showcase with trophies on one
wall. Her husband is also a player, for the Kenya National Team.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, her family and friends met in her home to
share stories and talk about funeral arrangements. Several fought
back tears as they gathered outside on wooden benches under a gray
sky. They prayed together first and then began to talk in low tones
about what was needed for a respectable funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was my best friend,'' said Danae Tirop, 28, who also
played for the bank's volleyball team. ``She was the maid of honor
at my wedding. She was warm, generous, kind, understanding. She
always thought of her children first.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tirop's eyes welled up.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that Friday, I actually wanted to go to see her,'' she
said. ``But I decided to wait until after lunch.''

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ On Friday morning, Jack Omukhani paid a visit
to his wife at her job in the switchboard room of the Ufundi
Cooperative Building.
</P>
<P>
   He had time to spare because he was on strike from his bank job.
They talked of little things. His wife, Elizabeth Akino, insisted
that he stay for a cup of tea to brace him against the chilly
weather. He left just after 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he picked up her mangled body from the city morgue. A
half-hour after they parted, Ms. Akino was killed by the
terrorist's bomb aimed at the American Embassy next door, which
caused even worse devastation at the Ufundi building.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akino was among at least 155 Kenyans who were killed in an
act of terrorism that investigators say appears to have nothing to
do with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for me, it was actually by the grace of God I survived,''
Omukhani said, as he fought back tears outside the City Council
Mortuary, the main morgue, where he had found his wife's body on
the floor. ``I had just seen her, and we had talked.''
</P>
<P>
   As the death toll from Friday's bombing continued to rise, the
families of victims turned to the grim tasks of burying their dead
and rebuilding their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The blast ripped through a busy downtown district dominated by
banks and government offices at 10:30 a.m. Many of the people who
died were educated, middle-class Kenyans: office workers, bankers,
engineers, accountants.
</P>
<P>
   In a country like Kenya, where jobs are scarce and the average
income is less than $260 a year, the effects of Friday's carnage
will spread far beyond the immediate families of the dead, like
rings in a pond, to hundreds of dependents living in rural areas,
Kenyans said.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who survived the blast and the storm of flying
glass and shrapnel that followed, life has been forever altered.
More than 500 people were hospitalized for wounds. Scores were
blinded or permanently scarred, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Many relatives of victims expressed a quiet outrage that Kenyans
were paying with their lives for American foreign policy decisions.
Some expressed the opinion that the American marines and officials
had done too little to help dig out victims from the rubble of the
Ufundi building in the crucial early hours of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a war between the Americans and other people, they
should take the war elsewhere,'' said Dr. Charles Onudi, who was
waiting for a relative's body outside the morgue. Lots of innocent
lives are being lost.''

</P>
<P>
   At the City Council Mortuary on Sunday, lines of relatives
snaked slowly through the horrifying rooms of disfigured and
mutilated bodies. Most had been searching city hospitals since the
blast in a desperate attempt to find their missing relatives alive.
Every few minutes, there were muffled cries, followed by the sound
of weeping, as people discovered their kin.
</P>
<P>
   On the front gate was a list of 34 names of people already
identified by the police, scrawled in felt pen on a paper bag.
</P>
<P>
   No. 28 was John Ouko Onyango, a 33-year-old engineer who worked
at the Kenya Power and Lighting Co. He was a polite, religious man
who seemed to have a bright future ahead of him, friends said. His
wife is a nurse at the Nairobi hospital. They had two small
children, the second only a month old.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Onyango purchased a new car, a sign he was coming up
in the world. A cautious man, he went to the Ufundi Cooperative
Building on Friday morning to buy more automobile insurance, his
friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the person who was well-off in the family,'' said his
cousin, Apollo Abiero. ``He was the bread-winner. He supported four
brothers and a sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Further up on the list was Caroline Ndolo, a lively 29-year-old
single mother who worked as a clerk at the Ufundi Cooperative
Savings and Credit Society. Her brother, Frederick, a father of two
young boys, also worked at the bank. He is missing and presumed
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Friends described Miss Ndolo as a talkative and independent
young woman who liked to go dancing in Nairobi nightclubs and
enjoyed her single life. She had been pleased to discover that she
was pregnant last year. Her baby boy is three months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was happy about the baby,'' her father, Michael Opondo
Ndolo, a retired civil servant, said as he waited for his
daughter's body to be loaded into a hearse. ``She had a plan of
opening a small shop, a boutique.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the sentiment of many grieving family members here,
Ndolo said the American Embassy should be moved far from the center
of town.
</P>
<P>
   Naftali Muyonga, a senior official in the Foreign Ministry, came
to the morgue to take care of arrangements for his brother-in-law,
Moises Ashton Mwani, who was a high-ranking civil servant in the
Teachers Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Mwani, 50, was killed by shrapnel from the blast as he sat in a
meeting on the fourth floor of a building next to the Ufundi
building, Muyonga said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we fail to understand is why the terrorists should pick
on a peaceful country like Kenya,'' Muyonga said.
</P>
<P>
   At about noon, Omukhani and his friends carried the body of his
wife, Elizabeth Akino, out of the morgue on a stretcher and into a
van. Half her face and head had been destroyed by shrapnel. The
hearse took the body to a funeral home in Nairobi's center, to keep
until the family can collect enough money to transport her body to
western Kenya for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Akino's death was a heavy blow for her family. She has two

to work.''

the family would not have enough money to support the children. Ms.
Okidi, a former secretary, said she had recently started a small

AN ENDANGERED LIST OF BACHELORS GOES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Susie Carter divorced her husband four years ago because he
was unhappy about how much time she was spending at work, she knew
what she should do next. She put him on the cover of her magazine,
Alaska Men, whose mission is to advertise the state's plentiful
supply of bachelors to eager, spouse-seeking women around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked. Soon her ex-husband was happily remarried
and living in Britain, and Ms. Carter, unfettered, was able to
direct her energies entirely into being a professional matchmaker
in print.
</P>
<P>
   Issues of Alaska Men usually feature up to 100 men who pay a
``nominal fee'' of $499 to have their picture and biography
published on a half-page. In return, ``they receive hundreds of
letters,'' Ms. Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter, whose ex-husband did not have to pay the fee,
contends that Alaska Men has brought about ``three to five
marriages'' a month, although she acknowledges that it is difficult
to keep a running count.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, the guys meet a girl and just disappear,'' she
said. ``We're the last thing on their minds after they meet their
soul mate.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, Ms. Carter's romance with her magazine is
troubled. Because of a legal battle over its control, publication
has been suspended since winter and bachelors are going unclaimed.
But thanks to the Internet, Ms. Carter has not been completely
stymied. She has set up a World Wide Web site for the magazine and
hopes to resume publication soon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the single fathers she met while she operated a day-care
center in her home that piqued Ms. Carter's interest in starting
the magazine. Many of them, she said, seemed as if they could
benefit from the companionship and support of women.
</P>
<P>
   But women are in somewhat short supply in Alaska, making up only
48 percent of the population, vs. 51 percent nationwide. Moreover,
at least anecdotal evidence suggests that single men far outnumber
single women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter is eager to get back to the business of promoting her
local bachelors in print, sounding responsible for their fate _ as
well as that of the brides-to-be. ``I get mail from women in
communist China,'' she said. ``In Japan, they've done three
television shows. We fly men to Germany _ three of the guys found
mates there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter describes Alaska Men as ``not a huge moneymaker, but
a labor of love.'' She said the magazine, which she started in her
kitchen in 1987, had built up a subscriber base of 25,000, with a
$5.95 cover price. Last year, the magazine signed an agreement with
Media Mix Marketing of Hollywood to take charge of its business and
marketing side. But Media Mix then moved to take control of the
editorial content as well, filing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage didn't work,'' said Terry Gross, the magazine's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carter, 55, filed a countersuit and argues that Media Mix
would have changed the magazine radically. ``They wanted to glitz
it up so it's more like Cosmopolitan, with model-type guys,'' she
said. ``They don't want rough-looking guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality, she said, is what her readers have come to expect.
``Women want to know what their husbands look like,'' she said.
``Sometimes they're short and fat and wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Media Mix would not comment on the litigation,
but Gross said he hoped a settlement could be reached soon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though the dispute has stalled production of the magazine, a
quarterly, a new issue is stuck in a warehouse while Ms. Carter
tries to raise cash to distribute it. Among her businesses is a
``900'' telephone number that enables readers to hear the
bachelors' voices and to leave messages.
</P>
<P>
   Her foray onto the Web has provided Ms. Carter with a way to
keep Alaska Men, and the men of Alaska, in the spotlight. Though
her matchmaking potential has been limited by the legal dispute,
she herself managed to be brushed by love while interviewing
candidates to serve as Webmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and it was love at first sight,'' she said of
Patrick Smutz, who is now both the magazine's Web expert and her
fiance. ``I saw this man and thought, `What a hunk.' I don't think
that very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic publishing has opened new possibilities for Ms.
Carter, who said that once the print magazine came back, ``we'll
probably be doing both.'' Already, she has added a section called
``Alaska Women.''
</P>
<P>
   Though dismayed by the legal battle, she is still committed to
one prevailing maxim: ``Women all over the world want to find
men.'' All the better, she feels, if they find them in Alaska.

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small start-up company in Connecticut has been awarded a broad
patent that appears to protect not just the virtual nuts and bolts
of its electronic commerce system, but also its entire business
model for buying and selling goods and services on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Priceline.com LLC of Stamford, best known for
allowing consumers to ``name your own price'' for airline tickets,
said it would be issued U.S. patent No. 5,794,207 on Monday for
both the method and the use of ``buyer-driven commerce'' from the
Patent and Trademark Office. Priceline in effect convinced the
Patent Office that it had invented a new way of doing business, one
that was fundamentally different from any other form of electronic
commerce today.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's ``reverse auction'' method is such a narrowly
specific approach to online business that analysts said few other
Internet commerce companies were likely to be significantly
restricted by the patent. But the Patent Office's growing
willingness to protect an entire Internet business model _ and not
just the technical wrinkles _ could set a precedent with
far-reaching implications for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet-related business patents are extremely important,''
said Carl Oppedahl, an intellectual property lawyer in Frisco,
Colo. He cited the continuing case of E-Data, a New Jersey business
that is suing more than a dozen companies over its patent claims to
control fundamental aspects of electronic commerce. Depending on
the outcome of the E-Data case, Oppedahl said, ``Microsoft levels
of money either will or will not change hands, and there are likely
to be other Internet-business-method patent lawsuits with similarly
high stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Several computer-related business-method patents have been
upheld by the courts in the last decade. But the Priceline patent
is one of the first awarded since the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia affirmed last month that a ``practical
application of a mathematical algorithm, formula or calculation''
could be protected.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Priceline's patent could touch off a race to control
the underlying framework of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the Priceline system, consumers submit a bid, known as a
``conditional purchase offer,'' to buy goods or services _ airline
tickets or automobiles, for example _ from unknown sellers at a
certain price, and they guarantee the offer with a credit card.
Priceline presents the offers to the sellers, who then have the
option of either fulfilling or rejecting the bids, or making a
counteroffer. Priceline then completes the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a buyer might wish to buy two airplane tickets from
New York to Seattle. He or she would set conditions: the flight
must be on a major airline on a certain date, allowing one change
of planes if the layover is no more than two hours, and the price
per ticket can be no more than $300. Any airlines that participate
in the Priceline system can review the offers, and the first one
that responds, meeting all the conditions, gets the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Whinston, director of the Center for Research in
Electronic Commerce at the University of Texas at Austin, said that
from a traditional economic perspective, the Priceline business
model was hardly radical. It seems very similar to the method by
which a government agency or a corporation puts out specifications
and conditional purchase orders to multiple contractors or vendors,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Priceline's use of cryptography and other networking
technologies, what appears to be new and original, said Whinston,
is that by using computers and the Internet, the company is able to
bring this method of buyer-driven commerce to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it has one buyer and multiple sellers, it is a mirror
image of Internet auction companies like Onsale.com, in which you
have one seller and multiple buyers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline officials said that the patent would also cover the
``apparatus'' the company developed to authenticate customers'
identities and verify their ability to pay, to protect the
anonymity and privacy of both buyer and seller, to enable sellers
to browse the list of offers, and to complete the pact
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Although Priceline does almost all its business on the World
Wide Web, company officials noted that its buyer-driven method
could also be carried out through electronic mail, voice mail or
fax.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline said last week that it had received $20 million in
private financing from the venture capital firm General Atlantic
Partners. The investors expect revenue from Priceline's business
operations, but the real potential payoff will come from the
licensing of its methods to other electronic commerce companies,
said Jay Walker, Priceline's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priceline is really entering into an exciting space, one that
I know many other large organizations, notably Microsoft, have also
looked at,'' said Kenneth Smith, director of online retailing
research at Mainspring, a Boston-based consulting company. ``My
assumption is they will be challenged on this patent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Smith and other analysts noted, however, that the Priceline
model was very likely to appeal to a relatively small niche of
buyers who know the exact specifications and reasonable prices for
the product or service they want.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers must be willing to fly at unpopular times, for
example, and give up their choice of airline and perks like
frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline asserts that it has sold 40,000 airline tickets to
leisure travelers in its three months of operation, despite the
fact that only a handful of domestic airlines now participate in
the system. Even so, the airline industry reports that the average
number of seats that fly away empty every day is about 500,000.
Walker said that there was untapped demand for those seats at the
right price.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently broadened its offerings to include new
cars, but the participating car dealers are limited for now to the
New York area.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Priceline would soon expand its online products to
include hotel rooms, automobile financing, credit cards, personal
computers, home mortgages, life insurance, rental cars, cruise ship
vacations and other services.
</P>
<P>
   James McQuivey, who analyses online retail strategies for
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., described Priceline's broad
strategy as ``brilliant'' but said that its success would depend on
the selection of goods that are offered. ``There's really no
incentive for the airlines to play,'' he said, because all the
seats are managed by relatively few sellers. ``In the car business,
though, power is diffused through more than 20,000 dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith of Mainspring was also sanguine about Priceline's patent.
``I think they have a real chance,'' he said. ``More so than in any
other industry, the Internet allows a new and interesting business
a chance to deliver value into the marketplace. At the same time,
it can quickly deliver the message from the market if the value
proposition is either not wanted or not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, you get a chance, but you find out very
quickly if you're going to be a failure.''

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The world's two largest digital cellular
phone companies and a Japanese microelectronics giant plan to
announce on Monday separate deals with a three-year-old Silicon
Valley start-up to produce global positioning system chips
inexpensive enough to be installed in cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia of Finland will announce a $3 million investment in the
start-up, Sirf Technology Inc., while both Ericsson of Sweden and
Hitachi will announce partnerships to develop global positioning
systems, or GPS, for consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   GPS devices use signals from satellites to pinpoint a location
anywhere on the globe. The technology was developed by the Pentagon
and first made its way into civilian use in specialized
navigational systems for ships and airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The new backing for Sirf, a relatively unknown company, is the
strongest signal to date that GPS technology will increasingly
become part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Start-ups like Sirf are being joined by established contenders
like Trimble Navigation in rapidly adapting global positioning
technology for a wide range of consumer electronics gadgets as well
as for virtually any movable object, whether automobiles or
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will put this technology in our products beginning as early
as the year 2000,'' said Daryl Toor, an Ericsson executive. ``Our
vision is that increasingly, a small portable phone will be your
gateway to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of portable wireless electronic devices and the
World Wide Web may soon make it conceivable for consumers to type
questions like ``Where is the nearest pizza parlor?'' into
hand-held devices and receive an answer in text or even from a
robotic voice.
</P>
<P>
   By licensing its technology to consumer electronics companies
and chip makers, Sirf is hoping it will be able to transform the
GPS industry, which until now has been built around different
proprietary systems for every company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing in Ericsson and Nokia is a huge coup for Sirf,'' said
Dale Ford, an industry analyst with Dataquest of San Jose, Calif.,
a market research firm. ``Licensing technology to semiconductor
companies could become a very large business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirf has been developing GPS technology on smaller and smaller
chips, and at the same time has been lowering the price to the
point where this technology can now be an economical component in
most consumer electronics products.
</P>
<P>
   The company's founder, Kanwar Chadha, a former Silicon Valley
executive at Intel and at the S3 Corp., describes an array of
applications for GPS technologies that go far beyond currently
available navigational devices used by sailors, pilots and hikers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when GPS receiver prices fall below $10, probably
some time early in the next century, it will be possible to use
them as security devices. Anything from a car to a computer would
know its location and could be programmed to automatically shut
itself off if it was moved illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had been looking at the really exciting GPS
applications,'' Sirf's founder said.
</P>
<P>
   By re-engineering GPS receivers based on microprocessors and
digital signal processors, the chips that enable sound in computers
and cellular phones, Sirf executives say, the company has realized
major performance improvements in the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts who have seen Sirf's prototypes said they were
more sensitive than existing products, permitting them to function
at an acceptable level in the urban canyons that have traditionally
blocked GPS signals.
</P>
<P>
   Sirf engineers recently demonstrated a prototype device that was
able to begin reporting location information almost instantly and
could continue to communicate with orbiting satellites from the
basement of a one-story parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Current GPS systems usually require a number of minutes to start
delivering location information and fail when they are blocked by
buildings or trees.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology also has privacy and security implications,
in part because the Federal Communications Commission has required
that cellular phones be able to provide position information to
within 125 meters, or roughly 400 feet, by 2001 so they can be
located when placing 911 emergency calls.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are now two contending technologies competing to meet the
FCC requirement. One, developed by companies like True Position
Inc., uses complex software to locate cell phones by a
triangulation method based on measuring the difference in arrival
times of signals received by different network antennas.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the GPS receivers provide location information
based on measuring the differences in arrival time from a
constellation of Air Force satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Both systems have strengths and weaknesses _ and different
implications for privacy. For example, while the network method may
prove superior in some urban areas, the GPS systems will be more
reliable in rural regions.
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy advocates prefer the GPS systems, which they argue
give the user control in deciding whether or not to transmit
location information.
</P>
<P>
   Using a triangulation system, the phone company could determine
the user's location any time the phone was turned on.
</P>
<P>
   This difference has become more important in recent months
because the FBI has indicated that it expects cellular telephone
companies to make location information available to law-enforcement
agencies.

SPORTS COLUMN: NEW GUY IN THE FRATERNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He has been around the game all his life, and he has
heard the stories about the biting and the gouging and the
blustering that can take place in the middle of the scrum.
</P>
<P>
   To Peyton Manning's surprise, he was greeted more civilly than
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Sam Adams telling me his dad said to say hello,''
Manning recalled after his first social engagement in the National
Football League, the son of a former New Orleans lineman, Sam Adams
Sr., chatting with the son of the former New Orleans quarterback,
Archie Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cortez Kennedy and I have a mutual friend, and we were
discussing that,'' Manning continued. ``Better than it could have
been. I'm sure that's because it was a preseason game.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right about that. The two grizzled Seattle defensive
tackles _ well, they're all grizzled, aren't they? _ could have
threatened him with what they would do to him when they got their
hands (and knees, and cleats, and elbows) on him.
</P>
<P>
   They did not need to issue any warnings. Peyton Manning knows.
He watched his dad get tossed around the fields, real and ersatz,
during Archie's long and frustrating career, and now the son is
also a professional, with the Indianapolis Colts. Peyton Manning
made his debut Saturday night in the test-tube atmosphere of an
exhibition loss, 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   His first pass went for a 48-yard touchdown to Marvin Harrison,
but Manning knew there would be tough times ahead, and they arrived
almost immediately. He let a ball slither out of his fingers for a
fumble, he tossed an interception in traffic, and he never produced
another score in his prescribed 30 minutes of work.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to grade his own performance, Manning smiled and said: ``I
never do that. I'm sure you guys will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. This was a workout, a trial test, no grades
necessary. But Manning proved he had the arm, the head and the
poise of a professional quarterback, to go with the pedigree and
the $48 million contract for six years.
</P>
<P>
   He carries so many labels. In college he was known for his
inquisitive mind, his long hours in the film room. He then became
known as the strange dude who passed up a huge contract after his
junior season at the University of Tennessee. There were
insinuations that he was ducking the upgraded challenges of pro
ball, but as a loyal son of the South, Manning had one more year in
almost idyllic surroundings that he could never replicate, and
what's wrong with that? He could even live with a predominantly
defensive player, Charles Woodson of Michigan, winning the Heisman
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``His senior season, all he could do was fail,'' said his new
coach, Jim Mora, with an ironic tone. ``But he handled that well.
Being a rookie pro quarterback is never easy, but he'll handle that
well, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning knows people will be watching him _ and nobody more than
the other Colts in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very poised,'' said Jay Leeuwenburg, one of those
relatively stable shaven-headed 290-pound brutes that reside on
every offensive line. ``You need that in a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got confidence,'' said Jerome Pathon, a rookie from the
University of Washington who was paired with Manning on several
pass routes. ``It soothes you. When you go into the huddle, if you
see a quarterback with a wild look in his eyes, it kind of
unsettles you. But he's got a great attitude, and you feed off
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning's first four plays were straight handoffs to Marshall
Faulk, his best running back. Then he flicked a short line drive on
the right side to Harrison, who burst past Shawn Springs, the
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in a zone blitz,'' Manning said. ``Springs was
trying to be aggressive, and Marvin put a good move on him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' defender, Fred Thomas, said there was more to it
than that. He saw Manning pick up the blitz in an instant and react
with the correct pass, on his fifth professional play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He read the defense perfectly,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   It went downhill from there, by all accounts. Manning said he
made the right read on an interception but threw the ball badly. He
said the fumble was ``a freak thing,'' the ball just slipped out of
his fingers as he went back to pass. The statistics were all right
_ 8 of 15, 113 yards _ but Mora said the first half ``was pretty
ugly out there,'' and Manning agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected that,'' Manning said. ``I know pro ball is faster,
more complex, better athletes, big time players, but I'm not in awe
of it. That just makes you better.''
</P>
<P>
   Some quarterbacks struggle more than others. Jon Kitna, still
trying to overcome his Central Washington Division II label, moved
a talented team in the first half, and then had to field questions
about what will happen if and when the Seahawks re-sign 41-year-old
Warren Moon this week.
</P>
<P>
   With Peyton Manning, it is more than the top draft choice and
the money. The other players know all about him. This is not to say
there won't be painful moments in the middle of a scrum, but on
Saturday night, there was the definite sense of watching the first
step in what could be called a career.

DUBIOUS DATA ON SAVINGS AREN'T WORTH WORRYING ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: If the news that America's savings rate hit a record
low recently stimulated your caring glands, you're misallocating
your anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   It has become fashionable to fret about America's grasshopper
tendencies even as the ants get the worst of it. It could be argued
convincingly, in fact, that the transformation of the erstwhile
Asian dynamos into zombies was caused by too much savings. Those
economies ended up with more savings than could be used
efficiently, which led those running the financial system to
channel the excess into wasteful investments.
</P>
<P>
   This is always the problem. Savings may be the raw material of
investment, but unless the resources are allocated to the highest
and best use, savings won't translate into prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans persist in beating themselves up because the
national savings rate isn't higher, it's quite possible the savings
rate has, for the time being at least, outlived its usefulness as
an economic statistic.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy is driven by personal consumption, which fuels
two-thirds of the country's growth. In Japan, the comparable figure
is almost 10 percent lower. This helps explain why Japan's economy
is sputtering while America's is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is caught in what some economists might call a liquidity
trap. Bankers call it pushing on a string. Japan's policy-makers
seek more consumption to stimulate growth and design policy to
encourage consumer spending. Japanese fears about the economic
future, however, prompt more savings and less consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Would America want to trade its anemic savings problem for
Japan's inadequate consumption problem? Probably not, given the
realities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is good reason to doubt the validity of the
savings statistic. The level of mutual fund assets recently topped
$5 trillion, an increase of nearly 1,700 percent over the last 16
years. Smart Money recently noted that employer-sponsored 401(k)
plans, which weren't widely available when the decade began, now
are used by 25 million workers who are sitting atop some $1
trillion worth of 401(k) investments.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of statistics wouldn't seem to reflect any serious
lack of interest in saving for a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of statistical cognitive dissonance, a number in
the most recent savings story didn't compute at all. The article
quoted a Federal Reserve estimate that nearly 60 percent of all
families don't own stock, which means they haven't benefited from
the bull market of the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Without disputing the numbers outright, it's probably a
reasonable guess that a significant number of these families
include workers whose pension funds are substantially invested in
stocks. If so, it means these workers probably feel less pressure
to save for their retirement and thus are more active consumers
than otherwise would be the case. As consumers, of course, they
help generate the economic growth that has been a key factor in the
stock market surge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Social Security money each month transfers money from
a generation that might save it to a generation that almost
certainly will spend it. The generation providing the money thus
feels less need to save because of the expectation that Social
Security also will supplement their needs when they become elderly.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is worrisome, perhaps, but the result so far is an
economy that serves society's needs better than any other in the
world.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ in the future.
</P>
<P>
   - G. Thomas Van Bebber, chief district judge for Kansas,
disclosed that he wrongly reported that his wife closed an
individual retirement account worth up to $15,000 in October 1996.
The account at New York Life Insurance Co. remains open.
</P>
<P>
   Van Bebber also disclosed for the first time that in 1996 he and
his wife invested in a Glenbrook Life mutual fund worth as much as
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Van Bebber called the omissions an accident.
</P>
<P>
   - Judge Kathryn Vratil of Kansas City, Kan., disclosed that in
her 1996 report she failed to list stock worth up to $15,000 in
Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. The investment was made on behalf of
her children, she said, and is controlled by her ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   Vratil described the oversight as unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   - Judge Nanette Laughrey of Kansas City reported that in
previous years she inadvertently omitted an outstanding loan to her
husband and an unpaid medical bill, totaling up to $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   - Judge Ortrie D. Smith of Kansas City disclosed that in 1996 he
sold his interest in a Colonial mutual fund worth up to $50,000 and
redeemed another investment worth up to $15,000. He called the
omission an accident.
</P>
<P>
   - Judge Gary A. Fenner of Kansas City sent a letter to court
officials reporting that in 1996 he failed to report that he
collected cash from a bond trust on four occasions. He said he left
out the distributions, worth up to $15,000, because of an
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   - At least three judges, all from western Pennsylvania,
disclosed that in earlier reports they left out stock and bond
investments or failed to disclose financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Some judges' reports left important questions unanswered. For
example, Judge Michael Hogan of Oregon disclosed that he receives
17 percent of capital gains and dividends accrued by the Hogan
Family Partnership. Yet he did not disclose which stocks the
partnership owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, what I've done is acceptable,'' Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most striking information in the new reports comes
on their final pages. That is where the judges attested that they
performed no judicial function in any lawsuit in which they had a
financial interest.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the judges signed the certification but then appended
statements showing that they had, indeed, run afoul of the conflict
laws. In previous years none of the reports reviewed by The Star
included such a statement _ even reports from judges who had
violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty, who threw out the American Express lawsuit, included a
note in his 1998 report that explained the conflict. He also
altered the standard certification from ``I did not ... '' to read
``I do not believe I'' violated an ethical canon.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gustave Diamond of Pittsburgh disclosed that since 1995 he
had presided over four lawsuits in which his wife owned stock in a
litigant. He said the conflicts ``escaped detection'' until
identified by The Star.
</P>
<P>
   Judge H. Dean Whipple of Kansas City reported that he issued an
injunction and other orders in a lawsuit involving a brewery and
only later realized he owned stock in one litigant's parent.
Whipple sold the stock before taking further action in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Judge D. Brook Bartlett signed the certification
without comment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet records show that Bartlett last year presided over a lawsuit
against the Stryker Sales Corp. Bartlett's report shows he owns
stock worth up to $15,000 in the company's parent, the Stryker
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, chief district judge for Western Missouri, said in an
interview he was astounded that he overlooked the conflict. He
stressed that no one opposed any of his orders but added that he
was not making excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly my fault,'' Bartlett said. ``I had not the
foggiest idea about it.''

HOW TO AVOID `CULTURE' SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Here's the scenario: You have a job offer.
You're trying to figure out what the place is really like. You know
you're supposed to get a grip on its ``culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Great advice. How do you do it?
</P>
<P>
   Tried-and-true tips tell you to walk around the job site, talk
to current and former employees, talk to competitors, clients and
suppliers. Ask them what it's like to work there. Try to feel the
vibes the place emits.
</P>
<P>
   Such research isn't scientific, but it's a start.
</P>
<P>
   You also might consider asking specific questions suggested by
Mary Marren Heideman, a Kansas City executive search consultant.
Heideman works mostly with higher-priced-spread executives, but any
or all of her questions could be adapted when you're trying to
decide whether the job offer will be a good fit for you.
</P>
<P>
   Heideman suggests asking:
</P>
<P>
   - What are the three most important categories on the
organization's performance evaluations?
</P>
<P>
   - Can you describe someone who was recently promoted and tell me
why that person was promoted?
</P>
<P>
   - Who is your organization's competition and what does the
competition do better or worse than you?
</P>
<P>
   - Who held this job previously and where is that person now?
</P>
<P>
   - What do you know about the organization now that you didn't
when you joined it?
</P>
<P>
   Ask those questions of your prospective boss, your interviewer
and a range of potential co-workers and you'll get a library's
worth of insight into the organization's culture.
</P>
<P>
   That insight will help you decide whether to accept or reject
the job offer. If, for example, you believe you do your best work
alone, but everyone says teamwork is one of the most important
performance appraisal categories, you may detect a faulty fit and
escape a costly mistake.

   UNDATED: Our home for the first six months of marriage was a
rented cottage well beyond the city's edge.
</P>
<P>
   The property was bounded on one side by a railroad track, and on
two others by meadows where quail whistled and the rank grass was
interlaced with rabbits' runways.
</P>
<P>
   An interstate highway passed by a quarter mile to the east, but
it was screened by trees, out of sight and almost out of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   That was the road my new bride and I both took to our work in
town. It was a trip of 25 minutes or a bit more at rush hour. We
complained about the time it took, and about beginning and ending
our days with that hectic drive.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, however, is that the volume of traffic the highway
carried was not so great. Neither was the hazard. Drivers behaved
civilly then, and the term road rage had not even yet been coined.
</P>
<P>
   A morning errand the other day took me past that place where we
once lived.
</P>
<P>
   The open fields are gone _ that whole area having become, in
effect, an immense industrial park. The great undistinguished
buildings have a mechanical and inhuman aspect. And that is only
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   For far out past that sprawls the residential development _
treeless subdivisions to the horizon and beyond. More highways have
been built, all interconnecting, to carry the automobiles of the
grim legions who make their twice-daily passages from and to the
cookie-cutter warrens of exurbia.
</P>
<P>
   It had occurred to me to notice my watch, so that I might
compare the time of travel with the trips of that earlier year.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of fever and fury on the road. Cars weaved in
and out, changing lanes like shuttles in a loom. Horns blared. A
man went past me with his face set in a scowl, jaw thrust out,
gripping the wheel like someone choking snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the drivers were chatting on their car phones. Others
were applying lipstick or eye shadow. All this while the flow of
traffic proceeded practically bumper to bumper, sometimes at a
crawl, sometimes a full 15 miles an hour over the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   And that journey that formerly had taken 25 minutes, sometimes
less, now required a bit over 40 minutes. Meantime, at the sides,
road construction crews were at work, slicing off a part of the
hillside to make room for more lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Our home is in the city now. In the rush hour, I need 15 minutes
to get to the office. Other times of the day, I can make it in 10.
</P>
<P>
   I realized in that moment, as I was borne along in the careening
mob, that nothing under heaven could persuade me to live as those
people live. And I also received what I believe to be a powerful,
if not very original, insight.
</P>
<P>
   It is that the very machine which has destroyed the cities _ the
automobile _ may in the end turn out, ironically, to be their
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The time must eventually come when there will be no place left
to lay new pavement. The numbers of vehicles, expanding
exponentially, will overwhelm the road builders.
</P>
<P>
   As traffic of outlying areas degenerates toward gridlock, the
danger and the fury will become intolerable and unmanageable. And
it will occur to the exurbanites, as it has to me, that no one
should have to live that way.
</P>
<P>
   The flow to the outermost edges will be reversed. People will
look once more to the place they left, the center, and with their
return will come new vitality.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the farthest suburbs could stand empty. A hot wind will
blow across that asphalt desert, as if it were some abandoned
station on the planet Mars.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that may not ever actually happen. But as Brett Ashley
says in the final line, ``Isn't it pretty to think so?''

JUDGES DON'T ALWAYS INCLUDE ALL ASSETS ON FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE STEPHENS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Revelations that federal judges routinely
violate ethics laws have the judiciary working to make their
financial disclosure reports more available. But that may not solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Newly released reports show that judges often leave key assets
off the statements. That makes it impossible to identify conflicts
of interest _ no matter how easy it is to get the reports.
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas City Star review of 1998 reports filed by 33 judges in
four states shows one-third include information that, by law, they
should have disclosed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Several judges belatedly reveal stock holdings. One discloses a
loan for the first time. Others report old investments in bonds and
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   In three instances the belated disclosures show that judges
presided over lawsuits against companies in which they had a
financial interest.
</P>
<P>
   Why the new openness? Several judges acknowledged making their
reports more comprehensive this year as a result of increased
scrutiny of their finances.
</P>
<P>
   In April, The Star used reports from earlier years to show that
federal judges presided over dozens of lawsuits against companies
in which they owned stock, despite laws forbidding such conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the articles, Congress has been pushing for wider
distribution of the disclosure reports to help the public identify
conflicts. Judicial officials have proposed reforms, too.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, has tried to determine the accuracy of the
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law makes it a crime for a judge to deliberately leave
information off the statements. Yet experts say they are unaware of
a judge ever being prosecuted for a reporting lapse.
</P>
<P>
   The judges say they are just forgetful. Judge Ancer Haggerty of
Oregon, for example, said that for years he simply did not remember
to report up to $65,000 worth of investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said judges would never accept such excuses from
defendants in their courtrooms. They say judges' financial reports
should be as accurate as those they file with the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is really no excuse for not filling them out
completely,'' said Stephen Gillers, a judicial ethicist at New York
University. ``The disclosure forms are intended to let the public,
litigants and the bar know the full financial interests of the
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts mailed
out 1,800 letters to federal judges, questioning discrepancies and
offering help with the forms. But a spokesman pointed out that if a
judge never lists a stock holding, the office has no way of knowing
something is amiss.
</P>
<P>
   The Star found the missing investments by reviewing the new
disclosure forms filed by federal district judges in four cities:
Kansas City; Kansas City, Kan.; Pittsburgh; and Portland, Ore. The
cities, each in a different judicial circuit, were selected to
provide a core sample of judges nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the just-released reports, which cover calendar year
1997, include notes revealing the previous omissions. In other
cases the newspaper identified the omissions only by comparing the
new reports with those from earlier years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   - For years Judge Fernando J. Gaitan Jr. reported owning stock
in just one corporation, AT&AMP;T. Shortly after the newspaper series,
however, the Kansas City judge amended his latest filing to show he
also owned stock in six additional telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gaitan said in a letter to The Star that he never realized he
had to report the stock until he read the newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he believed, but was not sure, that he received
stock in the Baby Bell companies when they separated from AT&AMP;T _
which AT&AMP;T said occurred in 1984. He called the amounts
insubstantial; his report identifies them each as worth up to
$15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always treated them as one, AT&AMP;T,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Gaitan issued eight court orders in a $10 million
lawsuit against a subsidiary of one of the companies, U.S. West
Inc. At the time, Gaitan explained, he did not realize he was a
U.S. West shareholder and he did not know federal law required him
to withdraw if he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my rulings were perfunctory,'' Gaitan wrote. ``And
ultimately the case was transferred to yet another judge.''
</P>
<P>
   - The Star series questioned whether Haggerty had fully
disclosed his assets. At the time Haggerty declined to be
interviewed or to clarify his investments.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after publication, however, Haggerty wrote to court
officials to disclose for the first time that he owned stock in
American Express Co. and held an American Funds mutual fund.
Together the investments were worth $15,000 to $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty acknowledged in an interview that he presided over a
lawsuit against an American Express subsidiary last year and that
he eventually threw the case out of court. He said the
``disjointed'' lawsuit made no actual claims against the company
and told court administrators he did not know if his actions
violated ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
   - Judge Donetta Ambrose of Pittsburgh disclosed to court
officials for the first time that her husband co-owned an interest
in Mellon Bank in 1995 and 1996. In that time Ambrose presided over
a million-dollar racketeering lawsuit that named Mellon Bank as a
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose said she was unaware of the conflict until questioned by
The Star, and she vowed to make fuller disclosure in the future.

REUNION OF LONGS BRING LOVING TALES OF HUEY AND EARL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNFIELD, La. _ The stories of politics and pig hunts are a
little worn from use here in the birthplace of brothers Huey and
Earl Long, a bit like the final line of an oft-told fairy tale that
a child shouts out even before the reader is finished. No one knows
those stories better than family, and as about 50 Long relatives
gathered Saturday for an old-fashioned family reunion, the people
who hold tiny pieces of that legacy fitted them together to form
legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the name Long was like a magic word,'' said Floyd H.
Long, a distant cousin, born here in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Huey Long, the governor and U.S. senator who was assassinated in
the hallway of the state capitol he built, and Earl, who was
governor three times and died soon after he was elected to
Congress, were imperfect men _ Earl wore a big button that said
``I'm Not Crazy,'' after time in a mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But here, people with the same name as these two famous and
sometimes infamous Louisiana politicians swapped tales tempered by
familial love, and stroked their memories like an old dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite story is one everyone knows, about how Huey tried
to impress the Catholics,'' said a distant cousin, Huey P. Long,
who was born here in 1929. ``How on Sundays, he would say he
carried his Irish Catholic mother to church in a wagon, then later
came back for his father,'' to take him to Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people didn't believe him, and asked him if it was true.
And he said straight-out, `Hell, no, we don't even have a wagon.'''
</P>
<P>
   Huey Long, the demagogue who dreamed of being president but
endeared himself to generations of Louisianians with a colossal
personality, paved roads and free textbooks, died in 1935. Earl
Long, a beloved but vexing man who kept company with a stripper,
died in 1960. But to say either one is gone would be inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame, where
family members gathered and some Long memorabilia was auctioned,
figures in the likenesses of Huey and Earl glare down from podiums.
Huey, his dark hair parted in the middle like the tenor in a
barbershop quartet, is jabbing his finger into the air, like he
jabbed it into the faces and probably even the dreams of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Earl is just Earl, kindly looking and only a little wild-eyed,
holding a straw hat.
</P>
<P>
   That might be fitting. Historians, scholars and relatives agree.
People feared Huey, and loved Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy D. Long, who has served his district in central Louisiana
for three decades in the Louisiana House of Representatives, tells
of the time Earl lost his entire campaign war chest while hunting
for wild pig outside Winnfield around 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Earl had placed in a folded newspaper an envelope containing
$100,000 and put it in his pocket before the hunt, Jimmy Long said.
After hunting pigs all day on horseback with several of his
cronies, Earl got back to the farm to discover that the money was
gone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earl assumed one of them had stolen it. He called in his friend
B.J. (Sixty) Rayburn and told him he was going to line the cronies
up and search them, but did not want Sixty _ no one at the reunion
was sure how he got that name _ to be offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you didn't take it,'' Earl told him.
</P>
<P>
   When he did not find the money on his friends, he ordered them
all up early the next morning to search. They found it on the
ground, still rolled in newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the stories told here this weekend were about Earl, who
was elected governor in 1939, 1948 and again in 1958. He outlived
Huey by three decades, so naturally memories of him have faded less
with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always wanted home-smoked pork,'' said Vera Long Wells, 82,
whose father was a first cousin of Earl and Huey.
</P>
<P>
   But it also seems as if the relatives enjoyed talking about him
more, because he seemed more a part of Winnfield and less a part of
the Baton Rouge political scene. They were protective of his mental
health history _ he once was held, in his later years, in a mental
institution, but relatives said his erratic behavior might have
been caused by several small strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Baxter, who, as former head of the state Department of
Hospitals, oversaw the hospital that held Earl, was the guest
speaker at the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Earl was the best governor Louisiana ever had,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But after being slow to rule that Earl was sane, Baxter was
fired by the state's Lieutenant Governor.
</P>
<P>
   When Earl died, ``it was the only time I saw my daddy cry,''
said Carroll Long, a third cousin.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers Earl's last political moment in 1960. At 65, thin
and ill, he had just been elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Long recalls seeing him stand at the lectern, gripping
the microphone stand, to keep from falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see the light through his arms,'' where the flesh
hung loose on his bones, Carroll Long said. ``It was almost like he
just refused to die until he won one more race.''
</P>
<P>
   He died 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   Huey, called the Kingfish and who preached a sort of
share-the-wealth socialism as he played golf, chased women and
sometimes reputedly misplaced state money, was elected governor in
1928, then moved on to the Senate in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   At 42, he was poised to challenge Franklin D. Roosevelt for the
White House when a Louisiana doctor mortally wounded him in the
state capitol in September 1935. Bodyguards shot the assassin, Dr.
Carl Weiss, 61 times.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, Julius, once wrote that Huey ``had no sense
of family.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one of his biographers, T. Harry Williams, in
``Huey Long,'' (Knopf, 1969) Huey once said: ``I'd like to get as
far away from my damn kinfolks as I could. This state is full of
sapsucker, hillbilly and Cajun relatives of mine, and there ain't
enough dignity in the bunch to keep a chigger still long enough to
brush his hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Other relatives say Huey loved his family, and liked coming
home. He genuinely loved the poor people who put him in office,
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and father thought everything of Huey in our home,''
said Floyd Long. He recalls that when Floyd was a member of a
1,200-member cadet corps at Louisiana State University in the early
years of the Depression, Huey would often pay hundreds of $10 train
fares so poorer cadets could see football games in other parts of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can debate Huey's motive,'' said Carroll Long. But the
fact is ``he was helping people.'' Earl did the same, he said, and
that is why there is such pride in the family name.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many of the surviving members of the extended Long family remain
dazzled by a brief encounter with one of the brothers. Kenny Long
remembers standing in his grandmother's front yard, awed as Earl
arrived in a black stretch limousine and handed out watermelons
from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like meeting the president or something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives have what so many others want, a part of that
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, people still talk about the time they met Huey
Long, said Huey P. Long, the cousin. ``A lot of people say they
knew him, but he was dead before most of them were born.''

</P>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ If the Dream Team had been here, Rudy
Tomjanovich would have gone home with a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dream Team had been here _ Grant Hill, Gary Payton, Tim
Hardaway and the rest of the big-name NBA stars _ the outcome would
have been a foregone conclusion. The United States would have won
by 20, 30 or 40 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dream Team had been here, the only questions would have
been who among them would cause the first international incident
and whether Nike, Reebok or Adidas won the sneaker wars.
</P>
<P>
   The World Championship of Basketball ended with Yugoslavia
edging Russia 64-62 for the gold medal and Rudy T's American
Dreamers whipping Greece 84-61 for a third-place finish, which was
anything but a bronze bust.
</P>
<P>
   The night after they lost a stunner to Russia in the semifinals,
blowing a 10-point lead, the Dreamers were reeling from the
emotional blow. Yet in the fragile hours when it still hurt like an
open wound, they were beginning to look at the overall picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the greatest basketball experience of my life,'' said
David Wood, 33, who has played for 13 pro teams and eight NBA
franchises. ``It was an honor to play for my country. I never knew
what it was like to be an Olympic athlete, and now I do. This will
always be very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition was genuine
</P>
<P>
   It was special because of the circumstances that brought them
together for a 4{-week whirlwind tour through four countries as
this disparate group of European exiles, Continental Basketball
Association lifers and one college star stepped into the breach
left by the Dream Team's absence.
</P>
<P>
   It was a question that dogged their every step, a shadow they
could never hope to outrun: Wouldn't the Dream Team have done
better?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it would have. But that is not to say it would have
been a better experience for those involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Dream Team, the talent level, of course, would have
been overwhelming,'' Tomjanovich said. ``With that team, you're
talking about detail work, getting plays just right, trying to do
this and that and, at the same time, entertain everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost a no-win situation. If you win by 15 or 20,
people want to know why it wasn't 25 or 30. In spite of the
disappointment, in a lot of ways, this felt more satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the point. It was more satisfying seeing a committed
coaching staff take mediocre-but-devoted players from the depths of
America's basketball talent and mold them into a team that became a
legitimate threat to win the title.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T's staff fought the odds of playing against veteran
national teams that have been together for years and a deck that
was stacked against them. First, the NBA stars abandoned them.
Then, some of the bottom-dwelling life forms known as player agents
sabotaged their effort, persuading experienced former NBA players _
i.e., Byron Scott and Dominique Wilkins _ to pass on invitations as
a show of support for the union.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what did U.S. fans miss without the Dream Team,
except a gold medal that would have come from overkill in place of
true competition, like using a sledgehammer to swat a mosquito?
</P>
<P>
   Testament to Rudy T
</P>
<P>
   In order to feel ahead of the rest of the world hoopswise, must
we always gas up the Enola Gay for another bombing run? Truth is,
if an air of superiority is all we're looking to get out of these
affairs, we can feel smug having scared the bejabbers out of the
tournament field with a roster that included none of America's
roughly top 500 players.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, this was big. The job he did under these circumstances makes
Rudy T the front-runner to be the U.S. Olympic coach at Sydney in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamers always will remember the last three minutes against
Russia, the misplays, the bad calls. It's a fact of life at this
level. This is a different, quicker, more partisan, and in some
ways, better game than the NBA. No dancing girls, mascots, blaring
music or whoring for the corporate dollar with a promotion during
each timeout. It is just basketball with national flags, chanting
and thick cigarette smoke. Also, offenses are always on the attack,
even if not as skilled.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamers played hard, running their legs and not their
mouths. There was none of the trash-talking or crotch-grabbing
demonstrated by Derrick Coleman and Larry Johnson in 1994. There
was little ego, certainly none of the Dream Team conceit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys got as much out of what they have as any team I've
ever been around,'' Rudy T said.
</P>
<P>
   No gold. Just an experience to be bronzed.

 &HT;    Third of nation flirts with poverty, census study finds
 &HT;    By Scott Shepard
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poverty in the United States may be more of a
revolving door than a trap door, with nearly one-third of Americans
falling into poverty for months at a time only to pull out later,
the U.S. Census Bureau reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report used seven different economic measures designed to
provide a ``video'' look at poverty instead of the more traditional
``snapshot.'' It concluded that while some Americans are mired in
chronic poverty, for most, poverty is ``a transitory condition,''
sometimes lasting no more than a couple of months in any given
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who experience poverty generally escape it within
a few months,'' said Mary Naifeh, author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Naifeh, comparing 1993 and 1994 survey data, found that 30
percent of the U.S. population was poor for at least two months,
but only 5 percent was poor continuously for the full 24-month
period. She concluded that while ``poverty rates may suggest to
some that poverty is a chronic condition, the reality is quite
different.''
</P>
<P>
   She found that 41.8 percent of Hispanics and 40.2 percent of
African Americans slipped into poverty for at least two months
during the study period, compared to 18.3 percent of whites. People
in families headed by a single female had the highest poverty rate
of any group, 48.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The average number of months spent in poverty was 4.5 over all,
with whites averaging 4.2 months; African Americans, 6 months;
Hispanics, 5 months; and single female households, 7.2 months.

<P>
   Children had the highest ``entry rate'' into poverty: 4.4
percent of those ages 0-17 who were not poor in 1993 fell into
poverty during 1994. The entry rate for those age 18-64 years was 3
percent. Among retirement-age adults, only 2 percent slipped into
poverty from one year to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Naifeh also found that 21.5 percent of central city dwellers
experienced poverty during the study period, compared to 17.5
percent of ``nonmetropolitan'' residents and only 10 percent of
those living in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The statistical poverty threshold, based on after-tax income and
the number of adults and children in a family, is adjusted each
year by the federal government. In 1993, it was $14,654 for a
two-adult, two-child family. In 1994, it was $15,029 for the same
family.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty experts cautioned that the new Census data could be
easily misinterpreted as suggesting that the United States, now in
the eighth year of unprecedented economic growth, does not have a
significant poverty problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always known that there's a lot of mixing and churning
going on,'' said Robert Haveman, an economics professor at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison and an associate of the
university's Institute for Research on Poverty. ``And the way we've
traditionally measured poverty has taken that into account.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether upward mobility is occurring any
faster now that it has in past economic periods,'' said Jared
Bernstein, an analyst at the Economic Policy Institute in
Washington. ``And every indication is that appears to be
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 15 years, the rate of people moving out of poverty
has been relatively unresponsive to the growth of the economy,
according to Bernstein. Further, in the robust economic expansion
of recent years, the national poverty rate has dropped only 1.1
percent, from 14.8 percent in 1992 to 13.7 percent in 1996, the
latest year for which complete Census data are available.

AS ELECTION NEARS, MANY IN SWEDEN LOOK TO THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden _ The waterfront palaces and baronial
shoreline buildings of this northern capital stand as hardy symbols
of Scandinavian stability, and the sailboats and tourist vessels
that glide over the gray Baltic waters leave barely a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the outward signs of sureness, continuity and calm,
Sweden is approaching its future and an election with a sense of
drift and loss and an unaccustomed confusion over what to do about
it.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, Swedes have lost their feeling of being
something exceptional, and experienced their first unemployment,
social spending scandals and a decline in competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has
reduced Sweden's per capita income standing from fourth to 15th
place in the world, ranking it behind its Scandinavian neighbors,
Denmark, Finland and Norway, as well as Ireland and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Its largest and most successful company, the telecommunications
giant Ericsson, is threatening to move its headquarters to Britain,
where it finds the business climate better. Industrialists cite
high personal income taxes and rigid labor rules as impediments to
remaining competitive globally while doing business here.
</P>
<P>
   The country that produced Gunnar Myrdal and preached racial
tolerance has now developed segregated communities in Stockholm's
suburbs for many of the 800,000 immigrants who have come here over
the last 30 years from the Middle East, Asia, South America and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Long quietly proud of their country's position as the world's
good conscience, Swedes miss being the society that attracted
admiration from afar for a nation of fewer than 9 million people
living on the chill edge of Europe. Then, they were the future, a
model of rationality, tolerance, cradle-to-grave care of citizens
and generosity to people living in less advantaged countries
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The nostalgia arises in every conversation with Swedes about
their country and has produced an election campaign in which the
most repeated claim is not a dynamic pledge to bring change but a
stolid promise to restore what was.
</P>
<P>
   ```Restore' is the key word,'' said Sigfrid Leijonhufvud, a
political and economic columnist for the Svenska Dagbladet. ``The
desire is to go back to when Sweden was one of the three or four
richest countries in the world, when we were listened to in the
United States and labor and management used to come and tour Sweden
to see how we did it and everyone looked to us for the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the renowned Middle Way that sought to provide a humane
passage between controlling totalitarianism and uncaring
capitalism, and its home was Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absurd, but we thought of ourselves as a kind of
superpower,'' said Arne Ruth, an author and former editor in chief
of Dagens Nyheter. ``We had the certainty that progress was
permanent. Now that feeling of exceptionalism has been lost, and we
are just another normal nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other normal nations, Sweden faces the new pressure of
competing in a globalized economy where progress is measured in
enterprise and productivity. Meeting that challenge may be at cross
purposes with satisfying its aging population's desire to keep huge
welfare-state subsidies intact.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative government attempts to trim its welfare costs are so
resented that officials have promised to increase spending and
abandon talk of tax cuts. ``Talking about tax cuts in this campaign
is like swearing in church,'' said Toivo Sjoren, research chief at
the Sifo opinion surveying group.
</P>
<P>
   The government spends 46 percent of Sweden's gross national
product on welfare, more than any other country, and its overall
public spending is 63 percent of gross national product. The income
taxes required to support this public munificence take 59 percent
of the pay of people earning as little as $30,000 a year and oblige
employers to pay up to 41 percent of employee remuneration into
social security and pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   While center-left parties in European countries like Britain,
the Netherlands, France and Spain have cut government subsidies and
encouraged private business, Sweden's ruling Social Democrats go
into the Sept. 20 parliamentary elections facing irresistible
demands from their aging constituents to restore what was cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are Swedes who are excited about the possibilities of
the future, but more who are scared by them, and the politicians
respect the scared part because that's where you get the votes,''
said Mats Lindgren, the chairman of the consulting firm Kairos
Future.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is sure about what the way for Sweden is anymore,''
Sjoren said. He produced study charts that held out little hope
that the country's leaders would take any decisive action.
Measuring the dispositions of major countries, the document placed
Sweden in the corner representing the pursuit of stability instead
of innovation and dependence on collectivist action as opposed to
individual initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Other industrialized countries were crowded into the top quarter
for their willingness to take risks and act decisively. Sweden's
only companion in the forlorn bottom spot was Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Stockholm offers reminders of Sweden's days as a pioneer of
style and social conscience. Wheelchair runners are common,
stoplights along the Drottinggatan shopping route feature a
staccato beep that alters rhythm to allow blind people to cross
safely. Every three or four blocks there are stores called UFF that
take Swedes' donated old clothes, refurbish them, sell them at
bargain prices and devote proceeds to aid for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The passing car is most likely a Volvo, the Swedish make that
famously sold itself not on sex appeal but on safety. Downtown
offices reflect the sleek Swedish Modern style that revolutionized
design in the 1960s. Embodying the national characteristic of
elevating ordinariness, Swedish Modern was clean, unadorned and
functional, and it prized the simple pure value of the wood or
metal used.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Swedes expect strict probity in public life. Mona
Sahlin, the front-runner to become prime minister after Ingvar
Carlsson resigned in 1995, had to leave politics after it emerged
that she had used her state-provided credit card to pay for
personal snacks and auto rentals. She had made reimbursements, but
they were deemed too tardy.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War has dramatically altered the rationale
for Sweden's traditional nonaligned posture. Once, the Baltic Sea
was a strategic wall between Sweden and the Soviet republics of
Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Now, one of the first signs
off the highway as one drives in from Stockholm's Arlanda
International Airport points to the ferry for Tallinn, the Estonian
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden has found itself pressed to drop the neutrality it
adopted in both World Wars and join an expanding NATO. While
determined to resist that, it has participated in the Bosnia
peacekeeping organized by NATO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 referendum, Swedes narrowly decided to join the
European Union, but the public has blamed many problems since then
on that organization. Polls suggest that a vote today would go
against European Union membership. Sensing this mood, the
government of Prime Minister Goran Persson has ruled out even
holding a vote on whether to join the European single currency
being introduced next year.
</P>
<P>
   Once a nation that spoke out on conditions around the world,
Sweden has become inward-looking and self-absorbed. Once, it gave
the world Dag Hammarskjold, secretary-general of the United Nations
from 1953 to 1961, and Olof Palme, a pioneering Social Democrat
prime minister gunned down by a still unknown assassin on a
Stockholm street in 1986. Their fame on the foreign stage was an
asset at home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Carl Bildt, the former prime minister who spent two years
as chief foreign peace envoy to Bosnia, has returned home to find
his opposition Moderate Party losing popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Bildt argued that the two major parties were on the same train
but that his was on the front looking forward and Persson's was on
the back staring at the past. Voters still seem to favor the latter
stance.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt at restructuring faces formidable cultural
resistance. The work force is 80 percent unionized, and 31 percent
of the jobs are in the public sector. Pressure for change is coming
from frustrated entrepreneurs and young people who have benefited
from the welfare state but feel no obligation to ``pay back,'' said
Lindgren of Kairos Future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses can't grow here, because it's too expensive to hire
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are starting to think globally,'' he said.
``They're comparing themselves with the people around the world
that they meet on backpacking trips or on the Internet or where
they've studied abroad or at a job for a multinational. Some of
them are moving away, and they are the people that Sweden needs
most.''

U.N. CHIEF TRIES AGAIN TO PERSUADE IRAQ TO SUBMIT TO ARMS
INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan summoned his special envoy in
Baghdad for talks this weekend and sent him back with a message
asking President Saddam Hussein to end Iraq's refusal to cooperate
with arms inspectors, Annan's spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The envoy, Prakash Shah of India, had several private meetings
with Annan over the weekend in Lisbon, where the secretary general
is on an official visit, said Fred Eckhart, the U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's actions lent his authority to efforts to prevent a new
crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq from getting out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   No active weapons searches have taken place in Iraq since it
said on Wednesday that it would no longer cooperate with
inspectors. Only the maintenance of long-term surveillance
equipment installed at Iraqi sites is being permitted.
</P>
<P>
   That type of surveillance was to have been the next stage in the
monitoring process, after Iraq had been declared free of banned
weapons and sanctions had been lifted, but Iraq appears to be
trying to move itself to that stage by fiat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspections in respect of the commission's disarmament
responsibility are temporarily suspended,'' Janet Sullivan, a
spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission, the weapons inspection
agency, told Reuters in Baghdad on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and diplomats say it is difficult to see how the
more intrusive inspections can be resumed unless Saddam Hussein
sees some gain in reversing his order.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has demanded an immediate lifting of sanctions. At the same
time, Saddam Hussein has been building support in the Arab world
and among some members of the U.N. Security Council for
circumventing the embargo imposed in 1990 if the United States and
Britain, both of which have veto power, insist that the sanctions
stay in place until outstanding questions about Iraq's prohibited
weapons programs have been answered. The next major sanctions
review is in October.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its stand in the crisis early this year, the Clinton
administration has conspicuously not threatened the use of force to
win Iraqi compliance with inspections. American military strength
in the Persian Gulf has been reduced since the end of the last
crisis, which was defused by Annan with a visit to Baghdad in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has chosen instead to focus on
weakening Saddam Hussein by aiding rebellious Kurds in a
semiautonomous region of northern Iraq, victims of two decades of
persecution that human rights groups define as genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Kurds were attacked with chemical weapons in the
mid-1980s. Many others were forcibly moved from their homes, and an
unknown number were shot and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has moved troops into the Kurdish region in recent days,
and some experts on the region say Kurdish leaders may need the
promise of military support if they are to be prevented from
seeking a deal with Saddam Hussein rather than face another Iraqi
campaign against them. They say that the Kurds do not have a hope
of toppling Saddam Hussein and that the only potentially effective
rebellion might be from Arab clans in the Iraqi heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Wedgwood, an expert on international organizations at Yale
Law School and the Council on Foreign Relations, says in a
forthcoming article in the American Journal of International Law
that the last crisis with Iraq teaches that without a stronger
threat from the United States, statements and demands from the
divided Security Council will not have much effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In international politics, multilateral diplomacy without a
unilateral commitment to enforcement is unlikely to be effective,''
Ms. Wedgwood wrote. She recalls Annan's remark in Baghdad in
February, when the Persian Gulf bristled with American and British
warships.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do a lot with diplomacy, but of course you can do a
lot more with diplomacy backed up by firmness and force,'' Annan
said then, just after extracting a pledge of cooperation from Iraq.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iraq, aware of American reluctance to threaten force this time,
is trying to portray the current crisis as the fault of the United
States. A letter to the Security Council last week from Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, Saddam Hussein's spokesman to the
outside world, characterized the sanctions as ``the injustice
created and maintained by the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials and diplomats from the Middle East say they
suspect a link between Iraqi belligerence toward the United States
and an increasingly acquiescent environment for a new round of
terrorism by Arab militants. Even governments friendly to the
United States are under intense pressure from radicals because of
the deadlock in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of suggesting a direct relationship between
the Iraqi crisis and the bombing of American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania on Friday, an official said Arabs had been warning for
months about a generally poisonous atmosphere toward the United
States spreading in the Arab world, fueled by the Iraqi crisis and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Arab League accused Richard Butler, executive
chairman of the U.N. arms inspection agency for Iraq and its chief
arms inspector, of overstepping his mandate in continuing to demand
a fuller account of weapons programs from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butler's actions exceed his duties, since Iraq has fulfilled
all its commitments concerning weapons of mass destruction,'' the
Arab League spokesman, Talaat Hamed, said in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed said the league's secretary general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid,
was in contact with Annan. ``Abdel-Meguid wants the Iraqi file
completely closed,'' Hamed said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, interviewed Sunday by CNN, said Saddam Hussein always
tried to characterize the standoff over sanctions as an issue
between him and the United States, while the conflict was instead
with the Security Council, which demands a real accounting for
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't cook the books,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that in talks last week, which he broke off on Tuesday
after repeated Iraqi refusals to discuss outstanding issues, Iraq
had been rattled by the recent finding of traces of VX nerve gas in
shell fragments after years of denying that it had ever filled
warheads with the chemical weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the degree of protection that Tariq Aziz was running on
the biological program was a miracle to behold,'' Butler said.

   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ New details are emerging from the
hijacking of a commercial jet last week in Congo to suggest that
the country's eastern neighbor, Rwanda, has strongly backed and
perhaps actively led efforts to bring down the government of
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacked plane was used on Tuesday to fly rebel troops from
rebel-held areas in the west across Congo to the east, where they
opened a second front in the insurrection against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy account of the boldest rebel operation in the
week-old insurrection, given over Congo's official radio station
Sunday morning, a Nigerian commercial pilot said he had flown the
commandeered plane. After takeoff from the eastern rebel-held city
of Goma, he said, he was ordered to land in the Rwandan capital,
Kigali, to refuel.
</P>
<P>
   In the cockpit with him throughout the flight, directing the
operation at gunpoint, the pilot said, was James Kabarehe, the
Rwandan commander who is widely believed to have led the rebel
armies that defeated the long-ruling dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko,
and installed Kabila in power in Kinshasa, the capital, 15 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, when Kabila dismissed him in the midst of a
growing rift with Rwanda, Kabarehe was on loan from that country as
the powerful interim chief of staff of the new Congolese Army being
assembled by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the pilot's story holds up, this has all the markings of a
world-class double-cross,'' said one European diplomat, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``Kabila depended upon the Rwandans so
completely that they know his situation inside and out. Now they
are using that knowledge against him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian pilot, Raymond Gnang, is a contract employee of the
Congolese company Air Atlantic, whose passenger jet happened to be
in Goma when the rebels seized the city. Gnang said that not one _
as reported earlier _ but three jets had flown on Tuesday in the
surprise operation to the western city of Kitona, where the rebels
quickly opened a second front in the insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Gnang said Kabarehe had led operations as the jets landed at a
major Congolese military base at Kitona, southwest of Kinshasa,
where the arriving rebels exchanged fire with troops stationed at
the base.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot said Kabarehe had been accompanied on his aircraft by
at least 180 soldiers, each with his own assault rifle, and by
crates of weapons. Another airplane used in the operation, a Boeing
707 belonging to Congo Air Lines, carried at least 400 troops, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping off the insurgents, the pilot said, the airplanes
took off again, with orders to head east. ``Instead of flying back
to Kigali, as I was told by Commander Kabarehe, I flew to Lagos, in
Nigeria, where I am from, with two wounded aboard,'' Gnang said
from Kinshasa, where he has since gone. ``I did not want to be an
accomplice of the rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   Since landing at Kitona, Congolese government officials say, the
rebels have managed to rally to their side many of the hundreds of
troops from the defeated army of Mobutu, who were being retrained
there for Kabila's army by Rwandan instructors until Kabila ordered
the Rwandans home two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels already control most of the far eastern part of the
country. But in the last few days, Western diplomats say, they have
moved from the Kitona base to seize two important towns, Banana and
Moanda, that control access to the country's only seaport, Matadi.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest fighting, though, they are reported to be
encountering strong government resistance about 160 miles southwest
of Kinshasa.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From the time Kabila was installed in power by Rwanda, his
falling-out with his former patrons has been gradual but steady. In
the earliest clear sign of a rift, disgruntled Congolese Tutsi, the
ethnic cousins of the Tutsi who dominate Rwanda's current
government, fought a gun battle last November against other
Congolese troops in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting followed Kabila's demotion of a senior Congolese
Tutsi officer who had played a key role in Kabila's insurrection
against Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the region's affairs say that what seemed to have
prompted the current fighting was a feeling in Rwanda, as well as
in Uganda and Angola, two other important sponsors of Kabila's own
uprising, that his government was doing too little to stop
cross-border incursions into those countries by rebels who use
Congolese territory for rear bases.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacked pilot's account came on a day when the Congolese
authorities gave details of what they said was substantial foreign
involvement in the rebellion. In addition to Rwanda, the Kabila
government has accused Uganda of sending troops and tanks into
northeastern Congo in support of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the United States, which as recently as a few months
ago was a strong supporter of Kabila, seems recently to have
wearied of his arbitrary rule, erratic style and persistent human
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila was careless enough to ignore the concerns of the
people who created him,'' said one African diplomat.

NAPALM SHIPMENT FINDS WARY ACCEPTANCE IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEER PARK, Texas _ Four months ago, after residents and
politicians in Indiana and Illinois screamed bloody murder, a train
carrying 22,000 gallons of napalm to an Indiana disposal plant was
abruptly halted and turned back to California, where the napalm had
been moldering since the end of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In July, another toxic waste company won the napalm disposal
contract. This time the company, GNI Group, is situated along the
Houston Ship Channel, one of the globe's largest and densest
concentrations of petrochemical installations. Yet the very same
first shipment of napalm eased its way into Texas last month with
only the briefest flurry of complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Houston deal with this kind of stuff all the
time,'' said Robin Yocum, a spokesman for the Battelle Memorial
Institute, the Navy's prime contractor on the project and the
company that hired GNI Group. ``You say napalm to most people and
they picture the image of that little girl running down the road.
But you explain to people in Houston that it's just gasoline mixed
with benzene and styrene and they know right away what you're
talking about and what you're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Local environmentalists say it is still early in their campaign
to stop the project, the highlight of which has been a protest
outside a Navy recruiting station by someone dressed like a napalm
burn victim. They are planning a gathering later this month in
downtown Houston to ignite their protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to remind you that up there in Indiana it took
them a number of weeks to get organized,'' said Neal Carman, clean
air director for the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club. ``You
know, it's pretty hard to do things outside in this kind of summer.
It doesn't make protesting a whole lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists have an alternative explanation, as well,
for the relative lack of citizen outrage over the project,
particularly in Deer Park, the community where the napalm will
actually be processed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People along the Ship Channel don't feel they can do anything
about it,'' said LaNell Anderson, a Houston real estate agent and a
member of Grandparents of East Harris County. ``They feel
powerless, as though they've been designed as a national sacrifice
zone. You know, these toxic companies looked for the place with the
least resistance and that's why they came here.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Starns lives along the Ship Channel in a working-class
community, Channel View, just over the water from the Deer Park
plant where the napalm will be processed. ``We've already got a
toxic soup around here,'' she said. ``We've breathed, choked and
slurped enough of that stuff that we're wise and we're fed up.
California didn't want it. Indiana didn't want it. Just leave it to
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Carman, the Sierra Club official, said the argument that napalm
was no worse than other Ship Channel chemicals was beside the
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, here we've got U.S. taxpayer dollars
adding to the pollution hazards and burden that is already there,''
he said. ``And it's unnecessary. The material could be disposed of
out there in California using new, safe technology, without any of
these transportation and incineration hazards.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Crabtree, Deer Park's city manager, said his office had
received only about 20 phone calls about the napalm project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming response from our residents,'' Crabtree said,
``has been that this material was of much less hazard than what was
already being handled or traveling through our community on a daily
basis and that they saw no reason to be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Napalm, which engulfed villages in flames when it was dropped
from planes in the Vietnam War, is a kind of jellied gasoline that
burns intensely hot and tends to stick to what it touches,
including people. A total of 3.4 million gallons of it had been
stored so long in aging aluminum canisters at the Fallbrook naval
installation outside San Diego that the metal had begun to
deteriorate. Local politicians, swayed by residents' concerns, had
pushed the Navy to find someplace to dispose of it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the Navy came up with the notion of getting rid of the
notorious explosive through recycling. Battelle was awarded $28
million as prime contractor and built a $5 million plant at
Fallbrook. The napalm was to be squeezed out of the aging canisters
like toothpaste and placed inside 6,000-gallon isocontainers aboard
railroad cars.
</P>
<P>
   Battelle signed a $3 million contract with Pollution Control
Industries in East Chicago, in northwest Indiana. Pollution Control
would accept the isocontainers, blend the napalm with a solvent so
it would burn at a lower and more predictable heat level, and then
ship it to a cement kiln, where it could be burned as fuel, or to
another site like a toxic waste disposal incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December, Rep. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., caught wind
that the Navy planned daily rail shipments of napalm through his
state, and he began making noise about it. Local environmentalists
joined the chorus, as did several other Illinois and Indiana
politicians. The Indiana company, Pollution Control Industries,
decided that the project was more trouble than it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   The GNI Group, which specializes in handling dangerous and toxic
substances, had bid on the project the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to try for it again,'' said Bill Reeves, GNI's vice
president for regulatory affairs. ``And then things started
happening very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   News reports in early July indicated that GNI was one of three
finalists for the contract, leading to a public meeting in Deer
Park at which officials from the company as well as from Battelle
and the Navy set up booths to explain their plan to residents.
About 100 people showed up, said Crabtree, the city manager.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said: ``We took a lesson from what happened in Indiana.
We saw the politicians come out, saw the misinformation of what
went around. We just felt that if we got this out to the public,
quickly, it would be understood and, by and large, it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The first shipment _ 22,000 gallons aboard two railroad cars _
arrived on July 16 and is being stored in a warehouse on the GNI
property, just across from the site of the battlefield where Sam
Houston won Texas' independence.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to bring two containers of napalm onto the
property each weekday and feed it into the blending process,
shipping out the same amount every day. If GNI Group keeps up that
rate, it will take two years to complete the disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get into storage,'' Reeves said. ``We want to
move it out at the same rate it's coming in.''

 DEER PARK, Texas: 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But move it out to where?
</P>
<P>
   The Navy would like the napalm shipped to cement kilns, but thus
far neither of the two cement companies in Texas has expressed an
interest in it. An easy and financially attractive alternative
would be to send the material to a toxic waste incinerator located
on the property just adjacent to GNI. Some environmentalists and
residents believe this is the company's real plan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Starns, who lives along the Ship Channel, said: ``Listen, we
didn't just fall off the turnip truck yesterday. They have an
incinerator just next door. There's not even a fence. They can take
it over there on wheelbarrows, so why are they going to pay to
transport it someplace else?''
</P>
<P>
   Yocum, the Battelle spokesman, said that the institute was still
looking for a cement kiln to accept the napalm, but that the
company would not rule out sending the material next door to be
burned. It will take GNI another month or so to get its program up
and running, so Battelle has until the end of the month or so to
figure out where it will send the blended napalm, Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Starns added: ``I'm not all that concerned with their
blending and storage of the napalm. It's just when they talk about
burning it over there that I get concerned. You know, when I moved
here, I couldn't even spell the word environment much less know
what it means. But I assure you, you learn quick when you live
around the Ship Channel.''

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ American intelligence officers and
law-enforcement personnel from around the world streamed into
Nairobi Sunday to search for clues in the terrorist bombing that
killed at least 190 people and wounded nearly 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   A mother and son were found alive Sunday in a bank building
damaged in the blast, and rescuers were continuing an excruciating
search for survivors, using pickaxes, shovels, crowbars,
sledgehammers and their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Here and in Washington, a global investigation into the nearly
simultaneous attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
began to take shape. Some evidence may come from videocameras
mounted on the roofs of both embassies, although officials in Kenya
and Tanzania said they were not sure whether the cameras had
recorded the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said their investigation was likely to reach across
Africa and the Arabian peninsula to Afghanistan, looking into
terrorist networks with bases in at least four countries and into a
need for stepped-up security at vulnerable American diplomatic
posts around the world. In Washington Sunday, senior Clinton
administration officials said they would ask for more money to
improve security at American embassies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they feared that forensic evidence from
the bombing might have been destroyed in the frantic search for the
wounded and dead in the wreckage left by the powerful explosion.
Only Sunday did American investigators begin to secure the site of
the blast and begin a painstaking search for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are conflicting priorities,'' a senior American official
here said. ``One is removing survivors and removing remains.
Another is gaining evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli rescuers found a mother and a son unharmed Sunday on the
20th floor of the Cooperative Bank of Kenya building adjacent to
the embassy. Lt. Col. Oren Loefler, a spokesman for the Israeli
rescue team, told Reuters that the boy, who he said was about 12,
had been in the apartment at the time of the explosion, and that
his mother had entered afterward to find him. They waited there for
two days, too frightened to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers said that Sunday afternoon, at least one woman,
named Rose, was still alive in the wreckage of the Ufundi House, a
seven-story office building next door to the embassy. The rescuers
strained to hear her as they clambered over a 40-foot-high pile of
debris containing dozens of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is alive,'' said an Israeli officer, Alon Seren. ``She is
stuck in a difficult place, and it is very dangerous for us to
rescue her.''
</P>
<P>
   But as darkness fell, the voice of Rose fell still, and rescuers
were not sure if she was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The rescuers were bringing out the dead, one every 20 minutes.
``We have pulled out bodies with our bare hands,'' said Meital
Hallawi, another member of the Israeli team. ``We are just like
robots,'' she said. ``We can't have any feelings if we want to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Olumola, 38, a cashier at Ufundi House who had left the
building to run a quick errand when the bomb went off on Friday
morning, helped Kenyan Red Cross workers identify the bodies.
``They have just found a friend of mine,'' she said. ``There are 28
more people in there, they say. I knew some of them. I passed them
by at work.''

<P>
   The chance of a terrorist assault on the Nairobi embassy was
rated as slim by officials at the State Department and the CIA,
according to Paul Peterson, the embassy's regional security
officer. Security risks at American embassies are ranked as low,
medium, high and critical by those analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said that ``Nairobi was low'' _ so low that the
embassy, one of the largest American diplomatic outposts in Africa,
shelters diplomats from the U.S. mission in neighboring Sudan,
where the CIA had warned of a possible attack in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five FBI agents, 11 officers from the CIA's
Counterterrorist Center and scores of military intelligence
officers and State Department security experts arrived in Nairobi
Sunday. Among those arriving to reconstitute the embassy was a
State Department officer, Charles Slater, who had just flown in
from London and said his wife had been maimed in the explosion at
the American Embassy in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   At the embassy here, not a single room was untouched by the
blast. A slightly tattered American flag hung limply from the roof
Sunday, surrounded by twisted metal, a ruined satellite dish and a
disabled security camera.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion, which destroyed ``the brain center of the
embassy,'' in the words of Peterson, came from a vehicle that
breached a thin layer of security at the rear of the building.
Embassy officials said the vehicle had apparently been driven past
a manually operated barrier staffed by an employee of the
Cooperative Bank of Kenya to the edge of a ramp leading to the
embassy's underground garage.
</P>
<P>
   There, a few feet from the first-story windows of the embassy,
the vehicle exploded with a force that hurled a maelstrom of flying
glass and debris over a 10-block radius in downtown Nairobi,
damaged buildings 500 feet away and shattered thousands of lives.
As of Sunday evening, 190 people were known dead _155 people who
were outside the embassy and 35 who were inside.
</P>
<P>
   Among the embassy's staff, 12 Americans were confirmed dead
Sunday night. ``There will be 12 coffins going back tomorrow,''
said Chris Scharf, an embassy spokesman. Twenty-four Kenyan
employees were dead, and uncounted dozens were missing, American
officials said. The death toll represented roughly one of every
five Americans in the building at the time of the explosion, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy held a private memorial service Sunday for employees
who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Prudence Bushnell, who had been giving a speech at
the Cooperative Bank building down the street from the embassy at
the moment of the explosion and was slightly wounded, toured the
ruins of the mission Sunday, walking stiffly, with a slight limp, a
split lip and an expression of mourning.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   She emerged, looking devastated, briefly stopping to touch a
rosebud on a memorial bouquet standing by the embassy's entrance
before she drove away. Around her, grim-faced security personnel
and edgy Marines sent from Saudi Arabia stood guard.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to use the ruined embassy, its staff and the new arrivals
from the FBI, the CIA, the State Department and the Pentagon have
decamped to the headquarters of the U.S. Agency for International
Development, where the investigation is being headed by Joseph
Melrose, the ambassador-designate to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The information being analyzed by the investigators Sunday
included a witness' report, not yet independently confirmed, that
three men described as Arabs were seen stealthily videotaping the
embassy building on Monday, an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI forensic technicians, State Department security experts,
Navy Seabees and Fairfax County, Va., firefighters detailed to the
State Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance began
combing the embassy building Sunday, looking both for signs of life
and clues to the crime. Among the firefighters' ranks were veterans
of the team that rushed to Oklahoma City after an Army veteran blew
up the federal building there _ a case successfully closed with a
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said Sunday that the investigation of
this bombing could take months or years. And they voiced fears that
amid the rubble and chaos, clues from the crime had been lost in
the search for the wounded, the missing and the dead.

 &HT;    BellSouth settlement may mean future changes for workers
 &HT;    (EDS: May be used as a sidebar to any BellAtlantic strike story.
Moving on (f) financial and (a) general news wires.)
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 11th-hour settlement that averted a strike against
BellSouth offers raises and increased pensions, but includes an
effort to reshape the way the union and the phone company do
business with each other.
</P>
<P>
   In the tentative, three-year pact that covers 48,000 of
BellSouth's 86,188 employees, the Communications Workers of America
won a 12.39 percent wage increase and a potential bonus of 2.5
percent in the deal's last two years. The company also said it
would soften its practice of forcing employees to work overtime,
agreeing to rely first on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   But for the union's graying membership, retirement benefits were
also key, and BellSouth agreed to a substantial boost in pension
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have been the tough issues all along, and they stayed
tough until the end,'' said Noah Savant, assistant to the vice
president for the CWA district that covers the nine-state BellSouth
turf. ``I think both sides worked extremely hard to get an
agreement, but of course a deadline always puts pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, the deal calls for formation of a ``joint
operations board'' that would include union and company officials
from six BellSouth units.
</P>
<P>
   The board could examine bonuses for employees, rules for union
jobs and training that would let workers shift to better positions.
The idea is to give workers better job opportunities and the
company more flexibility. For example, the board might recommend
that job descriptions for a truck driver or technician be revised
if the work could be done more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Vice President Dick Sibbernsen said company success
depends on ``employees being willing to work in new ways and CWA
being willing to partner with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of arrangement may be critical in the next few years
for BellSouth, which began life in the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T with a
virtual monopoly on local telephone service through most of the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the $21 billion-a-year company faces competition in
wireless, international operations, data services and local phone
service to businesses, as well as residential service in some
places.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BellSouth is champing at the bit to get approval for
entering the competitive market in long distance telephone service,
and BellSouth agreed the CWA can represent workers in its long
distance unit.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications analyst Jeff Kagan said the new board may
help BellSouth minimize what he says is the disadvantage of having
a union. ``The phone companies of the future will look nothing like
phone companies of the past and the unions are set up to operate in
the phone companies of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Michel, economist at the Economics Policy Institute,
said union wages are not the only factor in rising prices. A union
can be an advantage to a company that needs a stable and skilled
work force, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the contract to take effect, the deal must still be ratified
by union members The deal calls for members to get a $500 ``signing
bonus'' for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's agreement contrasts with the strike called by the
CWA against Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's workers were ready for a walkout, too, and despite
the optimism of both sides, it went down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   But by 11:30 p.m., the 40-person BellSouth team led by Tom Posey
and the 30-person CWA squad headed by Vice President Jimmy Smith
had put the finishing touches on a deal.
</P>
<P>
   As the word was passed to CWA Local 3204, which accounts for
4,000 BellSouth workers, local president M.M. Smith said he was
relieved. ``You are not ever really anxious to do a strike. It's
just something you might need to do to achieve what you need to
achieve.

 &HT;    BellSouth settlement may mean future changes for workers

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 11th-hour settlement that averted a strike against
BellSouth offers raises and increased pensions, but includes an
effort to reshape the way the union and the phone company do
business with each other.
</P>
<P>
   In the tentative, three-year pact that covers 48,000 of
BellSouth's 86,188 employees, the Communications Workers of America
won a 12.39 percent wage increase and a potential bonus of 2.5
percent in the deal's last two years. The company also said it
would soften its practice of forcing employees to work overtime,
agreeing to rely first on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   But for the union's graying membership, retirement benefits were
also key, and BellSouth agreed to a substantial boost in pension
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have been the tough issues all along, and they stayed
tough until the end,'' said Noah Savant, assistant to the vice
president for the CWA district that covers the nine-state BellSouth
turf. ``I think both sides worked extremely hard to get an
agreement, but of course a deadline always puts pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Intriguingly, the deal calls for formation of a ``joint
operations board'' that would include union and company officials
from six BellSouth units.
</P>
<P>
   The board could examine bonuses for employees, rules for union
jobs and training that would let workers shift to better positions.
The idea is to give workers better job opportunities and the
company more flexibility. For example, the board might recommend
that job descriptions for a truck driver or technician be revised
if the work could be done more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Vice President Dick Sibbernsen said company success
depends on ``employees being willing to work in new ways and CWA
being willing to partner with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of arrangement may be critical in the next few years
for BellSouth, which began life in the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T with a
virtual monopoly on local telephone service through most of the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the $21 billion-a-year company faces competition in
wireless, international operations, data services and local phone
service to businesses, as well as residential service in some
places.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BellSouth is champing at the bit to get approval for
entering the competitive market in long distance telephone service,
and BellSouth agreed the CWA can represent workers in its long
distance unit.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications analyst Jeff Kagan said the new board may
help BellSouth minimize what he says is the disadvantage of having
a union. ``The phone companies of the future will look nothing like
phone companies of the past and the unions are set up to operate in
the phone companies of the past.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Shop 'til the state drops $19.2 million in sales taxes
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) general news and (f) financial categories.)
 &HT;    By Angie Francalancia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida lawmakers have such a deal for
you: Buy clothing, shoes and similar items costing $50 or less and
save at least 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state-sponsored sale _ actually, it's a week without sales
tax _ begins at 12:01 a.m. SaturdayAug. 15 and ends midnight Aug.
21. As always in sales, some restrictions apply _ and it's a
one-shot deal.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, all essential clothing and shoes are tax-free for the
week. The state's list of essentials includes aprons, adult
diapers, baseball caps and choir robes.
</P>
<P>
   Items excluded from the tax-free list include backpacks,
scarves, athletic cleats and neckties.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature came up with the tax-free week as a way to
return money to taxpayers in a year that finds the state flush with
cash from an $11 billion settlement with tobacco companies and a
healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   It was set during the back-to-school shopping season and limited
to items costing $50 or less to ensure that ``Joe Lunchbucket''
benefits, outgoing House Speaker Dan Webster, R-Orlando, has said.
Notably missing from the tax-free list, however, are back-to-school
items such as barrettes and classroom supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Republican-led legislature, known for supporting
big business, will remind voters of the tax-free week come election
time.
</P>
<P>
   State finance officials estimate the state will lose $19.2
million in sales tax during the week _ meaning people across
Florida will save that amount by not paying the 6 percent tax on
each item they buy for $50 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a $50 blouse, keep the $3 in sales tax. Shoppers can buy an
unlimited number of eligible items at $50 and below without paying
tax. But items costing more than $50 will be taxed on the whole
amount. For example, a shopper buying a $75 pair of pants will pay
the full $4.50 in sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   No splitting pairs
</P>
<P>
   Also, a store cannot split items typically sold together _ like
a pair of shoes or a suit _ to sell each piece at or below the $50
mark. Store coupons that reduce the price to $50 or below can be
used to get items tax-free _ rebates and manufacturer coupons
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers can take advantage of the tax break in other ways. For
example, any items put on layaway before tax-free week and taken
home during the week will not be charged the tax. Or a shopper
could start a layaway on merchandise during tax-free week and the
stores will not ring up the sales tax, even though the items will
be picked up after the week is over.
</P>
<P>
   The $19.2 million the state expects shoppers to save is a
minuscule fraction of the $12 billion in annual sales-tax revenue.
Some local jurisdictions with sales taxes, such as Okeechobee
County, which adds 1 percent, and the St. Lucie County School
District, which collects a half-cent on the dollar, will forfeit
that money as well. Statewide, local governments will lose $2.7
million of the $19.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be pretty hard to quantify what our portion is. I
don't think it's going to impact us negatively,'' St. Lucie School
District Finance Director Mike Averyt cq said. ``It's only one week
out of 52.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida retailers are hoping it will be a big week, with
shoppers flocking to the stores the way they did in New York when
that state tried a sales-tax exemption on clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you run a sale, you hope to make a buck,'' said Dave
Roberts, governmental affairs vice president for the Florida Retail
Federation. ``We don't know how it's going to be here. We think it
will be a good week of sales. Will that benefit us with all the
administrative costs? We hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul McConnaughay, owner of Johnson's Men's Shop in Lake
Worth, said, ``I don't think it will mean much for us. I'll
probably have to explain it to each one of the customers.''
</P>
<P>
   New York merchants were similarly skeptical when legislators
tried the state's first tax-free week in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting pummeled by the competition from the border
states _ New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts _ that have no
state sales tax on clothing,'' said Ted Potrikus, vice president of
the Retail Council of New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York retailers fell in love with tax-free week, which raised
their sales threefold in some cases, Potrikus said. Statewide,
sales grew to $421 million last year from $238 million in January
1996. Shoppers saved nearly $32 million, according to a New York
Department of Tax and Finance study.
</P>
<P>
   Two big differences
</P>
<P>
   But there are two big differences. Florida's neighboring states
don't have the tax exemptions that New York's neighbors do. And New
York set the limit at $500 for tax-free items, drawing huge crowds
to shop for bigger buys.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-school sales already will draw crowds into the stores,
but industry analysts said they don't know how many more people
will wait to begin shopping on Saturday. Palm Beach County's public
schools open Aug. 19, and Martin and St. Lucie county public
schools resume Aug.18 _ all in the middle of tax-free week.
</P>
<P>
   National chains, including Target, JCPenney and Kids R Us, have
been advertising back-to-school sales for two weeks (cq based on
Aug. 9 run date.).
</P>
<P>
   ``We did move an ad we had running the previous week, and we
also have special signs made up that say this is a tax-free item,''
said Scott Lerner, senior store manager at JCPenney in the Palm
Beach Mall. ``But our advertising officially kicked off July 26.''
</P>
<P>
   While a nationwide analysis shows that August is the
third-biggest sales month behind November and December, holiday
peaks have been flattening in recent years. Shoppers are likely to
have begun buying school clothes during the summer months,
according to the study by the International Council of Shopping
Centers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Revenue has had meetings throughout the
summer to give retailers information about what is and isn't on the
tax-exempt list, but attendance has been skimpy, said John Merchant
of the department's Palm Beach County office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent out a list of tips outlining the tax-exempt items to
everyone with a taxpayer identification number,'' he said. ``We've
offered to do training for some of the big chains, like Wal-Mart,
but their officials said they thought the list was pretty
self-explanatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Department of Revenue officials have set up toll-free
lines to answer questions from shoppers and merchants: (800)
850-7847 and (800) 367-8331 for hearing-impaired from 8 a.m. to 9
p.m. Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Saturday and noon-6 p.m. Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   National retailers that have been through the New York
experience aren't worried about preparing for Florida's tax-free
week. Some, like Macy's, will give sales clerks additional
training. Others will put the burden on their computer programmers
so cash registers simply will ring up items without the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work so hard to train your people on a daily basis as to
how you run your programs,'' said Ed Goldberg, government and
consumer affairs vice president at Macy's. ``There's a major
training issue for people to be taught for a one-week period. I
really wish it was as simple as pressing a button.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the cost to do the training . . . is far worth it,'' said
Goldberg, adding that Macy's New York stores had a 300 percent
increase in sales the first time New York exempted clothing from
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's and other stores have adjusted their advertising
schedules to promote sales next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned is to make sure the consumer understands that
tax-free is going to take place,'' he said. ``We're going to beef
up that promotional calendar.''

 &HT;    Runoff election a likely snooze for Georgia voters
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the summer sizzles, voter enthusiasm fizzles. And
the scarcity of big-name races doesn't help as candidates try to
lure the faithful back for one more round of balloting in Tuesday's
runoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With the governor's matchup decided but for the formality of
Tuesday's election, and only a handful of other races left hanging,
the apathy that marked last month's primary elections is expected
to return with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The rough-and-tumble campaigns waged by most statewide
candidates who resorted to negative ads and personal attacks also
may have turned off many potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Secretary of State's office isn't making a specific
prediction, but officials there suggest that turnout is likely to
dip into the ``mid-teens,'' down from the nearly 25 percent of
Georgia's 4.1 million registered voters who cast ballots three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, they're probably right. Generally,
about half the voters who participate in the primary return to the
polls to help settle runoffs. Two years ago, the 33 percent primary
turnout dwindled to roughly 17 percent. And in 1994 _ the last time
Georgia's governor and lieutenant governor seats were up for grabs
_ the 25 percent primary turnout plummeted to 11 percent in the
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do show up this year will decide who represents both
the Democrats and the Republicans in the fall lieutenant governor's
race, the Republican contest for attorney general and the
Democratic race for state labor commissioner. Scores of local races
also are on the ballot throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat's nomination for governor will appear as a
contested runoff on the ballot, but that's only on paper. Lewis
Massey, the second-place finisher who forced the runoff, suspended
his campaign and tossed his support to frontrunner Roy Barnes,
making Barnes the de facto nominee. Guy Millner's position as the
Republican gubernatorial nominee was affirmed in a recount last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Heated local contests may be the best hope for spiking turnout
upwards in some areas. A spirited contest between homeowners
advocate Sam Olens and incumbent county commissioner Gordon Wysong,
author of Cobb's anti-gay rights resolution, may energize voters.
Similarly, the runoff between Gordon Joyner and Horacina Tate for
Ralph David Abernathy III's Senate seat may lure Fulton voters back
to the polls. In Cherokee County, runoffs for two county commission
seats forced by slow-growth forces also are hot tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall dearth of voters may be good news for candidates
like Democrat Mary Margaret Oliver and Republican Clint Day, both
of whom can count on a well-defined and motivated voting base to
return to the polls as they vie for their respective party's
nomination for lieutenant governor. For Oliver, it's women and
voters in Atlanta's liberal communities. For Day, it's Christian
conservatives
</P>
<P>
   In what have become two of the most acrimonious contests this
election season, Day faces Fulton County Commission Chairman Mitch
Skandalakis for the GOP nomination and Oliver is pitted against
Albany lawmaker Mark Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Ralston of Blue Ridge, Ga. faces former
lawmaker Kip Klein for the Republican nomination for attorney
general. And Michael Thurmond, the architect of the state's welfare
reform plan, is up against state Sen. Steve Henson of DeKalb County
for the Democratic nomination for labor commissioner.

   ``We sent out a list of tips outlining the tax-exempt items to
everyone with a taxpayer identification number,'' he said. ``We've
offered to do training for some of the big chains, like Wal-Mart,
but their officials said they thought the list was pretty
self-explanatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Department of Revenue officials have set up toll-free
lines to answer questions from shoppers and merchants: (800)
850-7847 and (800) 367-8331 for hearing-impaired from 8 a.m. to 9
p.m. Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Saturday and noon-6 p.m. Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   National retailers that have been through the New York
experience aren't worried about preparing for Florida's tax-free
week. Some, like Macy's, will give sales clerks additional
training. Others will put the burden on their computer programmers
so cash registers simply will ring up items without the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work so hard to train your people on a daily basis as to
how you run your programs,'' said Ed Goldberg, government and
consumer affairs vice president at Macy's. ``There's a major
training issue for people to be taught for a one-week period. I
really wish it was as simple as pressing a button.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the cost to do the training . . . is far worth it,'' said
Goldberg, adding that Macy's New York stores had a 300 percent
increase in sales the first time New York exempted clothing from
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's and other stores have adjusted their advertising
schedules to promote sales next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned is to make sure the consumer understands that
tax-free is going to take place,'' he said. ``We're going to beef
up that promotional calendar.''

FUNDING SOUGHT TO BOLSTER SECURITY AT U.S. EMBASSIES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Clinton administration officials, vowing
again to track down the terrorists who bombed two U.S. embassies in
East Africa last week, called on Sunday for an expanded budget to
fortify American diplomatic installations abroad against a growing
threat from terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the attacks on the
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in which
12 Americans were killed, pointed up larger security problems many
of the 280 American embassies and other diplomatic installations
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried, in a systematic way, to upgrade the embassies
around the world by making sure that the perimeters are secure,
that they have barricades, barbed wire, a variety of things to try
to secure the buildings,'' she said on the NBC News program ``Meet
the Press.'' ``But it is a very hard job and we do not have the
resources for it.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We are going to be talking about how to increase
the resources.'' Albright cited no dollar figures, but other
administration officials have said that billions of dollars would
be needed if the government hoped for a significant improvement in
security standards at most embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albright repeated President Clinton's pledge that the United
States would track down those responsible for the bombings, no
matter how long it might take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memory of the United States is very long, and our reach is
very far,'' Ms. Albright added.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's call for more money to improve embassy
security came as a former deputy director of the CIA, who led a
State Department panel that studied the issue, said the bombings in
East Africa showed that the department had failed to meet security
standards it had supposedly adopted in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't learn lessons very well,'' said Bobby Ray Inman, a
retired admiral who led the experts panel for the State Department
during the Reagan administration. ``We need to do everything we can
to provide protection for those who are representing us abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the State Department has been given less than
one-third of the money that would have been required to modify or
build embassies meeting the standard set in 1985. Between 1986 and
1990, the State Department required $2.7 billion to upgrade its
embassies, but Congress appropriated a total of about $880 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department insists that it is eager to make
security improvements, many department officials were relieved that
the money was not approved in full, believing that compliance with
the Inman standards would have turned some diplomatic compounds
into nearly inaccessible fortresses.
</P>
<P>
   The embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam had not been modified
to comply fully with the security standards called for by Inman's
1985 report, which was requested after a terrorist attack the
previous year against the American Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, in
which 16 people died.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Inman said he was ``a little cynical after too many years of
watching a process where there's greater eagerness to solve a
problem when you have been attacked'' but little enthusiasm later,
``after time goes on and the attacks haven't been repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from his home in Austin, Texas, Inman said the
attacks in East Africa were predictable, given that security
standards at some large embassies in the Middle East and elsewhere
in the world had been improved dramatically to meet the so-called
Inman standards, leaving embassies like those in Kenya and Tanzania
as ``softer targets.''
</P>
<P>
   His panel, he said, forecast the problem. ``We recognized that
as some buildings became more secure, terrorists who were looking
to carry out attacks would start looking elsewhere _ they would
start looking for softer ones,'' he said. ``I believe that's what
happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said Sunday that he believed
Congress would move to increase spending on embassy security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that they would evaluate the needs of the State
Department,'' he said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``It's correct that
not all of the money that has been requested by the president for
increased securities has been funded.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said on the
CBS News program ``Face the Nation'' that it was impossible to
guard against all terrorist attacks ``unless you build fortresses,
but obviously in the wake of an incident such as this, additional
efforts will be made.''

 &HT;    Linebacker position cuts may mean special teams additions for
Falcons hopefuls
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes time to start shaping the Atlanta
Falcons' final roster, the toughest cuts may come at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine players in training camp at that position, and
the Falcons will keep six to eight. The hard part is several
players who might not play well enough to make the team on
linebacking skills alone happen to be good special teams players.
That's important.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably, the linebacker position is as competitive as any on
the team this year,'' said assistant head coach/defensive
coordinator Rich Brooks. ''And with special teams in the mix, it's
going to be complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The three men who finished last season as starters -- middle man
Jessie Tuggle (5-foot-11, 230 pounds), weak 'backer Cornelius
Bennett (6-2, 240), and strongside 'backer Henri Crockett (6-2,
251) are holding ground so far.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett isn't going anywhere. He's a middle linebacker at heart
and by trade. Injuries necessitated his move to the middle in
Friday's 31-16 preseason loss to Tennessee, and despite practicing
there just one day, he performed above expectations in three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   When Tuggle's contract ends after the 1999 season, Crockett will
quite likely be the man in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle, 33, and Bennett, 32, both had good seasons last year.
Due to their ages, coaches must keep an eye on their legs. Also,
both men will count $3.45 million against the salary cap _ the two
highest totals on the team, and a combined 13 percent of the team's
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be difficult, and perhaps imprudent, to trade or
waive either one. Even if they were cut, Bennett would count $1.25
million against this year's cap, Tuggle $933,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of who would play in their spots. In
Tuggle's case, it might well be Crockett, although backup middle
men Eddie Sutter (6-2, 239) and Ruffin Hamilton (6-1, 238) were
doing some good things before suffering hamstring injuries last
week. Neither played against the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   In Bennett's case, the backups are third-year man Craig Sauer
(6-1, 240), who has 21 career tackles, and rookie first-round draft
choice Keith Brooking (6-2, 244) The thought of either starting at
the beginning of the season, when it is hugely important the
Falcons start well to avoid another season where fans refuse to buy
tickets, is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Sauer also has taken some snaps in the middle. Brooking
eventually will get a look on the strongside.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Crockett on the strongside is 12th year man David Brandon
(6-4, 238), who was the starter before breaking his leg in the
fourth game last season. Brandon, too, is 33.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Crockett and Brandon is third-year man Ben Talley, (6-3,
248) a Griffin native who was a fourth-round pick of the Giants in
1995. Under coach Dan Reeves, and current Falcon linebacker Don
Blackmon, Talley was going to compete for a starting job when he
shredded his knee on the first day of training camp in '96. He
missed that entire season, and was cut by the Giants last summer,
playing no football in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Rosters must be reduced from 80 to 60 after the third preseason
game, and down to 53 after the final preseason game. If cuts were
made today, Talley and Hamilton probably would be first to go.
</P>
<P>
   Talley is not as fast as some, and Hamilton, who is a tad
undersized, hasn't played much as a pro, including five games for
the Packers in '94, none in '95, when the Packers waived him, and
none in '96, when the Falcons reached an injury settlement with him
upon waiving him. He had just two tackles and six special teams
tackles last year, playing outside.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon, who along with Talley, Tuggle and Bennett is considered
a one-position linebacker, could be next on this list.
</P>
<P>
   But there's time for impressions to change, and injuries could
have some say in all this, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied with everybody's progress right now,'' Blackmon
said. ''With the live action (of preseason games), they'll start to
separate.''

COMMENTARY: THE HATE VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The purpose of the march, according to its
organizers, is to bring black and Latino youngsters from all over
the city and all around the country to Harlem to loudly protest
such pervasive evils as police brutality, job discrimination and
substandard educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   A worthy goal. But to pull this off safely and successfully, it
would help if you had leaders as conscientious and disciplined as,
say, Martin Luther King, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, John Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But those are names from a brave and glorious past. Times have
changed. Once there was jazz and blues. Now there is gangsta rap.
And the so-called Million Youth March scheduled for Sept. 5 is
being led by one Khalid Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called Jew claims that there were six million in Nazi
Germany. I am here today to tell you that there is absolutely no
evidence, no proof. There is absolutely no evidence to
substantiate, to prove that six million so-called Jews lost their
lives in Nazi Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Muhammad speaking at San Francisco State University on
May 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Same speech: ``Don't let no hooked-nose, bagel-eating,
lox-eating, perpetrating-a-fraud so-called Jew who just crawled out
of the ghettoes of Europe just a few days ago ...''
</P>
<P>
   Same speech: ``Who's pimping the world? The hairy hands of the
Zionist in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Different speech, this one on the weekend before the Million Man
March in Washington in October 1995: ``Look at it, so-called Jew.
Look at it, imposter Jew. Somebody must call you what you are.
Somebody must look you in your cold lying blue eyes and pull the
cover off of you today. I don't give a damn about you and I will
give you hell from the cradle to the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, a former Nation of Islam official, has also made
sickening comments about rabbis and circumcision and was
disciplined by Louis Farrakhan after making a speech in which he
referred to Jews as ``bloodsuckers.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a big controversy now over Muhammad's desire to hold
his march, which would move through the heart of Harlem, along the
37 blocks of Malcolm X Boulevard between 147th Street and Central
Park North. Nearly everyone agrees that no matter how repellent his
views, Muhammad has a First Amendment right to march, but the exact
time and place are subject to reasonable regulation by the city.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the city is being led by one Rudolph Giuliani.
For him, this is an easy call. We are headed for a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view,'' said the mayor, ``this is a hate
march.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has refused to grant Muhammad and his fellow organizers
a permit for a march on Malcolm X Boulevard. Officials have offered
instead to authorize a gathering at a different site, perhaps Van
Cortlandt Park in the Bronx or Randalls Island.
</P>
<P>
   The response from a colleague of Muhammad was as follows: ``The
Constitution does not say that Mayor Adolph Giuliani can determine
the time and place of the execution of our free speech and
assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers insist the march will go on as planned.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens next?
</P>
<P>
   It would be helpful if some prominent African-American leaders,
faced with the grotesque reality of a virulent anti-Semite playing
Pied Piper to the nation's black children, would stand up and say
enough is enough. This is wrong. This is not what our community
stands for, and it is not a message that we will allow to be fed to
our young.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, no ally of Giuliani, has denounced
Muhammad, saying, ``We don't need anybody preaching hatred in
Harlem.'' A few other black officials have issued more or less
muffled statements about not condoning Muhammad's rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   More voices need to be heard, and they need to be louder and
more forceful. It needs to be made clear that Muhammad's type of
leadership is a virus that is potentially as debilitating to the
black community as HIV.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be helpful if public officials more skilled at
negotiating than Giuliani were allowed to play significant roles in
resolving the problem of when and where Muhammad is allowed to have
his say.

 &HT;    Good memories for Kiraly
 &HT;    By Jon Gallo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Karch Kiraly said he needs to come to Alanta more
often. Every time the San Clemente, Calif., resident has dropped in
for a visit here, he's left with a lot more money in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at the Miller Lite Beach Challenge at MetLife Park in
Atlanta was no different for Kiraly and partner Adam Johnson. After
an undefeated run, the top-seeded team will return to California
sharing $10,416 after beating Brent Frohoff and Rob Heidger 15-12
in the final of the Association of Volleyball Professionals event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't figured out what's special about this city,''
said Kiraly, who has never lost in the five tournaments he's played
here, including the 1996 Olympics. ``But every time I come here,
good things always seem to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the final, Kiraly's winning streak was in
jeopardy, as Heidger's back-to-back blocks against Johnson gave his
team a 9-5 lead. But Johnson and Kiraly went on a 4-0 run and tied
the score when Kiraly's spike over Heidger found the back line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get down, we never panic, and that's really
important,'' Kiraly said. ``We just kept our composure and played
like we were capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   After regaining the lead 12-9, Frohoff and Heidger then fell
apart for good. Johnson and Kiraly ran off six straight points to
capture the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we just needed to start making plays,'' said Johnson,
who had three of the team's final five kills, including the
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended an upset-filled tournament run for Frohoff and
Heidger. To get to Sunday's final, the duo knocked off the
third-seeded team of Brian Lewis and David Swatik (15-4),
fourth-seeded Franco Neto and Roberto Lopez (15-9), sixth-seeded
Bill Bouilianne and Ian Clark (15-4) and 10th-seeded Aaron Boss and
Albert Hannemann (15-9).
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the best I've played in a long time,'' said Frohoff,
who missed all of last season because of a knee injury. ``But it's
disheartening because we had two leads against the best team in the
world and blew them both.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's win makes it 4-for-4 for Kiraly in tour stops here:
with Kent Steffes in 1994, in 1995 with Scott Ayakatubby (while
Steffes was out with a shoulder injury), and back with a healthy
Steffes in 1996. There was no AVP stop here last year.
</P>
<P>
   But even the $40,000 in prize money Kiraly and his partner have
taken home from those four wins in Atlanta pales in comparison to
what Kiraly and Steffes did the last time they stopped here. At
Atlanta Beach in Jonesboro, Kiraly and Steffes won the first
Olympic beach volleyball competition in 1996, when they beat Mike
Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the best moments in my career,'' said Kiraly,
who also won gold in the indoor team volleyball event at the 1984
and 1988 Olympics, in addition to having won 134 AVP events in his
13 years on the tour. ``All I know is that I'm definitely going to
come back here.''

CAMERA MAY PROVIDE CLUES IN TANZANIA BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: AFRICA-BOMBINGS, AFRICA-VICTIMS, AFRICA-EMBASSY,

(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ A video camera on the roof of the
American Embassy here that points at the entrance gate where a
terrorist bomb went off at 10:39 a.m. Friday may offer clues for
investigators who started piecing together evidence Sunday about
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that they did not know yet whether the
camera was rolling during the attack, but that the camera seemed to
be one of the few pieces of equipment that remained intact on the
largely devastated three-story building.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion, which left nine dead and more than 70 injured,
appears to have been caused by a bomb attached to a car or truck,
an American official said Sunday. Much of the attention is focused
on a water truck that was at the entrance awaiting clearance to
make a regular delivery when the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
   An American official said that ``a possible scenario'' _ and so
far, the most likely explanation _ was that a bomb was attached to
the water truck. The blue tanker lay crumpled upside down in the
rubble in the compound Sunday, its undercarriage slammed askew
against the embassy wall and the cabin where a driver and his
assistant sat reduced to a few spokes of black metal.
</P>
<P>
   But there were many questions about how a water truck that
belonged to the embassy's motor pool could have been fitted with a
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the water truck, his assistant and five Tanzanian
security guards at the gate were all killed. The impact was so
severe that it damaged buildings more than a mile away. So far no
witnesses have come forward, the American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania has been considered a quiet diplomatic post. But while
American officials here puzzled about the physical details of the
bombing, there was less puzzlement about how the nation, with its
large Muslim population, might possibly have been chosen as a site
for an Islamic fundamentalist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the nations in East Africa, Tanzania has the highest
percentage of Muslims. Along the coast, about 60 percent of the
population is estimated to be Muslim; most of the rest are
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials have said that they have no clues yet about
who the bombers might be. But one name that officials mention
frequently is that of Osama bin Laden, a wealthy sponsor of
fundamentalist Islamic activities around the world. Bin Laden, who
lives in Afghanistan, is sometimes given protection by the Sudan,
to the north of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   More militant strains of Islam have come to Tanzania in the last
few years, and in February police clashed with protesters, killing
two, outside a mosque in the Mwembe Chai section of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such coincidences, however, there are no real known
clues, and no prominent group has claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects of unearthing vital evidence _ whether from traces
of the explosives or from the video camera _ seems better here than
in Nairobi, where the lengthy and complex work to rescue victims
may have damaged investigative leads.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A longtime personnel assistant in the embassy, Evita Kwimbela,
said the driver of the water truck had been employed by the embassy
for nine years and was ``very calm, very cool.'' Mrs. Kwimbela, who
is recovering from a head wound in the hospital, said she knew the
driver by his last name, Ndange, and said he was in his early 40s.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of about 10 embassy drivers, she said, and had been
assigned on Friday to pick up water from a well owned by the
embassy about four miles from the compound and bring it back. Mrs.
Kwimbela said that because of Dar es Salaam's chronic water
shortage, the tanker went to the well daily and was parked inside
the embassy grounds when it was not in use.
</P>
<P>
   The American official who said the water tanker was considered a
possible vehicle for the bomb also said the bomb might have been
attached to a car. Several charred car skeletons lay almost
directly outside the embassy gates; in all, 22 cars that were near
the building were wrecked.
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread sentiment Sunday that because of its lax
borders, open Indian Ocean sea front and widespread poverty,
Tanzania is a natural place for organizers either to send or to
recruit helpers for a bomb attack. It would not be difficult for a
well-organized effort to penetrate society with bribes and
promises, several Tanzanians said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the people don't have money and need money,'' Mrs.
Kwimbela said.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy in Tanzania was considered a low-risk, low-profile
post, a place where American diplomats administered aid programs
and tried to spread ideas about American democracy. Unlike some
other African countries, Tanzania receives little military
assistance, and few Americans visit, aside from a steady stream of
safari tourists.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no ambassador since January, and the embassy and
its staff of 40 have been managed by the charge d'affaires, John
Lange. The new ambassador, Charles Stith, a political appointee
chosen by the Clinton administration, is to arrive next month.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, American officials said, the embassy security
system worked as it was supposed to because the bomb went off
outside the embassy compound rather than inside. But the building
itself is very close to the narrow street and lacks the setback
required for newly built American embassies.
</P>
<P>
   No American was killed here; one temporary American employee was
evacuated to London on Friday for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   There was some conjecture Sunday that the Tanzanian guards at
the gate suspected there was something awry with the water truck
and were inspecting it more carefully when the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marine guards, who are posted at all American
embassies, operate from inside the front door of the building. They
do not typically inspect individual visitors or cars, officials
here said.
</P>
<P>
   A protective green tarpaulin now covers the crater, which is
seven feet wide. Traces of the explosive will presumably be found
in the crater. The embassy compound, flanked by flowering oleander
and frangipani trees, is neatly cordoned off and guarded by more
Marines who flew in Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The building, built of reinforced concrete by the Israeli
government for use as its embassy in the late 1970s, is probably
beyond repair.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have long theorized that climatic changes related to
global warming could unleash outbreaks of diseases like malaria,
dengue fever, cholera and heat stroke. But with the modest amount
of warming experienced so far, they have been unable to produce
much hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Now the experts have a research gift from an unlikely
benefactor: El Nino. Combined with an underlying global warming
trend, say scientists who track such things, El Nino will probably
make 1998 the warmest year in several centuries.
</P>
<P>
   And the heavy rains, droughts and other extreme weather fostered
by El Nino over the last year are precisely what many scientists
expect will also result from a predicted warming of the globe in
the decades ahead.
</P>
<P>
   So in the belief that 1997 and 1998 may provide a taste of what
is to come, those who pay attention to the health effects of
climate are now pulling together data about weather-related illness
and death in recent months. While most of the evidence is
circumstantial, consisting of correlations and coincidences, it
suggests that amid all the scientific smoke there is some fire.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the clues:
</P>
<P>
   _ The World Health Organization reports ``quantitative leaps''
in the incidence of malaria around the world, coincident with
extreme weather events associated with El Nino. Both heat and
variations in rainfall affect transmission of the disease by
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tens of thousands of people in Kenya and Somalia were
afflicted by another mosquito-borne disease, Rift Valley fever, and
at least 200 died, after the heaviest rains since 1961, attributed
to El Nino, fell on the region.
</P>
<P>
   _ The incidence of cholera increased markedly over the last year
in Latin America, where an epidemic had already been in progress
for seven years, and in parts of Africa. In both cases the surge in
cases was associated with heavy rainfall and floods linked to El
Nino.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the southern Rockies, a warm, wet winter brought on by El
Nino has produced abundant food and cover for deer mice, which
transmit the deadly hantavirus to humans. The number of mice has
increased, and the deaths of three people have been ascribed to the
disease. Federal disease-control agents are still analyzing the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forest fires in Southeast Asia, made possible by a killing
drought attributed to El Nino, subjected hundreds of thousands of
people to respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   While this and similar evidence is sifted and tested, scientists
are also beginning to focus more closely on the health impact of
extreme weather events quite apart from El Nino, especially in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they are finding is that there is a statistically
significant association in the United States between heavy
rainstorms and outbreaks of waterborne diseases. These include
hepatitis, E. coli infections and the cryptosporidium parasite that
infected 400,000 people and killed 50 to 100 in Milwaukee in 1993,
as well as other gastrointestinal diseases caused by viruses,
bacteria and parasites.
</P>
<P>
   In East Africa, Model and Portent
</P>
<P>
   If the relationship between heavy rain and disease is a solid
one and climate experts are right, the United States may be in for
a surge of climatically induced waterborne illness.
</P>
<P>
   Analyses of the last century's weather records by the National
Climatic Data Center have found that extremely heavy rainstorms
have become more common. For example, single rainfalls on the order
of 8 and 9 inches each deluged the Boston area in mid-June, the
Ohio Valley in late June and south-central Tennessee in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologists say that this is just the kind of increase in
extreme rainstorms that would be expected in a warming atmosphere,
which holds more moisture and causes more water to evaporate from
the oceans. The heavier rain that results is more likely to cause
floods that not only kill people but also overwhelm drinking-water
purification systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If extreme weather events are part of a changing climate,''
said Dr. Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health
and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, ``we've seen
lots of evidence of the profound health effects associated with
climate change this year.''
</P>
<P>
   East Africa, he said, especially illustrates the risk to health
posed by climatic factors. There, simultaneous outbreaks of
cholera, malaria and Rift Valley fever followed heavy rains and
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein has long held the view that global warming will have a
serious effect on health. His group at Harvard has also made a
compilation of possible health effects of El Nino in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The view has provoked argument. In the always contentious debate
over climate change and the uncertainties that attend it, it has
been especially difficult to get a handle on the question of health
and disease. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an
international group of scientists advising the United Nations,
recognized this in its most recent report, issued in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The panel predicted that if emissions of heat-trapping
industrial-waste gases like carbon dioxide were not reduced, the
average surface temperature of the earth would rise by about 3.5
degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   This is roughly half the amount of warming experienced since the
depths of the last ice age. About one degree of warming has taken
place in the last century, and the latest surface readings combined
with tree-ring studies made by climatologists at the University of
East Anglia in Britain indicate that 1997 was the warmest year in
the last 1,000 years and that 1998 will probably be warmer still.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent events, the intergovernmental panel said in 1995,
might plausibly be early signals of climate-induced changes in
human health. The panel cited a surge in heat-related deaths in
India in 1995 (there was a similar surge this year), changes in the
ranges of some insect-borne diseases and the spread of cholera
along coastal areas in some developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the group also said it was ``not possible to attribute
particular, isolated events to a change in climate or weather
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Dr. Duane Gubler, director of the division of
vector-borne infectious diseases at the Federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, ``is that we may see some correlations''
between climate and disease outbreaks, ``but we don't know whether
it's cause and effect.'' So, he said, ``we're kind of cautious'' in
tying climatic change to changes in health.

<P>
   More Than One Way to Kill a Mosquito
</P>
<P>
   Not a few experts point out, for instance, that while a warming
atmosphere would theoretically be expected to expand the range of
mosquito-borne tropical diseases like malaria and dengue fever,
reality is not so simple.
</P>
<P>
   Temperature, humidity, rainfall and other weather factors are
indeed some of the main things that influence transmission of the
diseases. In some instances, temperature increases the virulence of
the disease itself, by prompting viruses to multiply more. Heavier
rainfall creates more standing water for some kinds of mosquitoes
to breed in, and populations soar. Drought encourages people to
store water in open containers, with the same result.
</P>
<P>
   But in the developed countries, experts like Gubler say,
public-health pluses like pest control and better living conditions
(more tightly built houses, for example) have pretty much slammed
the door on epidemics of mosquito-borne illness.
</P>
<P>
   Until early this century, malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever
were common in the United States. Today, outbreaks of those
diseases are small, isolated and rare. Usually, says Gubler, the
cases have arrived from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   This public-health success, a number of experts say, would
probably stop any climate-induced invasion by mosquito-borne
diseases at the U.S. border _ as indeed may have happened already:
Dengue fever, resurgent in the Caribbean and Central America in
recent years, has not become a major problem in the United States _
even though, Gubler says, the temperature along the Gulf Coast is
higher than in the Caribbean. While Texas reported only a handful
of cases in 1995 and again in 1997, said Gubler, there were
thousands of cases a stone's throw away, in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Gubler, Epstein and many others agree that developing countries,
with less effective and in some cases nonexistent controls on
mosquitoes, would be highly vulnerable to any climatically induced
surge in diseases borne by vectors _ animals, usually insects, that
carry a disease from a host to another animal.
</P>
<P>
   They also agree that efforts to improve public health measures
there and to limit climatic change globally are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But the richer countries, including the United States, may not
be immune to climate-sensitive health problems. Two big cases in
point are heat waves and waterborne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Many climate experts say that heat waves are likely to become
more frequent and intense, and therefore more deadly. If they are
right, what has happened in Texas this summer may be a foretaste.
More than 100 people have died there in a heat wave that saw
temperatures in Dallas rise above 100 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks
on end.
</P>
<P>
   It was even worse in India, where the most intense heat wave in
50 years sent the temperature soaring above 120 degrees in some
places. Nearly 1,300 people died.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics point out that people in the southern United States
have become acclimatized to heat, and argue that northerners will
also adapt if the climate warms.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Laurence Kalkstein of the University of Delaware, who
has long studied the subject, says that people become vulnerable to
heat whenever it reaches a certain threshold above what they are
used to _ even if they are used to high temperatures. The lethal
Southern U.S. and Indian heat waves this year may provide some
evidence of this.
</P>
<P>
   The important unanswered question, Kalkstein said, is whether
heat waves will get hotter along with the general climate. ``If New
York's climate becomes more like Jacksonville's and all the days
stay about the same in the summer,'' he said, ``I think New Yorkers
will acclimatize.'' But if hotter heat waves are then superimposed
on top of a generally warmer climate, ``we are going to get more
deaths,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics also point out that cold-related deaths would probably
drop in the winter. But Kalkstein believes that heat-related deaths
will more than offset this. Many cold-season deaths, he explains,
result from diseases like flu that are transmitted in confined
spaces in buttoned-up winter buildings. Climate change is not
likely to alter this picture much, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking Diseases Borne by Water
</P>
<P>
   Experts are just beginning to get a firm handle on
weather-related outbreaks of waterborne disease in the United
States. One problem is that heavy rainfalls tend to overwhelm
sewage-treatment systems early in a flood, catching those who
operate the systems unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, disease organisms ``ride the initial wave that
comes downstream'' in the first hour or two of a storm, infecting
people before anything can be done, said Dr. Dennis Juranek, the
associate director of the division of parasitic diseases at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is compounded by the fact that outbreaks of
diarrheal diseases, the most common waterborne maladies, are not
usually perceived as a public-health emergency _ even though they
are sometimes fatal to people whose immune systems are depressed _
and therefore are probably underreported.
</P>
<P>
   Diarrheal diseases do not ``cause people to fall over or bleed
out of the eyes or mouth,'' Juranek said, adding, ``It has to be
something big like Milwaukee'' to get people's attention. Even in
Milwaukee, he said, ``we came within a hair's width'' of failing to
find out that the cryptosporidium outbreak of 1993 was waterborne.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of South Florida, the University of
Maryland and the National Climatic Data Center are taking some of
the first steps in pinning down the cause and effect in climate and
disease. They have plotted more than 300 recorded outbreaks of
waterborne disease over the last 50 years against the distribution
of heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   Although the data are still being analyzed, ``we can demonstrate
increased probability of waterborne outbreaks when there are
extreme events,'' said Dr. Joan Rose, a water-pollution
microbiologist at the University of South Florida. In 1982-83, the
last big El Nino period before 1997-98, 60 percent to 70 percent of
the outbreaks were associated with extreme rainfalls, she said.

TALKS CONTINUE BETWEEN BELL ATLANTIC, UNION TO END STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New England, Mid-Atlantic states.)  (nk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bell Atlantic and union officials negotiated through
the day Sunday to end a strike by 73,000 telephone workers that
began shortly after midnight. The immediate impact of the strike
was to inconvenience customers from Maine to Virginia trying to
reach directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Company and union officials said they expected the disruption to
be greater Monday, when most Bell Atlantic workers would have
normally reported to work, and scheduled repairs and installations
of phone lines would face inevitable delays.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were taking place in New York and Washington, and
officials from Bell Atlantic and the Communications Workers of
America said they wanted to reach a quick settlement and avoid
all-out-warfare like the 17-week strike by Nynex workers in 1989.
Nynex merged with Bell Atlantic last year, forming the nation's
largest regional phone company.
</P>
<P>
   The communications workers went on strike as soon as the two
sides failed to reach a settlement at 12:01 a.m. when their
three-year contract expired. But 13,500 Bell Atlantic workers in
New England who belong to the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers decided not to go on strike in the hope that a
settlement could be reached in several days.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the strike could end soon, officials with the
electrical workers said that in separate talks in Boston, the union
and Bell Atlantic had agreed on contract language that would set
stronger limits on the company's use of nonunion workers to do work
traditionally done by unionized phone technicians.
</P>
<P>
   That had become a major issue for both unions, and the
communication workers had demanded limits on Bell Atlantic's
practice of farming out work to the company's new nonunion
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a concern expressed by workers at many other companies,
union members fear Bell Atlantic's increased use of nonunion
workers will endanger their job security and reduce the union's
bargaining clout.
</P>
<P>
   Communications workers officials said they were studying the
language the company had worked out with the electrical workers and
might want more comprehensive restrictions on the company's moving
work to nonunion employees.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of cities along the Eastern Seaboard, repairmen,
operators and customer service representatives picketed Sunday in
front of Bell Atlantic buildings, often shouting, ``No Contract. No
Work.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, callers who sought directory assistance were
greeted by an electronic voice, saying, ``We're sorry due to the
work stoppage. We're not able to provide an operator at this time.
Please place your call later. We are sorry about the
inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations in New York said they would not be hurt by a short
strike because it would not make much of a difference if they had
to wait a few extra days to have new lines installed. But a long
strike might be a different story, a Merrill Lynch spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, based in New York City, provides telephone
service, wireless communications, cable and digital TV, and
Internet and data services to close to 27 million customers in 13
states and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said that to prevent major delays in repairs
and installing phones lines, thousands of managers would pick up
the slack by working 12 hours a day, six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the day, key officials with the union and company
engaged in informal talks, but occasionally the two sides held
formal sessions with their complete negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
   Morton Bahr, president of the communications workers' union,
said, ``Our major unresolved issues at Bell Atlantic include
keeping good permanent jobs from being outsourced and converted
into temporary jobs at low pay and minimal benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kraus, a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman, said the company had
addressed that issue in its proposal. ``All of the union's concerns
are addressed, including outsourcing, overtime and vacations,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both sides said they were eager to avoid a replay
of the 1989 strike, an especially bitter showdown. During that
strike, workers sabotaged Nynex equipment, customers grew angry
about service delays, the company lost business and a striker was
killed trying to prevent a car from crossing the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   A long strike could hurt Bell Atlantic by encouraging frustrated
customers to turn to its competitors for services like high-speed
Internet connections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Millions of customers in nine states in the Southeast were
spared disruptions Sunday because the CWA announced shortly before
midnight Saturday that 48,000 workers at Bell South would not go on
strike because the two sides had reached a tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Bell South agreed to increase wages by 12.4 percent over the
three-year contract and to hire additional workers in an effort to
reduce the large amounts of forced overtime that workers had
complained bitterly about.
</P>
<P>
   The strike had far less effect in New England than in New York
and Bell Atlantic states to the south because the electrical
workers, who represent most Bell Atlantic workers in New England,
had not walked out. Most of Connecticut is not affected by the
strike because the phone company that serves most of the state,
Southern New England Telecommunications, reached a contract
agreement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kraus of Bell Atlantic said outsourcing _ the transfer of
work to nonunion companies _ was only a small percent of Bell
Atlantic's work, asserting that it is used for functions like food
service, cleaning and getting computers prepared for the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have the flexibility just like every other business
in America to run our business cost-effectively and to continue to
do this in the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say their concern is not that Bell Atlantic is
farming out food service and cleaning work to nonunion workers, but
that it is outsourcing work like handling business accounts and
installing high-speed Internet lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the core telephone work which has
always been unionized will remain unionized,'' said Bob Master, a
spokesman for the communications workers. ``That's the fundamental
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Other issues under negotiation include wages, forced overtime,
increasing pensions for current retirees and the company's failure
to offer early retirement inducements to everyone it said it would
under the 1995 contract.

<P>
   LANDER, Wyo. _ Time has been standing still for the friends and
family of Amy Wroe Bechtel for more than a year now, since the
endurance runner vanished from this quiet mountain town.
</P>
<P>
   No solid clues have emerged since July 24, 1997, when the
unlocked car belonging to Mrs. Bechtel, a 24-year-old personal
trainer, distance runner and amateur photographer, was found
several miles from town along a road in the Shoshone National
Forest. It is believed that she went there to map a trail for a
race she was organizing. Her keys and sunglasses were on the car
seat, but her wallet has never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the thin leads for her family have slipped from their
grasp _ like the sighting of a homeless woman in Florida who bore a
striking resemblance to Mrs. Bechtel, and the man who was said to
have stalked her while she was in college but turned up with an
alibi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not much farther along than we were one year ago, to be
honest,'' said Fremont County Sheriff Larry Mathews. ``But this is
not at a standstill. It's still moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses have testified before a Federal grand jury,
but Mathews said the major obstacle to his investigation was the
refusal of Mrs. Bechtel's husband, Steve, to take a polygraph test.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to make up a suspect list, he'd probably be the only
one on it,'' the sheriff said. ``Until he'll cooperate, until we
get other evidence that eliminates him, he is a possible suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bechtel has said that polygraph tests are unreliable and
that he has already cooperated by allowing a search of his home and
truck and answering investigators' questions. Mr. Bechtel, a
27-year-old mountain climber, is in Greenland on an expedition for
several weeks and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no basis whatsoever to view Steve as a suspect, not
one shred of evidence,'' said Kent Spence, Mr. Bechtel's lawyer.
``It's time for law enforcement to back off of Steve. It adds
another tragedy to this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bechtel has said he was mountain climbing about 100 miles
away the day his wife disappeared, then returned home and had
dinner with neighbors while waiting for her. A motive seems
unclear. There was a life insurance policy of $3,400. Mr. Bechtel
pays the mortgage on the house that he and his wife bought and that
he cannot sell without her signature, friends and officials close
to the case say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mr. Bechtel's in-laws say his decision not to take the
polygraph test has strained their relationship with him. A few
months ago they changed the 800 number on the posters they have
mailed out across the country and on their Web site so it would
ring at their house and not his. A reward has increased to
$100,000, and new posters are being sent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's entirely possible that Steve could have done
something,'' said Joanne Wroe, Mrs. Bechtel's mother. ``But we need
to be open to any possibility.''

IN NEW YORK, MOSQUITOES AND TICKS ARRIVED EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (With CLIMATE-DISEASE)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The warm, wet winter produced by El Nino, combined
with an on-and-off wet spring, stimulated an unusually early
increase of mosquitoes and ticks that might spread disease in the
New York region. But so far no epidemics have materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In this region, where malaria and many other illnesses borne by
insects and other vectors have long been under control, two
weather-influenced diseases are of special concern: Lyme disease
and Eastern equine encephalitis, the former potentially crippling,
the latter potentially fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Two mosquitoes in particular _ the salt-marsh variety and a
similar freshwater type _ thrive in wet-dry cycles like those that
characterized the early summer in this region, said Dominick
Ninivaggi, the vector-control superintendent in Suffolk County on
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The common household mosquito known as culex has also been more
abundant than usual this year, but although these insects have made
the summer a misery for some residents, none of them carry disease.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito to worry about is the freshwater variety Culiseta
melanura. It transmits the encephalitis virus and has been
relatively abundant in places like Manorville, Ninivaggi said.
Measures to control its breeding were taken in the early spring, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the encephalitis virus was detected in some Long Island
mosquitoes; it typically appears in August. No cases have been
recorded on Long Island in recent years, although one person died
from encephalitis in Rhode Island earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, the summer has mostly been dry, and the number of
mosquitoes has consequently dropped, Ninivaggi said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease is spread by the tiny deer tick, and Dr. Richard
Ostfeld, an ecologist at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in
Millbrook, said the warm and wet winter led to an earlier and
bigger appearance of the ticks than usual in early spring.
Nevertheless, Ostfeld said, studies indicate that the total tick
population over the warm season ``should not be extraordinarily
high'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Suffolk County, where the ticks are endemic, disease
statistics seem to jibe with Ostfeld's analysis of the early
season. ``There's no question that there are more ticks around,''
said Dr. David Graham, Suffolk's director of preventive medicine
services.
</P>
<P>
   That has translated to about 250 confirmed cases of Lyme disease
in the county so far, he said. Most of the cases appeared ``a
little ahead of schedule,'' he said, but the total falls within the
range of 600 to 1,200 cases normally expected there each year.
</P>
<P>
   Next year might be different if the predictions of Ostfeld and
his colleagues prove right. They are calling for an extraordinarily
large population of deer ticks for 1999.

USC'S SOWARD WANTS LOW PROFILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If USC is hoping to spotlight R. Jay Soward for any All-American
campaigns, the junior wide receiver might not be a willing
participant this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the only interviews I'll do for the rest of the
year,'' Soward said Sunday. ``I don't want to be in the media life.
I feel it affected my game.''
</P>
<P>
   USC officials will no doubt attempt to convince the flamboyant
Soward to change his mind, but it's clear he enters this season
with a dramatically different attitude. After being suspended
during spring practice and for the season opener against Purdue for
poor academic performance, Soward said he has matured.
</P>
<P>
   Soward can offer as proof that he passed two summer courses he
needed to retain his eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary to me (getting suspended),'' Soward said. ``I
thought (USC coach Paul Hackett) was going to suspend me for two or
three more games if I didn't get good grades.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward has also changed physically, gaining 12 pounds this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he can control his comments remains to be seen. Last
year, he angered Arizona State when he said, ``We're the team of
the future. They're the team of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State ended up winning 35-7.
</P>
<P>
   Soward has vowed that his mouth will not be a significant aspect
of his game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to learn not to talk too much,'' Soward
said. ``I'm just trying to help myself and the team. It doesn't
sound like me. Maybe I've matured.''
</P>
<P>
   Good shape: USC players were put through conditioning drills
Saturday evening and Hackett was pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people in the best shape of their lives,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Trojans get transfer: Kansas State defensive end Matt Childers
has transferred to USC. Childers (6-foot-4, 265 pounds) played at
Chabot Community College in Northern California last year but
participated in spring drills at Kansas State. He will redshirt
this season and have two years of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good future,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Sugg finished: Sophomore offensive lineman Joel Sugg has decided
to quit playing football because of a back injury. He will remain
on scholarship as a medical redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Sugg's departure means USC has lost three of the seven offensive
linemen who signed in 1996. Center Pat Smith transferred to San
Diego State last year. Guard Mike Whitcanack also quit playing
football.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough reports: As expected, freshman tailback Sultan
McCullough reported Saturday after being academically cleared by
the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Windrell Hayes is expected to report Thursday, if
he pays $8,500 in damages and a judge accepts his plea bargain
Wednesday for writing bad checks.
</P>
<P>
   Practice dates: USC will practice at UC Irvine through Aug. 28.
Practices are open to the public except Aug. 15, 19, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27 and 28.

CORONADO'S QUEST HOLDS OFF VICTORY GALLUP TO WIN $1 MILLION
HASKELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEANPORT, N.J. _ Five months ago, trainer Shug McGaughey left
Gulfstream Park a frustrated and disappointed man, his hopes of
taking Coronado's Quest to the Kentucky Derby in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he left Monmouth Park with the dream of a championship
for the talented 3-year-old colt very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest, whose fractious behavior in the Florida Derby
kept him out of the Kentucky Derby, put himself squarely in the
battle for year-end honors when he held off the stretch run of
Victory Gallop to win the $1 million Haskell, his first Grade I
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Behaving beautifully before a Haskell-record crowd of 40,405
that had made him the 3-5 favorite, Coronado's Quest stalked the
early pace set by the long shot Arctic Sweep and then moved up
quickly to take the lead on the far turn.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the stretch, Coronado's Quest, a chestnut son of
Forty Niner, first shook a strong challenge from Grand Slam and
then turned back the expected bid from the late-running Victory
Gallop, the Belmont Stakes winner. Victory Gallop, who was ridden
by Gary Stevens, charged along the rail to within 1\ lengths of the
winner at the end of the mile-and-an-eighth race.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens lodged an objection against Coronado's Quest, who was
ridden by Mike Smith, for drifting in in the final yards, but it
was quickly disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I bothered that horse at all,'' said Smith.
``It didn't affect the outcome by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand Slam held on for third, a half-length back, and was
followed under the wire by Ian's Thunder, Tomorrow's Cat and Arctic
Sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign started today for him,'' McGaughey said of
Coronado's Quest's chances for a championship. The colt missed the
Preakness and the Belmont because of a minor foot injury but
returned with victories in the Riva Ridge and the Dwyer at Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we had been pointing toward,'' McGaughey said.
``We came up against a horse today who has been to the battles and
we beat him. Now, we have to beat him again.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be in the 1 1/4-mile Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 29,
a race Victory Gallop's trainer, Elliott Walden, believes will be
more to his colt's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along this was a two-race series, the Haskell,
then the Travers,'' said Walden, whose colt finished second in the
Derby and the Preakness to Real Quiet. ``That day will be to our
advantage. He definitely is still in the running for champion
honors. His record speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop has four victories in seven starts, with two
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coronado's Quest was the best one today,'' Walden added. ``He
had some advantages with the track. We knew we were taking a chance
of getting him beat because of how this track plays.''
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey acknowledged that Monmouth's speed-favoring,
tight-turned track was very much to the liking of Coronado's Quest,
who covered the nine furlongs in 1:48 3/5 as he extended his record
to four victories in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory Gallop will be tough coming back at 1 1/4 miles with
those big turns at Saratoga,'' McGaughey said. ``We'll have to be
tough, too. I saw what I wanted to out there today _ he responded
to two good challenges. A good hard race was what he needed and
that's what he got.''
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest returned $3.40 for a $2 bet to win and earned
$600,000 for Stuart Janney Jr., who had concurred with McGaughey's
opinion this spring that the colt was too badly behaved to risk
taking to the carnival-like atmosphere at Churchill Downs. But a
minor surgical procedure performed before the colt left Florida to
correct his breathing, coupled with the extra time McGaughey and
his staff spent with him, all seem to have turned him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left the races Florida Derby Day I was a pretty
humiliated guy,'' McGaughey said. ``I was pretty down. I was
disappointed in the horse, second-guessing myself _ I didn't know
what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty proud guy,'' he said. ``I think we've got a
contender.'' &QL;

ADVERTISING: BRITISH CAMPAIGN FOCUSES ON YEAR 2000 COMPUTER
PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Get your business ready for the bug,'' a gigantic
yellow-and-black billboard screams in the heavily trafficked
Leicester Square subway station near London's West End theater
district.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bug'' in question is the millennium bug, the technological
apocalypse that may wreak havoc on computers at the end of the
century if they have not been upgraded to understand when the year
changes from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The gigantic billboard is just one of 3,175 posted in and around
London as part of an ambitious $17 million advertising campaign
that seeks to make small and mid-sized businesses aware of the
potential heart attack their computers may suffer without a visit
from a digital doctor, or ``bug buster,'' as Prime Minister Tony
Blair has referred to the technological experts who are in short
supply to re-code Britain's computers.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is sponsored by Action 2000, a government agency
that was set up last fall to help prepare Britain's businesses for
the potential computer problems at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although awareness of the millennium bug is high,'' said
Gwynneth Flower, managing director of Action 2000, ``too many small
and medium-sized businesses have yet to implement a plan of
action.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the agency, only one in four British businesses has
``taken realistic measures to tackle the bug within their own
organizations.'' The campaign, which began several weeks ago in
print and on billboards, aims to provoke computer users to call
Action 2000's telephone hot line or go on line to the
organization's Web site (http://www.bug2000.co.uk) to get detailed
information on the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ads have appeared as double-page spreads in The
Times of London, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent and The
Guardian, as well as others.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this many companies think they're ready when in fact
they're not, then the small-business sector of U.K. PLC as a whole
is suffering a worrying perception vacuum,'' said Don Cruickshank,
chairman of Action 2000, referring to the low number of companies
that are prepared for the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry experts seem to be doing some worrying of
their own about the effectiveness of the new campaign. ``I don't
want to knock it because it's better than nothing,'' said Andy
Kyte, an analyst at Gartner Group in London. ``But it's
questionable whether the material they are providing is
comprehensive enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The danger is you get everyone aware of the problem
without the resources to support everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign, which was created by the London-based
agency FCA, a unit of Publicis SA, and is also scheduled to include
television and radio spots in early fall, is part of a larger
government-sponsored initiative to support small and medium-sized
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Blair announced that the government would spend $160
million to help eradicate the bug, in part, by providing grants to
train 20,000 people throughout Britain to understand the
technological complexities of the problem. The government hopes to
use young people as well as older unemployed or retired people to
help small and mid-sized businesses recode their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without careful preparation, there could be major disruption
to essential services such as benefit payments, or even to
emergency services such as hospitals, the fire and the police,''
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium bug results from a computer's inability to
recognize the year 2000 because it recognizes only the last two
digits of any given year, making many computers interpret the year
2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   One consulting company that has been very critical of the
British government's handling of the year 2000 problem conceded
that the new campaign might be helpful. ``The campaign is the first
positive step the government has made,'' said Richard Coppel, chief
executive of Prove It 2000. ``Other governments ought to take a
look.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coppel still finds fault with the campaign. ``We have a
problem when we keep telling them about the issue but not providing
an adequate solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that with less than a year and a half to go
before January 2000, any information is beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is you need awareness and education,'' Kyte of the
Gartner Group said, ``even if it is at this late stage.''

YANKEES PULL OUT ANOTHER WIN, 5-4, OVER ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trying to teach instincts to a baseball player is
like trying to eat a bowl of soup with a fork: basically
impossible. You can try and try, but you will almost always be
unsuccessful. You have a spoon, or you do not. You have instincts,
or you do not.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter has excellent base-running instincts, and Ramiro
Mendoza has excellent pitching instincts. Because Jeter never
stopped running as he tried to steal second base in the eighth
inning, and because Mendoza has never treated his switch to the
bullpen as a demotion, the Yankees managed to steal a 5-4 victory
over the Royals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The march toward history continued for the Yankees, who do not
think they should ever lose a game, and usually do not. Andy
Pettitte was listless in his first start in 10 days, following a
muscle strain in his left shoulder, and he dumped the Yankees in a
4-1 ditch after five and a half innings. The Yankees yawned,
realized they still had a game to win and delighted a Beanie Babies
crowd of 55,911 at Yankee Stadium by doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to win every time out,'' Jeter said. ``We know it's
not going to happen, but that doesn't mean we don't think we can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they did it again to sweep the four-game series from the
Royals while outscoring them, 41-9. The Yankees improved to a
ridiculous 84-29 for the season and a just-as-ridiculous 42-8 at
home. If anyone definitely expected the Yankees to rally against
Hipolito Pichardo and Kansas City's bullpen, it was the 25 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that we're not satisfied to just play
pretty well,'' said Scott Brosius, who homered for New York's first
run. ``There's a desire in all of us to win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   That desire manifested itself with one out in the eighth, after
Jeter walked on a 3-2 pitch with the score tied, 4-4. Jeter bolted
for second base on Scott Service's 1-0 pitch to Paul O'Neill, and
shrewdly looked back at the plate twice. He saw a wild pitch whiz
by Royals catcher Sal Fasano when he was about 20 feet from second,
so he never hesitated and cruised into third easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said we were fortunate or lucky when we were
winning earlier in the season,'' Jeter said. ``I think you make
your own breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre raved about the critical play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got such great instincts,'' Torre said. ``Those are
things you can't teach. I'm sure that put pressure on. Now they
weren't allowed to allow us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. Service intentionally walked O'Neill to set up a
double play. But Bernie Williams looped a single to left center.
Had Jeter only taken second, he probably would not have scored on
the hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things like that can win you a game or two during the
season,'' O'Neill said. ``Today, it did that for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Jeter's dash, Mendoza had replaced Pettitte with two outs
in the sixth inning and the Yankees behind, 4-1. After the Yankees
scored three runs in the bottom of the sixth on O'Neill's two-run
double and Williams' sacrifice fly, Mendoza was unhittable.
Mendoza, who was pushed to the bullpen by Orlando Hernandez's
success, was terrific in retiring seven of eight batters and
permitting only one ball to reach the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel mad about going to the bullpen,'' said Mendoza
(8-2). ``I'm still going to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis will take batting practice at Yankee Stadium on
Monday before continuing his rehabilitation assignment at Class AAA
Columbus on Tuesday. . . . The crowd of 55,911 was the second
largest of the season, behind the 56,717 on opening day, and was
the 10th largest in the 23-year history of the remodeled Yankee
Stadium.

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ She already knew that her son was dead.
</P>
<P>
   But as Sue Bartley and 150 other mourners left a memorial
service here Sunday for the American victims of Friday's terrorist
bombing, they were hoping against hope that Mrs. Bartley's husband,
Consul General Julian Bartley, was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   They listened to a reading from Ecclesiastes, heard a mournful
rendering of taps and then went home to wait, grasping red roses in
trembling hands.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, their wisp of a hope was gone. Using torn
clothing, strands of hair and a ring, doctors positively identified
Bartley's badly disfigured body Sunday evening, adding his name to
a list of 11 dead Americans that included the Bartleys' 20-year-old
son, Jay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the last missing American,'' Chris Scharf, an embassy
spokesman, said of Bartley.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts the father and son were an immensely popular duo
whose headlong embrace of Kenyan life had been lovingly returned by
the people they met and befriended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julian was greatly loved by Kenyans,'' Scharf said, ``not only
because of his respect of them, but also because of his ability to
relate to the person who was trembling in line for a visa. He would
leave his office and go outside the embassy and work the line,
talking to people, asking them about themselves. He was
extraordinarily popular among Kenyans, even those who might be
denied a visa.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bartley was discovered missing, Kenyan soldiers searched
for him in local emergency rooms and the public morgue. But later
his body was found in a private mortuary where a tag misidentified
the body as that of a Kenyan, Scharf said.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony at Ambassador Prudence Bushnell's residence
Sunday, colleagues ``spoke about how Julian had touched so many
people,'' said Donald Mackenzie, director of the regional office of
the U.S. Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very special person,'' said Mackenzie, who found it
difficult to talk about his friend and colleague in the past tense.
``When he talks to you, you feel like you are the most important
person in the room, and not that he was looking around to see if
there was someone more important around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great sense of humor. Though I guess it isn't so
funny now, he used to say to people who came to him, `I'll take
care of you from womb to tomb.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley, 55, was born in Jacksonville, Fla., according to a
statement released by his daughter, Edith, who lives in the United
States and was en route Sunday night to Nairobi to join her mother.
He grew up in South Jamaica, Queens, where his mother, Gladys
Baldwin, still lives. He worked for the Foreign Service for 24
years, including assignments in the Dominican Republic, Colombia,
Spain, Israel and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's crowded memorial service, held on the porch of
Bushnell's home, Bartley's friends recalled how he once took a
night job to help pay some medical bills for his son Jay.

   To people who knew him, Jay Bartley had come to Kenya full of
youthful enthusiasm about Africa about two years ago. And when he
died, he had carved a young man's comfortably frenetic niche for
himself in Nairobi, coaching a girl's basketball team, jet skiing
at African beaches and teaching friends how to ride horses.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the bombing, Jay Bartley was working at the
embassy in a summer job, preparing for his sophomore year at the
U.S. International University in the Kasarani section of Nairobi,
about 12 miles from the city center. The college is based in San
Diego, but has an 1,800-student campus in Nairobi.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview, Freida Brown, executive director of the
university's Nairobi campus, said Jay Bartley had planned to spend
one more year in Nairobi before returning to the United States to
complete his bachelor's degree, possibly in international
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the explosion first hit, you felt detached from it,'' she
said. ``But Saturday morning, when they called me and said he had
died, I was totally distraught. Because I knew him and I could just
see him walking across that campus.''
</P>
<P>
   She described Jay Bartley as gentle, outgoing and caring, a
lanky young man with a wide grin and soft voice. He coached the
girl's basketball team at his former high school, the International
School of Kenya, and was known for teaching friends how to ride
horses. ``He was the kind of kid who got up first and made his
parents breakfast in the morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to Mombassa with some friends, Ms. Brown
recalled, Jay Bartley took it on himself to oversee the welfare of
a female student who had broken her leg after falling off her jet
ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took her to the hospital,'' Ms. Brown said. ``Then after
her foot was put in a cast, he piggybacked her to the bus. He was
always looking after other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said Jay Bartley had a learning disability that made
it difficult for him to complete written tests, but that he had
more than compensated with a buoyant, dogged personality and a
laptop computer provided by his father. ``It was a real struggle
for him, but he never let that stop him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown described Julian Bartley and his wife as similar to
their son: easygoing, upbeat, sociable people. ``Julian always had
a big smile and hug for everybody,'' she said. ``They were three of
a kind.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the Bartley home on Saturday, Ms. Brown
described Mrs. Bartley as being ``in a state of shock.'' Yet she
still had enough presence of mind to ask Ms. Brown whether she had
received a cookbook from the Nairobi American Women's Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's amazing,'' said Ms. Brown. ``She was looking after
people even in this time of sorrow.''

NOSTALGIA AND INNOVATION IN YIDDISH SONGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This is the second article in a series describing cultural
events through their audiences' experiences. The previous article
described a performance by the Argentine troupe De la Guarda.) 
(js) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faye Schutzberger was sitting in a 148-year-old
synagogue that has been turned into an otherworldly performance
space, trying to explain the elusive appeal of the language of her
ancestors and the long-lost music it spawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``S geyt tsu dem hartz; it goes to the heart,'' she finally said
as her eyes swept the faded elegance of the neo-Gothic building,
modeled after the Cathedral of Cologne, on the Lower East Side.
``It's soul music. Yiddish soul music. It affects you the way no
other music can.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times when audiences and performers have different
agendas and times when they are looking for precisely the same
thing. But it's hard to think of a case where the planets are more
passionately aligned than the hyperbolic evocation of Jewish roots,
``Mamaloshen'' (``Mother Tongue''), being performed by Mandy
Patinkin at what is now the Angel Orensanz Foundation and Center
for the Arts at 172 Norfolk St., near Houston Street.
</P>
<P>
   For Patinkin and for his audience, his hour-long concert of
Yiddish songs _ and quintessentially American ones translated into
Yiddish _ is less a performance than a seance, a way to connect
with a past that seems at once both utterly lost and somehow eerily
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the imagined past is wholly consistent with the real one
is open to debate, and it's safe to say an evening of Patinkin's
singing in Yiddish is not everyone's idea of artistic bliss.
</P>
<P>
   But for Mrs. Schutzberger, 80, who has lived her whole life in
the Flatbush section of Brooklyn; for Felice Spector and her
mother, Florey Stein; for Irving Goldberg, Martha Bergman and Roz
Schapira, who are part of a Yiddish club affiliated with the
Woodstock Jewish Congregation, no less than Patinkin, his
performance each night is like peeking into an overflowing chest,
long since discarded, with a combination of wonder and bewilderment
at what might be inside.
</P>
<P>
   So when Sylvia Herscher, 84, found herself standing on the
corner of Norfolk and Houston streets the other day, a few blocks
from the site of the wholesale hardware store her father used to
own, the mere existence of Patinkin's show and the surprising
vitality of the world it evoked was cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' she said to her cousin, Phyllis Schwartz.
``There hasn't been as much action on Norfolk Street in 50 years.
What is this? Remembrance of things past?''
</P>
<P>
   The show's genesis dates back to the beginning of the decade
when Joseph Papp asked Patinkin to record a song, ``Youssel,
Youssel,'' in Yiddish. Given Patinkin's theatrical (critics
sometimes say too theatrical) style, the emotional megatonnage of
the material seemed a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   Papp was so taken by what he heard that he told Patinkin: ``You
have to do this music. This is your job.''
</P>
<P>
   After Papp's death in 1991, the job slowly became a calling, and
then a mission and then an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm freest, I'm most able to express myself when I sing,''
Patinkin said one morning in his study in his Upper West Side
apartment. The study is jammed with family, career, model railroad
and Jewish memorabilia, like a plaque reading ``Dybbuk stops
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And for some reason, singing that song in Yiddish tripled the
experience,'' he continued. ``For all the times I've been
criticized for being over the top, maybe I was drawn to this music
because it invites it. It almost demands it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, I was born singing in the wrong language because the
people who wrote and sang these songs were the greatest
storytellers ever of family and journey, life, birth, death, joy,
sorrow. And I realized that this was where Tin Pan Alley began,
that before there was the music I began singing, before Gershwin
and Irving Berlin and Rodgers and Hammerstein, there was Yiddish
music.''
</P>
<P>
   To do the show, Patinkin immersed himself in Yiddish language,
literature and song, including studying every morning at 7 with
Moishe Rosenfeld, who presides over New York's only daily Yiddish
radio show. The result, first in a Nonesuch CD and then in the
show, is an improbable musical stew that's one part rediscovery of
the lost past and one part reinterpretation of the familiar
present.
</P>
<P>
   So the songs include old Yiddish numbers like ``Belz,'' a lament
for a small town, or ``Papirosin,'' about a poor cigarette seller;
``Unter Dayne Vayse Shtern'' (``Under Your White Stars''), a
Holocaust song, and ``Lid Fun Titanic'' (``Song of the Titanic''),
a Yiddish take on the sinking, pre-Leonardo.
</P>
<P>
   But they also include Patinkin's entirely unlikely Yiddish
versions of familiar songs like ``Maria'' (rendered as ``Mayn
Mirl'' ) from ``West Side Story,'' ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game''
(``Nem Mikh Mit Tsu der Ball Geym'') and ``God Bless America''
(``Got Bentsh Amerike''), replete with an unfurled oversize flag.
All of this provides a vertiginous experience of somehow sounding
unsettlingly right when rendered in Yiddish, as if plucked whole
from a parallel universe.
</P>
<P>
   For Patinkin the music resonates on at least three levels:
first, for its role in the development of American song; second,
for its evocation of his own Jewish past, and third, for its
evocation of the American immigrant experience. But he said the
degree to which the production is both indelibly Jewish and
patently American explains in part the mystery of how listeners
seem both transfixed and somehow comprehending of music in a
language only a small percentage of them understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mystery I can't explain, but I did not grow up with
this stuff, and it speaks to me,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   For much of the audience, it's the specific, not the universal,
elements of the music and culture that mean the most. So for the
mother and daughter, Ms. Spector and Mrs. Stein, the appeal was
very much rooted in the pickles at Gus', the egg creams at Katz's,
the smell and texture of Orchard and Ludlow and Essex streets.
</P>
<P>
   For Goldberg, it was more the survival of Yiddish and what he
saw as a revival of culture he once thought was certain to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how many people listen to klezmer music?'' he said
excitedly. ``Not just among Jews, but even among gentiles? That's
why you see so many young people here.''
</P>
<P>
   At which point he spied three young women walking in together
who turned out to be three Mormon sisters, Christy, Laura and Emily
Summerhays, from Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss, may I see you a minute, please?'' he said to the first
one. ``I don't want to get too personal, but we're doing an
interview here. How old are you?''
</P>
<P>
   He beamed when Christy Summerhays, an aspiring actress, said she
was 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' he said. ``You get my point?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the point is open to endless interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Schutzberger, who grew up in a Yiddish-speaking home, was
not happy with the English version of Paul Simon's ``American
Tune,'' which Patinkin uses as a bridge weaving through the
performance and as a way to convey a sense of the production to
those who don't speak Yiddish. And she was not convinced the show
was more than a glimpse of a dying culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's like a last gasp,'' she said. ``For those of us
that grew up with it, this is a part of us. It's almost cellular.
But I try to get my daughter interested in Yiddish music or
theater, and she has no interest. It's not part of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   And not everyone was taken with the emotional temperature of the
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little of Mandy goes a long way,'' one woman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the show has been such a success that it has been extended
from its original closing date, last Saturday, to Aug. 22. After
that the Orensanz will not be available, but Patinkin is searching
for another theater. And both for those who lived the vanished
world of the Lower East Side (``Loved it, loved it, loved it,''
Mrs. Stein said as she bounded off for a hot dog and an egg cream
at Katz's) and those, Jewish or not, who knew it third-hand or not
at all, most people seemed profoundly moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the language, but you still understand,'' Christy
Summerhays said. ``I never felt I was missing out.''
</P>
<P>
   How far the show will go toward fostering the embryonic revival
of interest in Yiddish culture is not clear. But Rosenfeld said
Patinkin had fulfilled all his missionary instincts and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the album and the show, more people are being turned onto
Yiddish culture now than at any time in the past 25 years,''
Rosenfeld said. ``It's important for people to know, to have some
respectful acknowledgment of the beauty of this culture. That's
what Mandy's doing. How far it goes, only time will tell. But it's
all good. That's the key. It's all about doing good for the soul.''

FAVORITE TRICK WINS JIM DANDY BY A NOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ In the other half of the day's
sweepstakes for 3-year-old honors, Favorite Trick won the Jim Dandy
Stakes by a nose with a dramatic rally that showed the class of a
Horse of the Year, but not many clues to his future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the colt's stirring success, it remained most unlikely
that he would go on to the Travers Stakes in three weeks to
challenge Coronado's Quest, who won the $1 million Haskell
Invitational at Monmouth Park, and Victory Gallop, who finished
second to Coronado's Quest. Both races were ranked as preps for the
Travers and the year-end prize, the Eclipse Award for the best
3-year-old colt of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick played the starring role in his part of the show
by prevailing in a tight three-horse finish by the length of his
nose over Deputy Diamond, who won second by a neck over Raffie's
Majesty. Then it was only a length and a half back to Scatmandu in
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Jim Dandy also became a personal triumph for Bill Mott,
trainer of Favorite Trick, coming on the day before his induction
into the Racing Hall of Fame. And it punctuated a ringing weekend
for Pat Day, who won the Whitney Handicap on Saturday aboard
Awesome Again and returned Sunday to win the Jim Dandy with
Favorite Trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He proved that he was a champion last year,'' Mott said of
Favorite Trick, ``and he was named Horse of the Year, and
rightfully so. That was 1997, and he's now shown this year that
he's good enough to win at a mile and an eighth. He's never run a
bad race other than the Kentucky Derby, and that was at a distance
that didn't suit him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Derby, which was run at a mile and a quarter, Favorite
Trick ran eighth. The only other race he lost was the
mile-and-an-eighth Arkansas Derby, when he ran third in a scramble
behind Victory Gallop. His record now is 11 victories in 13 starts,
but Mott again doubted that he could win beyond a mile and an
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Travers, run at a mile and a quarter, Mott said:
``It's probably something we're not planning to do right now. I do
think we'll stay away from that race, but we'd like to discuss it
for about a week or so. Grass is an option for him, and it's
something we may look to do down the line because he's worked over
it and we know he handles it. A flat mile may suit him because we
know if we're thinking about the Breeders' Cup, we obviously are
not going to run him in the mile-and-a-quarter Classic. We'd like
to keep our options open and find out what it is that he does
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick ran third much of the way Sunday, stalking the
early speed flashed by Rock and Roll, who led for nearly one mile.
Right on his heels came Scatmandu, who briefly poked his head in
front as they turned for home. At that point, Favorite Trick seemed
to be losing ground. But Day changed paths, found daylight and
raced from fourth place to first in the deep stretch, where he
stuck his nose in front at just the right time in a gutsy
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick ran the mile and an eighth in 1:50 flat, paid
$5.90 for a $2 bet to win and earned $150,000, raising his career
income past $1.5 million. Limit Out, who was one of the early
favorites, was scratched a couple of hours before the race because
he was coughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Favorite Trick has had a pretty good year,'' Day said, ``but
obviously he's not handling the competition with the authority he
did last year. But he's getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   The race was run before 61,190 fans on a sunny afternoon in the
Adirondacks, conditions that helped surpass the attendance record
of 58,269 set last Aug. 3. But the precise number of spectators who
attended on both days was doubtless somewhat lower because both
were promoted with souvenir T-shirts, and many in both crowds went
through the turnstiles several times and willingly paid the $2
admission charge more than once to get more gifts. . . . At 45,
Bill Mott will become the youngest trainer inducted into the Racing
Hall of Fame when he is enshrined at Saratoga on Monday. He was
elected to the Hall of Fame along with Jacinto Vasquez, the jockey,
who rode 5,231 winners and twice won the Kentucky Derby, and Ansel
Williamson, who started training horses during the 1850s while
still a slave and later, after being freed, went on to train
Aristides, the winner of the first Kentucky Derby in 1875.

FORMER GREEN BERET SUES OVER CNN-TIME REPORT  
 MILKEN'S LATEST VENTURE: CO-WRITING A COOKBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif.)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cable News Network and Time magazine have been served with the
first lawsuit filed in response to their joint ``CNN Newsstand''
report in June contending that the U.S. military dropped lethal
nerve gas in Laos in 1970. In what could be a harbinger of
expensive legal bills to come for the two Time Warner companies,
the suit was filed by a man who was never even named in the CNN
report or its companion article in Time.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Plancich, a former Green Beret who was on the so-called
Operation Tailwind mission that day 28 years ago, filed a $100
million lawsuit against Cable News Network and Time on Thursday in
U.S. District Court in Miami, saying he had been defamed by the
June report, even though it was publicly retracted a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Although not named, he appeared in photographs, both on CNN and
in Time, of what Time called a ``hatchet force'' sent to ``wipe out
a Laotian village suspected of harboring American defectors.''
</P>
<P>
   That accusation angered Plancich, said his lawyers, Edward Horan
and Mitchell Cook. ``CNN focused in on the nerve-gas issue,'' Horan
said, ``and the Pentagon got involved investigating very quickly
because of that allegation, plus the question of whether anyone
killed was an American defector. But they all glossed over the
allegations of killing women and children _ crimes punishable by
death under international military law.''
</P>
<P>
   After inquiries by both the Pentagon and CNN's own legal team
found insufficient evidence to support the ``Newsstand''
allegations, CNN and Time executives retracted them and issued
profuse apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The network also negotiated an undisclosed monetary settlement
with retired Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff in 1970, whom CNN had depicted as having confirmed the use of
nerve gas. CNN also offered a settlement to the mission's
commanding officer, Lt. Col. Eugene McCarley, who rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the network said CNN would not comment on
pending legal action. Horan said that Plancich, who lives in Key
West, Fla., was not interviewed by CNN for the Tailwind report.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's own internal investigation of the coverage criticized the
journalists who produced the Tailwind segment _ two of whom were
dismissed _ but took pains to say that those journalists believed
that what they were reporting was true.
</P>
<P>
   That may make it difficult for Plancich to prove the reporters
acted with ``actual malice'' _ a requirement for winning a libel
judgment on behalf of a public official. Some libel experts said a
court would most likely regard an Army sergeant as a public
official.
</P>
<P>
   Although a deliberate effort to avoid the truth can be evidence
of malice, that, too, is difficult to prove. But Horan indicated
that he might try to prove just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hearing two sides all along,'' he said, ``but they
basically chose to discount the versions that didn't go along with
their story line.''

   Milken's Latest Venture: Co-Writing a Cookbook
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity cookbooks are nothing new. But now Michael Milken _
the man whose enormous appetite for power, money and junk bonds led
to his conviction for securities fraud _ is serving time as a
recipe monger.
</P>
<P>
   Using the nom de spoon Mike Milken, he is co-author with his
personal chef, Beth Ginsberg, of ``The Taste for Living Cookbook:
Mike Milken's Favorite Recipes for Fighting Cancer.'' The book,
which the Time-Life Books unit of Time Warner will distribute as a
50,000-copy first printing in September, is part of Milken's
personal and public battle against the disease. His prostate cancer
is now in remission.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from California, Milken, 52, said that
when advanced prostate cancer was diagnosed in February 1993 and he
was told he had 12 to 18 months to live, he decided not to follow
the example of his friend Steven J. Ross, the former Time Warner
chairman, who had died of the same disease a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Milken recalled that Ross thought ``the idea of giving up eating
the food you love is the same as giving up life'' _ even though
leading researchers say that a low-fat diet high in fruits,
vegetables and soy products may be an effective tool in combating
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Milken changed his diet as part of his treatment regimen _
although, initially, he said, eating became ``more of a burden than
a pleasure.'' That is, until Ms. Ginsberg, who trained at the
Culinary Institute of America, taught him that ``you could make
healthy food taste like and look like the food you grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-color, large-format book, which will sell for $27.50,
was designed and edited by the Boston-based book packagers Allen &AMP;
Osborne. It includes a six-page first-person memoir of Milken's
eating life _ although his time in jail is not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Time-Life will distribute the book for the publisher, Cap Cure,
the prostate-cancer charity that Milken founded. Cap Cure will
receive all the profits from the book.
</P>
<P>
   When Milken goes to New York to publicize the book in
mid-September, he will be eschewing the kind of junk food he once
chewed while standing at his desk trading junk bonds. He now
recommends low-fat or fat-free delicacies like ``Eggs Michael,''
``Vegetable Reuben'' and ``Devil's `Fool' Cake.''

THE PRIMAL NEED TO ESCAPE INTO THE MIND OF A WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  (culture column) 
(js) 
 BY MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why are we still ranting, dissenting, defending,
brooding and quarreling _ gloating when writers we love appear,
ready to hurl thunderbolts when they don't _ about the Modern
Library board's hubris-ridden list of what it considers the best
novels published in English since our century began?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just the obvious sight of canons clashing. It's the
fact that the literary industry is manipulating us exactly as the
fashion industry does: imposing dictates that seem omniscient when
they are just the result of personal taste and a determination to
maintain or regain an idealized status quo. And the result is to
mingle the demands of public reading and the rewards of private
reading in a distasteful way.
</P>
<P>
   Public reading is part of our education, our work, whether that
work consists of being a student, a scholar or an ordinary
citizen-reader keeping up with cultural news. Public reading is
also a continuing mass entertainment that lets us be audience and
players simultaneously, as when we join book clubs or read
self-help books and best sellers. And public reading is what leads
to the making of best-books lists, whether they are readers' lists
of the century's greatest, compiled by the English bookstore chain
Waterstone's last year, or the Modern Library list, compiled by an
editorial board of 10 and announced last month.
</P>
<P>
   That list is now on the Internet, side-by-side with a Readers'
Top 100. And the pairing can remind you of those ``What kind of
person are you?'' tests that magazines so love to run, where none
of the answers remotely fit you. If the Modern Library's top pick
is ``Ulysses,'' a masterpiece I wish never to read again, and the
readers' top pick is ``Atlas Shrugged,'' a mastodon I wish never to
go near again, to whom do I turn?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe lists like these can operate like allergy shots and send
us all back, brains and sensibilities unclogged, to the pleasures
of private reading. Private reading is what we do because we want
to, and it can range from the compulsion that marks the thriller
binge to the more contemplative quest for linguistic and emotional
harmony that certain poems bring.
</P>
<P>
   Are you, like some actors, a reader who likes to play out (and
play in) certain kinds of scenarios again and again, to stay in one
century or another, at most two continents, where you always know
your way and the thrill comes from tracing it over and over with
variations in tone and mood? Are you one who sets out to master
every text, the reader as intrepid conqueror or contestant,
underlining and talking back in the margins, or the sort who
wanders through the sounds, sights and stories, happy to suspend
judgment until the experience is complete?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the reading groups that are so popular right now seem
to combine the private and public modes very well. Explorers,
pedagogues and homebodies can all be accommodated. And on a good
night, you can get the intellectual pleasures of the best college
seminars plus the confessional tension that marked your private
talks about literature in those years _ years when what you read
and how you responded to it seemed to say everything about who you
wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   Lists usually combine the two less honorably. A word like
``best'' can cover a book that many acknowledge to be a masterpiece
whether or not they love or even like it. (I'm not alone in finding
``Ulysses'' the most obvious example.) But it is just as likely to
apply to a definite nonmasterpiece that someone wanted to be deemed
``the best'' simply because he or she loved it so. (``Deliverance''
and ``Lord of the Flies,'' anyone?)
</P>
<P>
   The Waterstone's readers' list, which used the word ``greatest''
and included nonfiction, will give everyone something to gag at,
but it is the most honest in its display of tastes and motives.
There are children's books like ``Winnie-the-Pooh'' and ``James and
the Giant Peach''; there is science fiction; there is Delia Smith's
``Complete Cookery Course,'' for heaven's sake. And while I have no
wish to see ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``Jurassic Park'' take up
space anywhere, they qualify because it is clear that readers take
``the greatest'' to mean not simply the best but the most
shamelessly (or shamefully) entertaining, as in ``the greatest show
on earth.''

   The Modern Library list strikes one (certainly this one) as
disingenuous. There are what look like trade-offs involving fine
minor writers. (You can have Henry Green if I can have Dashiell
Hammett.) There is the virtual 50-50 split between British and
American writers. English-speaking African writers simply don't
exist: no Chinua Achebe, no Nadine Gordimer, with their narrative
ambitions and complexities. Britain's post-World War II women are
deft and tidy sorts like Iris Murdoch and Muriel Spark; nothing
impressively large-scale like Pat Barker's World War I trilogy. And
no living American women, certainly not amid all those living
American men. (Might Toni Morrison be getting a wrist-slap for
winning a Nobel prize before any of them did? And why ignore John
Updike while paying homage to John Cheever, Saul Bellow, Philip
Roth and Norman Mailer?)
</P>
<P>
   But back to a pleasanter topic: the business of how we live our
private reading lives. An analyst could tell as much about us by
our books as by our dreams. Some needs are as simple and as primal
as childhood's: William Blake, to infuse oneself with a kind of
visionary courage; the haiku of Richard Wright, to see and feel a
powerful human will merge with the impersonal precision of the
natural world. Pleasures have to be worked for in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   When I read Shakespeare I know that I am going to have to slow
down for the words and phrases I don't know, which isn't at all the
same thing as slowing down to savor one of his gorgeously
worked-through chains of images. When I read the stunningly banal
prose of Mary Higgins Clark, I grit my teeth and resolve to charge
through her bald yet coy sentences for the sake of the girl-Gothic
thrills I crave at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   I consider every 19th-century novel I read, however wise, bold
or terrifying, a form of escapism. They are costume dramas now;
they give us disguises and shield us from the present, even as they
show us things we need to know (or things we are missing and still
want). I don't look down on escapism, because the greatest
literature offers escape of every sort. ``Beauty is truth, truth
beauty'' is a noble escapist creed; it aims to help us flee what is
low and dishonest in our lives and create something finer.
</P>
<P>
   But every 20th-century novel of quality gives us something we
cannot do without: the rhythms and dissonances, the evasions and
the inevitabilities of the way we live now. What a safe, timid
little ``we'' the Modern Library board has chosen to define itself
as, and in what a small, circumscribed way it has chosen to live
now.

JACOB'S PILLOW: TRIUMPH FOR AMERICAN INDIAN DANCE THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BECKET, Mass. _ The American Indian Dance Theater's new
``Kotuwokan'' got off to a slow start on Saturday night at the Ted
Shawn Theater at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival here. But by the
close of the evening, the company had succeeded triumphantly in an
ambitious project, ending in a grand finale with a stageful of
dancers and musicians performing as one vivid whole.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been enough to merit the kinds of cheers and
youthful screams that greeted the company when the curtain rose
again on the bowing ensemble. But those closing moments of the
piece, a suite of dances whose title means ``come celebrate the
dance'' in the Algonquin language, were also extremely poignant. In
trying to suggest the vital survival of tradition, Hanay Geiogamah,
who conceived and directed ``Kotuwokan,'' also suggested that it
was possible to make fresh formal art of age-old ritual, practiced
here by a company founded 10 years ago to preserve and popularize
traditional American Indian dance and music.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the inclusion in the piece of a dance
created for the company by the modern-dance choreographer Laura
Dean. And Ms. Dean's quartet ``New Dance,'' performed by Rod
Atcheynum, Lisa Odjig-Fisher, Dawn Russell and Dmitri Seth, was a
shimmering little jewel of a piece that took a rather rigidly
circumscribed vocabulary of small walking steps, colored by tilts
and dips of the torso, and turned it into rich, minimalist art. One
thought of Paul Klee's glowing magic-square paintings, watching the
performers move together in a line and then separate for solos
clearly drawn from their individual gifts and styles, waving small
fronds of bright ribbons as they danced.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive was the way Geiogamah sewed the piece into
the larger quilt of the new work. A lone traveler's journey through
time and a culture _ a familiar genre in the these multiculturalist
days _ ``Kotuwokan'' incorporated a city street scene, old forms
like the Fancy Shawl Dance, Hoop Dance and a variety of animal
dances, and scenes of hunting and battle. The traveler died and was
brought back to life, borne up by the long wings of attendant
eagles. The piece built into dances that gave the performers a
chance to show off the smooth, quick footwork that moved them into
astonishingly complex jumps and cross-footed travel.
</P>
<P>
   The most affecting moment came toward the end in the ``modern
fancy dance'' performed by Ms. Odjig-Fisher and Shawn Yazzie in
odd-looking black gym clothes, that in its renewing of the
traditional recalled the South African gumboot dance fashioned by
miners from their inherited dance forms. The point was made.
</P>
<P>
   The company, culled from 11 tribes across the nation, also
includes Marty Pinnecoose, Eddie Swimmer, Leslie Barichello, Jason
Daniels, Bronson Haywahe, Kevin Haywahe, Georgena Jones, Isaac
Lehi, Marc Meekis, Dallas Morrison, Elizabeth Olney, Darrell
Paskemin, Sancha Paskemin and Morgan Tosee.

NO CANDIDATES YET BUT VOTERS PREFER ...  
 FLORIDA: UNITY EVENT EXPOSES RIFT WITHIN RIFT  
 COLORADO: POLITICIANS GALLOP AND RUN FOR VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's early for this sort of thing, but because many of the
presidential candidates, probable candidates and possible
candidates are already out shaking the bushes, here's how the field
ranked when the Harris Poll recently asked 1,011 potential voters
to name their first choice for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000. The figures following each name represent the
percentage of support:
</P>
<P>
   Colin Powell, the retired general, 25;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush Jr. of Texas, 16;
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, wife of former Senator Bob Dole, 8;
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kemp, the 1996 Vice Presidential nominee, 7;
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, 7;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the magazine publisher, 4;
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, the commentator and former candidate, 3;
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, 3;
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, 2;
</P>
<P>
   Former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, 1;
</P>
<P>
   All others, 8
</P>
<P>
   And undecided, 15.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, released last week, was conducted between July 17 and
21 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   A few words of caution:
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say Powell runs best in polls if respondents are asked
to pick a favorite from a list that includes his name _ the method
in this poll _ as opposed to respondents' mentioning his name on
their own. Apparently many voters take him at his word that he does
not intend to be a candidate and therefore do not volunteer his
name.
</P>
<P>
   In the current Harris poll, when the poll-takers removed the
retired general's name from the list for a second round of
questioning, the order of finish for the remaining names was
roughly the same as in the first round of questioning, with Bush
getting 22 percent, Mrs. Dole 12 percent and the others ending up
in about the same order as before and with about the same
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, pollsters say his high standing _ he consistently
does well in all polls _ appears to result in part because some
voters confuse him with his father, the former president.
</P>
<P>
   UNITY EVENT EXPOSES RIFT WITHIN RIFT
</P>
<P>
   Racial feuding between white and black Democrats in Florida over
leadership jobs has taken a new and more ominous turn, with blacks
now fighting with blacks over how to end the bitter quarrel.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore flew to Fort Lauderdale over the weekend
in an effort to mediate an end to the squabbling, which is not only
considered a major divisive threat to Democratic election hopes in
this fall's elections, especially the governor's race, but could
also pose a threat to any hopes Gore might have for capturing the
Sunshine State's big trove of 25 electoral votes two years from
now.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and some of the state's top Democratic
leaders emerged from the meeting talking peace and solidarity. But
they conceded that the rift was by no means totally healed and that
the meeting was, at best, ``a step forward toward unity.''
</P>
<P>
   One major figure in the quarrel, state Rep. Willie Logan of
Opa-Locka, was not at the meeting _ and it was not clear whether he
had not been invited or had spurned an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting got under way, some black demonstrators handed
out leaflets that were critical of some black participants,
including Rep. Alcee Hastings of Miramar, perhaps the most powerful
black politician in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling broke out last spring when white Democrats in the
State House of Representatives decided to oust Logan, who is black,
as their leader. They contended that he was ineffective and chose
state Rep. Anne Mackenzie of Fort Lauderdale, who is white, to
replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings weighed in at that point, declaring that the leadership
change was but the latest proof that Florida's Democratic Party
took the state's considerable black vote for granted. He and Logan
began talking about using the black vote, normally 95 percent
Democratic, as a swing vote, one that could go either Democratic or
Republican in elections, now punishing, now rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ms. Mackenzie has announced that she plans to
retire, and her fellow white Democrats, both in the State House and
within the Florida Democratic Party's top ranks, have been trying
to make amends, including casting about for a black member to
replace her as leader. But their top choices strike Hastings and
Logan as the wrong choices.
</P>
<P>
   They were chosen, Logan said a few days ago, because they would
``do the bidding'' of the white majority in the State House.
Hastings warned of ``sycophantic symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the black legislators in the running, state rep. Josephus
Eggelletion of Fort Lauderdale, accused Hastings of divisive
political meddling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the king,'' Eggelletion said.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the weekend peace talks, Hastings seemed intent on
putting such remarks behind him in favor of building party unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to elect Democrats all over the state,'' he said,
adding that he, for one, intended to work hard this fall for the
Democratic ticket.

   POLITICIANS GALLOP AND RUN FOR VOTES
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's primaries in Colorado will be some of the most
important in the country to date, with abortion rights a major
issue in several.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell is favored to be renominated in the
Republican Senate primary, not only because is he an incumbent,
with high name recognition, but also becaise he has a big stash of
campaign cash. Still, his challenger, Bill Eggert, a lawyer and
solid Republican conservative, has run a surprisingly strong race,
constantly hammering on the possibly crucial fact that Campbell was
a lifelong Democrat until he jumped to the Republican fold three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Dottie Lamm, the wife of former Gov.
Richard Lamm, is the favorite, having high name recognition, a big
cash stash and the backing of most party leaders. Yet her opponent,
state Rep. Gil Romero, has hung on doggedly, traveling much of the
state on foot, often running, literally, because he is an avid
jogger.
</P>
<P>
   If the fall race comes down to a Campbell-Lamm contest, current
polls indicate Campbell will win, thereby doing his part to help
retain the Republican majority in the Senate. But national
Democratic leaders have indicated they may pour in help, whomever
the Democrats nominate, because they believe Campbell's party
switching has left him vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In the primaries for governor in Colorado, abortion is a crucial
issue in the Republican contest, with State Treasurer Bill Owens, a
conservative, opposing it, and the president of the state Senate,
Tom Norton, a moderate, in favor of leaving the choice up to women.
</P>
<P>
   Polls give Owens a slight lead. But he has been slipping a bit
since he acknowledged that he misstated his draft record when he
said did not receive a college deferment during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler is favored to
win over the state Senate's minority leader, Mike Feeley. Ms.
Schoettler has campaigned much of the time by horse, riding more
than 500 miles in a successful search of publicity. Democrats have
controlled the Colorado governorship for the past 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Two Colorado congressional primaries, both in districts where
incumbents are retiring, merit watching.
</P>
<P>
   In the 6th District, on Denver's western outskirts, the
attention is all on the Republican contest because the district is
so full of Republican voters that, come fall, it probably will not
matter whom the Democrats send into battle. What is worth keeping
an eye on is whether the four Republican conservatives and
moderates running on Tuesday so fragment the vote that an abortion
rights advocate, state Rep. Martha Kreutz, slips in as the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2nd District, northwest of Denver, four Democrats are
vying for the right to try to hold the seat for the party, which
has owned it for the past 12 years. It could be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The likely winner, Boulder's Mayor, Bob Greenlee, is a moderate
who favors abortion rights. Come fall, that kind of political
ideology could make him a real competitor in a district that is
evenly divided among Republicans, Democrats and independents.

NEW YORK AND THE YANKEES BOTH HITS WITH KNOBLAUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chuck Knoblauch was doing high-step running exercises
in front of the first-base dugout with the rest of the Yankees two
hours before Sunday's game. All the Yankees needed were tires
strewn across the grass to make the drill look even more animated.
Legs churned, arms pumped, faces contorted.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Knoblauch abandoned the routine and zigged and zagged
between and around his teammates like a miniature Jerry Rice. It
was a trivial display, but it looked natural for Knoblauch to
behave expressively, and it made his teammates chuckle. That meant
it was a successful venture for Knoblauch. He looked comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it before, and I'll say it again, this is the most
positive experience I've had in baseball and in my baseball life,''
Knoblauch said. ``Off the field, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Knoblauch won a World Series championship with
the Twins as a rookie in 1991 and that his .254 average this season
is a whopping 50 points lower than the career average he entered
the season with, it was an intriguing comment. The Yankees have not
had one post-season game yet, and Knoblauch sounds like a person
who adores New York, or one who really wants everyone to believe he
does.
</P>
<P>
   The always intense Knoblauch loosened up considerably as he
recounted walking through Manhattan recently and being jolted when
a truck driver abruptly stopped a few feet away from him. The
trucker shouted, ``Hey, Chuckie,'' waved his fist, told the second
baseman the Yankees ruled, and rumbled away.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is just different from any other city,'' Knoblauch
said. ``The people, the city, everything is great.''
</P>
<P>
   While it has been thrilling for Knoblauch to be the leadoff man
for a team that is barreling toward the major league record for
regular-season victories, perplexing moments have collided with
positive moments. From the inexplicable throwing troubles he has
endured to the subpar batting average to the dwindling on-base
percentage to the remarkable splurge of homers that exceeds what
Mark McGwire has done since the All-Star Game, this season has also
been a soap opera of sorts for Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Knoblauch has socked 11 homers since July 10, two
more than McGwire in the same period, it has puzzled Manager Joe
Torre. Torre is not sure how to feel about Knoblauch's swinging at
the high pitches he is being fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Torre said. ``Again, I'm not sure if it's good
or bad, because he's a get-on-base guy. Turns out he's helped us
win games in other ways, with the home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch helped Sunday by reaching base in three of four
at-bats, including a single in the sixth inning to begin a
three-run rally as the Yankees edged the Royals, 5-4. Still, the
numbers that matter most are 84-29. That is the Yankees' record,
and why Knoblauch said: ``I want to play here. I haven't thought
any differently since I was traded. I can't say how much I enjoy
being a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Brian Cashman should clip Knoblauch's words out
of the paper and save them as potential bargaining tools. Because
Knoblauch was traded in the middle of a five-year, $30 million
contract, he can demand a trade within 15 days after the conclusion
of the World Series. Knoblauch, who will have three years and $18
million remaining on the deal after the season, does not seem
likely to do that. But Alan and Randy Hendricks, his agents, would
surely like a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   When those discussions happen, Cashman should politely remind
the agents that Knoblauch had a good, not a great, year. Cashman
should also tell them that Knoblauch's $6 million salary would be
more than anyone on the roster who has a guaranteed contract for
1999 except for Paul O'Neill. The general manager should say $6
million is enough. For now, forget an extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only discussion we had was early and how he doesn't want
to go anywhere and we don't want him to go anywhere, so let's not
worry about it,'' Cashman said. ``I'm not worried about it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees traded pitcher Eric Milton and three minor leaguers
for Knoblauch, and that is another reason they do not want to lose
the 30-year-old. ``It's a good relationship,'' Knoblauch said.
``Hopefully, there won't be a problem. I don't foresee any as long
as they want me to play here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch halted his ``I Love New York'' campaign when asked
what he would do if the Yankees sought to honor his current
contract and did not offer him a dollar over $18 million, which is
quite plausible and quite fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I haven't even thought about,'' Knoblauch said.
``It's hard for me to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   It should not be hard. Not for someone who loves New York so
much.

COMMENTARY: JUST SHOPPING _ NO SEX, PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was supposed to be a harmless shopping expedition,
aimed at picking up the kind of bargains that a more single-minded
sex-shop patron might easily miss. Where else, after all, but at
the Times Square Book and Video Center, formerly XXXtasy Peepshow
Center, could you find a Thomas the Tank Engine video (``Thomas
Breaks the Rules'') for only $1.98?
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, in the course of an afternoon spent strolling
Eighth Avenue, this columnist did get some swell stuff. For Mom _
happy birthday! _ a bottle of Dolce Vita eau de toilette ($9.99,
tax included, at Show World). For her father-in-law, a Rodale
gardening video, ``Planting, Pruning and Propagating'' ($4.28,
bought at NRS Video, formerly NRS XXX Video).
</P>
<P>
   As for herself, a leering salesman with a Freddy Krueger laugh
recommended a key chain adorned with a diminutive couple who
perform, when properly manipulated, what is now officially known as
a ``specified sexual activity.'' She chose, however, to go with a
classic: a brunet ``tip and strip'' pen ($2 at the Photo Emporium).
</P>
<P>
   But despite the fun and the bargains, the afternoon ended badly,
at least for the cause of free speech. First, an embarrassed but
persistent salesman at NRS Video insisted that this columnist would
have to leave if she continued to write down titles from its new
stock of tapes. (``If you have a question, talk to our lawyer,'' he
kept saying.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the Playpen, she was thrown out again for taking notes,
this time by a considerably larger and more intimidating gentleman.
When asked why, he gestured impatiently and said: ``I'm just doing
my job. I'm not giving you any more.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the battle over New York's sex shops has
been a game of cat and mouse, with the cat, as usual, heavily
favored.
</P>
<P>
   Since the city passed its new zoning law three years ago, shop
owners, whose business does not actually have much to do with
speech, judging from the sounds issuing from the remaining peep
booths, have sought shelter in the First Amendment. Meanwhile the
Giuliani administration, trying to stay on the right side of the
Constitution, has claimed to be merely regulating the sex shops
while clearly trying to shut down as many as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Now the game has entered a new phase, in which each side has
forced the other into increasingly baroque postures.
</P>
<P>
   The shop owners have spent the last few weeks in hurried
renovations, trying to stock up on enough irrelevant tchotchkes and
remaindered videos to evade the title ``adult establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The city could have simply claimed victory and enjoyed the
spectacle. Instead, it has tried to press ahead with closing the
shops, only to bump up against the mathematics of its own law.
</P>
<P>
   According to regulations issued by the Buildings Department last
month, a sex shop-video store-luggage boutique-perfume counter does
cease to be an ``adult establishment'' once 60 percent of its
accessible floor space is devoted to stuff that no one entering the
shop is likely to be interested in.

<P>
   So far, neither cat nor mouse can be sure how this latest phase
of the chase will end.
</P>
<P>
   The city has closed down several clubs where real sex seems to
have been for sale, but it has yet to succeed in shutting a shop
where all that was at issue was good clean smut.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Justice Stephen Crane of state Supreme Court in
Manhattan heard many hours of testimony on the precise nature of
the changes at Show World, formerly the city's most extensive sex
shop, now a combination pool hall, ``classic'' movie theater,
bookstore and sex shop. He reserved judgment on the question of
whether the establishment, at Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street, should
be shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   Why some sex-shop owners are so reluctant to allow reporters to
chronicle their transformation is hard to know, but the staff at
Show World could not have been more gracious when this columnist
appeared at its new and totally empty movie theater to sample the
offerings. Behind her, a foreign tourist in a tank top took one
look at what was showing and left in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Available for viewing were five ``classic'' movies, or more
precisely videos, which were being screened on a continuous basis.
Upon request, one of the staff members obligingly cut off
``Barbarosa'' in favor of ``Of Human Bondage.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Howard limped across the screen in a grainy blur. Sad to
say, even at $5, it wasn't a bargain.

   As the artistic directors of Summerfest La Jolla in California,
the husband-and-wife team of David Finckel, the cellist, and Wu
Han, the pianist, have banded together their musical cronies in
hope of producing ``the world's best chamber music festival.''
Whether or not that's true, chamber-music aficionados can feast on
performances by some of the biggest names in the business during 10
concerts at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. Lending a hand
to the newly appointed leaders are the violinists Ida and Ani
Kavafian and the pianist Menahem Pressler. The festival runs
through Aug. 22. Information: (619) 459-3728.

   The Jolly What?

   The 1998 Edinburgh Festival Fringe retained its Guinness Book of
World Records status as the largest arts festival when it opened
Sunday for its 51st season. With 16,141 performances of 1,309 shows
by 9,810 artists, the Fringe is a cornucopia of arts both
traditional and, well, not so. Falling in the former category are
the European premiere of Sam Shepard's play ``Shaved Splits'' and a
tribute to the 1960s balladeer Serge Gainsbourg by '90s rockers
like P.J. Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``mad musical mayhem'' of ``The Jolly Folly of
Polly the Scottish Trolley Dolly.'' Just don't ask what it's about.
The festival's organizers aren't sure themselves, though a
spokesman said it had nothing to do with cloning. Information:

MICROSOFT PITCHING TENT IN SILICON VALLEY  
 HOUSE E-MAIL EFFORT RAISES CENSORSHIP ISSUE  
 DIRECTV AND THOMSON PLAN SET-TOP BOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif.)  (Eds.: Bylines follow individual items.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven A. Ballmer, who has more often cast a dark shadow over
Silicon Valley, arrived there last week offering peace, love and
local tax payments. Ballmer, newly elevated to the job of president
of Microsoft Corp., announced that his company, based in Redmond,
Wash., would set up a satellite headquarters in a 32-acre corporate
campus in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer is renowned for being the field marshal of Microsoft's
aggressive and highly effective marketing efforts, which have often
left Silicon Valley littered with casualties. And not lost on
anyone is the fact that Microsoft is moving into the hometown of
Netscape Communications Corp., whose David-and-Goliath struggle
with Microsoft is at the heart of the government's antitrust suit
against Ballmer's company.
</P>
<P>
   But Ballmer declared that the campus, with five buildings,
``underscores Microsoft's ongoing commitment to its employees,
partners and customers in the valley.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which already has 800 employees scattered in
offices throughout Silicon Valley, will move those people into the
Mountain View campus. Yet much more than merely a matter of real
estate consolidation, the step is also clearly meant to raise the
company's profile in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A larger presence in Silicon Valley, industry executives said,
could help Microsoft recruit people from the region's talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft competes for engineering talent, but only the talent
that is willing to move from here to Seattle,'' said Roger McNamee,
general partner of Integral Capital Partners, an investment firm in
Menlo Park, Calif. ``And a lot of people who live in the valley are
religious about the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder what took Microsoft so long, saying the company's
relations with Silicon Valley might be better now if such a move
had been made years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real reason for the valley's ambivalence toward Microsoft is
that Microsoft didn't show its face around the valley and didn't
make an effort to understand valley culture,'' said Paul Saffo, a
director of the Institute for the Future, a research group in Menlo
Park. ``Microsoft is late to everything, even moving to the
valley.''

   HOUSE E-MAIL EFFORT RAISES CENSORSHIP ISSUE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A congressional committee has endorsed a bill to control junk
e-mail by requiring the senders of unsolicited marketing material
to identify themselves in the body of their messages _ a provision
that opponents said would give Internet service providers the new,
undesirable task of weeding through private communications.
</P>
<P>
   The measure to regulate junk e-mail, or ``spam'' as it is called
by Internet users, was approved by the House Commerce Committee's
telecommunications subcommittee on Thursday as part of a bill
intended to prohibit another communications annoyance:
``slamming,'' or the practice by some telephone companies of
changing their customers' long-distance carriers without prior
approval. A similar anti-spam measure is part of the phone-slamming
bill already passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the House and Senate spam-buster measures
involves the spot in the message where the senders must identify
themselves. Under the Senate bill, a message must be identified as
unsolicited commercial e-mail in the subject header, which would
enable Internet service providers and individuals to filter out
such messages. But the House bill would require such identification
in the body of the message itself, making automatic filtering
difficult or impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Everett-Church, a lobbyist for the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Commercial e-mail, a group that is pushing a bill to
ban spam, called the House bill ``disastrous for consumers and
Internet service providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett-Church said that to filter mail through a notice in the
body of a message, as opposed to the subject header, is much more
labor-intensive because each message would have to be opened. Not
only would that add a further burden to network operators already
struggling to cope with heavy messaging traffic, he said, ``it is
disturbing to Internet service providers who don't want to get in
the practice of sifting through people's private e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We fear that will open up a new realm of censorship based on
content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ JERI CLAUSING
</P>
<P>
   DIRECTV AND THOMSON PLAN SET-TOP BOX &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The way the makers of television sets see it, the cable industry
stands squarely in the way of the successful introduction of
digital, high-definition television. Most of the major cable
companies say they will not carry the digital programs that the
broadcast networks plan to being offering in November. And since
two-thirds of the nation's homes subscribe to cable, it is little
wonder that the manufacturers are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   So Thomson Multimedia, the nation's largest maker of television
sets, is teaming up with DirecTV, the largest direct-broadcast
satellite company, to work around the cable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV, part of the Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors
Corp., was one of four companies that bought minority stakes in
Thomson Multimedia late last month. As part of that deal, the
companies agreed to build a set-top box for use with
high-definition television sets.
</P>
<P>
   The box will include a decoder for the DirecTV satellite signal
_ as well as a tuner for over-the-air television signals, both
digital and analog. The boxes should sell for about $400 and enable
DirecTV subscribers with television antennas to get cable channels
from DirecTV, and local television stations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, direct-broadcast satellite services, which beam the same
programming to the entire country, have been unable to carry local
television stations, and that has been a large barrier to mass
acceptance. DirecTV and Thomson Multimedia hope the hybrid box will
solve some of the marketing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of course all of this may remain academic as long as
high-definition televisions are selling, on average, for $8,000.

TINA BROWN CHOOSES EDITOR FOR MIRAMAX MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tina Brown, who recently resigned as editor of The
New Yorker, has chosen one of her longtime colleagues to be
executive editor of her new monthly magazine at Miramax, which is
due out in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   David Kuhn, 38, the features and special issues editor at The
New Yorker, was appointed Friday as executive editor and vice
president of the new magazine. He will also be vice president of
Ms. Brown's and Ronald Galotti's new multimedia division within
Miramax, which will include the magazine unit and units for books,
television specials and feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Kuhn's enterprise and imagination are a great fit in a
company that requires a lot of lateral thinking,'' Ms. Brown said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The position seems, in many ways, tailored for Kuhn, who has
experience with film as well as several years in publishing. Before
going to The New Yorker, part of Advance Publications, in June
1994, he spent two years developing film material as a production
executive at Longview Entertainment, a company affiliated with
Universal/MCA.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Kuhn spent seven years as an editor at Vanity Fair,
under Ms. Brown's leadership there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does kind of combine everything I have done
professionally since I started working in magazines, including my
two years in the movie business,'' said Kuhn, who starts in
September. ``I feel over the moon and sad that I'm leaving The New
Yorker, which has been an unbelievable ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn will be involved in the day-to-day running of the magazine
_ hiring, assigning articles and editing. Kuhn said it was too soon
to discuss a concrete vision for the magazine _ or a title. ``It's
something we have only talked about in the abstract,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Soup Nazi? Well, recently I came across the Shoe
Nazi. It was my first visit to his store near Lexington and 77th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, as a customer, I was a bit trying.
</P>
<P>
   I found a perfect pair of evening shoes and thought I should
take advantage of the store's sale and buy a pair of sandals.
</P>
<P>
   As the clerk was writing up the sale, I began to waver about the
nice-but-not-perfect sandals. I told the clerk to forget them.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they were nice, and I did need them. ``OK, OK, I'll
take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot flash about another pair bought earlier in the year but
never worn. ``No, no, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner, listening nearby, grabbed the sales slip, ripped it
up and demanded that I leave the store with neither pair.
</P>
<P>
   Is my memory playing tricks, or did he actually say ``No shoes
for you''?
</P>
<P>
   The acute desire to walk away was trumped by my deep love and
need for the evening shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Mortified, I said, ``But I must have the first pair.'' He was
adamant.
</P>
<P>
   I begged: ``Please, please let me buy the shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! Out!''
</P>
<P>
   Degradation: ``I beg you. They're perfect. Please don't do this
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you'll take both pairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowed and broken: ``Yes, I will take both.''
</P>
<P>
   End note: The dubious sandals are working out well. I wonder how
long I'll have to lie low before I show my face there again.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Just one more ``Titanic'' story: Meryl Wiener's 11-year-old son
did not know the history of the ill-fated vessel, so she told him
all about it before taking him to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours, with still no hint of impending disaster, he
tapped her on the shoulder and asked, ``Are you sure this ship
sinks?''
</P>
<P>
   The dog, a young, muscular pit-bull mix with a thick chain-link
collar, had dug his paws in near the West 91st Street exit of
Central Park and refused to move.
</P>
<P>
   The owner _ black baseball cap, large sunglasses, tall, tough as
his pet _ was tugging on the leash trying to persuade him to walk
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' he said. The dog did not budge. ``Get moving.'' No
response. ``It's time to go home.'' Still no motion.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine T. Becher watched as the man, exasperated, scooped the
dog up in his arms and said, in all seriousness: ``Look here, we
have to get this straight right now. I don't speak dog so you'd
better plan on learning English.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Scene: A crowded crosstown bus headed east during the 57th
Street morning rush.
</P>
<P>
   I signal for an exit at Seventh Avenue, and the driver pulls
alongside the bus stop _ with a cab smack dab in front of the back
exit. I try to exit, but the doors barely open, because of the cab.
</P>
<P>
   I politely ask the cabby to move his empty cab, as there is
nothing between his cab and the corner. The cab moves about 2 feet.
I still cannot exit the bus without really squeezing between the
dirty bus doors and the dirty cab. I ask the cabby to move some
more. He doesn't move.
</P>
<P>
   A large male passenger behind me is also yelling at the cabby,
angry and kicking the cab. The cabby is now angry too, but seeing a
large male he stays in his cab, still not budging.
</P>
<P>
   I say to my fellow passenger, ``Shall we go through?'' He
answers, ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   So I step out through the partially open bus door, open the back
door of the cab and slide through, with the fellow following. We
exit onto the sidewalk _ and leave both back doors of the cab wide
open as we go our separate ways.

   Eleanor Spitz's second-grade class had a ``show and tell''
during snack time. Dawn told about a visit to her grandfather, an
optometrist. Ms. Spitz asked where he practiced, to which Dawn
replied: ``He doesn't practice anymore. He knows how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The young panhandler on Park Avenue was getting an unusual
reaction from passers-by. They would read his sign, smile or laugh
and pass on without giving him a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   As Grace Grant approached the sign, she understood their
reluctance. In his case, honesty wasn't the best policy. In big
letters he had written: ``Why lie, I need a beer!''

<P>
   For hip-concealing A-line sacks.
</P>
<P>
   It's tinting, bleaching, dyeing hair;
</P>
<P>
   It's covering what once you'd bare,
</P>
<P>
   And knowing that the chances are
</P>
<P>
   You'll never wed a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   BUT
</P>
<P>
   For women who would cling to youth,
</P>
<P>
   I offer this consoling truth;

   Fifty can be, oh, so restful!

deciding what to wear. She finally pulled together a stylish
combination of black pedal pushers and a black tank-type top with
Asian-inspired embroidery.

<P>
   As she was ambling along midtown, a little girl, about 8 years
old and wearing a yellow flowered dress, was walking behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people in New York only wear black?'' the child asked

   Ms. Hoffman was understandably chagrined at the reply. ``Maybe
because they don't want to look pretty,'' the mother said.

   Selma Marx was standing in a movie line with a recently widowed

had dinner at various restaurants before dashing off to theaters

METS' BID FOR SWEEP FALLS SHORT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As Mets Manager Bobby Valentine reminded anyone within
earshot this weekend, there is long way to go before the season is
over. But a victory Sunday still would have meant something.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since May 31, the Mets had a chance to pull
into the lead in the National League wild-card race. All they
needed was to beat the Rockies again.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs were on their way to another defeat in St. Louis, as
the Cardinals swept a three-game series and left the door wide open
for the Mets. And, for a moment, it looked as if the Mets might
leave Coors Field with their first series sweep, and their first
victory over Darryl Kile since May 4, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo took the mound in the bottom of the fourth inning
with a 4-1 lead. But Nomo, who had somehow battled his way through
the first three innings, lost any touch he had left. The
right-hander never escaped the fourth, as Colorado rallied for
seven runs. Before the game was over the Rockies would score 10
unanswered runs for an 11-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   And after the drubbing, the Mets (62-53) had to travel to St.
Louis, still trailing the Cubs by a half-game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kile (8-14) had improved his record against the Mets
to 9-3, as Dante Bichette, who homered, singled and doubled twice,
drove in 5 runs to reach 100 runs batted in for the fourth
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long afternoon,'' Valentine said. ``And that fourth
inning was real long.''
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud was the one bright spot for the Mets. He had four
singles to extend his hitting streak to 23 games, one short of
Hubie Brooks' club record. But little else went right for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   And almost everything went wrong for Nomo (5-9), who in three
and two-thirds innings was charged with eight hits, seven runs,
three walks, three wild pitches and one costly balk that forced in
a run. It was Nomo's first loss since June 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dry here, maybe that's why,'' Nomo said through his
interpreter. ``I don't know if it was the dryness or what. It just
feels different pitching at Coors Field.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Valentine: ``He kept fiddling with his grip on the ball. He
was fiddling with it the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   And not like Zero Mostel.
</P>
<P>
   Over his last five starts, Nomo, who is the only pitcher to
throw a no-hitter in this park, had been 3-0 with a 2.37 earned run
average. But Sunday Nomo's lack of control, which had plagued him
earlier in the season, did him in again. Staked to the 4-1 lead
after two and a half innings on the strength of a two-run second
and a two-run third, Nomo walked a pair of Rockies in the bottom of
the third, but escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   But when Nomo allowed back-to-back singles to Todd Helton and
Mike Lansing to open the fourth, he could not escape again. Nomo's
first pitch to Colorado's No. 8 hitter, Kirt Manwaring, was a wild
one that moved the runners to second and third. Manwaring rifled
Nomo's next pitch under the pitcher's glove, off the mound and into
center field to score one run and move Lansing to third.
</P>
<P>
   Before throwing another pitch, Nomo made a move toward first.
But Nomo had missed a sign from his first baseman. Olerud had
broken toward home, anticipating a Kile bunt attempt, and Nomo
balked to score Lansing and give the Rockies a 4-3 lead. Manwaring
took second on the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing shaken, Nomo fell behind Kile, 3-0. After running the
count to full on the pitcher, Nomo walked him. On the next pitch,
Darryl Hamilton pushed a bunt up the third-base line for an infield
hit.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and nobody out, Valentine went out to the
mound. Nomo responded by inducing Neifi Perez into a fielder's
choice at second, as Manwaring scored to tie the score, 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Another wild pitch on a 2-2 count to Larry Walker, and Perez
advanced to second as Kile stayed at third. Nomo rallied to strike
out Walker on a full-count forkball. But Bichette grounded a
two-run single between the pitcher's legs for a 6-4 lead, and that
was all for Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   One day after another strong outing by Armando Reynoso, Mets
Manager Bobby Valentine announced that he will go with his six-man
rotation until a pair of back-to-back doubleheaders with the
Cardinals at Shea Stadium on Aug. 20 and 21. ``It seems like, why
mess with it?'' Valentine said of his six-man experiment. ``This is
the best stretch we've had the whole year. Why should we change
anything?'' ... Greg McMichael left the team to be with his wife,
Jennifer, who is about to give birth to the couple's third child.

GRASS FIELD A HIT WITH GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The field was spotty in some places, with a fine, grainy green
mixture patching crevices where the grass had worn or yellowed in
streaks at one end of the field. Paint obscured some other
blemishes, and from the upper deck at Giants Stadium, it was easy
to see where forklifts had marred the grass in patches, turning it
brown.
</P>
<P>
   But the first grass field to play host to a football game in the
22-year history of Giants Stadium was mostly unscathed, and
afterward the field was an unqualified success in the eyes of those
who played on it.
</P>
<P>
   Add Giants Coach Jim Fassel to the list of supporters. Team
executives were pleased as well.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the experimental grass-tray field, damaged by a
concert on Aug. 2 at the stadium, was not a factor in the Giants'
24-17 preseason victory over the Cincinnati Bengals Saturday night.
But it became the players' most frequent post-game topic of
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the field,'' cornerback Jason Sehorn said. ``Sure, if
you're going to have a concert on grass, some of it's going to die.
But it wasn't bad. Besides, I'd rather play on dirt than artificial
turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Scott Gragg said: ``It was a very true field, no lumps,
bumps or parts that weren't level. They had the grass cut down
short, so it was quick. It was fine, and I'm sure we'll all feel a
little fresher because of it tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Scott Galyon, beginning his third season with
the team, said the grass field made him see Giants Stadium in a
different light.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come off the field with dirt and grass stains on you, not
rug burns,'' he said. ``You feel like you've been in a football
game, and that makes it much more like a football experience. The
whole atmosphere of the place is different with that grass.''
</P>
<P>
   No player said anything critical about the grass field _ until
it was mentioned that the team would play just one more game on it
this year. After the Giants' exhibition game with the Jets on Aug.
20, the grass, which is positioned on 6,100 portable trays, will be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will play their final preseason game and the regular
season on a new artificial turf, which is now beneath the grass
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is going to be the hard part,'' Sehorn said. ``Going back
to the old turf after we've seen this.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the current grass field continues to satisfy Giants
players, coaches and management as it has so far _ and particularly
if it improves as it recovers from the concert damage _ it will
only hasten the implementation of a permanent grass field at Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That could come as early as next season, though Giants officials
have indicated recently that a grass field in Giants Stadium for
the entire National Football League season is more likely by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel Is Encouraged
</P>
<P>
   Even after reviewing the video of Saturday's game, Fassel could
not offer much criticism of his team's performance. He felt his
second- and third-team players were not accustomed to the pace of
an NFL game, which, Fassel said, accounted for the two second-half
touchdowns the reserves gave up.
</P>
<P>
   For his starters, who charged to a 17-3 halftime lead, Fassel
had mostly praise.
</P>
<P>
   Of quarterback Danny Kanell, who overthrew a few receivers but
otherwise looked sharp, Fassel said: ``What I liked is that Danny
looked very comfortable in the pocket. I liked his footwork, his
mechanics, and he kept his vision down the field. Sometimes, in the
first time out in a season, you see guys flinching a little. I saw
none of that in Danny.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel also singled out cornerback Phillippi Sparks, who
intercepted a pass and forced a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phillippi is very alert and in the best shape I've ever seen
him,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said safety Rodney Young was a dramatically improved
player, and the coach continued to marvel at Scott Galyon. Galyon's
play as a linebacker in the nickel packages has been so good that
he would probably be in the starting lineup except that Jessie
Armstead, the Giants' All-Pro weakside linebacker, plays the same
position.
</P>
<P>
   Special Teams Highlights
</P>
<P>
   There were some standout performances Saturday on the Giants'
special teams, which were statistically a trouble spot last year.
</P>
<P>
   David Patten returned a kickoff 41 yards, which is significant
when you realize that the Giants had just two kickoff returns
longer than 30 yards in 17 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Place-kicker Brad Daluiso produced touchbacks on three of his
five kickoffs. And punter Brad Maynard had punts of 58 and 59
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Injury Report
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said there were no serious injuries Saturday night.
Safety Tito Wooten has a dislocated finger on his right hand.
Backup quarterback Kent Graham has a deep thigh bruise that may
limit his practice time because of swelling and soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, however, was injured. He has a sore right arm after an
official's flag _ they are stuffed with lead pellets so they won't
blow away on windy days _ struck him in the arm during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy really flung that thing and it hurt,'' Fassel said.
``I told him: `I'm standing over here in the coaches' box, I
shouldn't be getting hit with the flags.'''

EDITORIAL: NO QUICK FIX IN ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   More than a year has gone by since the collapse of Thailand's
currency, the baht, signaled the beginning of the Asian crisis.
Hopes that the turmoil would be contained to one or two countries,
and would end soon, have long since been dashed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is worse than it might have been, because Japan
waited too long to deal with the aftereffects of the collapse of
its stock and real-estate markets eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Japan's new prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, hit all the
right notes in his first major policy speech on Friday, promising
economic deregulation, tax cuts, increased public spending and a
program to rescue the country's banking system. But important
details are still vague, and Obuchi was right to warn that it will
take ``a year or two'' to get a Japanese recovery under way.
</P>
<P>
   Healing sick banks is a necessity in virtually every Asian
country. Having lent money to finance inflationary booms when Asia
was growing faster than the rest of the world, the banks now find
their loans are backed by assets whose value has collapsed or,
worse, were made to companies that had plenty of political
influence but no real way of earning money to repay the loans.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the problem is both larger and more solvable than in
other Asian countries. There may be as much as $1 trillion in bad
debts on the books of Japanese banks, making that problem far
greater, in proportion to the size of the economy, than the one
that confronted American banks at the beginning of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the United States, Japan is a wealthy country that can
afford to clean up the mess if there is the political will. It
appears that will is finally present.
</P>
<P>
   China's problems provide another risk for the region. There is
renewed speculation in financial markets that China's currency, the
renminbi, will be devalued despite the government's promises to
hold the line. Chinese exports are being hurt by the weakness of
the yen and other Asian currencies, particularly the South Korean
won.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is winning export markets in products like steel and
cement that China needs to export as it tries to reform its economy
and shrink the bloated state-owned enterprises that employ most
Chinese workers but lose large sums of money. It has kept those
enterprises afloat, and its economy growing, through ``loans'' from
state-owned banks, which as a result would be insolvent if
reasonable accounting standards were applied.
</P>
<P>
   China has enough foreign exchange to defend its currency, and
its relatively closed financial system makes speculation against
the currency difficult. But the Chinese leadership fears a slowdown
in its economy, and it might decide within a year that it needs to
devalue, even if that risks worsening the problem for other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in this decade, Asia's strength helped bring prosperity
to the rest of the world. Now it appears that the world will have
to deal with a weak Asia for some time to come.

EDITORIAL: THE SHOWDOWN ON SEX SHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's crackdown on New York City's sex
industry has met a legal snag. Many adult video stores and strip
clubs are feverishly reconfiguring their businesses to limit the
amount of floor space and inventory devoted to X-rated
entertainment to under 40 percent. They claim that changes their
character enough to exempt them from new zoning restrictions on
pornography shops.
</P>
<P>
   It is a clever strategy. But the constitutionality of the new
zoning ordinance, and its worthy purpose of protecting communities
from the adverse impact of sex-related businesses, has been upheld
by both state and federal courts. It would be absurd to allow
subterfuges like a halfhearted display of suitcases and trinkets to
prevent its enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The new law bars ``adult establishments'' entirely in purely
residential neighborhoods and prevents their clustering into ``red
light'' districts in the commercial and manufacturing areas where
they are still allowed. Such businesses are prohibited from
operating within 500 feet of each other or within 500 feet of
residential buildings, schools and churches.
</P>
<P>
   The law defines a business as an ``adult establishment'' if it
devotes a ``substantial portion'' of its operation to adult
entertainment. Citing language in a City Planning Commission report
and court papers filed by the city to help the statute pass
constitutional muster, the pornography shops argue that they can be
treated as X-rated enterprises only if 40 percent or more of their
business is in adult materials.
</P>
<P>
   But, clearly, the 60-40 ratio was meant only as a general
guideline, not a mechanical test. It was intended to show that the
rules pose no threat to general interest book or video stores with
a relatively modest section of adult materials. Notably, the City
Planning report says a store should not escape regulation as an
``adult establishment'' simply by moving a large amount of adult
materials into a smaller amount of floor space.
</P>
<P>
   The city's authority to zone has firm constitutional standing.
If the courts find problems with the way this particular law is
being enforced, these problems can be remedied with appropriate
amendments by the mayor and City Council. Meanwhile, neither the
existing law nor the First Amendment should preclude city
inspectors from considering factors other than square footage in
determining whether a business is an adult establishment.
Meaningful enforcement calls for common sense, not just a tape
measure.

GORDON IN MIDDLE OF JETS' DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Amid the hand-wringing after Marvin Jones'
season-ending injury, the speculation about whether Pepper Johnson
can replace Jones and the arrival of Bryan Cox, one Jet has
remained unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   And he is the man who is playing middle linebacker for the Jets,
instead of one of those three more-noted performers.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Gordon simply keeps making plays. Sunday in practice, he
tore through the line on third-and-8 to strip the ball from Glenn
Foley and disrupt an offensive series.
</P>
<P>
   And Gordon may have been the Jets' most dominating defensive
player in the opening half of their victory in the exhibition
opener at Philadelphia last Thursday. He had a game-high six
tackles in the half, including five unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   So he will continue in that role against the Baltimore Ravens at
Giants Stadium on Saturday, while Johnson backs him up and Cox
still tries to get used to playing the outside once more. Jones
will undergo surgery next week for ligament damage in his left
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gordon, who is 28, should have been able to generate big
plays before this. But he conceded Sunday that he had to grow up as
a pro football player after the Jets signed him a year ago, after
two seasons each with Atlanta and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember after my first scrimmage with the Jets, Bill
Parcells said to me, `Why didn't you play like that in San
Diego?''' Gordon said. ``I didn't want to tell him because I was
hurt. He said, `Was it because you were fat and out of shape?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon admits that that may have been part of the reason, along
with the nagging knee injury. When he joined the Falcons as a
rookie free agent in 1993, he admits, he did not like to watch
films. He also did not watch his weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't figure it out in terms of being a
professional,'' he said. ``By the time I got to San Diego, I
realized that watching films isn't all that tedious.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he never started more than three games in a season until
last year with the Jets, when Johnson suffered a quadriceps injury
in the eighth game that ended his season. Gordon was the starter
the rest of the year. He produced some big games, including an
11-tackle effort against the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   So when Jones was injured, the Jets did not have to make
significant changes. They stayed with Gordon, who desperately
wanted the opportunity to start again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attitude changes after you've had something and don't
want to lose it,'' he said. ``My confidence was always there. I was
just waiting for the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon grew up in White Plains, N.Y., and went to high school
near Poughkeepsie in LaGrangeville, N.Y. From there, he attended
the University of New Hampshire, more noted, perhaps, for its
hockey team than for its football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get $10 a game as an usher at the hockey games,'' he
said. ``I liked to watch the girls in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is extremely coachable, said Al Groh, who tutors the Jets
linebackers. Coaches like his intelligence and his ability to
absorb information, which offsets to some degree his average size
of 6 feet 1 inch and 240 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   With Jones, the Jets thought their linebacking unit was as good
as anybody's. Teamed with Mo Lewis and James Farrior, Gordon might
still be able to help the linebackers become the strongest unit on
the club. Cox is being groomed for the outside, where Parcells
hopes he can be used as a disruptive pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have one of the best linebacking units?'' Gordon said.
``That remains to be seen. On paper we do.'' &QL;

GANGS AND GUNS SHAPED SUSPECT IN OFFICER'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With an absent father and a single mother who could
not control her five sons, Shatiek Johnson fell into a world of
drugs and gangs and shootouts long before he was old enough to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   His father is a convicted drug dealer. So is his oldest brother.
Another brother was involved in a gunfight. Violence was never too
far away in the Staten Island public housing projects where the
family lived. Two gangs, the Bloods and the Wolfpack, competed to
control the local market for marijuana and crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Now charged with the shooting death of Police Officer Gerard
Carter, Shatiek Johnson is the 17-year-old ex-convict whose sullen
face, framed by chocolate-colored dreadlocks, is flashed regularly
on the television news.
</P>
<P>
   To Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, the
teen-ager symbolizes the failings of the state's prison early
release program. To the police officers who arrested him, and who
mourn the death of Carter, he is a remorseless thug who they say
killed without conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just an all-around bad guy,'' said a police detective
close to the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The dysfunctional picture of Johnson that emerges from
interviews with police investigators, prosecutors, neighbors and
friends is of a teen-ager described as once being a ``nice kid''
who loved to play basketball. But by age 15, he had been convicted
of manslaughter for the beating death of a homeless man. Now, in
addition to Carter's fatal shooting, Johnson will soon be indicted
in the killing of a rival gang leader.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, when a reporter knocked on the front door
of the sixth-floor West Brighton Houses apartment where Johnson
lived, his mother, Betty Johnson, refused an interview, shouting,
``Get away from my door!''
</P>
<P>
   Affixed to the door were two stickers from the Wu-Tang Clan, the
rap group. The members of the group were raised in Staten Island
housing projects, and their lyrics depict a bitter world of
``stickup kids, corrupt cops and crack rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that world that residents say can be found in West
Brighton Houses and a neighboring public housing complex, Markham
Gardens Houses, the world that produced Shatiek Johnson. Here,
there are scores of hard-working people trying to raise families.
Many of the children play in a softball league organized by the
police officers, including Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But, two longtime residents said, young men also come and go
from prison in bunches, like seasonal harvests. The drug trade is
so active that another tenant said customers often just drop money
out of their apartment windows to waiting sellers.
</P>
<P>
   So deep is the distrust of outsiders, particularly the news
media, and so genuine is the fear of retribution for speaking out,
that few residents interviewed were willing to give more than first
names. And in an eerie example of the interconnectedness of people
in the neighborhood, the police and local residents say that
Johnson and Carter, the slain officer, were once briefly related by
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, police investigators and prosecutors depicted the two
neighborhoods, though relatively benign in appearance, as
increasingly menaced by the Bloods in Markham Gardens and the
Wolfpack in West Brighton. Once considered little more than
teen-age wannabes _ local girls used to mock them as ``fake''
Bloods _ these gangs had grown more violent recently, fighting over
who would control turf to sell crack and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that whenever we collide out here, there's going to
be a war, and there are going to be more bodies,'' said Chris, a
28-year-old resident of Markham Gardens who identified himself as a
member of the Bloods. He said the Bloods sell crack in ``the
Markham'' while the Wolfpack controls the drug market in ``the
Projects,'' as West Brighton Houses is known. Police detectives
also confirmed this balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chris and to police investigators, Shatiek Johnson
was a member of the Wolfpack. Until he turned 10, he had lived in
Markham Gardens, but housing officials said the family moved into a
bigger apartment in West Brighton Houses in March 1991. It was far
from a stable atmosphere. Shatiek's father, Tony Lovett, did not
live with the family; one neighbor said he peddled hats and shirts
on the side of the road. Lovett was an avid Knicks fan and,
according to some, a likable guy. But he also sold drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest brothers, Tarsheen and Karscine, also ran into
trouble. Now 26, Tarsheen is serving 6 to 12 years in prison after
a string of convictions for burglary, sodomy and criminal sale of
controlled substances.
</P>
<P>
   Karscine, 24, was linked to a 1995 shootout in front of
Scotty's, a graffiti-splattered convenience store situated between
the two housing complexes. He was charged with fatally shooting two
men _ including Robert Young, the biological father of his baby
sister, Josslyn _ but he pleaded guilty to a lesser weapons charge
in 1996 after witnesses recanted their testimony. Last week,
Karscine Johnson was arrested on an outstanding warrant for
drinking in public.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Betty Johnson describe her as a well-intentioned
mother. ``She did her best for her kids,'' said Jamila Pass, 21,
who said she had known the family for years. ``She's a single
parent raising six kids by herself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Pass and others say Ms. Johnson could not control her
family. One neighbor described loud shouting matches. On some
nights, the neighbor said, teen-agers spilled out of the Johnson
apartment, smoking so much marijuana that the fumes seeped beneath
his closed door. Complaints had been filed with the Housing
Authority, which had already banned Tarsheen and Karscine from
public housing. Ms. Johnson was also threatened with eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole family,'' said Hilly Gross, a Housing Authority
spokesman, ``seems to be problematic.''

   On March 25, 1996, Shatiek Johnson and a friend, Kinte Carter,
walked to a local liquor store, Papa Joe's. It was Shatiek's 15th
birthday. Outside the store, the two friends fought with Richard
Martin, described in a police report as a homeless alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   David Lehr, chief assistant district attorney in Richmond
County, said the dispute was over $10. In his confession, Carter
said he struck Martin only in self-defense; he also said Johnson
had tried to break up the fight. Martin died the next day, and
though his death was initially attributed to natural causes, an
autopsy found that his spleen had been ruptured and his ribs
cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told the police that Johnson had helped Carter kick
the victim as he lay helpless on the ground. Though not considered
the aggressor, Johnson pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was given
a one- to three-year sentence at a youth detention center. He was
denied parole in February 1997 but was released last April 10
because of state guidelines that mandate freeing any prisoner who
has served two-thirds of his sentence without any major infractions
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson returned to West Brighton Houses and at some point
became a member of the Wolfpack. ``He wasn't one of the tough
guys,'' said a West Brighton Houses tenant who said he has known
the family for more than a decade. ``He was a very nice guy. I
don't know what changed him.'' Maybe, the tenant said, ``he wanted
to be down with the guys. He got involved and he got caught up in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between the Bloods and the Wolfpack had intensified
with the coming of summer, but it exploded on July 16 with the
slaying of Eric Trotman at Markham Gardens. Police investigators
described Trotman as a member of the Bloods. He was discovered shot
14 or 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trotman had a gun, this kid had a gun,'' Lehr said. ``He kills
Trotman before Trotman kills him. That's allegedly what happened.''
Nicknamed ``Confidential,'' Trotman was considered a ``superior,''
or leader, of the local Bloods gang, according to Chris, the Bloods
member. When word spread through Markham Gardens that Johnson was
the shooter, Chris said the Bloods quickly put out a ``contract''
on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Shatiek,'' Chris said.
</P>
<P>
   The police released a picture of a youth suspected in the
Trotman slaying. Ten days later, on the evening of July 26, Carter
and his partner, Eric Storch, were patrolling the courtyard in West
Brighton Houses when they saw a youth who fit the description of
the suspect. Police officials said the two officers kept driving,
again checking the picture before returning to the courtyard.
Without warning, the police said, the youth fired through the
windshield, striking Carter in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, an emergency services police unit
captured Johnson inside a West Brighton Houses apartment after an
armed standoff. When Carter died four days after the shooting,
Johnson's grim image was broadcast all over New York City as a
teen-age cop killer. Another suspect in the Trotman killing, Jason
Walker, was arrested on Tuesday, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with second-degree murder in the slayings of Carter and
Trotman, Johnson faces 25 years to life on each count. He is not
eligible for the death penalty because he is not yet 18. His
lawyer, Alex Shulman, said on Friday morning that he would fight to
suppress a confession in which Johnson reportedly admitted to both
slayings. Shulman said he might have Johnson submit to a
psychiatric evaluation. Shulman also described his client as
``respectful and cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the shootings, West Brighton Houses
residents say the police are now constantly patrolling _ and
harassing _ tenants. One mother said she was awakened early in the
morning last week by officers searching for someone who had stolen
a child's bicycle. In Markham Gardens, two young women said they
had been stopped by police officers and asked why they were wearing
red clothing, considered the color of the Bloods.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, the member of the Bloods, said the police presence had
pushed the gangs into hiding. But he also noted that the
``contract'' on Johnson remained in effect, even while he is in
prison. For now, Johnson is under protective custody in Rikers
Island, but a police detective noted that ``he's got a problem when
he goes into the population of a jail.'' As for Johnson's family,
they seem to want only to be let alone. His mother has avoided the
news media. And on Wednesday, the youngest brother, 14-year-old
Ramik, rode around West Brighton Houses on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you just leave us alone?'' he told a reporter. ``The
man is locked up now. Just chill.''

EDITORIAL: LEGAL SERVICES IN JEOPARDY AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee might be
annoyed if you told them that they cared nothing for equal justice.
But there is no other way to explain their obsessive drive to
destroy the federal Legal Services Corp. and its ability to help
impoverished Americans with civil legal problems. For the third
consecutive year, the committee voted to cut the Legal Services
budget in half.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a sufficient number of lawmakers rallied last week
to block the devastating cut on the House floor, as they have in
the past. Even so, the budget approved by the House includes just
$250 million for the program.
</P>
<P>
   That figure is less than the inadequate $283 million Congress
allocated for Legal Services last year and far short of the $340
million sought by the administration. The money is needed, among
other things, to help protect victims of domestic violence and
enforce child support orders against an absent parent.
</P>
<P>
   The House also made no move to repeal a ban on class-action
suits and other congressionally imposed restrictions that hinder
efficient and effective representation of Legal Services clients.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Legal Services decry its ``liberal agenda.'' But
its actual docket is dominated by cases involving housing,
benefits, consumer-credit disputes and domestic relations issues.
The purpose of this program is not to promote a political
philosophy but to broaden access to the justice system for indigent
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, at least, was more generous. Last month, it voted to
budget $300 million for Legal Services in the next fiscal year. The
issue now goes to a House-Senate conference committee. To provide
anything less than $300 million would harm both Legal Services and
the Republicans' reputation for fairness.

BUS DRIVER IN FATAL 1997 CRASH WAS UNFIT TO DRIVE, PANEL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Transit officials knew that the bus driver involved
in a fatal crash on Fifth Avenue last year had a long history of
seizures and alcoholism but failed to take him off the road, in
violation of state law, a state panel has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Charles Alston, suffered a seizure moments before
the Oct. 2 crash, doctors have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any serious review of his medical records should have resulted
in the conclusion that he was not medically qualified to drive a
bus,'' the State Public Transportation Safety Board said in a
report issued last week.
</P>
<P>
   The board urged New York City Transit and its parent agency, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to review the medical
records of all bus drivers and subway and train operators, a
process that had already begun shortly after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on a review of New York City Transit's thick
medical file on Alston, found references to at least three
seizures, dating back to 1991. In all, Alston had missed 470 work
days from 1992 to 1997 due to illnesses ranging from cancer to
asthma to glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said, the agency's doctors ignored an
internal order in 1994 to make sure that Alston was treated for
alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   State motor vehicle law forbids anyone suffering from alcoholism
or ``any condition which is likely to cause loss of consciousness''
to drive a bus.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, Alston lost control of his midtown bus for seven
blocks, plowing into several cars, critically injuring a bicyclist
and killing a foot messenger before crashing into a building. He
died 20 days later of illnesses unrelated to the crash, shortly
after a neurologist diagnosed epilepsy, which in adults is often
triggered by alcoholism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the accident, transit officials said that although Alston
had been suspended in 1983 for using morphine and in 1985 for using
alcohol, he had not tested positive for drugs or alcohol since
then. They added that he had denied having any seizures in his last
three annual physical exams.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board, however, found that New York City Transit had
extensive knowledge of Alston's health problems but followed a
disturbing pattern of taking him off the road for a while, then
declaring him fit to drive. From 1992, when Alston was treated for
a seizure attributed to alcohol withdrawal, until July 1997, he was
placed on restricted duty five times due to either seizures, losses
of consciousness or alcohol-related problems. But he was always
allowed back behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   If the agency had simply followed its own internal guidelines,
the report stated, ``this bus operator should have been removed to
a nonsafety-sensitive position, with a diagnosis of
alcoholism/alcohol dependence _ a diagnosis indicated in New York
City Transit medical records at least four times.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Transit officials declined to comment on the
report Sunday, saying they had not finished reviewing it.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trying to teach instincts to a baseball player is
like trying to eat a bowl of soup with a fork: basically
impossible. You can try and try, but you will almost always be
unsuccessful. You have a spoon, or you do not. You have instincts,
or you do not.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter has excellent base-running instincts, and Ramiro
Mendoza has excellent pitching instincts. Because Jeter never
stopped running as he tried to steal second base in the eighth
inning, and because Mendoza has never treated his switch to the
bullpen as a demotion, the Yankees managed to steal a 5-4 victory
over the Royals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The march toward history continued for the Yankees, who do not
think they should ever lose a game, and usually do not. Andy
Pettitte was listless in his first start in 10 days, following a
muscle strain in his left shoulder, and he dumped the Yankees in a
4-1 ditch after five and a half innings. The Yankees yawned,
realized they still had a game to win and delighted a Beanie Babies
crowd of 55,911 at Yankee Stadium by doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to win every time out,'' Jeter said. ``We know it's
not going to happen, but that doesn't mean we don't think we can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they did it again to sweep the four-game series from the
Royals while outscoring them, 41-9. The Yankees improved to a
ridiculous 84-29 for the season and a just-as-ridiculous 42-8 at
home. If anyone definitely expected the Yankees to rally against
Hipolito Pichardo and Kansas City's bullpen, it was the 25 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that we're not satisfied to just play
pretty well,'' said Scott Brosius, who homered for New York's first
run. ``There's a desire in all of us to win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   That desire manifested itself with one out in the eighth, after
Jeter walked on a 3-2 pitch with the score tied, 4-4. Jeter bolted
for second base on Scott Service's 1-0 pitch to Paul O'Neill, and
shrewdly looked back at the plate twice. He saw a wild pitch whiz
by Royals catcher Sal Fasano when he was about 20 feet from second,
so he never hesitated and cruised into third easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said we were fortunate or lucky when we were
winning earlier in the season,'' Jeter said. ``I think you make
your own breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre raved about the critical play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got such great instincts,'' Torre said. ``Those are
things you can't teach. I'm sure that put pressure on. Now they
weren't allowed to allow us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. Service intentionally walked O'Neill to set up a
double play. But Bernie Williams looped a single to left center.
Had Jeter only taken second, he probably would not have scored on
the hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things like that can win you a game or two during the
season,'' O'Neill said. ``Today, it did that for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Jeter's dash, Mendoza had replaced Pettitte with two outs
in the sixth inning and the Yankees behind, 4-1. After the Yankees
scored three runs in the bottom of the sixth on O'Neill's two-run
double and Williams' sacrifice fly, Mendoza was unhittable.
Mendoza, who was pushed to the bullpen by Orlando Hernandez's
success, was terrific in retiring seven of eight batters and
permitting only one ball to reach the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel mad about going to the bullpen,'' said Mendoza
(8-2). ``I'm still going to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis will take batting practice at Yankee Stadium on
Monday before continuing his rehabilitation assignment at Class AAA
Columbus on Tuesday. . . . The crowd of 55,911 was the second
largest of the season, behind the 56,717 on opening day, and was
the 10th largest in the 23-year history of the remodeled Yankee
Stadium.

SONNY ROLLINS: DISCOURSE WITH TANTALIZING TANGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sonny Rollins could hardly wait to start improvising
when he arrived with his tenor saxophone onstage at the Damrosch
Park Band Shell on Saturday night. Before Rollins finished his
first tune, ``Biji,'' he was already darting away from it with
quick asides and looping runs, following impulses he was eager to
share.
</P>
<P>
   Commanding, whimsical, unpredictable and telling, those impulses
made for a set that transcended jazz factionalism through sheer
force of personality.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins was mainstream and avant-garde, abstruse and basic,
conservative and anarchic, uncompromising and crowd-pleasing. The
free concert, presented by Lincoln Center Out of Doors, drew an
audience that overflowed the park.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins' structures were old fashioned. The set included
standards, modal tunes, altered blues and calypsos, and each
selection used the theme-solos-theme form.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Anderson on trombone and Stephen Scott on piano played
their solos with urbane intelligence, swinging over the beat and
tracing linear narratives, keeping the music tonal and genial. Bob
Cranshaw on electric bass, Perry Wilson on drums and Victor
See-Yuen on percussion provided sure, easygoing support, despite
some clutter from See-Yuen.
</P>
<P>
   And while the rest of the group played within mainstream rules,
Rollins rocketed past them. Jazz is often compared to conversation,
but Rollins had two discussions simultaneously: a witty discourse
on the tunes and, bursting out between the lines, all kinds of
alternatives and extrapolations and tangents, the stream of musical
consciousness behind a typical solo's judicious phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins kept touching down on the melodies, as if knocking on
wood, then streaking out to the further reaches of harmony and
speed. He played breakneck lines that zigzagged through all kinds
of chordal convolutions; he skipped up to high, hooting notes and
an occasional overblown squeal, then dived down to foghorn honks.
Unlike David Murray, whose solos turn into ecstatic glossolalia,
Rollins made his seem like spectacular introspections and private
dares.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins treated standards, including ``They Say It's Wonderful''
and ``More Than You Know,'' with jocular affection. He moved the
original melodies around the beat and gently mocked romantic
declarations with exaggerated vibrato or an extra edge in his
sound. His saxophone crooned the melodies of his own ballads,
including selections from his latest album, ``Global Warming''
(Milestone), and a new song written for the concert,
``Homecoming.'' The bluesy ``Clear-Cut Boogie'' ended with a
repeated riff in a decrescendo until Rollins, true to the
ecological titles on the album, declared, ``And then there were no
more trees left.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tours de force were the calypsos: just three chords and
endless possibilities. Rollins put dissonant tags on cheerful
melodic hooks; he toyed with snake-charmer scales and nasal bagpipe
tones; he cartwheeled through arpeggios and spiraled through
harmonic transformations; then returned to the tune as if nothing
had happened. It was the sound of a master deep in thought and
equally deeply at play.

EDITORIAL: AN EAST TIMOR BREAKTHROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, has apparently decided that
with so many problems to deal with, he can live without the
international harangue Indonesia has received for its brutal
occupation of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials met with their Portuguese counterparts last
week and pledged to seek an agreement on ``wide-ranging autonomy''
for the region, which Indonesia annexed in 1975. The proposal stops
short of the referendum on independence that the East Timorese
rightly demand. But East Timor activists believe it is a
significant step that could eventually lead to independence.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials said they might grant East Timor autonomy
over everything but defense, foreign policy and some economic
matters. They would also allow East Timor to hold free elections
open to all political parties. East Timorese activists believe this
could be a face-saving alternative to a referendum that would
almost certainly produce an overwhelming vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
   But if East Timor elects leaders who demand independence, the
activists believe, Indonesia might be prepared to let the region
go. That could depend on whether Indonesia itself becomes more
democratic and remains attuned to international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far the talks between Indonesia and Portugal have not
included any East Timorese. Indonesia would be well advised to
release from prison Jose Xanana Gusmao, the leader of East Timor's
guerrilla movement, and include him in negotiations. Gusmao
apparently favors the agreement, and is the only person who can
convince his suspicious countrymen to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, where Indonesia has also begun a partial troop
pullout, is one of several issues on which Habibie's government
seems to be breaking with Suharto's repressive ways. Last week Gen.
Wiranto, the head of the armed forces, promised to pull some troops
from Aceh, a province where the army is accused of widespread
abuses while fighting a Muslim separatist group.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia also began an investigation of the military's role in
the kidnapping and torture of democracy advocates. Ten officers
face courts-martial and three others, including Suharto's
son-in-law, will appear before a special military council. The
officers will suffer only dishonorable discharge, when real trials
are needed. But any accountability is a welcome change from the
imperial rule of Suharto.

 &HT;    Foxworthy at peace with God
 &HT;    Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Comic Jeff Foxworthy confided before a throng of 4,000
Sunday night, including Gov. Zell Miller, that talking about his
faith was outside his ``comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The nationally-known comic who's trademark ``redneck'' humor has
made him rich and famous said he discovered after returning home to
Georgia that what was missing in his life was ``inner peace,'' and
no amount of fame and fortune could make up for that.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute address at Roswell High School in north Atlanta,
laced with Bible verses and spiced with his trademark crackerbelt
humor (''When I was a kid one of my uncles wrote on our mailbox the
word M-A-L-E. About the time I was a junior in high school I
thought ``You know, that ain't right. The ``M'' should be
capitalized''), Foxworthy talked about his conversion that, he
said, was really more like ``coming home again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was seven years old I gave my life to Christ,'' said
Foxworthy, who now lives in Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never turned my back on him. But I didn't walk with him... I
started drifting away because I didn't have momma waking me up on
Sunday morning making me go to church.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the crowd _ which ranged in age from infants to seniors,
and from devoted Christians to devoted Foxworthy fans _ didn't
quite know what to expect from the comic who had yet to talk
publicly about his newfound faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him perform,'' said Karen Sledge, 30, of
Marietta, Ga. ``I came out here expecting to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Miller, his arms propped on a bannister in the back of the
high school's gym, and without his usual entourage, said he's
always been a fan of Foxworthy and wanted to bring his grandson
Justin Miller along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff's one of Georgia's greatest treasures,'' said the
governor. ``I like all of his stuff . . . I 'm glad that he's back
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxworthy, wearing a beige golf shirt, black jeans and cowboy
boots, appeared nervous at first, but quickly loosed up as he began
discussing his life and career and his connection with God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say if I could make $100,000 a year, I wouldn't have
a problem in the world,'' he said. ``I had nights where I've made
that much. But I found out I wasn't a bit happier than when I
started out and was making $20 a month . . . Since I have decided
to walk with God, it has changed my entire life,'' he said. ``It
has helped me curb my anger, it has helped me live my life with
more ease.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was sponsored by Fellowship Bible Church in Roswell.
``He just wants to tell people some of what god's doing in his
life,'' said the church's assistant pastor, Paul Pridemore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to do a lot of it because he wants his privacy.
But he loves God and he wanted to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxworthy revealed that after his sitcom was cancelled and he
was preparing to return to Atlanta, he told his wife Gregg, ``I
might be a preacher.'' She was dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked at me kind of like a cow looks at a new gate,'' he
said, ``and said that great Southern word: 'Dowhat?' ``

TSZYU SHAKEN, NOW IS STIRRED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kostya Tszyu was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   The former amateur world champion from Russia, now living in
Australia, was IBF junior welterweight title holder, undefeated,
promoted by Bob Arum, on Oscar De La Hoya's short list of possible
opponents and overflowing with talent.
</P>
<P>
   Then he ran into Vince Phillips last August.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest upsets of 1997, Phillips, then 34, pounded
and then stopped Tszyu in the 10th round to take the championship
and turn Tszyu's world upside down.
</P>
<P>
   He was shaken emotionally for a few months, faced with the
prospect of rebuilding his career and ultimately released by Arum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning of my career, I never thought I would lose,''
said Tszyu, who faces Rafael Ruelas in a WBC super lightweight
title-elimination bout Saturday in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it happened.... It wasn't easy. I never thought about
retiring. At the same time, I didn't know how long it would take me
to recover from that. It was about two months later that I decided
to get back in the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Tszyu, 28, blamed the loss in part on his diet.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't notice anything unusual leading up to the
fight, he said, he somehow lacked sufficient energy once it began.
His manager, Vlad Warton, said Tszyu had anemia and was somewhat
dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   Once he made the decision to get back into the gym, he addressed
the problem: He hired one of the top dietitians in Australia and
claims he's a new man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vitamins I used were wrong, the diet I had was wrong,
everything was wrong,'' he said. ``The things I do now are totally
different. I do the right things, I eat the right things and now I
can make weight properly without any problems at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so simple I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly more simple than his climb back to the top.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that he has considerable ability. He's a 3-1
favorite over Ruelas, a former world champion himself, for a
reason.
</P>
<P>
   However, his was no ordinary loss. It came against a fighter few
took seriously and it was one-sided, two facts that shattered his
image as a great _ or potentially great _ fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the million-dollar paydays that seemed to be around
the corner were nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Tszyu tried to focus on the positive.
</P>
<P>
   He learned something particularly valuable: He can be beaten, a
fact that has a way of keeping a fighter focused.
</P>
<P>
   And he learned who will be with him for the long haul. He lost
several ``friends'' after the loss but received unwavering support
from his family and his adopted country.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Australia after the Phillips fight, he was
greeted by roughly 1,000 fans at the Sydney airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost made me cry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tszyu has fought twice since the Phillips fight, stopping Ismael
Chaves and Calvin Grove _ in three and one rounds, respectively _
in Australia to run his record to 20-1-1, with 16 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   His confidence back, Tszyu doesn't believe he has anything to
prove to anyone. He knows what he's capable of and is getting his
chance to prove it once again: The winner of Saturday's fight has a
date this year with Miguel Angel Gonzalez for the vacant title.
</P>
<P>
   With De La Hoya out of the picture for the foreseeable future,
his goal now is to unify the 140-pound titles.
</P>
<P>
   And his hunger to realize it is more acute than ever. He wants
it for those who stood by him _ including the Australian fans _ and
for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more determined now than ever,'' he said. ``I'll be 29
next month. It's time to get a championship belt again. I'm
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   More local fighting: Mehdi Zamani, owner of the Country Club and
a licensed promoter, plans to bring back regular shows to the
Reseda venue.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Goossen of North Hollywood will headline his first card, on
Sept. 9, against an opponent to be determined. He also has
scheduled cards for October, November and December.
</P>
<P>
   He and promoter Peter Broudy, who is helping Zamani put together
the cards, hopes to pit Goossen against Hector ``Macho'' Camacho on
ESPN on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the Country Club is boxing. Mehdi really wants
to have boxing there on a regular basis,'' Broudy said.
</P>
<P>
   Oxnard promoter Robert Valdez has scheduled a fight card for
Aug. 29 at L.A. Fitness Center's outdoor tennis arena in Woodland
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Goossen was scheduled to fight Roberto Duran in
his first reasonably lucrative fight last year but broke his foot
and had to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   A matchup with Camacho would help ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen must beat whomever he fights and Camacho must beat Tony
Menefee on Tuesday for the fight to happen. Broudy, negotiating on
Goossen's behalf, and Camacho's handlers are near a deal....
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, scheduled to fight on the Ruelas-Tszyu card, pulled
out after injuring his hand....
</P>
<P>
   WBA and IBF heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield will face IBF
No.1 challenger Vaughn Bean on Sept. 19 in Atlanta. The fight, a
terrible matchup, can be seen on pay-per-view television.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WBC champ Lennox Lewis will defend against Zeljko
Mavrovic on Sept. 26 on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   What did we do to deserve this?...
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas of Oxnard (13-0, 13 KOs) returns to the ring
against capable Antonio Rivera (26-1-1, 19 KOs) in a 10-round
junior middleweight bout on Aug. 22 in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Gatti, the world's most exciting fighter, faces Ivan
Robinson in the 10-round lightweight main event.
</P>
<P>
   The card is on HBO....
</P>
<P>
   Prince Naseem Hamed reportedly will fight Kennedy McKinney on
Halloween night in Las Vegas....
</P>
<P>
   If referee Mills Lane is hired by Fox to be a ringside
commentator, his career as a ref would be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mills is 60 years old and I think he's looking long-term,''
Nevada State Athletic Commission director Marc Ratner told the
Boston Globe. ``If he gets a long-term contract with Fox and goes
full-time, he wouldn't be allowed to referee in Nevada because it
would be a real conflict. He understands that and accepts it.''...

   Alex Ramos of the Retired Boxers Foundation and Robert Ortiz of
Kid Gloves Boxing Foundation were named ``Heroes of the Week'' by

UNINTIMIDATED BY SUCCESS, O'MEARA TAKES AIM AT THIRD MAJOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winning the Masters and the British Open in the same year should
at least make you the most recognized golfer in your city. But Mark
O'Meara is not even the most recognized person in his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara lives in Windemere, Fla., outside Orlando, in the same
community with Tiger Woods and Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But while Woods and Griffey are better at making headlines,
O'Meara has quietly been making history. He enters this week's PGA
Championship at Sahalee Country Club in Redmond, Wash., with a
chance to win three majors in the same year. No man has done that
since 1953, when Ben Hogan won the Masters, the U.S. Open and the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Golf's spotlight has finally found its way to O'Meara, an
unassuming 41-year-old family man who has replaced Woods as the
neighborhood's hottest golfer. The turn of events was unexpected.
O'Meara had enjoyed a solid career before this year, winning 14
tournaments on the PGA Tour and 20 tournaments worldwide. But he
had never won a major.
</P>
<P>
   Now, O'Meara has reached his peak at an age when others are
reaching for Nuprin. His success is testament to what can happen
when talent, temperament and experience merge. Yet, if someone had
told O'Meara in January that he would have a chance to win his
third major by August, what would he have said?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have believed it,'' O'Meara said last week in a
telephone interview from his home.
</P>
<P>
   He believes it now. And despite his modesty, O'Meara is not
intimidated by the attention he will face this week as he tries for
a triple-major year, something that such great golfers as Jack
Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer never achieved. To prepare for the PGA
Championship, O'Meara spent the weekend in Park City, Utah, with
his longtime coach, Hank Haney, golfing, fishing, and fine-tuning
his game. O'Meara has never seen Sahalee, a picturesque course
outside Seattle featuring narrow, tree-lined fairways that put a
premium on accuracy off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara has been cautious not to let the anticipation hurt his
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm approaching this the same way I always do, wanting to play
well enough to give myself the opportunity to win,'' O'Meara said.
``If I don't play well, I can live with it. It has already been a
special year. And I think it's pretty neat that a 41-year-old guy
is showing that the older guys can still play the game a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo was the last man who arrived at the PGA Championship
with a chance to win his third major in one year. But after winning
the Masters and the British Open in 1990, Faldo finished tied for
19th at the PGA. O'Meara hopes to do better, and he will be
well-rested. He has not played in a tournament since last month's
British Open at Royal Birkdale, when he won a four-hole playoff
against Brian Watts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's success does not surprise Haney. Their relationship
started in 1982, when O'Meara was a young golfer from southern
California, struggling to make a living. It was late in the season,
and O'Meara was 124th on the money list, needing to finish in the
top 125 to keep his tour card. After working with Haney, O'Meara
made the next three cuts and kept his card. Haney said that 16
years later, O'Meara remains as dedicated to the game as he was the
day of their first lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing that makes Mark special is that his mental
attitude is as good as it has ever been,'' Haney said. ``That's
pretty impressive, when you're talking about a guy who's 41.
Hanging around guys like Tiger and Ken Griffey is a part of that.
You can learn a lot hanging around champions, guys who are that
competitive, guys who are pushing you. Tiger and Mark played golf
in Orlando before the British Open, and Mark shot a 63. He lost.
Tiger shot a 62. That's not a bad way to get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that O'Meara has played the best golf of
his career since Woods joined the tour in the summer of '96. Woods
and O'Meara, who are both represented by International Management
Group, became fast friends. Woods, who won the Masters at age 21,
was looking for a place to live after turning professional, and
O'Meara sold him on the Orlando area, with its warm climate and
lack of state income tax. Other tour players, such as Scott Hoch,
Payne Stewart and Lee Janzen, the reigning U.S. Open champion, also
live near O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   Woods looks up to O'Meara for his experience, and O'Meara is
fueled by Woods' fire. The day after the British Open, O'Meara and
Woods flew home together, and as soon as it was safe to take off
their seat belts, Woods wanted to see the claret jug, the trophy
given to the British Open winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Tiger he'd have his name on that trophy one day,
probably a few times,'' O'Meara said. ``He's got plenty of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But for O'Meara, that chance was a long time coming. ``I finally
realized I didn't have to play perfect golf to win a major.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Haney believes O'Meara has always had the game for a major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardly anybody has a game suited for all four majors, and it's
hard to win any of them,'' Haney said. ``I always thought Mark
would win a British Open, because his lower ball flight and
accuracy are suited for playing over there. But Mark always had
what it takes. He doesn't have too many easy victories in his
career, but when he has a chance to win, he usually closes the
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, O'Meara has been a better deal-closer than Donald
Trump. He did not lead the Masters until the final hole, but he
rallied from three strokes down with four holes to play to defeat
Fred Couples and David Duval by one stroke, clinching the victory
with a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Only certain players make putts like that. Ask players on tour
to name the game's best pressure putters, and it will not be long
before you hear O'Meara's name. That ability to find the bottom of
the cup makes O'Meara extremely dangerous when he is in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say I was certain I'd make that putt at
Augusta, but I had a pretty good read on it, and I felt
confident,'' O'Meara said. ``That was quite a way to win my first
major.''
</P>
<P>
   But the British Open was just as dramatic, as O'Meara prevailed
over a world-class field in windy, chilly conditions that tested
every part of a player's game. Once again, O'Meara never led until
the final round. Then, after finishing the 72d hole at even par, he
waited behind the 18th green with his wife, Alicia, and their two
children, Michelle, 11, and Shaun, 8, as Watts played the final
hole. It was great theater, as Watts made one of the great shots in
British Open history to force a playoff with O'Meara, hitting a
difficult greenside bunker shot to within six inches of the cup to
save par.
</P>
<P>
   Showing his class, O'Meara applauded the shot. Showing his
toughness, O'Meara dominated the playoff, setting the tone with a
birdie on the first hole and winning by two strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But just because nobody expected him to win two majors this
year, O'Meara says he see no reason to be intimidated by the
magnitude of what he could accomplish this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to have a chance to win three majors in the same year is
pretty special,'' O'Meara said. ``When the year starts, you really
can't expect anyone to be in that position. I'm just happy to have
the chance.''

IN BROOKLYN, LONGTIME FRIENDS BECOME POLITICAL ADVERSARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They were not merely up-and-coming officials from the
same Brooklyn neighborhood, but kindred politicians close enough to
have been the best of friends for years. Over nightcaps in
neighborhood bars, they planned their political futures. They
worked on each other's campaigns. They went to family reunions
together and even, at times, vacationed together.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in one of the odd twists that are often part of
politics, the two officials, Assemblyman Darryl Towns and City
Councilman Martin Malave Dilan, have become political adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Towns, 37, is in a heated Democratic primary for re-election to
a seat he won in 1992, representing the northern Brooklyn
neighborhoods of Bushwick and Cypress Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Dilan, 47, who was elected to the council in 1991, is running
against him. It is a race in which Towns has had to defend his
record, presenting himself as a vigilant advocate for his district
as Dilan has offered a dissenting view and the promise of ``a more
active presence in Albany and in the district.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The current Assemblyman has been an absentee Assemblyman,''
Dilan said of his former confidant. ``Many of the people in the
district, if they were to see his face, would not know who he is.
In fact, I think he has been in a holding pattern waiting for Daddy
to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Towns' father, U.S. Rep. Edolphus Towns. The
younger Towns' relationship with the Democratic Party organization
in Brooklyn adds another layer of complexity to the race for the
Democratic nomination for the Assembly seat. The contest between
Dilan and Towns is widely seen as an extension of a feud between
Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., the Brooklyn Democratic chairman,
and the younger Towns.
</P>
<P>
   Norman and the elder Towns, once close friends themselves, have
become bitter political adversaries, a result of disagreements over
endorsements. When the younger Towns decided to support Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, in last year's mayoral contest,
Norman announced that the Democratic organization would no longer
support the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Dilan had planned to run for Congress,
against Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a fellow Democrat. But last month,
Dilan, a close ally of Norman, announced that he could not raise
enough money to topple the popular congresswoman. Instead, he
announced his candidacy for the Assembly seat held by the younger
Towns.
</P>
<P>
   Both Norman and Dilan say they are not involved in any plan to
injure the Towns family.
</P>
<P>
   ``One might have that perception,'' Norman said. ``But I want to
make it perfectly clear that the county organization is neutral.
Despite the fact that I have some differences with the father, it
has nothing to do with my relationship with the son. There is no
backdoor support to Darryl's opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all are convinced, however. ``He's neutral against an
incumbent?'' the younger Towns asked. ``I find that strange,
because the incumbent usually enjoys the Democratic organization's
support.'' The race in the 54th Assembly District is also marked by
ethnic issues. Towns, who is black, and Dilan, who is Puerto Rican,
are running in a district that is predominantly Hispanic. And one
of Dilan's campaign themes is that it is time for the district to
send a Hispanic Assemblyman to Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 census showed the Assembly district as 66 percent
Hispanic, 24 percent black, 5 percent white and 3 percent Asian,
and demographers say the Hispanic population has since grown to
more than 70 percent.

SPORTS COLUMN: FROM RENAISSANCE TO RECKONING, FOR BOTH JETS AND
GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past, when the Jets and Giants have played each other the
games often had a set of meanings and implications, carried certain
overtones: Giants fans' condescension, Jets fans' feelings of
inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   This season, when they meet on Aug. 20 at Giants Stadium, the
game will be played minus the overtones. Nothing will be on the
line besides temporary bragging rights and momentum; there will be
none of the inferior-superior dichotomies of the past. This time it
will just be two contending teams, each in the midst of a
renaissance, doing a little muscle flexing as they prepare to take
the next step.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Giants went from mediocrity to a division
championship and the Jets went from 1-15 to 9-7, barely missing the
playoffs. On Thursday, the Jets roughed up the Philadelphia Eagles
in their exhibition opener, 29-15. Last season at this time, with
so much focus being placed on changing the team's attitude, the
Jets always seemed to be groping along. On Thursday, they moved
with authority and even confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants looked commanding in their opener on Saturday, a
24-17 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. ``Last year everything
was new for us,'' cornerback Jason Sehorn said after the game. ``We
started out 1-3, we didn't grasp it that quickly. This year we're
not installing, we're just updating. It's nice to see we didn't
digress.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficult part for the Jets and Giants is that the level of
expectation surrounding both teams has skyrocketed. Giants fans are
looking for a trip to _ or near _ the Super Bowl; Jets fans are
looking for the team to make the playoffs for the second time since
1986, and many are holding out hope for a division title.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Giants' victory over the Bengals, and in the
midst of the general euphoria surrounding their prospects, people
are saying that the Giants are beginning where they left off last
season. Anyone who remembers how last season ended knows that is
not exactly true.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were unexpectedly pushed out of the playoffs by a
sudden, horrific jolt: The Minnesota Vikings scored 10 points in
the game's last 90 seconds and upset the Giants, 23-22.
</P>
<P>
   Players say musings and reflections about past losses are for
fans and writers; they say that players don't care. They may not,
but coaches do. For all of the success and the coach of the year
honors, you can't tell me that the Giants' Jim Fassell doesn't
remember that heart-rending feeling last December. Or how he went
home after the Minnesota game and woke up three times in the
morning, preparing to go back to work _ and there was no work to go
back to.
</P>
<P>
   Fassell is not likely to have forgotten the image of the Giants
fighting among themselves on the field in the third quarter as the
dream began to unravel. Or the snapshot of Minnesota's Randall
Cunningham hitting Jake Reed with a late touchdown pass in the
swirling snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's over,'' Sehorn said. ``I don't live in the past, in
anything in life: football or nonfootball. When it's in the past
it's in the past and you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Football players may not live in the past, but they live in
denial; the ever-present violence of their game makes it necessary.
Attention is always tightly focused on the next game. Players have
the luxury of forgetting; nightmares aren't really nightmares, but
mere inconveniences that result in a loss here and there. Nothing
life-threatening: busted play, blown coverage, missed tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally reality pops up and intrudes, reminds players of
their fragile nature. Last week tests revealed that Corey Miller,
the Giants linebacker, had a herniated disc in his neck and would
miss the season, and may have to retire. Last year Ike Hilliard,
the Giants' rookie receiver, injured his neck in September in only
his second pro game and missed the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the seasonal ebb and flow. Miller leaves,
Hilliard returns. Sudden injuries, sudden losses _ block them out.
The constant has to be winning.
</P>
<P>
   What's important for the Jets and the Giants is fulfilling their
potential, and meeting expectations. This is a new season with high
hopes and clean slates. The novelty phase is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time of slipping past people and sneaking up on people is
over,'' Sehorn said. ``Teams are going to be waiting. People expect
us to win; we expect us to win.''

 &HT;    'Truth Train' pulls into South Florida
 &HT;    By Mary Warejcka
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. _ Rebellion isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   After all, not long ago teens were defying authority by
``smokin' in the boys' room,'' instead of applauding an
anti-smoking campaign, as a couple hundred teens did in West Palm
Beach Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They call it a rebellion against corporate tobacco. The fight
against cigarette makers is literally rolling through the state on
a train from Pensacola to Miami. They call it a campaign for
``truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Their message is simple: Smoking kills so don't start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoking just draws too much from the heart and what you love
to do,'' explains Joshua Johnson, a West Palm Beach 18-year-old who
got on the train at Tampa. ``Like they say, kissing a smoker is
like kissing an ashtray.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also denounces smoking in TV and radio ads that are part
of the statewide effort to curb smoking in teens. The campaign is
being paid for with part of the $11 billion settlement that tobacco
companies offered last year.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 kids got off the train at the West Palm Beach station
at 201 S. Tamarind Ave. Some will stay and others will jump on the
train to travel south to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles also has popped on the train for parts of the
trip. He rode from Okeechobee to town Saturday. As he gave credit
to the teens for coming up with the campaign, a petition for movie
executives was passed around.
</P>
<P>
   It asks movie makers to stop glamorizing cigarette smoking,
saying that while only 25 percent of ``real people'' smoke, 75
percent of TV characters light up.
</P>
<P>
   Another anti-smoking organization GROSS, Get Rid of Student
Smoking, had an early afternoon outpost at Boynton Beach Ocean
Park. The organization is midway through a two-week campaign of
daily stops from Miami to Vero Beach aboard a retired fire engine.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors paid for giveaways at the truck including
Surge soft drinks, water bottles, drink holders and stacks of
T-shirts that read, in part: ``Surgeon General's Warning: Smoking
won't make you sexy or rich. Smoking won't make you cool. Smoking
makes you die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to get teenagers not to smoke,'' said 12-year-old
Nick Banko of Boynton Beach after coming up to the fire engine and
putting on a free T-shirt. ``I hate smoking. My dad smokes. I bug
him about it all the time.''

ANDRE WEIL, 92, MATHEMATICS PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa., Ill, Japan, Brazil)  (ll) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andre Weil, a former professor at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, N.J., whose work in algebraic geometry and
number theory recast the basics of mathematics, died on Thursday at
his home in Princeton. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   At the institute, Weil was considered an intellectual peer of
colleagues who were among the century's most influential scholars:
Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the mathematician John von
Neumann and the logician Kurt Godel among them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Weil (pronounced VAY) won the equivalent of the Nobel
Prize, which is not awarded in mathematics, when he received the
Kyoto Prize in Basic Science from the Inamori Foundation of Kyoto,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   That award honored the part of his work known as the Weil
conjectures, which provided the principles for modern algebraic
geometry. The patterns of numbers that Weil discovered are now
applied, for example, in writing almost-unbreakable secret codes
and in enhancing the accurate transmission of computer data.
</P>
<P>
   Other applications of his work can be found in elementary
particle physics and in encryption and computer security.
</P>
<P>
   But such practical applications were far from Weil's mind, said
Phillip Griffiths, director of the institute and a mathematician.
Griffiths said Weil had provided answers to some of the most subtle
questions about ordinary numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will certainly be remembered as one of the giants of
mathematics of all times,'' Griffiths said. Beyond that, he added,
Weil was a scholar and historian and was fluent in languages _ ``in
Sanskrit, in Persian, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   He introduced ideas of topology _ the study of geometric figures
_ into arithmetic, permanently changing the way scholars study the
science of computing by numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Weil, born in 1906 in Paris, became devoted to mathematics in
his early teens and received his doctorate from the University of
Paris in 1928. His thesis solved a problem concerning elliptic
curves that had been posed by the mathematician and philosopher
Henri Poincare.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Weil rejected the avant-garde circles of Paris and
instead went off to India to study its culture and to teach. In
India, he taught at Aligarh University from 1930 to 1932, then
returned to France to teach at Marseille University and Strasbourg
University until 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Weil was a founder of the influential Bourbaki, a group of
French mathematicians who rebelled against the French establishment
and whose original writings from the 1930s unified all of
mathematical knowledge for the first time. The Bourbaki remain
highly influential in the field to this day.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the draft, he went to Finland. ``As a soldier,'' he
said, ``I would be entirely useless, but as a mathematician I could
be of some use.'' The Finns returned him to the French, who
imprisoned him for six months.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, he created the Riemann hypothesis _ named for a
German mathematician _ and it became a basic element of number
theory and is regarded as one of his most insightful mathematical
achievements, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Weil later joined the French Army to earn his release from
prison, then came to the United States to teach at Haverford
College in Pennsylvania. He taught at the University of Chicago
from 1947 to 1958, and at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil
from 1945 to 1947.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Institute for Advanced Study in 1958. After he
retired from there in 1976, he wrote on mathematics and edited
works by Jacques Bernoulli and Pierre de Fermat, two French giants
in mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Eveline, died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Weil is survived by two daughters, Nicolette Schwartzman of
Princeton and Sylvie Weil Weitzner of New York City, and three
grandchildren. His younger sister, the philosopher Simone Weil,
died in England in 1943.

NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL LIFE DEAL EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Wash.)  (lb) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Milwaukee, the United
States' fourth-largest mutual insurer, is expected to announce as
early as Monday that it will acquire Frank Russell Co., one of the
nation's largest pension-fund advisory firms and the compiler of
the widely followed Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern is expected to pay about $1 billion for Russell,
based on recent prices for asset management companies, but
spokesmen for the two companies declined to comment on the
transaction Sunday night. According to people close to the
companies, negotiations had continued through the weekend and were
close to completion Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern, which is owned by its policyholders and dominates
the personal life-insurance market, has been on the sidelines in
recent years as other insurance companies have expanded into
broader areas of financial services. But it had hinted for months
that it was seeking an acquisition that would extend its reach
beyond its basic business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most big life-insurance companies have bought into asset
management,'' said Michael Frinquelli, a partner in Renaissance
Fund Advisors, a hedge fund specializing in insurance stocks.
``This is Northwestern's initial shot, and it is a big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Russell, a family-controlled company based in Tacoma,
Wash., would certainly offer Northwestern a broad footprint in the
financial services field. Besides its pension advisory work, it
markets mutual funds, private investment advisory services and
institutional brokerage services, in the United States and 25 other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had revenue of $305 million last year, is
controlled by George F. Russell Jr., its chairman and a grandson of
its founder, and members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell family owns approximately 60 percent of the company,
with the remaining 40 percent owned by its approximately 1,400
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the deal were first published on the World Wide Web
site of The Financial Times over the weekend. But some transaction
involving Russell has been expected since early this summer, when
Russell confirmed that the company had engaged Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
to advise it on estate-planning options.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Bloomberg News in June, Russell, 65, said
that the company's fortunes had risen sharply in recent years and
that he wanted to make sure that no crisis would arise if something
should happen to him or his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1936 as a small mutual fund and
brokerage company, is a brand name in the lucrative but highly
competitive pension-fund world.
</P>
<P>
   Besides managing about $40 billion directly, it advises a long
list of blue-chip corporate pension funds, including those of AT&AMP;T
and J.C. Penney, on asset allocation and the selection and
evaluation of money managers.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would give Northwestern, which has assets of $71
billion, an overnight presence in foreign markets. Russell has been
aggressive in forming joint ventures to develop and market mutual
funds to serve specific foreign markets. In March, for example, it
announced that it had joined with Societe Generale in Paris to
market mutual funds to its European customers. It has similar
relationships in Australia, Canada and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Russell created and maintains the Russell
stock-market indexes, the best known of which is the Russell 2000
index of small-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also created market indexes for investors in
Australia, Canada, Japan and Britain. Worldwide, more than $850
billion is invested in index funds that track these Russell market
benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if completed, would be the third acquisition of an
asset management company by a financial giant in recent months,
coming on the heels of Mellon Bank's purchase of Newton Investment
Management and Merrill Lynch's acquisition of Mercury Asset
Management.

PROFILES OF 6 AMERICAN VICTIMS OF THE KENYA BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ga., Fla., Va., Ind., Ala., Mo., Calif.)  (See also: AFRICA-BOMBINGS, AFRICA-VICTIMS, AFRICA-EMBASSY,

   They hardly thought of themselves as heroes. Some were clerks,
some were service personnel. Others were specialists in politics,
health or international aid programs. But they were also people who
loved music or dance, appreciated exotic lands and cultural
differences, liked tending a garden or studying Swahili. They were
sons and daughters, parents and siblings.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday the families, friends and colleagues of some of
the 12 Americans who died in the bombing of the American Embassy in
Nairobi, Kenya, spoke of them as heroes of a sort: They had come
from Georgia and Missouri, Indiana and Florida and other places,
and they were in Nairobi as Americans who wanted to work for their
country. As Kenneth Hobson Sr. said of his dead son: ``Anybody who
wears the uniform is a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the six victims profiled here, the victims included
Prabhi Kavaler, a Foreign Service officer; Julian Bartley, the
American consul general in Nairobi;, his son, Jay Bartley; Tom
Shah, of the embassy's political section; Jean Dalizu, of the
defense attache's office, and Michelle O'Connor, of the general
services office.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Louise Martin, epidemiologist
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Louise Martin, 45, an epidemiologist who had worked for
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta for more
than a decade, had been in Nairobi for three years and had recently
begun work on a pilot project there to treat children suffering
from drug-resistant strains of malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Like many expatriates in Kenya, Dr. Martin went regularly to the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi to change money and shop at the commissary
for hard-to-find American products. She was there on Friday when
the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New Orleans and the mother of three children, aged
14, 11 and 10, Dr. Martin studied veterinary medicine at Louisiana
State University, but friends and associates said she found her
true calling in research to improve the well-being of children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 she joined the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, and after two years of epidemiological training, she
embarked on eight years of research on birth defects, particularly
congenital heart defects, officials of the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin's husband, Dr. Douglas Klaucke, also was employed by
the Atlanta centers. Associates said both stood out for their
commitment and empathy. ``These are kind, loving, warm people,''
said Dr. Stephen Blount, the agency's associate director for global
health. ``They're not just regular doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jose Cordero, deputy director of national immunization
programs at the centers, said of Dr. Martin: ``She was very bright
and was always willing to step in when there was a challenge. She
was very, very outgoing, always happy, had a wonderful smile. She
was born in New Orleans and had this combination of Southern charm
and grace.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Douglas Klaucke was assigned to Kenya to work in a
polio immunization program for the World Health Organization. Dr.
Martin gave up her job with the Atlanta centers and the family
moved to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin concentrated at first on resettling her children,
then did volunteer veterinary work at an animal orphanage and field
work for the World Health Organization as it battled an outbreak of
fever in northern Kenya. An avid reader and kayaker, Dr. Martin
also acquired a working knowledge of Swahili.
</P>
<P>
   Klaucke recently signed up for another tour of two to three
years in Kenya, and Dr. Martin resumed the career she had set aside
to move to Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   She began working several months ago for the Atlanta-based Task
Force for Child Survival and Development, becoming associate
director of a program that provides a new drug, Malarone, for
victims of malaria who have shown resistance to other drug
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had enormous drive and the interpersonal skills and talent
to work with anyone,'' Walter Dowdle, director of programs for the
task force, said. ``She had this incredible ability to get down on
the level of children and relate to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't believe it's real,'' said Dr. Martin's sister,
Susan Bryson, of Lawrenceville, Ga. ``The only thing, she died in a
country she loved. She died doing the things she liked. She's left
behind so many people who loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Nathanael Aliganga, Marine sergeant
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Nathanael Aliganga had left his Florida roots far behind.
At only 21, he was a U.S. Marine security guard at the embassy,
where he was on duty Friday morning when the bomb blast took his
life. ``He died serving his country,'' said Capt. Landon Hutchens,
a Marine Corps public affairs officer.
</P>
<P>
   Aliganga had been at the embassy since late February, when he
completed Marine Security Guard School at Quantico, Va. The three
years since he enlisted, in January 1995, had been a whirlwind of
constant motion: recruit training at Parris Island, S.C.; combat
training at Camp Lejeune, N.C.; training as a communications
specialist at the Marine Air Ground Combat Center in Twenty-Nine
Palms, Calif.; Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he had gone on to postings in Okinawa, Japan and
Camp Pendleton, Calif., where he was selected for guard duty.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Lynn Olds, Air Force master sergeant
</P>
<P>
   Following in her father's footsteps, Sherry Lynn Olds had
enlisted in the Air Force right out of high school, hoping to see
the world, and she did.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Sgt. Olds, 40, spent two months in
Birmingham, Ala., taking courses to qualify for a promotion to
chief master sergeant. She was expected to receive her promotion in
a few months.
</P>
<P>
   During her course work in Alabama, Sgt. Olds also spent a week
at home in Panama City, Fla., with her parents, Delbert, now a
retired civil servant, and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a beautiful girl,'' said her aunt, Pat Casey. ``She
was very special to her parents.''
</P>
<P>
   After she went to Nairobi, she shipped African jewelry, amber,
carved wooden games and other presents home to her family.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the day two Air Force officers arrived with the
devastating news of their daughter's death, her parents received a
flimsy letter from Sherry in Africa. Inside the envelope was a
Post-It sticker. It said, ``Will e-mail you soon.''

   Molly Huckaby Hardy, administrative worker
</P>
<P>
   Molly Huckaby Hardy, 51, a career State Department employee from
Valdosta, Ga., had worked in Foreign Service posts around the world
_ in Asia, South America and Africa _ for more than 25 years.
Friends said she had always loved the adventure of life abroad, of
tasting other cultures and traveling to exotic places.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department described her only as an ``administrative
worker,'' and friends and family members said they never knew what
she actually did for the government. ``We never pried, we never
asked,'' said Marsha Bates, a longtime friend. ``She could have
been doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorced and the mother of a grown daughter, Ms. Hardy was
keenly interested in theater and dance, and involved herself in
community theater projects at many of her overseas postings, which
included Laos, Vietnam and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before her death in the terrorist explosion at the
embassy, Ms. Hardy sent home letters and photographs detailing her
work remodeling her home there and turning a small plot of ground
into a beautiful garden. ``She just loved being there, I think,''
Ms. Bates said. ``She found East Africa a beautiful place.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also hints in recent letters to friends and
relatives that her wanderlust was waning. She said she planned to
return to the United States, possibly next June, to work as an
instructor for State Department employees.
</P>
<P>
   A 1964 graduate of Valdosta High School, Molly Huckaby worked
for several years as a clerk at a local newspaper, where her father
was the advertising manager. She then attended Valdosta State
College before completing her undergraduate studies at a college in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, while working in Washington, she married
William Hardy of Jacksonville, Fla., who worked for the State
Department. Soon Ms. Hardy, too, was employed in the Foreign
Service. In Laos in 1973, Ms. Hardy became pregnant and was ordered
home, and her daughter was born in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The couple divorced in the late 1970s. Ms. Hardy continued her
Foreign Service career. About eight years ago, she bought a home in
McLean, Va., now occupied by her daughter, Brandi Plant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hardy was last in the United States in April 1997, to attend
the funeral of her sister, Patti Sanders, 46, who was killed in
Georgia in a head-on collision with a truck. She also visited her
newborn and only grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Hardy had occasionally had brushes with danger _ a
plane she missed went down in South Africa several months ago _ her
posting in Nairobi was not considered perilous. ``It was not a
high-risk facility,'' Ms. Bates said. ``And it was not a high risk
job. We never dreamed _ and she never dreamed, I'm sure _ that it
would come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Kirk, Air Force budget officer
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years in Africa, Arlene Kirk, 50, a native of South
Bend, Ind., who flew into Nairobi early Friday morning after a
six-week stay in the United States, had been looking forward to
going home for good next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bitter pill to swallow,'' said her sister, Katherine
Wright, from South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of six children, Ms. Kirk attended business school
at Indiana University, where she met her husband, Robert. After
graduation, the two moved to South Africa, where Kirk taught
democratic principles to township mayors. Later, the couple worked
for the federal government in various positions in Botswana and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Kirks moved to Nairobi with their son
Robbie Jr., now 14. Ms. Kirk was a budget officer for the Air
Force. Her husband, 50, is a project development officer for the
U.S. Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   Their oldest child, Maisha, 23, attends Tuskegee University in
Alabama. The couple lost a young daughter, Kamilah, to cancer in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   While at home in South Bend, Ms. Kirk cared for her parents,
Frederick Arthur, 84, and Mary, 83, taking them to the doctor and
trying to enroll them in exercise classes. She and her husband had
planned to extend their stay at home for several days, Ms. Wright
said, but Ms. Kirk worried that her bosses wanted her back at work
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   En route to Nairobi, their flight from Amsterdam was overbooked,
and the Kirks decided to give up their seats in exchange for some
money and a free night's stayover. But they were too late; other
passengers had volunteered. They got on the flight, arriving early
Friday morning in Kenya. Ms. Kirk rushed to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Hobson Jr., Army sergeant and aide to defense attache
</P>
<P>
   In the two small Missouri towns where he grew up, Sgt. Kenneth
Hobson Jr., 27, an aide to the defense attache at the embassy, was
remembered Sunday as a young man with a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said the sergeant regarded military life as an
adventure and intended to make a career of it.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, Mo., friends remembered Kenny Ray Hobson as a
talented and popular high school youth who played tennis, went
hiking, appeared in school plays, cooked gourmet meals, loved to
debate world affairs and had a taste for adventure that could not
be slaked in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   He was the son of a Vietnam War veteran, and after graduating
from Nevada High School in 1989, he joined the Army. What followed
were assignments to various posts in the United States and abroad:
to Germany, to the Persian Gulf during the 1991 war with Iraq and,
after Arabic language school in California, to Kenya last winter.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Deborah, a fellow Army enlistee, was mustered out
after their daughter, Meghan, was born two years ago. When Hobson
went into military intelligence training at Fort Gordon, Ga., and
in Washington, his wife and child lived for a time with his parents
in Lamar, Mo. But they accompanied him to Nairobi when he was
posted there last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lake Tahoe, Calif., on May 1, 1971, he was taken to
western Missouri by his parents when he was small. He attended
schools in Lamar, a town of 4,000, until the fourth grade. Then the
family moved to Nevada, 25 miles away, a community of 9,000, where
he finished secondary school.
</P>
<P>
   The family moved back to Lamar after he graduated. His father is
now a dispatcher in the Barton County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to Africa, said his mother, Bonnie Hobson, Hobson
was given a choice of four other assignments, all close to home.
But he chose the more exotic assignment in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   While he was listed as an administrative specialist at the
embassy, he told his parents he was not allowed to talk much about
his job, and they did not press him. They said he planned vaguely
to retire after 20 years of service, and then to attend culinary
school and perhaps open a bed and breakfast.

RESCUE EFFORT CONTINUES IN NAIROBI, DAR ES SALAAM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS   AND ANDREA USEEM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI _ While US officials tried to quell speculation about
who launched attacks on two American embassies in Africa, a tense
drama played out in Nairobi Sunday as Israeli soldiers and Kenyan
volunteers tried to extricate a dying woman from rubble at the site
of the more powerful bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
   As the rescue effort in Tanzania and Kenya entered its third day
and the official death toll climbed to 210 _ 200 in Nairobi and 10
in Dar es Salaam _ the Israelis, trained to deal with urban
terrorist attacks and equipped with hydraulic lifts, tried to free
a woman known only as Rose from the wreckage of Ufundi Cooperative
House, which housed a secretarial school and small offices.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was complicated by the need to use heavy earth-moving
equipment to excavate blocks of concrete without toppling the
remaining portions of the unstable building, and by the late
afternoon the woman had not been saved.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included 12 Americans, all in Nairobi. The 12th
American victim was identified Sunday as Consul General Julian
Bartley, whose son, Jay, a university student, also was
killed. &UR;  &LR; Dozens more people are believed missing and probably dead
in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   In both cities, the rescuers used bulldozers to clear debris,
pausing at times to let technicians with sensitive devices listen
for the cries of anyone trapped amid the jumble of cement, glass,
wires, and metal pipes.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rare moment of joy in the cordoned-off rescue area
in Nairobi when Israeli soldiers emerged from the twisted metal and
shattered glass of the Ufundi building with two survivors, a woman
and her son, who had escaped the blast unhurt. The two, who were
not immediately identified, had been too shocked and frightened to
walk down the 21 flights.
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern side of Ufundi house, a bulldozer scooped
concrete and loose papers and dumped the loads into a truck. At
first glance, it could have been a construction site in a crowded
downtown, but along with the detritus, several mangled bodies were
pulled from the wreckage and loaded into a Red Cross truck.
</P>
<P>
   Among those survivors watching with a mixed sense of relief and
unease was Aurelio Rebelo, a lawyer who barely escaped from his
office in Ufundi Cooperative House when it collapsed Friday
morning. ``I lost everything,'' said Rebelo, who escaped by
squeezing out of a first-floor balcony and scaling blasted-out
windows of a neighboring building. ``My entire library, all my
records.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal assistant remains buried in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   In their Sunday sermons in downtown Nairobi, clergymen called
for forgiveness. At the city mortuary, where families lined up to
identify bodies of missing relatives and friends, the talk was of
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we forgive people we don't even know?'' said Zablon
Obengo, 31, as he stood with other red-eyed relatives of his
cousin, a bank manager killed in the blast. After searching
hopefully but fruitlessly at one hospital after another, the group
had arrived at the last stop, the mortuary. The body was there.
</P>
<P>
   The mortuary _ where 48 corpses awaited someone to claim them _
was a scene of horror. Most lay on the bare cement floor, bloody,
half-naked and contorted. One man's skull was ripped open,
another's face was split in half. Several bodies were burned black.
</P>
<P>
   A horrific stench hung in the air.
</P>
<P>
   John Kamau Mwangi, leaning on his walking stick, bent over to
inspect the waxy bare foot of a corpse with half a head. His search
had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, his eyes wide, ``is my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey Gatitu Matu, who found his dead brother at the morgue,
spoke for many. ``If it is possible for those who did this to be
punished, that would be a good resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In both Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, police and rescue workers
said they will continue working around the clock to pull more
survivors from the ruins. But they admitted that their hopes are
dimming as time passes.
</P>
<P>
   In Nairobi, the specially trained 64-member Fairfax County, Va.,
Fire and Rescue team was searching the embassy with four teams of
dogs that look for bodies and body parts. The team took with it
55,000 pounds of preassembled gear, including concrete-piercing
drills, torches capable of cutting through steel beams, and
fiber-optic cameras.
</P>
<P>
   At both bombing scenes, the rescue workers balanced the need to
look for bodies and the need to preserve shards that might help
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets difficult to protect the integrity of a crime scene
when you've got bodies there,'' said the Rev. Charles R. Stith of
Boston, who will take his post as US ambassador to Tanzania next
month. He arrived in Washington Sunday for briefings at the State
Department with the emergency task force overseeing the rescue and
the investigation. ``You've got to get people who still might be
alive in the midst of the rubble, and that has to be the
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-story embassy building was so badly damaged that it
probably will have to be razed and rebuilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In both Kenya and Tanzania, most of the evidence technicians,
explosives specialists, terrorism analysts, and other investigators
from the FBI and other agencies had arrived by last night. While
the government refused to divulge exact numbers, officials said
that nearly 200 were working in Dar es Salaam and more were in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators might get a boost from video shot by two
closed-circuit cameras atop the embassy in Nairobi. One of the
cameras was blown off the roof, but US officials suggested that the
images of cars and pedestrians just before the blast might have
been preserved. In Dar es Salaam, a security camera remained on the
roof of the embassy, pointed at the heavily damaged gate.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials publicly and privately refused to name a top
suspect, or even to reveal what is known about the type and the
quantity of explosive used in the simultaneous explosions 450 miles
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the act of some isolated individual, a madman,''
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said. Appearing on ABC's
``This Week,'' he called the attacks ``long in the planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said that while some
Americans may want to retaliate, it is too early to talk about
striking back. ``While there might be an instant gratification to
do something about an attack on us, we have to be absolutely sure
we have the facts straight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memory of the United States is very long, and our reach is
very far,'' she said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, said too
many terrorist attacks have gone unsolved and unpunished.

HOT-HITTING OLERUD FINDS HIS GROOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ John Olerud had never heard of Ed Delahanty. Neither,
for that matter, had Mets Manager Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   For good reason. Delahanty concluded his major league career in
1903.
</P>
<P>
   But should Olerud win the National League batting title this
season, he would join Delahanty in an exclusive club.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Delahanty, who led the
National League in hitting with Philadelphia in 1899 (.410) and the
American League with Washington in 1902 (.376), is the only person
to win batting crowns in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be a household name like his,'' Olerud, who is known
for having a dry sense of humor, joked after going 4 for 5 against
the Colorado Rockies Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When told that Delahanty had been elected to baseball's Hall of
Fame (in 1945), Olerud said, ``Well, that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Olerud increased his batting average to a
league-leading .352 Sunday afternoon and extended his hitting
streak to 23 games, best in the National League this season, he
said he did not think about batting championships, Joe DiMaggio's
record 56-game streak or even the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet first baseman comes into every season with just one
goal: hitting .300. And, despite a lifetime .293 batting average
coming into this year, Olerud has accomplished this goal only once
in his 10-year major league career.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1993, when Olerud, playing for the Toronto Blue
Jays, flirted with the .400 mark all the way into August, before
settling for a .363 average to lead the American League. The next
three seasons, Olerud slipped to .297, .291 and .274, as the Blue
Jays tinkered with his swing in an attempt to get Olerud to pull
the ball more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a mess,'' Olerud said.
</P>
<P>
   So much so, that the Blue Jays shipped Olerud to the Mets after
the 1996 season for pitcher Robert Person. Last year, Olerud
started off strong, batting .356 in April. But that did not keep
the Toronto general manager, Gord Ash from playing down the early
success.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 17, 1997, article in The Toronto Star, Ash was quoted
as saying: ``People in this league know how to work him. They're
not at that point in the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   As the summer went along, Ash appeared to be correct. Olerud
slumped in late June, hit just .198 in July and did not fully
recover until September, when he finished off strong to hit .294
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, he didn't look much different,'' Ash said Sunday.
But Ash also said it wasn't a matter of him giving up on Olerud.
``It was more a case of Carlos Delgado,'' Ash said, referring to
Olerud's successor at first. ``Two guys at one position. One making
a lot of money, one an up and comer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appeared Olerud was in for a repeat performance this
season. On June 5, he led the National League with a .372 average.
</P>
<P>
   By June 30, Olerud was hitting .319 and had fallen out of the
league's top 10. Ever since, however, Olerud's swing has evoked
memories of the summer of 1993, when he could do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 1, Olerud has hit .411. In working with the Mets'
hitting coach, Tom Robson, to refine his swing, Olerud has found
the power that had eluded him earlier in the year, especially in
the way he has been able to turn on inside fastballs, while not
sacrificing his ability to hit balls where they are pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud's current 23-game hitting streak ties him for second on
the Mets' career list with Cleon Jones and Mike Vail, and is one
off Hubie Brooks' team record, set in 1984. Olerud's best is a
26-game streak, set in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as close to '93 as I've been in a real long time,''
Olerud said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Olerud is doing everything right. Not that he
blames the Ash for trading him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it proves anybody wrong,'' Olerud said. ``I
didn't have real good years the last few years in Toronto. I
understand why they were frustrated with the way I was playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, he was asked, has he all of a sudden found it again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Olerud said. ``In '93, I thought I had
things all figured out. The next year, I didn't have a bad year.
But in '95, I really struggled, and in '96, I struggled again. So,
no matter how well I'm doing, I'm not going to say I've figured it
out. It comes and goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Robson added: ``He's going to have another dip. It just
depends when and how long. Hopefully it will be right after the
playoffs.''

HARRY SCHARAGA, 88, HAILED AS SANITATION HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Scharaga, who did such a good job clearing snow off the
streets of Queens, N.Y., in 1968 that he may have helped doom Mayor
John Lindsay's presidential aspirations in 1969, died on July 28 at
his home in Lauderdale Lakes, Fla. He was 88 and had retired as
first deputy sanitation commissioner in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lindsay would have otherwise made a viable presidential
candidate after what happened _ or rather, didn't happen _ in
Queens in February 1969, he had about as much chance of winning the
1972 Democratic presidential nomination as a snowball in the hands
of an irate Queens resident picketing his campaign in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   As many Queens residents still recall with rancor, when 15
inches of snow fell on New York on Feb. 9, 1969, cleanup proceeded
apace elsewhere in the city, but in Queens, where Scharaga had
recently been the Sanitation Department's borough superintendent,
the cleanup was so sluggish that some streets were impassable for a
week and Lindsay was widely and extravagantly blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Various administrative lapses were singled out for blame, but
Scharaga's wife, Mildred, knew immediately and exactly what the
underlying problem was.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter from The Long Island Press called her at 3 a.m.
the night of the snowstorm to find out why the cleanup in Queens
was going so slowly, as she recalled last week, she gave him an
earful:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because my husband has been promoted to Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Scharaga, who had a recognized talent for planning,
organizing and directing complex operations, did such a good job
with snow removal and everything else in Queens that his promotion
seemed only reasonable, even if it did leave Queens residents with
what turned out to be unrealistic expectations for continued
administrative efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   That his promotion may have inadvertently left an administrative
vacuum that contributed to the dismal snow cleanup in Queens a
short time later was an irony not lost on the Lindsay
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of the 1969 Queens debacle, and with Lindsay in a
tight race that preceded his narrow re-election as mayor that
November, Scharaga had been promoted again, to chief of staff of
the Sanitation Department's bureau of cleaning and collection, and
put in charge of citywide snow removal operations.
</P>
<P>
   He planned so well and so thoroughly that in what became known
as the Christmas Night snowfall of 1969 so many snowplows and salt
spreaders were deployed so rapidly that the city was hardly
affected. And with the February storm still a raw memory, Scharaga
was hailed as a municipal hero.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later he tackled another festering problem that was
generating a wave of complaints. Finding that many city
neighborhoods ostensibly scheduled for three garbage pickups a week
were actually averaging only two _ and these so haphazardly that
residents never knew when the next one would be _ Scharaga came up
with an ingenious solution: He cut the number of scheduled pickups
in the affected neighborhoods to two a week but put them on regular
fixed schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay was so grateful that in August 1970, Scharaga was
promoted to the newly created post of first deputy commissioner for
operations. It was the first time in 28 years that a uniformed
Sanitation Department employee had made it to the commissioner
level, and Scharaga promptly earned his keep championing the
introduction of plastic garbage bags, which sharply reduced the
number of injuries to collectors.
</P>
<P>
   For Scharaga, who was born on the Lower East Side and dropped
out of high school to help support his family, the job and the
title were a culmination of a career of steady advancement.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the Sanitation Department in 1930, he rose rapidly
through the civil service ranks, his ambition fueled in part by
memories of his first sanitation job: shoveling refuse down a chute
into an incinerator, work so dangerous he had to wear a chain
around his waist to keep from falling in.
</P>
<P>
   Scharaga, a close friend of John DeLury, the longtime president
of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, was active in forming
the union in 1936 but elected to stay on the job rather than join
the union staff.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement, Scharaga fared somewhat better in Florida
than Lindsay had when his presidential campaign collapsed after
Queens residents followed him to Florida and jeered him in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   After four restless years, Scharaga became director of community
service for the Broward County tax assessor's office and did such
an acclaimed job that he held it until a few months before his
death.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Scharaga is survived by a daughter,
Arlene Eisenberg of New York City; a son, Victor Schargai of
Washington; three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

HERSHEL HERZOG, 74, PHARMACEUTICAL EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hershel Herzog, a pharmaceutical executive instrumental in
developing several popular antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs,
died on Aug. 4 at his daughter's home in Coopersburg, Pa. He was
74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was Lou Gehrig's disease, said his daughter,
Laura Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog received his bachelor of science degree in chemical
engineering at the University of Illinois in 1944, graduating summa
cum laude. After he received his master's degree and doctorate from
the University of Southern California, he went to work for E.R.
Squibb &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until 1950, when he joined Schering Corp., now
known as Schering-Plough, that his skill in the laboratory would
pay enormous dividends. Seeking to improve methods of
hydrocortisone synthesis, Herzog was part of a team that developed
prednisone and presnisolone, two anti-inflammatory drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The two drugs established Schering as a leader in the category.
Schering reported $45.9 million in sales in 1955, with $20 million
of that amount from prednisone. Two years later, total revenues
topped $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog was also part of the team in the early '60s that
developed gentamicin, an antibiotic used to treat eye, ear and skin
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, who spent 32 years at Schering, was appointed senior
vice president of drug development in 1977 and remained in that
post until he retired in January 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog married Levonna Horwin, another chemist, in 1944. She
died in 1995. Herzog is survived by their three children, Laura of
Coopersburg, Barbara of Montclair, N.J., and Daniel of Newark,
N.J., and two grandchildren.

 &HT;    Colbrunn content with second tour
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Greg Colbrunn has a career .278 batting average
with sporadic power (61 career homers) but respectable
run-production (one RBI per 6.9 at-bats). A first baseman, he had
played the outfield this season and can still play catcher, his
original position, if required. He plays hard. He is still just 29.
</P>
<P>
   This is not exactly the profile of a journey man. Yet, here he
is, in his second stint with the Braves, one of five teams to have
employed him. He is no closer to a multi-year contract now than he
was when he broke into the majors with Montreal in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the two decent seasons in Florida when I played every
day,'' he said. ''You like to think it would happen. But on the
other hand, I've had two major elbow operations. I mean, I'm happy
to have a job. There's two sides to every story.''
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn's first 10 days back with the Braves have been a smash.
Entering Sunday's game, he had three hits with a double and a home
run in his first six at-bats with five RBI. And he may well be the
best bargain on the team. The Braves are paying just $200,000
remaining from his $600,000 minor league contract he signed with
Colorado, in addition to a modest $30,000 bonus for each 25
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves obviously covet his services, having traded twice (at
the cost of three minor leaguers) to obtain him. This time, he
would like to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything goes right, yeah, that Braves are one of the
best teams to play for,'' he said. ``Bobby's (Cox) a heck of a
manager. They're built to win games. It's nice to be here for a
full year instead of coming in part-time. It's nice to be here but
it'd also be nice to be here from day one. I come in and they're 14
games up. They're going to win the division with or without me.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss out again
</P>
<P>
   Cox had Walt Weiss in the lineup until trainer Dave Pursley came
in early Sunday afternoon to suggest the shortstop be given a
second day off to rest his left quad. Weiss sat out Saturday's game
just to give him a break after a night game but he reported to the
clubhouse Sunday with some soreness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guy (Ozzie Guillen) just went 4-for-4 and Walt gets
almost four days off,'' Pursley said. ``It's not like he couldn't
play today.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuck on track
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker would like to think his slump is over. If hitting
safely in five of his seven starts didn't persuade him, Saturday's
4-for-4 performance finished the job. Tucker opened Sunday's play
with a .262 average, after leaving Atlanta at .253. He hit .180 in
July, his worst month as a Brave, but has gone 9-for-28 (.321) in
his last nine games and with his two doubles Saturday, he continues
to lead the club in that category (along with Andruw Jones) with
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been swinging pretty good for two weeks,'' Tucker said.
``A 1-for-4 doesn't do a thing. I need a few 2-for-3s and 3-for-4s
before anyone takes notice of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc. ...
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, when the Braves caught San Francisco on the last day
of the season to win the NL West, Atlanta has used 14 different
starting pitchers. The Giants have used 36. The Braves have won 93
more games than the Giants since then. ... The Giants wore red
ribbons on their jerseys as a part of the team's ``Until There's A
Cure Day,'' an AIDs salute.

ELIZABETH KARLIN, 54, INTERNIST WHO ADVOCATED WOMEN'S RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y., Wis.)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Karlin, a Wisconsin doctor, advocate of women's rights
and head of a clinic in Madison that was a target of abortion foes,
died on July 27 at her home in nearby Arena. She was 54.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain tumor diagnosed a few months ago, her
family said.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Dr. Karlin graduated from Bronx High School
of Science and Antioch College. She received her medical degree at
the University of Wisconsin and became an internist specializing in
endocrinology.
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a general practitioner in Tanzania before settling
in Madison with a practice in internal medicine. She began to
provide abortions in the 1980s even as more and more physicians
refused to do so because of the actions of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Until her illness was diagnosed, she directed the Women's
Medical Center on Madison's West Side. She was an outspoken
champion of women's rights to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I provide a full range of women's medical care and counseling
to women who largely have no other access to health care,'' she
wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1995,
``yet I am forced to wear a bulletproof vest, to outwit my
harassers and to hire security to protect my clinic and staff. My
job is to offer nurturing medical care to the women who least
expect kindness, excellence or even cleanliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Such caring and respect, she concluded, would actually serve to
decrease the number of abortions in the country in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karlin is survived by her daughter, Jessica Feierman of
Philadelphia; a son, Joshua Feierman of New York City; and her
mother, Rosa Karlin of Madison. Her marriage to Steven Feierman of
Philadelphia ended in divorce.

NO PRIVACY RIGHTS WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:   Someone in my company sent me an e-mail with confidential
information by mistake. While I was gone, my boss got into my
computer and deleted the e-mail without informing me. I found out
anyway, and feel this was an invasion of my privacy. Was this
legal?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Your computer and software is company property, just like
your desk and chair. And just as your company has a right to
examine the drawers of your desk, it has a right to go into your
computer and browse through your e-mail files.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy companies make sure their employees realize this, so there
aren't any unwelcome surprises in situations like yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I advise my clients to clearly state in their personnel
policies that computers are provided for business use, and
employees have no expectation of privacy,'' said Patrick Flynn, a
consultant with HR Management Solutions in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But even without a written policy, the company has a right to go
into your computer _ especially when there's a legitimate business
reason like deleting a misdirected memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one caveat would be looking at personal documents that
might be on the computer,'' Flynn said. ``If the company is doing a
search and comes across personal things, it's an open question
whether it has the right to copy them or delve into them.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here should be clear. Think of your office computer
as a glass box, with all its contents potentially visible to your
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss may never need to look inside. But to be safe, don't
keep anything there that you wouldn't want the company to read.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I soon will be leaving a major international firm after
one year due to a change in my husband's job location. Because this
is my first job after college, I asked my supervisor for a letter
of reference. She replied that it is against company policy. I
respect her position, but how can I prove to prospective employers
that I did a good job? I don't think a character reference from a
friend will sway anyone to hire me.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I've written before about how sad it is that many companies
no longer feel free to give job references, because they're afraid
of lawsuits. Here's a perfect example of the damage that does _ a
good young employee who may have trouble getting work because of a
lack of references.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Mandel, director of counseling at Alumnae Resources in San
Francisco, has a couple of suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a copy of your most recent performance evaluation, and
provide that in lieu of a reference letter. If your company doesn't
do evaluations as a matter of course, ask if you can have one
before you leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performance evaluations sometimes carry more weight with
employers than references, since they figure it wasn't done just
for the sake of impressing someone,'' Mandel said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to get a personal note or letter that can serve as a
reference from one of your co-workers, another manager, or a
manager who has left the company. If they don't want to put
something in writing, ask if you can have potential employers give
them a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't worry too much about references. Many of the other
applicants you'll be competing against face this same hurdle. And
prospective employers usually give much more weight to other
factors _ such as applicants' experience, skills and how they
present themselves in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   So focus your energy on writing a dynamite cover letter and
resume, and then acing your job interviews.
</P>
<P>
   And be sure to network, especially since you're moving to a new
city. ``Develop a strategy for how you're going to network,''
Mandel said. ``Use your husband's contacts and whatever career
centers are available. Call in favors from everyone you know here,
asking if they know people in your new city. ... I haven't seen any
change in networking being the most effective job-search
technique.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I run a small business and have a client who isn't paying
their bills. I've sat down with them and worked out plans to pay on
an installment basis, but they don't follow through. They owe me
about $8,000. Should I hire a lawyer and sue them, or what?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Free-lancers and small-business people with a
bill-collection problem have several options that are less drastic
than suing their client, according to David Perlstein, the San
Francisco author of ``Solo Success: 100 Tips for Becoming a
$100,000-a-Year Freelancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure you're dealing with the appropriate member of the
client's team _ the person with the power to sign checks. ``You may
have worked things out with your client contact, but you may not
have gone up the ladder to the head of accounting or the CEO,''
Perlstein said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a lawyer write your next letter asking for payment. It
may cost $200 in legal fees, but that's a worthwhile investment if
it shakes loose an $8,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a deal to accept even a small amount of money as an
initial installment to get the repayment ball rolling. Consider
dropping by the client's office to pick up the check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it helps to say, `If you can cut me a check right
now, I'll come pick it up,'' Perlstein said. ``Don't wait for the
client to say `The check is in the mail.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ You may also be able to sell this debt to an outside company
that makes money by buying and collecting people's receivables. You
can find such firms in the yellow pages under ``factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Factors pay a discounted rate for receivables _ for instance,
you might get $4,000 for selling them this $8,000 bill, Perlstein
said. The factor would get to keep all the money it manages to
collect from your client. You wouldn't have recouped the full
$8,000 you were owed, but at least you'd have gotten something.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might only get 50 cents on the dollar, but you'd get rid
of this matter,'' Perlstein said.
</P>

DON'T PANIC ABOUT ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY DOAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
As I reported in the July 27 column, most federal payments will
soon be made electronically in lieu of paper checks under the
Electronic Funds Transfer '99 Act. The change doesn't take effect
until January, and the Treasury Department says it will grant
waivers for certain people who want to stick with the
check-in-the-mail method.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But some unscrupulous financial service companies are telling
consumers that their payments will be delayed or halted immediately
if they don't sign up for expensive payment access services with
them, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what these businesses say, the government has not
started delaying or withholding any payments because of this
change. And it is still considering setting up low-fee
``limited-purpose'' bank accounts for people who aren't granted a
waiver.
</P>
<P>
   You can get more information on the government's electronic
payment plans by calling the federal agency from which you receive
payments or by visiting this Web site www.fms.treas.gov/eft/.

   USED VS. NEW CARS: Cars purchased when they're 1 to 3 years old
cost their owners an average 9.5 percent less to own and operate
over their lifetimes than do new cars, according to a study by
Intellichoice. The study looked at more than 2,500 cars, trucks and
sports utility vehicles (SUVs). It factored in depreciation costs,
financing, insurance and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The study also notes used SUVs cost 11 percent less to own and
operate than new ones, while pre-owned trucks cost only 6.2 percent
less than new trucks.

SMALL-CAP STOCKS PERK UP AFTER MARKET'S MELTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Are small-cap stocks finally making their long-awaited move?
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a year now, market gurus have been predicting that
the little guys were destined to rally. After all, the only stocks
out there that seem cheap by any rational measure (not that sanity
seems to matter anymore) are the small caps.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the most part, they've been clobbered while the big caps
continue to dominate what might be the twilight of this current
bull-run. Small caps, by the way, are generally considered stocks
with market-capitalizations (common shares multiplied by per-share
price) of less than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was a micro-trend, if you will, late last week
that caught the attention of some professional stock-pickers. Small
caps perked to life, bouncing back sprightly from Tuesday's market
meltdown. (In case you were too wrapped up in the Lewinsky
testimony to notice, the Dow dropped 299 points that day.)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday, the Russell 2000 index, which is an
often-cited barometer of small-stock performance, jumped 8 points
and 11 points respectively. The index closed Friday at 415.80, up
4.3 percent from Wednesday's close, which was a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great two days. I'm amazed at the way these stocks
have come back,'' says James Broadfoot, chief investment officer of
Ivy Management in Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, two days doesn't make a rally. But it's worth noting
because during past corrections, Broadfoot says, small caps were
hammered with the rest of the stock market but usually remained
beaten down long after the large caps started to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have expected (small caps) to go down with the broader
market and stay down. But here you have the small stocks
outperforming,'' says Broadfoot, who literally wrote the book on
investing in emerging growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has not been the case for the past couple of years,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's nearly impossible to tell if small caps are
really going to have their day in the sun. Institutional investors
tend to shy from them because the big-cap, name-brand stocks have
treated them so generously in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Russell 2000 is still trading down 23 percent
from its 52-week high of 491.41 in April. And 1998 certainly
doesn't rank as a banner year for the index.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the small caps are ever going to rally, they'll have
to make their move sooner or later. Despite the recent uptick, many
pros still think it will be later.
</P>
<P>
   NET NUTTINESS
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of stock insanity, let's talk about Internet
valuations. Of course, the mere mention of the two words (Internet
and valuation) in a single sentence should qualify the guilty party
for a free one-way ticket to the state mental institution in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, at the risk of engaging in a mentally unhealthy
exercise, some new data on Web site activity may be worth a gander.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a couple of semi-meaningful measurements that
analysts use in their economic models for Net stocks: revenues and
site traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And RelevantKnowledge, an online measurement firm in Atlanta,
has released its latest results telling which online outfits are
attracting the most eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   To little surprise, Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft continued to be
ranked 1-2-3 in June, attracting a total of 66.5 million unique
visitors (meaning an individual can be counted only once per site)
over the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   In the search engine category, Excite, Infoseek and Lycos
continued to rank second, third and fourth behind Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, online community GeoCities was the sixth most-visited
Internet portal, drawing 14.3 million visitors in July. Once again,
that showing underscores that it is among the last online name
brands to go public. (Its offering is expected this week.)
</P>
<P>
   Coming on hard was online community Xoom of San Francisco. The
GeoCities rival was listed as the 17th most-visited site in July
with 4.6 million eyeballs, up impressively from 21st in June.
What's more, Xoom wasn't even in the top 50 five months ago,
according to a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, I suppose they'll be going public faster than you
can say ``projected revenues.''

UC BERKELEY GETS FUNDS TO STUDY A KEY LAW OF CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FOST  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
The University of California at Berkeley will receive up to $10
million a year as one of the leading universities in an ambitious
semiconductor research project scheduled to be announced today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The project _ which eventually will parcel out $60 million a
year to six ``focus center'' universities _ aims to conduct the
long-term research that will drive the rapid, often incredible pace
of technological development.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force in the semiconductor industry has been the
theorem known as Moore's Law. First posited by Intel Corp.
co-founder Gordon Moore in the 1960s, Moore's Law states that the
number of transistors that fit on a chip will double every 18
months. Chips run not only computers, but all sorts of devices,
ranging from cars to clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's Law has held true so far, with Intel's latest Pentium
cramming 8 million transistors on a tiny sliver of silicon. The
industry is confident that it can achieve even more astounding
figures, such as 100 million transistors on a chip.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, however, more research is needed _ into the way
chips are designed, the materials that are used to make them and
the way the finished chips are tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be sure of the continuation of Moore's Law,'' said
Craig &UR;  &LR; Barrett, president and chief executive officer of Santa
Clara-based Intel and the leader of the Semiconductor Industry
Association's technology committee, which spearheaded the new
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The final details still are being negotiated, but if all goes
according to plan, UC Berkeley will run a focus center dedicated to
research on chip design. Prior university research in that realm
led to the establishment of the two leading companies in
chip-design software, San Jose-based Cadence Design Systems and
Mountain View-based Synopsys.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley would work as the hub, allocating funds and work to
other universities including Stanford University, Carnegie-Mellon
University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Project leaders also will announce today that the Georgia
Institute of Technology was selected as a focus center. Four other
focus centers will be announced in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Funding will start at about $4.5 million annually, according to
Richard Newton, a professor of electrical engineering and computer
sciences at UC Berkeley and the other project director. Within a
few years, that figure is expected to reach $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Semiconductor Industry Association, the leading trade group
in the chip industry, will pay for half of the research, with the
Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or
DARPA, and the chip equipment industry consortium SEMI/Sematech
splitting the other half.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reveals some of the unusual nature of the chip
industry. While the companies in it are fiercely competitive, they
also recognize the importance of funding shared research projects.
</P>
<P>
   Getting support for the initiative ``was like trying to herd a
bunch of cats and get them to march in single file,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Chip companies work together on a technology road map that gets
updated every year and published every two years. Each company also
funds its own in-house research and development, which leads to new
products.
</P>
<P>
   But university research often encourages the long-term thinking
that is missing from endeavors tied too closely to companies'
bottom lines. Barrett, a former Stanford professor, recognized the
importance of university research and also saw ``the federal
government pulling back from physical-science research toward
health-sciences research.''
</P>
<P>
   The chip industry also funds Sematech, a Texas-based effort that
researches practical manufacturing efforts, and the Semiconductor
Research Corp., a North Carolina institution that supports
university research. The SRC drew fire from some universities
several years ago for insisting that, in exchange for research
dollars, they surrender certain intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a history of a cultural mismatch between the SRC
and the university community over just what rights come with
(corporate-funded) research,'' said Michael Odza, publisher of
Technology Access, a Novato-based newsletter that covers the
transfer of technology from universities to industry.
</P>
<P>
   That dispute was resolved last year, according to Bill Hoskins,
director of UC Berkeley's Office of Technology Licensing. Companies
get access to the intellectual property developed with their
research dollars but have to pay royalties for other inventions to
which they did not contribute funding.

SUMMER CAMP COMBINES NATURE AND ACADEMICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ll) 
 By MACARENA HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mamasa Njie, 11, knew all about the mosquitoes,
poison ivy, uncomfortable mattresses and occasional homesickness
that awaited her at camp. But she had not counted on three hours a
day of reading, social studies and math and science classes.
</P>
<P>
   Mamasa, a sixth-grader from P.S. 64 in the South Bronx, is one
of the 1,300 New York City public school students attending summer
school at camp under a program started this summer by Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were just coming here and we'd pick what we
wanted to do, like in other camps,'' Mamasa said of her experience
at Camp Vacamas, near Butler, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what Crew had in mind. The chancellor, who
attended a summer camp in Maine when he was a boy in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., persuaded the board of education to help finance the program,
called Break-Aways Camp, not only to help improve schoolwork but
also to broaden the experience of inner-city children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exposing them to an entirely new perspective and their
understanding of life is just what a lot of our kids need,'' Crew
said. The camping courses, which carry no academic credit now, will
be evaluated, he said, and he hopes that the four-year pilot
project can be expanded and eventually involve 10,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to work very hard in being able to demonstrate that
this model has tremendous power,'' crew said.
</P>
<P>
   The program's start was touch and go because the board did not
approve the pilot project until late May, with an estimated annual
cost of $15 million to $20 million, which is supplemented by
private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The city contracted with 25 independent camps, some day camps
and others residential, ranging from the Brooklyn Center for Urban
Environment, which held sessions in Prospect Park, to Camp Ohnehtah
in the Catskills community of East Windham, N.Y. The Board of
Education provides the teachers, and the camps provide counselors
and other support workers. Tuition averages $400 for the sessions,
which run two or three weeks. The first camp sessions started in
June, and some camps have held more than one session.
</P>
<P>
   The board had planned for a program with 52 teachers and a class
average of 20 students, but was able to recruit only 39 teachers,
so classes are larger than planned.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers had already made vacation plans; others complained
that the pay was not enough. (At Camp Vacamas, it was $1,000 for a
three-week session.) Some of the 15 participating residential camps
threw in special privileges, like letting teachers bring their own
children at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   It proved easier to find students than teachers. Principals from
27 of the city's 32 community school districts selected candidates
from fourth through eighth grade, and then sought parental
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Mamasa and 20 other students from P.S. 64 were sent to Camp
Vacamas for three weeks. The three general school areas _ reading,
social studies and science and math _ are covered in two
hour-and-a-half classes a day, which frequently cover material in
more than one area.
</P>
<P>
   One reading assignment was to write a daily journal entry. After
three days, Mamasa wrote: ``Camp is all right so far. I am having
fun. We go swim everyday and go to classes. At rest hour I write
letters to my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Roser, 28, a teacher from Australia who was recruited by
Camp Vacamas for the summer as a counselor, said the students
envied the nonacademic campers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for them combining academics and camp activities,''
she said. ``You are combining two atmospheres.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to classes, students swim and take nature walks.
After two weeks, Mamasa and other campers could walk the trails and
call out oak, sassafras and pine trees by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mosquitoes are afraid of smoke, and I like that,'' wrote Lanna
Wilson, 12, in her journal. ``We lifted up rocks and we saw a lot
of nasty insects. I was the only girl who did not scream. I was the
brave one.''
</P>
<P>
   One city teacher who took a camp job, Linda Silverberg, a
computer teacher in Middle School 319 in District 9 in the South
Bronx, said she was concerned about the responsibility. ``I was a
little leery because I didn't know what exactly I was going to be
doing,'' she said. ``We thought we were going to have to cover
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The three teachers at Camp Vacamas chose to concentrate in one
of the course areas but to cooperate in planning and coordinating
lessons. Journal entries were used in social studies, for example.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon Mrs. Silverberg's social studies class was
presenting ``It's All About the Environment, Baby,'' a play
written, directed and performed by the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more here than what I have in my regular classroom,''
she said, ``They are touching and observing'' the trees and insects
and nature, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers were not the only ones who needed persuading. A few
parents were reluctant. Ydalia Perez, 40, did not like the idea of
having her daughter, Jessenia Liriano, 13, away for three weeks and
reachable only by mail, not telephone. It took a meeting with
teachers and a visit to the camp to persuade her to allow Jessenia
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can have more knowledge of what nature is,'' Ms. Perez
said. ``And she can become more responsible and take care of her
things. Over there she had to do her bed and wash her clothes. I do
all of that for her.''
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Vacamas, Jessenia had other responsibilities, like
writing and directing the play in Mrs. Silverberg's class.
</P>
<P>
   After the first run-through of the play, Jessenia, the actors
and the extras walked down to the lake for a quick swim before
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break-Aways is the bomb,'' she said, using a current term
according it the highest praise. ``We have school and camp all at
the same time.''

SMALL INVESTORS JUMPING ON IPO ROCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
After years of sitting on the sidelines, individual investors are
actively participating in the wild and woolly market for initial
public stock offerings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, they are getting a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   IPOs, formerly monopolized by institutional investors, were made
available to customers of such leading retail brokers as Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co. and Fidelity Investments starting last year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, retail customers can't always get as many shares as
they want. They can't always sell their stocks when they want, and
sometimes, the stocks they buy don't perform well.
</P>
<P>
   And when IPO shares are in hot demand, many customers can't get
them at all.
</P>
<P>
   But those who do participate in IPOs have made out well on
average. The IPO shares sold to retail customers have performed
better, by and large, than the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index _ the
leading stock market benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle examined 102 IPOs that have been sold to customers
of Schwab, Fidelity, E-Trade and a New York-based online broker
called Wit Capital since February 1997. A $1,000 investment in each
of them _ $102,000 all told _ would have grown to $117,675 at the
end of last month.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a hypothetical $1,000 investment in the S&AMP;P 500 at
the time of each IPO would have risen to just $111,231.
</P>
<P>
   Investors covet IPOs because they tend to be underpriced.
``Investment bankers usually do that as a reward for their best
customers,'' says Richard Shaffer, editor of Venture Finance
magazine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, once trading begins, most IPOs rise in value.
</P>
<P>
   A recent, spectacular example was Broadcast.com Inc., a Dallas
company that offers sporting events, music and news over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It went public at $18 per share on July 17, traded as high as
$74 that day and closed at $62.75. It since has tailed off to
around $50.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Broadcast.com was not among the IPOs that have
been made widely available to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Before last year, the only individuals who could get their hands
on IPO shares were those with lots of money and special ties to the
investment bankers that underwrote new issues.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to requests from its customers, Schwab wrangled
a deal last year with three leading investment bankers _ CS First
Boston, J.P. Morgan Securities and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist _ to
distribute shares in the IPOs they underwrite.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity struck a similar deal with Salomon Smith Barney, while
E-Trade now gets IPO shares from BancAmerica Robertson Stephens.
Wit Capital, which is not only a broker, but an investment bank,
gets IPOs from numerous other investment banks with which it does
business.
</P>
<P>
   The firms advertise their IPOs through selective mailings to
customers and by posting information on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, IPOs are in such heavy demand from so many quarters that
retail brokers usually can't get enough shares to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   At Schwab, which has distributed shares from 39 IPOs, only the
most-active and richest traders may participate. The IPOs are
reserved for those who place at least 24 trades per year with the
firm or who have account balances of at least $1 million, says Bob
Hannan, director of the syndicate department.
</P>
<P>
   That works out to just 3 percent of Schwab's 5 million
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks have a certain level of risk,'' Hannan explains.
``We have to make sure the customers we offer them to are
sophisticated, so we focus on our more-active traders.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which has participated in 29 IPO deals, has more
nebulous standards. The firm favors customers with ``long tenure''
who ``do much of their business with us,'' says Bob Mazzarella,
president of Fidelity Brokerage Services.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the only broker that makes IPOs available to all its
customers on a first-come, first-served basis is Wit Capital.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``We're trying to serve issuing companies by opening up their
lines of distribution,'' says Andrew Klein, Wit's founder and chief
executive. He says he hopes that this will persuade the nation's
big underwriters to give his firm still more investment-banking
business.
</P>
<P>
   Since last September, Wit has offered shares in 22 IPOs
underwritten by prominent investment bankers such as Goldman Sachs,
Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   To buy IPO shares from Wit, you must open an account with the
firm, which you can do electronically through its Web site, at
www.witcapital.com.
</P>
<P>
   Klein says that while the firm will sell IPO shares to any
customer, it is careful not to let customers get in over their
heads. ``If you have a net worth of $10,000, we would permit you to
buy maybe $1,000 of an IPO,'' he remarks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Most of the IPOs sold to Wit customers are not exactly
household names. The better-known ones include Rollerball
International, which makes in-line skates, and Cleveland Indians
Baseball, which owns the 1997 American League champions.
</P>
<P>
   All the brokerage firms ask their customers to refrain from
unloading their IPO shares quickly _ a tactic known as
``flipping.''
</P>
<P>
   The brokers do this at the demand of the underwriters, who are
committed to maintaining a stable market in IPO stocks during the
early trading days. If the customers flip shares, the underwriters
sometimes retaliate by withholding the commissions they normally
pay the broker for participating in the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-flipping dictum often conflicts with the interests of
investors, many of whom are drawn to IPOs because of the potential
for quick, large, in-and-out profits. If the profits aren't grabbed
quickly, they may evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Box Hill Systems, a New York-based maker of
data-storage systems, whose IPO was offered to Fidelity customers
last September at $15 per share. The stock surged to $20.06 on the
first trading day, but within less than two months, it had fallen
below the IPO price.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, it was trading at around $6.
</P>
<P>
   Wit Capital asks its customers to hold IPO shares for at least
60 days, and will hit those who disobey with an extra-large
commission on the sale. Normally, Wit charges $14.95 per trade, but
it imposes a surcharge equal to 5 percent of the transaction price
on a flip.
</P>
<P>
   If a customer flips 100 shares at $30 per share, for example,
the surcharge will amount to a stiff $150. Of course, that probably
won't bother customers who bought the stock for $10 per share. Even
with the surcharge, the net profit would come to $1,850.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab customers are asked to hold their IPO shares for at least
30 days. If they sell earlier, they don't suffer a money penalty
but they may not be allowed to buy shares in future IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   The same rules apply to customers of E-Trade Group, which has
sold shares in a dozen IPOs since last November.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity asks its customers to hold their stock for at least 15
days, and it, too, may restrict their participation in future IPOs
if they flip.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of flipping gets done anyway, much of it by institutional
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The underwriters ask the institutions not to flip, but the
biggest institutions can get away with it because of their
importance to the underwriters. No underwriter in its right mind
will cut off its nose by refusing to sell shares in future IPOs to
a giant mutual fund family.
</P>
<P>
   This disparity between the treatment of institutional investors
and small, individual investors recently prompted a multistate
group of securities regulators _ the North American Securities
Administrators Association _ to launch a formal investigation. The
investigation is still in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hurdles, hassles and obstacles, individual investors
seem pleased at the opportunity to get in on IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab customer Jack Diamond, a retired casket salesman in
Carrollton, Texas, has bought 500 to 2,000 shares each _ ``not as
much as I wanted'' _ in four IPOs: Blue Rhino, Capstar
Broadcasting, Keebler and USWeb.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask, Schwab will send you prospectuses,'' Diamond says.
``After reading them, I decided to try a little. It's up to you
because Schwab won't tell you whether a stock is good, bad or
indifferent. They only say that some go down and some go up.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``I'm happy with my choices'' _ as well he might be.
All but Keebler have performed far better than the overall market,
and even Keebler shows a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity customer Joseph Lupo Jr., a full-time investor in
Franklin Lakes, N.J., says he has gotten into ``a bunch'' of IPOs,
not all of which he could remember by name. His allotments have
ranged from a couple of hundred shares to several thousand per IPO.
</P>
<P>
   He says there have been ``some good deals,'' such as Qwest
Communications, whose stock has more than tripled since the IPO in
June 1997, and ``some down deals,'' including Earthshell Container,
which has lost more than half its value since going public last
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take the bad with the good,'' Lupo says. ``I'm
pretty happy.''

DAVENPORT GLAD TO BE PLAYING IN BACKYARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport will try to win her third consecutive Corel
WTA event this week at Manhattan Beach in the $450,000 Acura
Classic, which starts today at 10 a.m. The Newport Beach resident
won the Toshiba Classic in Carlsbad on Sunday and will be one of 28
players in the Manhattan Beach singles tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve matches, including four qualifiers, are set for today at
the Manhattan Country Club's stadium and court four. The fourth
match in the stadium between Los Angeles' Kimberly Po and France's
Julie Halard-Decugis highlights the first day. The winner will face
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, the second seed, has a bye with Nos.1, 3 and 4 seeds
Martina Hingis, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Monica Seles. At
Carlsbad, Davenport said she may play better in Southern California
because she receives more fan support than at other Corel WTA
events. She also said she looks at the events in Southern
California as tune-ups for later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to play near home, on the hard courts,'' she
said. ``For me, it's the perfect preparation for the U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Irina Spirlea, the sixth seed, will be the highest seed to play
today. She takes on China's Fang Li in the stadium at 7 p.m. Two of
the eight opening-round doubles matches also are today in the
tournament that runs until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many eyes will be on Davenport this week because she is close to
home and is coming off two wins. Even though she is ranked second,
she does not receive as much attention as others on the women's
tennis tour because she is not outspoken. Staying in the
background, however, is a role that she wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the position I'm in,'' she said. ``It's easier to stay
focused on your game when you're not in the spotlight.''

TELEPHONE STRIKE ENTERS SECOND DAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A strike against Bell Atlantic Corp. by 73,000
telephone service workers enters its second day Monday after
negotiations last night failed to resolve a contract dispute that
focuses on the company's use of outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The walkout by the Communications Workers of America threatens
to disrupt installation, repair, and, in some cases, operator
services for the company's 27 million customers from Maine to
Virginia. However, only minor delays were reported Sunday. Most
phone calls are routed automatically, and New York-based Bell
Atlantic said managers were filling in for striking employees.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA, which represents 2,800 customer service representatives
in New England, said it would &UR;  &LR; set up picket lines at Massachusetts
sites this morning. Protesters hit the streets Sunday in New York,
New Jersey, and West Virginia after the union's contract expired at
12:01 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're hung up over work being moved to nonunion
subsidiaries,'' Melissa Morin, president of New Hampshire-based CWA
Local 1400, said last night. ``We thought the issue had been
resolved because the company made certain commitments. Then, at the
last minute, it reneged. That's why we struck.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In New England, most Bell Atlantic workers are represented by
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. &UR;  &LR; This union
appeared to be near an agreement on its own contract but
negotiations were continuing. Even as negotiators continued to work
toward an IBEW accord, union officials said their members would
honor CWA picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we felt there was a major stumbling block, we wouldn't be
talking right now,'' said Edward Fitzpatrick, president of IBEW
Local 2222 &UR;  &LR; in Boston. The IBEW represents about 17,000 technicians
and operators in New England, including 4,000 in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hoey, a Bell Atlantic spokesman in Boston, said the company
has introduced a comprehensive offer that addresses all union
concerns, including temporary jobs, outsourcing, vacation policies,
and the expansion of high-technology union jobs in the company.
``From our point of view, the CWA strike is regrettable and, we
think, unnecessary,'' Hoey said.
</P>
<P>
   Morin, a member of the regional bargaining committee, said
workers were prepared to remain out ``until they have job
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, tempers flared in New York over a proposed
pension enhancement package that was to be offered to all customer
service employees before the Aug. 8 contract expiration deadline.
The package allows eligible workers who are near retirement to add
six years to their age and six years to years of service for
purposes of calculating their pension.
</P>
<P>
   According to the CWA, 13,000 employees, many of them based in
New York, did not receive the package as promised, prompting the
union to file a charge of unfair labor practice with the National
Labor Relations Board. Union officials representing more than 130
Massachusetts employees are expected to either join the complaint
filed in New York or file a separate charge in Boston today.
</P>
<P>
   Hoey said he could not comment on specific contract issues. He
noted, however, that the IBEW has negotiated an agreement with a
provision for the pension enhancements and with language on use of
outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The most recent CWA strike against Bell Atlantic took place in
1989 and lasted about three weeks. The CWA also walked out in 1989
at Nynex Corp., acquired last year by Bell Atlantic. That strike
lasted two months. &UR;

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ She already knew that her son was dead.
</P>
<P>
   But as Sue Bartley and 150 other mourners left a memorial
service here Sunday for the American victims of Friday's terrorist
bombing, they were hoping against hope that Mrs. Bartley's husband,
Consul General Julian Bartley, was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   They listened to a reading from Ecclesiastes, heard a mournful
rendering of taps and then went home to wait, grasping red roses in
trembling hands.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, their wisp of a hope was gone. Using torn
clothing, strands of hair and a ring, doctors positively identified
Bartley's badly disfigured body Sunday evening, adding his name to
a list of 11 dead Americans that included the Bartleys' 20-year-old
son, Jay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the last missing American,'' Chris Scharf, an embassy
spokesman, said of Bartley.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts the father and son were an immensely popular duo
whose headlong embrace of Kenyan life had been lovingly returned by
the people they met and befriended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julian was greatly loved by Kenyans,'' Scharf said, ``not only
because of his respect of them, but also because of his ability to
relate to the person who was trembling in line for a visa. He would
leave his office and go outside the embassy and work the line,
talking to people, asking them about themselves. He was
extraordinarily popular among Kenyans, even those who might be
denied a visa.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bartley was discovered missing, Kenyan soldiers searched
for him in local emergency rooms and the public morgue. But later
his body was found in a private mortuary where a tag misidentified
the body as that of a Kenyan, Scharf said.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony at Ambassador Prudence Bushnell's residence
Sunday, colleagues ``spoke about how Julian had touched so many
people,'' said Donald Mackenzie, director of the regional office of
the U.S. Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very special person,'' said Mackenzie, who found it
difficult to talk about his friend and colleague in the past tense.
``When he talks to you, you feel like you are the most important
person in the room, and not that he was looking around to see if
there was someone more important around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great sense of humor. Though I guess it isn't so
funny now, he used to say to people who came to him, `I'll take
care of you from womb to tomb.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bartley, 55, was born in Jacksonville, Fla., according to a
statement released by his daughter, Edith, who lives in the United
States and was en route Sunday night to Nairobi to join her mother.
He grew up in South Jamaica, Queens, where his mother, Gladys
Baldwin, still lives. He worked for the Foreign Service for 24
years, including assignments in the Dominican Republic, Colombia,
Spain, Israel and Korea. Before joining the Foreign Service, he was
a Peace Corps volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's crowded memorial service, held on the porch of
Bushnell's home, Bartley's friends recalled how he once took a
night job to help pay medical bills for his son Jay.
</P>
<P>
   People who knew Jay Bartley said he had come to Kenya two years
ago, full of youthful enthusiasm about Africa. When he died, he had
carved a young man's comfortably frenetic niche for himself in
Nairobi, coaching a girl's basketball team, jet skiing at African
beaches and teaching friends how to ride horses.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the bombing, Jay Bartley was working at the
embassy in a summer job, preparing for his sophomore year at the
U.S. International University in the Kasarani section of Nairobi,
about 12 miles from the city center. The college is based in San
Diego, but has an 1,800-student campus in Nairobi.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Freida Brown, executive director of the Nairobi campus, said
Jay Bartley had planned to spend one more year in Nairobi before
returning to the United States to complete his bachelor's degree,
possibly in international relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the explosion first hit, you felt detached from it,'' she
said. ``But Saturday morning, when they called me and said he had
died, I was totally distraught. Because I knew him and I could just
see him walking across that campus.''
</P>
<P>
   She described Jay Bartley as gentle, outgoing and caring, a
lanky young man with a wide grin and soft voice. He coached the
girl's basketball team at his former high school, the International
School of Kenya, and was known for teaching friends how to ride
horses. ``He was the kind of kid who got up first and made his
parents breakfast in the morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to Mombassa with some friends, Ms. Brown
recalled, Jay Bartley took it on himself to oversee the welfare of
a female student who had broken her leg after falling off her jet
ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took her to the hospital,'' Ms. Brown said. ``Then after
her foot was put in a cast, he piggybacked her to the bus. He was
always looking after other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said Jay Bartley had a learning disability that made
it difficult for him to complete written tests, but that he had
more than compensated with a buoyant, dogged personality and a
laptop computer provided by his father. ``It was a real struggle
for him, but he never let that stop him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown described Julian Bartley and his wife as similar to
their son: easygoing, upbeat, sociable people. ``Julian always had
a big smile and hug for everybody,'' she said. ``They were three of
a kind.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the Bartley home on Saturday, Ms. Brown
described Mrs. Bartley as being ``in a state of shock.'' Yet she
still had enough presence of mind to ask Ms. Brown whether she had
received a cookbook from the Nairobi American Women's Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's amazing,'' said Ms. Brown. ``She was looking after
people even in this time of sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives gathered Sunday night at Mrs. Baldwin's
two-story wood-frame house on 147th Street in Jamaica, but Mrs.
Baldwin declined to speak to reporters. A note on her front gate
said: ``The family would be both relieved and extremely
appreciative if you would allow Mrs. Baldwin the peace, dignity and
privacy to mourn the loss of her son and grandson.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Saltz, a former president of the Jamaica chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
recalled meeting Bartley on a trip to West Africa in the early
1970s. Bartley was in his early 20s, Saltz said, and even then he
expressed his hope of working in the Foreign Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time he was centered on working for the government and
being within the State Department or some government position,''
Saltz said in a telephone interview. The trip, sponsored by the
American Forum for International Studies, was intended as an
educational and cultural visit for Americans interested in Africa,
Saltz said.
</P>
<P>
   On the trip, Saltz recalled, Bartley had said he had joined the
Peace Corps hoping to be sent to Africa but instead had been posted
to American Samoa in the Pacific. After the trip, they remained in
touch, Saltz said, adding that Bartley had often gone home to see
his mother in Queens and would send cards from his postings abroad.

5 DIE IN A FIRE AT A HIGH-RISE IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five people died, including an elderly woman lunging for a
rescue ladder, after a fire broke out in a 20-story apartment tower
in North Bergen, N.J., Sunday afternoon and burned for more than
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started on the fourth floor of the building, which
houses mostly elderly people and low-income families, said Lt. Neil
D. Sanzari of the North Bergen police.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 residents, some in their 80s and gasping for air,
were taken to hospitals. At least seven firefighters were hurt,
including one who suffered second-degree burns on the back of his
neck and on his ears, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   A few residents fled through the building's garage. Others
rushed out the front door, some limping and others using canes.
Rescuers carried some residents in wheelchairs down several flights
of stairs filled with smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Sanzari said one woman fell to her death as she was about to be
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just jumped the gun,'' he said. ``They were bringing the
ladder right up to the balcony. But she didn't wait for them to put
the ladder on the railing. She grabbed it too quick and pulled it
right down.''
</P>
<P>
   The other four victims were found in the building and probably
died from smoke inhalation, Lieutenant Sanzari said. The
authorities had not released the names of the victims by late
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the fire was reported at 4:48 P.M. and
eventually was upgraded to five alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said they did not know the cause of the blaze.
But they said several oxygen tanks were found in the apartment
where the fire started, and the police said they received many
calls from residents and neighbors of the building who said they
heard a huge explosion about the time the fire started. Some
rescuers speculated that a cigarette could have touched off the
oxygen tank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John A. Caballero, who lives three blocks away and raced to the
building when he heard the explosion, said smoke quickly engulfed
the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big cloud of black smoke around the third and fourth
floors, and then it just kept going up and up and up,'' he said.
``It looked like a battle between the fire and the water. The water
was going in and the flames were coming out, but mostly it was just
smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The building, Westview Towers, is at 6115 Granton Avenue, near
61st Street, on the town's western slope in a neighborhood that
includes a number of buildings housing the elderly. The building
was evacuated, but the police said that it was not immediately
declared uninhabitable. Sunday night, the authorities were still
going door to door to check on residents.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers and firefighters converged on the scene from
throughout northern New Jersey. ``It looks like a firemen's
convention,'' Caballero said. ``Anywhere you are in North Bergen,
you can hear the sirens.''
</P>
<P>
   Police detectives and investigators were at the building in what
authorities called a standard response to such a huge blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll approached that of a fire in Passaic, N.J., in
May 1997 when six young children were killed in a blaze that tore
through their three-story wood-frame apartment house. All the
children were members of the same extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Heat and smoke _ but not flames _ spread through the tower, fire
officials said. More than 30 residents and at least seven
firefighters were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the North Bergen Fire Department said the building
had no sprinklers, and was built about 20 years ago, when only fire
alarms were required. Battalion Chief Charles J. Severino said the
building _ made of concrete, steel and bricks _ is designed to
contain a fire in the unit where it starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The down side of that is that the building holds a lot of
heat,'' he said. Chief Severino said firefighters were unable to
get down some halls because of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   North Bergen is a town directly across the Hudson River from
Manhattan, with what residents often call ``million-dollar views''
of the city. The building is in a working-class neighborhood with
narrow streets that quickly jammed with rescuers and panicked
residents when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the scene said the building is a privately owned,
federally funded center for the elderly, although some younger
people live there as well. Around 400 residents live in 285 units
on 20 floors.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christine Todd Whitman rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a question of flames spreading throughout the
building,'' Governor Whitman said. ``It was intense heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Renee Palumbo, who has lived in the building for 22 years, said
she was in her apartment when firefighters told her she had to
leave. As she was being escorted out, she saw flames shooting out
of one of the apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very scary,'' she said. ``I've never seen a fire like
this here before.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she left her two cats behind, but late Sunday night she
was told she would be able to return to her one-bedroom apartment.

`SEPHARDIC SANTANA' HAS JEWISH ROCK FANS DANCING 'TIL DAWN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBOURNE, N.Y. _ Jewish teen-agers with yarmulkes stuck firmly
to their heads were diving off the stage in the Ali Baba room at
the Aladdin Hotel, their fringes flying and their fists raised in
joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome!'' shouted one, falling into the melee of dancers
below.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, Yosi Piamenta and the Mizrahi Rockers were ripping
through what they billed as their first ``all-night rave,'' a
marathon self-promoted concert for which they charged $12 a head.
It drove hundreds of their fans into a frenzy of whooping,
stomping, rock-and-roll ecstasy that lasted until 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders _ and plenty of older-generation insiders _ might well
be puzzled at the partying in the heart of this Orthodox Jewish
community in the Catskill Mountains. But for those familiar with
Piamenta's heavy metal Hebrew jams, the music is a natural
outgrowth of their religious exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's a rabbi in Denver, and he's cool with this,'' said
Basi Twerski, 25, an elementary-school teacher in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Piamenta, an Israeli-born rock guitarist who became a Hasid,
shrugged at the notion of a conflict between an all-night rave and
his Orthodox faith, which prohibits women from joining their
boyfriends on the dance floor or even from moving to the music by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This was, he said, not a rave in the typical drug-induced,
dance-party sense. There were no blinding strobe lights or bumping
and grinding couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you can't wear the tsitsith and say, `Come on, baby,'''
Piamenta said, laughing and pointing at the fringes worn to remind
Orthodox Jews of God's commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Widely acknowledged by rock critics as a guitar virtuoso,
Piamenta, who now lives in Brooklyn, delights in swinging his
Fender Stratocaster behind his head and playing backward, a la Jimi
Hendrix, while he sings in Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   His set list ranges from Hebrew versions of popular hits like
the 1980s tune ``Down Under'' by Men at Work to his own religiously
themed jams. ``The music is maybe a little scary to some people,
but the message is kosher,'' said Rebecca Lillian, 39, a rabbi from
Skokie, Ill., who has been a Piamenta fan since the 1970s, when she
heard him in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday happened to be the first Sabbath, known as Shabbos
Nachamu, after a three-week period during which Orthodox Jews do
not eat meat, drink wine, celebrate in any way or listen to music.
Now they were ready to cut loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss it?'' said Michelle Newman of Brooklyn. ``It drove me
crazy not hearing music for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not surprising to see this,'' said a 36-year-old
diamond dealer from Great Neck, N.Y., who was watching the frenzy.
``The Orthodox are not afraid to be spiritual.''He added, ``And
hey, it's as close to Jerry Garcia as Orthodox Judaism's going to
get, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Mentioning the late guitarist and leader of the Grateful Dead
appears to be unavoidable at Piamenta's concerts. With his full
beard, tie-dyed shirt (adorned, of course, with religious fringes)
and a psychedelically embroidered skullcap, the ``Sephardic
Santana,'' as he is sometimes called, makes no apologies for
embracing the trappings of the counterculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 20 years I've been doing concerts for Jews, when really my
thing is rock-and-roll,'' Piamenta said. ``I'm a Jewish
rock-and-roller.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Piamenta, 46, who has six children, admitted to feeling
``dead'' the morning after his all-night show. His working weekend
was not over yet. In the afternoon he would be back in Brooklyn to
play another concert, and in the evening, a bar mitzvah in New
Jersey. (For years, weddings and bar mitzvahs have been Piamenta's
main means of support, though he recently broke into the New York
City club scene with gigs at the Knitting Factory and Wetlands,
both in TriBeCa.)
</P>
<P>
   ''He's good, real good,'' said Police Officer Jason Berger, 28,
of Fallsburg. ``I'm the only Jewish cop anywhere around here, so I
had to stop by and check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no hint of marijuana in the air, no underage drinking,
and other than hundreds of fans smoking cigarettes, no evidence of
any typical rock show vices.
</P>
<P>
   Rock fans will be rock fans, however, even here. Though skirts
hung properly long, some were more revealing than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture,'' Ms. Newman said, ``we can't really go out
there, but we love the music.''

A YEAR OF LIVING WITH THE LOUIMA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abner Louima bowed his head Sunday as he stood in
front of the Club Rendez-Vous in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where on a
steamy night exactly a year ago, prosecutors say, he became the
victim of a sequence of brutal acts at the hands of police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   A small gathering that included Louima's family and friends and
the parents of people who had died while in police custody were led
in prayer by the Rev. Al Sharpton. ``We come not to rally today,
but to pray,'' Sharpton said. ``We gather where Abner's blood began
to flow a year ago. A year ago, he was alone. Today, the whole city
stands with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year that has passed, doctors operated on Louima three
times to repair the injuries from that night. And at the same time,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police officials have made changes in
the department to try to repair relations with the community and to
eliminate the climate that they feared could have allowed the
incident to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say those changes have been largely cosmetic and
have not been felt throughout the department. More important, they
say, the mayor lost a golden opportunity to make much-needed and
systemic change.
</P>
<P>
   Louima was arrested a year ago during a brawl outside the Club
Rendez-Vous, at 1438 Flatbush Ave. Prosecutors say that four
officers beat him in a police car on the way to the 70th Precinct
station house, and that two of the four tortured him after arriving
there.
</P>
<P>
   One officer, Justin Volpe, is accused of ramming a stick into
Louima's rectum and then into his mouth, inflicting major internal
injuries; and a second, Charles Schwarz, is accused of holding
Louima down during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The case put a bright light on the Police Department and its
relationship with the people it patrols. In ethnically diverse
neighborhoods like those of the 70th Precinct, many residents,
especially Caribbean immigrants, said they had seen a pattern of
rudeness, rough treatment and abuse against black residents,
particularly from the largely white police force.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the Police Department's first steps after the
incident, in each of the city's 76 precincts lieutenants replaced
young and inexperienced sergeants as desk officers, the ones who
most commonly deal with the public.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also allocated $1.5 million to the Civilian Complaint
Review Board to hire a dozen senior investigators, people with
prior experience in law enforcement. That change was intended to
strengthen the police watchdog group, which has been widely
attacked by critics saying its investigations of police actions
have been shoddy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also created a 31-member task force, made up of
community advocates and leaders, to examine relations between
residents and the police.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the substantive changes occurred at the 70th
Precinct itself. A few days after the incident, officials replaced
the precinct's chief with Inspector Raymond Diaz, a popular
commander with extensive background in community policing who had
been in charge of precincts in East Harlem and in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz transferred about 24 officers and recruited more black
officers. Three of the last five new officers assigned to the
precinct are of Caribbean ancestry and live in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 35 percent of the 270 officers in the precinct are
black, including Capt. George Clouden, one of the executive
officers. Diaz said that the precinct was designated as a place
where immigrants can be fingerprinted for their naturalization
applications. So far, more than 1,000 people have used the service.
That, Diaz said, gave residents a different view of the station
house.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Diaz has attended and held scores of meetings
with various community groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can knock on the door and come to see me,'' said Diaz,
who added that he has given neighborhood residents his direct phone
number at the station house. ``And it doesn't have to be a
community leader; it can be anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday at least one critic said nothing had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's outrage of a year ago has abated,'' said Public
Advocate Mark Green, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for
the U.S. Senate. He spoke to an assembly at the Evangelical Crusade
of Fishers of Men Haitian Pentecostal Church in Flatbush. ``City
Hall has taken next to no action, and Mayor Giuliani has denigrated
his own civilian task force,'' he told the assembly, which included
Louima.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In March, the mayor's task force issued a report asking for
tougher screenings for police cadets, suggested that new recruits
be required to live in the city, and asked for bigger salaries for
officers who agree to continue on patrol duty. But Giuliani
dismissed most of its findings, saying that some of them ``are
unrealistic and make very little sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said in an interview that a year later there was
still no special prosecutor for police brutality, and there were no
residency requirements for police officers and no end to the
so-called 48-hour rule, which gives patrolmen involved in an
incident two days before they must talk to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   There have been few efforts to increase the number of captains
who are members of minorities, critics said. Of the 371 captains in
the department, 10 are black, six are Hispanic and one Asian. It is
widely believed that captains set the tone for a precinct more than
anyone, much the way that midlevel managers do in an office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago he was in a jam,'' said Siegel, a member of the
mayor's civilian task force, which has not met since March. ``He
came to some of his critics and said he was open to change. He
really wasn't at all. He simply wanted to manage the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Requests for comment from the mayor's office were referred to
Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   For Haitian residents, the Louima incident exposed the
vulnerability of a group that had had a closely held belief that
they could move into the mainstream by keeping to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to draw out a lot of Haitians into the fold,''
said Tatiana Wah, chairwoman of the Haitian-American Alliance, a
community group. ``These are people who had been away from the
community and are coming back saying, `How can we really help?'
This thing had shocked a lot of us.''
</P>
<P>
   After several protests and rallies, more and more Haitians are
getting involved in politics, including Samuel Nicolas, Louima's
cousin, who gained prominence as the family spokesman after the
incident. He is running for the Democratic nomination for
Brooklyn's 42nd Assembly District, an area that includes Flatbush
and parts of Crown Heights. There are now Haitians on the city's
community and school boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for a long time we've isolated ourselves,'' said Ms.
Wah, whose organization and others like it have increased the
number of citizenship and voter-registration drives in Queens and
Brooklyn, where some of the largest Haitian enclaves are located.
``We're a young immigrant group. We didn't know better. It's
finally sinking through that there are things we must do.''

DRY SPELL THREATENS CROPS IN NEW JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
   (ll) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey farmers are facing drought conditions as the New York
City region contends with one of its driest summers in years.
</P>
<P>
   It has yet to rain in August in New York City or in most of New
Jersey. July brought a mere drip of water, compared with normal
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a wet spring, rainfall for the year is actually above
normal, according to meteorologists, and reservoir levels are high.
The early part of this week may bring scattered showers and even
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   But the wet spell likely will be short-lived, and a few moist
days may not be enough to help farmers whose crops have been
damaged by high temperatures and drought conditions on the heels of
an unusually wet spring.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, ``much of the state has been bone-dry in
August,'' following a below-normal July, said Art Kraus, a National
Weather Service meteorologist based in Mount Holly, N.J. In July,
rainfall in Atlantic City was 2.41 inches below normal; in Newark,
it was 3.18 inches below normal.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey farmers are pouring money into irrigation and
anxiously watching their crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been irrigating around the clock,'' said Peter Demarest
of the Demarest farm in Hillsdale, after a half inch of rain in 39
days.
</P>
<P>
   His peaches are small but sweet, he said, but his pumpkins are
imperiled. He already replanted an entire pumpkin field after an
excess of rain in June. Now, he said, ``If I don't get water in
there in the next week or two, I'm in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Demarest said, is the sharp change from an
especially wet spring, which was preceded by an ``ultramild''
winter. ``I've seen more severe droughts,'' he said, ``but I've
never seen a season like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the southern part of New Jersey, the story is much the same.
Bill Brooks Jr., who runs Dusty Lane Farms in Elmer, N.J., and is
the president of the State Board of Agriculture, said his potato
yields were above average, thanks to a rainy May and June, but his
grain crops were being hit hard by the subsequent dryness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our yields will be off substantially,'' he said, adding that a
depressed market for corn and soybeans will exacerbate the wounds
inflicted by weather.
</P>
<P>
   Central Park's average rainfall for July is 4.35 inches; this
July brought only 1.09 inches. It was the seventh-driest July since
record-keeping began in 1869, said Joe Koval, a meteorologist with
the Pennsylvania State University department of meteorology. Based
on the average for years past, August should have brought a
``little over an inch by now,'' Koval said. Instead, the month's

HENRY BUTLER, 79, STAGED AND DIRECTED OPERAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry Butler, a versatile director and stager who was
best known for his work in opera, died on Aug. 1 at St. Vincent's
Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in a nursing home in
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer of the esophagus, said Marvin David Levy, a
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Butler wrote the libretto for the opera ``Mourning Becomes
Electra,'' which Levy composed. It had its premiere in 1967 at the
Metropolitan Opera House. Levy has been revising the opera for a
new production by the Lyric Opera of Chicago that is to open on
Oct. 6.
</P>
<P>
   After the opera's original opening, the critic Donal Henahan
wrote in The New York Times that the work, a ``three-act setting of
O'Neill's setting of Sophocles,'' was ``incontestably the most
successful new American opera produced last season at the
Metropolitan Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler directed a 1973 revival of the operetta ``Desert Song''
at the Uris Theater. He also staged a 1972 production of Bellini's
``Sonnambula,'' with Renata Scotto and Nicolai Gedda at the
Metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he staged the 1904 operetta ``Cendrillon'' at the
Newport Music Festival in Rhode Island. He also bridged sections
with a brief English narrative while the singers used the original
French of the operetta, whose words and music were by the singer
Pauline Viardot-Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's debut at the Metropolitan was his 1961 staging of
Puccini's ``La Fanciulla del West.'' Another Times critic, Harold
Schonberg, applauded him for staging the performance ``with skill,
handling the crowd scenes deftly, making the best of the awkward
situations in the libretto.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler's other work, which included acting, ranged from
off-Broadway productions to directing the Miss America pageant of
1956. He was widely known early in his career as Bill Butler, and
his Broadway and television credits in the 1950s were under that
name. He began using the professional name Henry Butler when he
started staging operas at the Metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
   He received grants from the Guggenheim and Rockefeller
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was born in Eureka, Kan., and went on to receive a
bachelor's degree in 1942 from the University of California at Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a nephew, Dr. Luther Creed, of Las Vegas.

COURVILLE WINS SECOND STRAIGHT METRO AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALAX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCARSDALE, N.Y. _ Jerry Courville Jr. lived up to his reputation
as one of the New York metropolitan area's most prominent amateur
golfers Sunday when he captured his second consecutive Metropolitan
Golf Association Amateur Championship with a 1-up triumph over Jeff
Putman at Quaker Ridge Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Courville and Putman were the last two players left from the 715
who entered the 96th edition of the oldest regional amateur event
in the country. They went into the 35th hole of today's 36-hole
match-play final even, and both found the fairway with their drives
on the 364-yard hole. But only Courville hit his approach onto the
green after a shift in wind cost Putman dearly.
</P>
<P>
   A light wind was behind Putman just before his shot on the
course's 17th hole, but it shifted during the shot and forced his
sand wedge from 115 yards to fall into high rough near a greenside
bunker on the left side. He ended up with a bogey-5, while
Courville made par to break the tie in a roller coaster of a match
at the 6,835-yard, par-70 course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fooled on 17,'' Putman said. ``I was 115 yards away and
I thought a wedge was OK with downwind, but it went 85 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit two clubs wrong, on 16 and 17, and I gave it to him,''
said Putman, who also made a bogey-5 on the 16th when his approach
flew past the green.
</P>
<P>
   Both players parred the 440-yard 18th hole, and Courville won
the Met Amateur for the third time in the last four years. It was
his second title this season at Quaker Ridge, where he captured the
Hochster Memorial in June.
</P>
<P>
   Courville also won all his three matches in last year's Walker
Cup here to lead the United States to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comfort factor to know the course,'' said Courville,
39, a member of Shorehaven Golf Club in East Norwalk, Conn., where
he works as an office manager. ``Knowing where to hit and where not
to hit helps, but Jeff knows this course, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Putman, 31, an investment banker in Manhattan and a member of
Somerset Hills Country Club in Bernardsville, N.J., captured the
tournament title in 1993 shortly after he regained his amateur
status. He played well enough to win all week, except on two of the
final three holes.
</P>
<P>
   Putman eliminated Greg Rohlf, the low medalist, in 24 holes in
the first round of match play and Ed Gibstein, who won a match in
this year's British Amateur. Hitting the wrong clubs in two of his
final three approaches cost him this tournament, however, because
Courville's play was slightly below his usual high level as a
result of back pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have to defend, I wouldn't have played because of
my back,'' Courville said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's August, so of course we're talking NBA....
Hoop fans, if they can stand any more abuse after the Karl
Malone/Dennis Rodman rasslin' match, are in for a long winter.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are the NBA owners and players are prepared to
act like babies and make everyone think Jerry Reinsdorf knew what
he was doing with the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern and several team owners on Thursday
abruptly walked out of the first meeting between league and the
players' union since June 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got up and walked out. It seemed more feigned than
anything else. It looked like a charade,'' NBA union director Billy
Hunter said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   This is all just posturing. The owners are prepared to see this
out to the bitter end, and the players _ for now _ are united.
Don't expect any meaningful negotiations to begin until at least
October and don't be surprised if the season doesn't start on time.
Count on watching the Rose Bowl before seeing any Lakers game this
season.
</P>
<P>
   _Let's see if we've got this right. You are in the middle of a
pennant race. You need pitching but fail to acquire any before the
trading deadline. Less than a week later, you designate one of your
leading RBI and homer guys for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   You are the Angels. You are now two games out of first place in
the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Cecil Fielder looked like Cecil B. DeMille on a few
at-bats this year. And his days of hitting as many homers as his
pants size are long gone. Still, Fielder was on pace for 24 homers
and 98 RBI when the Angels said, ``See ya.'' The club treated him
like he was Jeff Manto instead of the established, respected
veteran that he is.
</P>
<P>
   I guess it makes as much sense as trading for Jeff Juden.
</P>
<P>
   _Quick: How are the Angels like Venus de Milo?
</P>
<P>
   No arms. Oh, where have you gone Mike Witt, Kirk McCaskill?
</P>
<P>
   _It's August, so of course we're talking hockey.... So Disney
wants the NHL so badly it's willing to shell out $600 million for
five years just to televise the one sport that is so much better to
watch live.
</P>
<P>
   By the way it has handled the Ducks/Paul Kariya situation/Ron
Wilson fiasco, you would have thought it did not care much at all
for the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Disney can do something for the league whose TV ratings
last season were lower than rhythmic gymnastics'.
</P>
<P>
   _Just wondering. Who's running things at Disney: Huey, Dewey and
Louie?
</P>
<P>
   _It's August, so of course we're talking college football....
Don't send in any more ballots, the voting's over. The quote of the
year _ yeah, we know there's four months to go _ goes to Texas A&AMP;M
football coach R.C. Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   Said Slocum on losing prized recruit Chip Ambres, who signed a
professional baseball contract with the Florida Marlins for $1.5
million: ``I have a lot of rules and no money. Baseball has a lot
of money and no rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Slocum has forgotten the reign of Barry Switzer at
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   _I didn't vote in the recent Pac-10 media poll, but if I had, I
woulda picked 'em in this order: UCLA, Arizona State, Washington,
USC, Oregon, Arizona, Washington State, Stanford, Oregon State and
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   _It's August, so of course we're talking about another Dodgers
collapse.... This quote by Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park pretty much
summarizes the whole season, from the Mike Piazza contract squabble
to the firing of Fred Claire and Bill Russell to the botched trade
of Randy Johnson, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was stupid,'' was Park's response to blowing a 4-0
eighth-inning lead to the Montreal Expos (team motto: We'll trade
you anything. Just ask.) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No, Chan Ho, you're being too hard on yourself. Inept is the
word you were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   But give some credit to Park. At least he answered for his poor
performance and in English, no less. Can you interpret that, Hideo
Nomo?
</P>
<P>
   _And finally, this is what Wilt Chamberlain had to say about all
this NBA foolishness:
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball should have taught all these leagues a lesson, but
apparently it hasn't. I hope I don't reflect the entire population
of basketball fans, because if I do, the league is in big trouble.
I have no patience for this.''
</P>
<P>
   And neither do we. &QL;

SKINNER UPSTAGES TEAMMATE EARNHARDT

 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ The hottest driver at Richard Childress
Racing is not seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion Dale
Earnhardt. And ``The Intimidator'' knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Mike Skinner stamped himself as an emerging road-racing
ace Sunday with a career-best third-place finish in The Bud at The
Glen, an event that continued to showcase a run of success for RCR.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner was in contention for his first Cup victory until passed
by eventual race-winner Jeff Gordon on lap 87 of the 90-lapper over
the 2.45-mile Watkins Glen International road-course. Earnhardt,
whose year was made by his victory in the season-opening Daytona
500, finished 11th to preserve his top-10 standing (ninth) in the
points chase.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner and Earnhardt finished fourth and fifth, respectively,
in the Brickyard 400 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway last
weekend. And Skinner posted a fifth-place result at the New
Hampshire International Speedway on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race was the seventh for Skinner and respected crew
chief Larry McReynolds, who left Earnhardt's team and swapped
places with Kevin Hamlin in mid-June in an effort to rejuvenate
both underachieving teams.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who made his last pit stop on lap 51 of 90, said
McReynolds instructed him to conserve fuel in the waning stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably had enough gas left to win the race, but I didn't
know it,'' said Skinner, the 1997 Cup rookie of the year and driver
of the No. 31 Lowe's Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``I couldn't see inside
that gas tank. We've had some great strategy, and we've kept the
fenders on the cars. That's how we've got three top-fives in the
last four races.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt also was playing the fuel-mileage game to gain
critical track position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving the right way. We were just out of the top 10,''
said Earnhardt, driver of the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus
Chevy. ``Congratulations to Larry McReynolds and Mike Skinner and
that RCR team. They were on the same strategy we did _ and they
pulled it off.'' NUTS AND BOLTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeff Gordon is the only driver to lead at least one lap in 16
of the 20 races this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark Martin has been running at the finish of the past 36
races.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dale Jarrett, who finished fifth, scored his second top-five
finish at The Glen, but remains winless in 12 races here. It was
his eighth top-10 finish in the last 10 races.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeremy Mayfield, considered among Gordon's championship
threats at midseason, has posted five consecutive finishes of 18th
or worse since his first career victory at Pocono Raceway on June
21. He finished 31st here.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kyle Petty, who finished sixth in the No. 44 Mattel Hot Wheels
Pontiac Grand Prix, made the best points move of the race by
climbing from 31st to 27th.
</P>
<P>
   _ Petty, Sterling Marlin (seventh, second time) and rookie Jerry
Nadeau (15th) joined Skinner in posting season-best finishes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ricky Craven has finished 29th, 41st, 17th and 35th since
qualifying on the pole in his return to the series at New Hampshire
International Speedway on July 12.

 &HT;    Martinez overtakes Marichal as winningest Latin American
pitcher; Braves win 7-5
 &HT;    By Tom Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Working on the mound that Juan Marichal once
called home, Dennis Martinez, replaced the Giants great in baseball
history Sunday night. He won No. 244.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez worked a scoreless eighth inning and was the pitcher of
record when Chipper Jones' two-out, two-run single broke a tie in
the ninth and gave the Braves a 7-5 victory, making the 43-year-old
Nicaraguan the winningest Latin American pitcher of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Andres Galarraga both hit two-run homers as the Braves
swept the Giants. Atlanta hit 11 homers in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Gerald Williams legged out a swinging bunt, which
Ozzie Guillen followed with a double, his third in two games. After
Tony Graffanino struck out, Chipper Jones, who hit a two-run homer
in the first, drove a 2-2 pitch into center to score both runners.
</P>
<P>
   Starter John Smoltz struck out nine while allowing six hits and
took a 5-4 lead into the seventh but did not figure into the
decision. The Giants put two men on with Barry Bonds, who had
already homered twice, coming to the plate. John Rocker walked
Bonds on a full count to load the bases for Jeff Kent and, with
Rudy Seanez replacing Rocker, Kent lifted a sacrifice fly to right,
tying the score 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez was charged with his first blown save as a Brave. The
five earned runs charged to Smoltz were the most he has given up in
eight starts. He had yielded five runs in his last four games
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who had homered in the seventh for a short-lived Braves
lead, spoiled a second chance to play hero when he came up with the
bases loaded in the eighth. But Julian Tavarez induced a fielder's
choice to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker put the Braves ahead 5-4 when he led off the seventh with
his 12th homer of the year, tucking the ball just inside the
right-field foul pole. Tucker had not homered since June 27 but the
Giants could hardly be surprised. Five of his 12 home runs have
come against San Francisco pitching and his career average versus
the Giants was .647 entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz got into trouble in the third after retiring the first
two men he faced. He allowed a single to Stan Javier, then walked
Ellis Burks, who opened the night with a career .400 average
against Smoltz. That brought up Bonds, who drove the first pitch
far over the right-field fence for his 23rd of the year to tie it
4-4.
</P>
<P>
   This was Bonds' first multi-homer game of the season but the
32nd of his career. The two homers gave him 397 in his career,
leaving Bonds three short of becoming baseball's first 400-400
player (home runs-stolen bases). He already has 417 steals.
