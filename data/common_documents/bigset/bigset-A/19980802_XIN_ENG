<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Bank Concerns Over IMF Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A local bank has warned that if
Zimbabwe fails to achieve International Monetary Fund (IMF)
targets set as conditions for releasing further financial aid, it
could have disastrous consequences on the country's balance of
payments.
</P>
<P>
In its quarterly economic review released Saturday, Financial
Holdings (Finhold) said that Zimbabwe needs to show some
commitment to sound macro-economic policies necessary to maintain
the relationship with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"Not only will this ensure foreign currency inflows from the
IMF but it will also encourage other donors to disburse funds
needed to support the Zimbabwean program for economic and social
transformation," Finhold said in its report.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, a major backer of Zimbabwe's economic reform, in June
agreed to a conditional release of a 176-million-U.S.-Dollar
stand-by credit facility.
</P>
<P>
Targets the IMF set for Zimbabwe include the reduction of the
budget deficit to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product,
inflation down to 18.6 percent by the end of this year, and
maintaining gross official reserves equivalent to 1.5 months of
import cover.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF is concerned about the authorities'
commitment to the set targets and will be sending a team of
officials this month to hold talks with the Zimbabwean
government.
</P>
<P>
"In recent months, however, there are signs showing that such
commitment may be waning," Finhold said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urged to Abide by European Court Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides Saturday urged Turkey to abide by a verdict of
European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to pay compensation to a
Greek Cypriot woman.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Kasoulides said "the decision
reached by the Council of Europe over cases concerning Cyprus
shows clearly that Turkey is responsible for what goes on in the
part of Cyprus it occupies."
</P>
<P>
The ECHR in its verdict last Thursday ordered Turkey to pay
300,000 Cyprus pounds (about 600,000 U.S. dollars) to Titina
Loizidou for the continued violation of her right to use her
property.
</P>
<P>
Loizidou, a Greek Cypriot refugee who fled Kyrenia in 1974
when Turkey landed troops there, began the legal battle in 1989
over her right to the properties in Turkish Cypriot-controlled
northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was only recognized
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey has rejected the ECHR ruling, saying that the
judgement "lacked the means of applicability and implementation."
</P>
<P>
The decision "proves that...Turkey is responsible for such
(human rights) violations," Kasoulides added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey should abide by the decision of the
ECHR, "otherwise it will have to face the consequences which begin
with sanctions and finish with expulsion from the Council of
Europe."
</P>
<P>
"What is important is to overturn the results of Turkish
invasion and occupation and we will continue working through
diplomatic means to achieve this end," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Plans to Reduce Maternal Mortality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will launch a
national reproductive health program before the end of the year
to reduce the country's high maternal mortality, a senior health
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of Family and Child Department Lomami Shodu
made the remarks at the close of a five-day workshop
on reproductive health in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest
city.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 health managers from the country's eight provinces
attended the workshop, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was aimed at finding strategies of reducing
maternal mortality, which is currently pegged at 570 deaths per
100,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
Maternal mortality is the death of mothers or their babies
between pregnancy and the 42nd day after birth.
</P>
<P>
Shodu said that the major cause of maternal deaths has been
HIV/AIDS, although other diseases like pregnancy-induced
hypertension are also responsible.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, health officials will conduct constant
monitoring programs to the newly born up to a year.
</P>
<P>
"Through this program, we expect to reduce maternal mortality
by half," Shodu said.

<HEADLINE> Direct Talks With Israel May End Soon: Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Palestinian official
said Saturday that Israeli-Palestinian direct talks would end in
days unless Israel accepts a U.S. peace proposal on further
Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, Palestinian Planning
and International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath told reporters
in Gaza that the just-resumed direct talks would be over in two,
three or four days, unless Israel accepts the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Shaath made the remarks on his return to Gaza from his six-day
trip, with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat,
to Austria, Morocco and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Shaath stressed that Israel looks unlikely to accept the
proposal, which calls on the Jewish country to withdraw its
troops from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In separate remarks, Arafat confirmed that everything is still
frozen in Israeli-Palestinian peace process despite direct talks
between the two sides during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the next step would be, Arafat said everyone would
have to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for over
16 months since Israel started to construct a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Through the mediation of the United States, the two sides
restarted direct talks in mid-July but met great difficulties to
bridge the gap over the troop redeployment issue.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko Suggests Creating Chechen Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko during the talks with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
held in Nazran on Saturday suggested making Chechnya a special
economic zone, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister was quoted as saying that he suggested
trying "to work out a certain procedure" that could help to make
Chechnya "a free or special economic zone."
</P>
<P>
He said that "It is senseless to create the impression that the
situation in Chechnya usual". He explained that special customs
and other regulations could be invoked in the republic. But coping
with this task "will require much painstaking work."
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Premier, attention of the talks was
focused on two sets of problems: peace and stability guarantees in
Chechnya and entire North Caucasus and solutions to social and
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko emphasized that the main task in relations between
the federal center and Chechnya at the current stage is "to start
implementing concrete agreements rather than sign new documents."
</P>
<P>
One of the major tasks today is "to counter any forms of
terrorism and extremism, political or religious," the premier
noted.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Kiriyenko and Maskhadov discussed concrete
programs, including those on an oil pipeline, an oil refinery, a
cement plant, and a flour-grinding plant, and social programs.
</P>
<P>
No document was signed at the end of the talks, the report
cited the premier as saying.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting both sides expressed satisfaction with their
talks. Kiriyenko told reporters before flying to Moscow that he
was "pleased with the outcome of the meeting" with the Chechen
President.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov was also "pleased" with the talks. He hoped that
relations with Moscow will develop under the new Russian
government led by Sergei Kiriyenko, and both sides will see
practical steps toward implementing the achieved understandings.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. observers still need to
continue their monitoring work in the Iraq-Kuwait region for the
foreseeable future, the mission chief has said.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission
(UNIKOM) Esa Tarvainen said "it is very difficult to predict what
is going to happen in the future in connection with the duration
of UNIKOM in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Finish commander was quoted by official Kuwait news agency
Kuna as making the remarks on the eighth anniversary of the 1990
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Tarvainen took the present post in last November. The mandate
of UNIKOM, as stipulated by the U.N. Resolution 687, is to monitor
the demilitarized zone and the Khawr Abdallah waterway between
Iraq and Kuwait and to deter boundary violations.
</P>
<P>
The mission comprises military observers from 32 countries.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that in the foreseeable future, UNIKOM will stay
here but we all hope that one day UNIKOM will finally complete its
work and leave the area peacefully," Tarvainen said.

<HEADLINE> German Language Reform Goes into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Schools across Germany, Austria and
Switzerland started to switch to a set of new spelling rules of
the German language after a controversial language reform went
into effect on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The German language reform, which is the first comprehensive
one since 1901, was agreed to in July 1996 by cultural ministers
of the three German-speaking countries and was meant to make the
written German more logical and easier for school children to
learn.
</P>
<P>
The changes include shortening lengthy compound nouns,
introducing more consistent spellings to avoid numerous exceptions
and cutting the number of the correct-writing rules from 212 to
112.
</P>
<P>
However, during a transitional period until 2005, the new and
old ways of writing will be deemed equally permissible. Those who
refuse to change to the new rules, mainly older people, will be
viewed as writing "traditionally".
</P>
<P>
The language reform has aroused much controversies in Germany
over the past few years with many academics, authors and parents,
who like the old way of writing, having launched a number of legal
challenges to try to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Legal hurdles for the reform were only cleared last month after
Germany's highest court, the Constitutional Court, turned down a
complaint by a German couple who claimed that their basic parental
rights to guide their children's education were violated by the
introduction of the new language rules.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting arguments that the reform would create confusions,
the court said that the new rules would only affect about 0.5
percent of German vocabulary and therefore would not make German
less comprehensible.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Hopes Occupied South to Be Liberated Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri on Saturday expressed hope that the Israeli-occupied south
Lebanon would be liberated next year.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remark in a written speech released by the
state-run National News Agency for the 53rd anniversary of
Lebanese army's foundation which falls on August 1.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the next year be the year of liberation of south
Lebanon and western Bekaa from Israeli occupation," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister didn't elaborate the way the occupied
south will be liberated from the hands of the most powerful forces
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon and western Bekaa in 1985 with a claimed aim
of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas cross-border
attack.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Israel offered to withdraw from the region
on condition of Beirut's security guarantee for its northern
borders.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria rejected the offer and demanded the
Israeli soldiers leave Lebanon without any preconditions as
stipulated in the 20-year-old United Nations Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Hariri also stressed the unity between Syrian and Lebanese
army in face of the same challenge in front of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Syria's Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East
war. Its negotiations with Damascus were suspended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, a main power broker in Lebanon, have
decided to solve their problems with Israel at the same time.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Safeguards Right to Boost Iran's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Saturday safeguarded his country's right to build up
its military power, saying Iran needs no one's permission to do so.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in the wake of some countries' reaction to
Iran's recent test of medium-range missile.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a visit to a military exhibition by the
Defense Ministry, Khatami said that a strong military force would
serve as a deterrent against enemies' aggression.
</P>
<P>
Khatami rejected allegations that foreigners had a role in
Iranian missile programs, saying that the success in test of the
Shahab-3 or Meteor-3 medium-range missile was despite of many
sanctions already on Iran.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that Iran relies on its own expertise to develop
its defenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
On July 22, Iran successfully tested its first missile with a
range of 1,300 kilometers, meaning that it could target Saudi
Arabia, an ally of the U.S. in Gulf, Israel and the U.S. forces in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Washington announced on Tuesday to impose sanctions on seven
Russian firms for transferring missile technology to Iran though
both Tehran and Moscow rejected the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also stated that Iran's military might is intended for
defending the country and Tehran cannot and does not have any
aggressive intentions against other countries "due to its divine,
Islamic and national values."
</P>
<P>
Iran's military strength by no means constitutes a threat to
security of other countries, he said, it rather contributes to the
security of the friendly countries as well as the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
However, he termed Israel as the biggest threat in the region
and the world, saying that armed with a stockpile of nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons, the Israeli regime is a major
threat to the region as well as others.
</P>
<P>
On weapons of mass destruction, Khatami said "I unequivocally
state that driven by our Islamic values and humanitarian
principles, we are against proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction."
</P>
<P>
"We shake the hands of all governments and the benevolent
forces in promotion of peace and in removing such weapons
from the entire world," he said.

<P>
TEHRAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday strongly
condemned Israel for its recent military strikes on southern
Lebanon, terming Tel Aviv as the main factor of instability and
insecurity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the Israeli
move would pose big dangers for Lebanon, other regional countries
and the global community.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted Mohammadi as saying that
Iran supports Lebanese resistance against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israel attacks on southern Lebanon over recent days is in line
with the entity's expansionist and aggressive policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fightings between Israeli and allied troops and Lebanese
guerrillas in southern Lebanon have been a common scene. But they
became frequent in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with an aim to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on the
Jewish country's northern areas. Guerrillas there have been
struggling ever since to drive Israelis out.

the northern part of the country have been defeated and urged to
surrender after fierce fighting has taken place there since
Monday, a report reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iraq Start Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The chambers of commerce of Jordan
and Iraq Saturday started talks to discuss the details of a trade
agreement reached by the two countries in the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, President of the Jordanian Chamber
of Commerce (JCC) Hayder Murad said the talks "will open new
horizons of cooperation and trade exchange between Jordan and Iraq
and contribute to meeting Iraq's needs of goods and commodities."
</P>
<P>
In the framework of the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal, Jordan
and Iraq reached a 255 million-U.S. dollar trade agreement for
1998 on February 15, which features the highest level of Jordanian
exports to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Jordan will export 185 million dollars of
Jordanian-made products and 70 million dollars of services to Iraq
during this year.
</P>
<P>
In specific terms, the talks will also include the increase of
exchange between the two sides with a view to serve the trade
sectors of the two countries, the possibility of joint investment
and the coordination of both sides' stands in future Arab and
international meetings, said the president.
</P>
<P>
The current talks come within the framework of Jordan's support
of the Arab and international efforts to help lift the
eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegation taking part in the talks arrived here
Friday. It is headed by President of the Iraqi Chamber of
Commerce Zuhai Abdul Ghafour.
</P>
<P>
The chambers of commerce in Jordan and Iraq are
government-owned organizations devoted to serving commercial
affairs at a level below the ministerial one.
</P>
<P>
Iraq remains a main market for Jordanian industries, many of
which mushroomed during Iraq's 1980-1988 war with Iran to cater
solely for the Iraqi market. They find it difficult to sell their
goods to other markets.
</P>
<P>
Trade activity with Iraq has been banned by the U.N. since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Instead, the world body reached
an oil-for-food agreement with Iraq in 1996, allowing the country
to sell a limited amount of oil in every six months in exchange
for daily necessities such as food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been Jordan's sole oil provider for years. About 4.8
million tonnes of oil and oil products will be supplied by Iraq
to Jordan below the international price in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Ensure Oil Supplies for Kurdish Autonomous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi central government will
strive to ensure oil supplies for the country's three northern
Kurdish autonomous governorates at official prices, a source in
the Oil Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the source, whose name was not
given in customary practice, as saying Arbil governorate can get
4.5 million liters of gasoline and 2.3 million liters of machine
oil and kerosene every month.
</P>
<P>
Duhok governorate can get 2 million liters of gasoline and the
same amount of machine oil and kerosene, while Sulaimaniya
governorate can get 6 million liters of gasoline and 4.2 million
liters of machine oil and 3.5 million liters of kerosene, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
The priority in supplying the kerosene and machine oil will be
given to those outlying districts in the three governorates to
alleviate the suffering of the Kurdish people, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, the United States, Britain
and France have enforced no-fly zone in the three Kurdish
autonomous governorates, and the Iraqi central government has lost
control to a certain degree in these regions.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Israel Presents No New Ideas to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Saturday he was briefed by the Palestinians that the
Israelis have not presented any new proposals during the recent
face-to-face Palestinian-Israeli meetings.
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious to the Palestinians that the Israelis seek to
waste time and the results of the meetings were actually zero,"
Moussa said following his meeting with Palestinian chief
negotiator Saeb Erekat and his accompanying delegation who arrived
here earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that the Palestinians are "very
pessimistic and very desperate" because of behavior of the Israeli
negotiators with whom they had direct encounter last week, the
first in months.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was told by the Palestinians that the Israelis
even denied the presence of a U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative, which calls for a further 13.1 percent
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in return for Palestinian
security guarantee, has been accepted by the Palestinians. But
because of Israel's opposition, the U.S. has not made it public.
</P>
<P>
Moussa denied that there is any contradiction between the
American initiative and the Egyptian-French initiative which calls
for holding an international conference to rescue the Arab-Israeli
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
"The American initiative deals with the issue of the second
redeployment and is supposed to deal also with the third stage of
redeployment, while the Egyptian-French initiative deals with the
whole peace process which reached a deadlock," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
According to the report presented by the Palestinian
delegation, there is no positive aspect by Israel except ignoring
the American initiative and insisting on additional terms, Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation will be examined in light of this picture
which is termed as "very bad, regrettable and negative."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, holding an Arab summit or an international
conference are both available so as to save the peace process.

<HEADLINE> No More ECOMOG Troops Expected in Liberia: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government
doesn't expect more troops for the west African peace monitoring
force ECOMOG in view of the current level of peace and stability
in the country, said Liberian Defense Minister Daniel Chea.
</P>
<P>
"Government does not expect additional troops for ECOMOG at
this time because there are little jobs for them in Liberia,"
Chea told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
The liberian minister made the remarks in resopnse to
an earlier announcement by the outgoing ECOMOG Chief of Staff,
Abdul-One Mohammed that some 200 Guinean troops are returning
to Liberia, said a report reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chea said that his government was planning to cut down the
number of security forces in the streets, including ECOMOG
soldiers jointly manning checkpoints with police in the capital
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"This is to remove the fears that peaceful citizens harbor
against the security men," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government made no request for additional troops
for ECOMOG, Chea said, adding that his government is not aware of
the so-called ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States)
decision announced by General Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Guinea was among several west African countries that
contributed troops to the Nigerian-led ECOMOG but withdrew its
soldiers in March after the force's mandate officially expired in
February.
</P>
<P>
The official mandate of ECOMOG sent by ECOWAS in 1990 to stop
the factional fighting and mayhem and restore peace and democracy
to Liberia, expired on February 2, six months after the
inauguration of an elected president.

CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Saturday denied again that it
has developed medium and long-range Scud missiles, but pointing an
accusing finger at Israel's nuclear arsenal as a threat to
regional security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with a Palestinian
delegation, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa waved away the
U.S. concern over Egypt's reported possession of medium and
long-range Scud missiles.
</P>
<P>
Moussa added that Egypt will hold to its stance on removing all
weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The process of controlling armament in the Middle East will
not be fully maintained unless Israel becomes part of it and
adheres to the commitments binding other countries. Otherwise, the
situation will be unbalanced and unacceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to make peace with Israel,
which is believed to be the only nuclear power in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's remarks came two days after Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak refuted media reports that the country is developing Scud
missiles.
</P>

Mubarak said the range of the Egyptian Scud missiles is only
300 kilometers and Egypt is merely maintaining them.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Warns Imminent Chances of Conflict with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan Sunday warned that there were imminent chances of
conflict between Pakistan and India yet any adventure of India to
threaten Pakistan's security would be foiled with full force.
</P>
<P>
Gohar was talking to reporters at the airport of Lahore,
capital of Pakistan's Punjab province, on his return from Sri
Lanka after attending the 10th summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was unfortunate that despite the passage of 50
years, the Kashmir issue had remained unsettled, according to the
official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
"There were imminent chances of conflict between Pakistan and
India but any adventure on the part of the enemy to violate
Pakistan's solidarity and integrity would be countered with full
force," Gohar said.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the possibility of rolling back the nuclear
program, the foreign minister said, "All failed to prevent us from
going nuclear, how we could be persuaded to roll back our nuclear
program."
</P>
<P>
Gohar's remarks came at a time when the situation along the
Line of Control in the disputed Kashmir has become increasingly
tense.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, both Pakistan and India have accused
each other of undertaking unprovoked cross-border firing. The
Pakistani government announced Sunday evening that so far 56
civilians were killed by Indian firing in the Pakistan-controlled
Azad Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Leads in World Superbike Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Texan Colin Edwards raced over
Honda teammate Aaron Slight to make a winning start to the ninth
round of the World Superbike championship in Brands Hatch, England
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Edwards was timed 36 minutes 16.391 seconds, finishing the
first of the two races just 0.103 of a second ahead of the New
Zealander.
</P>
<P>
Scott Russell of the United States was third on a Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
Slight, who had injured his right knee in a heavy crash at the
last round in Laguna Seca, was the biggest beneficiary of the
first race after Australian pole-setter and championship leader
Troy Corser finished seventh for Ducati.
</P>
<P>
Corser had led from the start but Edwards went past on lap five
and the Australian fell back steadily.
</P>
<P>
But Corser still led the championship with 250.5 points, ahead
of Slight who closed in with 234 in second place.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy. I had Aaron to worry about all the time. The
whole race was flat out," said Edwards whose two other race wins
this season came at Monza in Italy in May.
</P>
<P>
"As Scott said to me on the victory lap, if you want to win
one, this is the place to do it. This is a win I'll remember
forever. Its the biggest crowd, its awesome."
</P>
<P>
Despite Slight being ahead of Edwards in the standings going
into the race there was no suggestion of team orders.
</P>
<P>
Third place was Russell's best finish of the season. He came
from 15th on the grid to eighth at the start and then carved his
way up to third between laps nine and 12.

</P>
<P>
July 8 - A masseur for the Festina team, Willy Voet, is stopped

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nanjing Military Area Command
for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has issued emergency orders
instructing all officers and soldiers to fight to the death to
protect Yangtze River dykes, major cities along the river and the
well-being and property of local people.
</P>
<P>
The command headquarters had sent 13,000 men, 702 motor
vehicles and 234 boats to flood ravaged areas from July 27 to 29,
in addition to mobilizing 260,000 militiamen and reserve officers
to assist with flood control efforts in Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Well over 800,000 PLA soldiers, militiamen and reserve forces
have joined local residents in the flood control effort in central
China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 soliders rushed to reinforce a section of the western
levee surrounding Dongting Lake last week and proceeded to work
tirelessly for five consecutive days and nights.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain caused a cave-in along the Zhongzhou Levee in Yueyang
County on July 29. The Hunan Military Area Command and armed
police immediately dispatched over 500 people to reinforce river
levees, with the decisive action saving the lives and property of
100,000 county residents.
</P>
<P>

<P>
FUZHOU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists recently
discovered an ancient spring well dating back to the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) in Quanzhou, a historic city in east China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
The well was discovered during the reconstruction of a local
house.
</P>
<P>
Tests proved the potability of well water and archeologists
noted that the water was once used for weaving, bleaching and
dyeing.
</P>
<P>
Quanzhou was the eastern terminus of the "marine silk road," an
ancient maritime trade exchange channel linking the east and west.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also found a mulberry tree estimated to be 1,000
years old and an rare ancient stone shaped like a parrot.

<HEADLINE> Increased Investment to Promote Economy, Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
announced at the end of last month that the central government
will introduce positive measures to increase investments in
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of related measures will be the most effective
method for stimulating domestic demand and promoting the economy,
according to Zhu, who made the comments during visits to the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shanxi Province between July 27-31.
</P>
<P>
China's economy grew by some seven percent in the first half of
this year, or slightly under the government's eight percent
economic growth target for the year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed to China's success in economic development, but
noted that arduous efforts will be required to reach this year's
target. "We must fully consider the negative impacts of the Asian
financial crisis on our economy," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
New investment will be earmarked for the construction of
highways, railways, telecommunications networks, irrigation and
water conservancy facilities, ecological projects, urban
infrastructure, environmental protection, rural electric networks
and housing, said Zhu, adding that even more powerful measures
must be taken to further promote the reform of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said the nation will provide basic guarantees to ensure
the well-being of laid-off workers and help them find new jobs at
the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the process of reaching the economic goal will
require the country to strictly limit increases in stockpiles and
eliminate the construction of redundant projects.
</P>
<P>
Major problems facing China's state-owned enterprises include
redundant, surplus workers and excessive government interference in
business operations, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The premier called for the creation of more job opportunities
laid-off workers and noted that related individuals should alter
conventional concepts concerning employment. Zhu also issued
instructions related to reforts of the grain distribution system
and the management of coal mines.

<HEADLINE> Plan to Revise Marriage Law Stirs Fierce Debate in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But Li Yinhe, a renowned Chinese sociologist studying marriage
and family issues at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said
she is worried that "such an alteration would impede upon the
hard-earned freedom of divorce that the Chinese citizens have now."
</P>
<P>
"We must be cautious of retrogress when revising the marriage
law," she warned.
</P>
<P>
She said that mutual love should be taken as the ideal
foundation of marriage, and it is natural that marriage should
end when love expires.
</P>
<P>
A women's rights defender Xu Weihua, who was also one of the
drafters of the proposed code and official of the All-China
Women's Federation, does not agree with Li on the term of
"retrogress."
</P>
<P>
"Divorce is too easy under the existing marriage law, and
women's rights have not been protected because many became single
mothers and poor," she said. Tighter restrictions on divorce
would make couples well aware of consequences, which would be
conducive to the family stability and unity of the society, she
added.
</P>
<P>
"A piece of legislation should be judged on its function of
protecting the legitimate rights and interests of citizens,
instead of simply by the abstract terms of 'progress'
or 'retrogress'," the women's rights defender contended.
</P>
<P>
But most of the young generation of legal experts said they
do not want to include the phrase of "mutual faithfulness" in the
law.
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers in south China have published a series of
articles to criticize the proposed code of marriage and family.
Young people interviewed have different opinions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists hold that this debate shows that the young
generation of Chinese people are more liberal and open in their
views on marriage, family and sex.
</P>
<P>
The draft revised law needs approval by a plenary session of
the National People's Congress before it goes into force.

<HEADLINE> Plan to Revise Marriage Law Stirs Fierce Debate in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) - A plan to revise China's
18-year-old Marriage Law that will place restrictions on divorce
and prohibit extramarital affairs is now being fiercely debated
among people from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Those in favor of the new law say it will help maintain the
stability of families and society as a whole, while those opposed
argue that it would mean social retrogression if the new bill is
adopted.
</P>
<P>
The new code on marriage and the family defines living
separately for three years as a condition for divorce, and
stipulates that married couples must be faithful to each other,
and that if one partner has an affair, the other partner must be
compensated if there is a divorce.
</P>
<P>
The revision plan, devised by a group of legal experts
designated by the Civil Affairs Ministry, has been partially
revealed by the media and instantly caught the attention of the
public.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say that such a revision would mean that the
increasing number of Chinese who attempt to find happiness
outside marriage would be challenged by the law.
</P>
<P>
In response to opposition opinions, Wu Changzhen, a female
professor of law at the China University of Political Sciences and
Law and one of the authors of the proposed code, said that
including "mutual faithfulness" as one of the duties for married
couples is intended to make extramarital sexual relations
illegal. "This is in line with the principle of monogamy," she
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing Chinese Marriage Law, a marriage may
be terminated when "mutual affection is ended." Legal experts say
it is difficult for a court to decide whether an unfathomable
"mutual affection" is there or not. That is why the proposed
revision made several specific additions for evaluating broken
marriage relations, such as separation for three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Water levels along the Yangtze
River and at Poyang Lake near Jiujiang posted new records today
although the third flood crest has moved downstream.
</P>
<P>
The Jiujiang Hydrological Station reported that the water level
hit 23.03 meters by zero hour, surpassing the previous record
level by 0.83 meters.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Poyang Lake climbed to a record 22.55
meters by 04:00 (Beijing time) today, surpassing the old
mark by some 0.75 meters. Forecasts call for continuing rain in
the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, with water
levels expected to rise even further and remain far above normal
for a relatively long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Flood control efforts in Jiangxi Province, which has witnessed
some of the heaviest flooding, had consumed 7.5 million straw
bags, 2.7 million gunnysacks, 16 million plastic sandbags, 14,000
cu.m. of timber and 435,000 bamboo poles costing over 176 million
yuan by July 30, according to a local flood control official. Over
1.5 million soldiers and local residents are working on river
levees around the clock.
</P>
<P>
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has
sent emergency relief materials, including plastic sandbags and
life preservers, to Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government recently issued an emergency circular
urging all flood control departments to place priority on
protecting Yangtze River and Poyang Lake levees, the city of
Jiujiang, the Beijing-Kowloon Railway line and major reservoirs.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leaders Accuse Ethiopia of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The main political leaders
in the Somali capital Sunday piled blames on Ethiopia
for interfering in the internal affairs of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed has
accused Ethiopia for trying to create leaders for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The accusation came after the Ethiopian government invited
Hussein Haji Bod, the new political rival of Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
and other politicians throughout the nation to Addis Ababa for a
political meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, those invited by the Addis
Ababa authority include Mohamed Saeed Hirsi Morgan of Kismaio
town, and politicians from the central and northeastern regions
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in his office in north Mogadishu Sunday,
Ali Mahdi also accused Ethiopia for being responsible for the
continued delays in the course of the formation of an
all-inclusive administration for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, leader of the south
Mogadishu faction, also accused Ethiopia for being responsible
for the secession of the northwestern regions known as the
breakaway Republic of Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
Aidid blamed Ethiopia for masterminding the
disputed local government recently announced by the northeastern
regions led by Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, Ethiopia invited 26 factions and split groups
who formed what is called a National Salvation Council (NSC)
co-chaired by five politicians including Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Osman
Ali Atto and Colonel Abdullahi Yussuf.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts believed Ethiopia is trying to collect back
what is remained of the NSC and other politicians to formulate
another strong alliance to combat the Cairo peace deal
sympathizers including main faction leaders Ali Mahdi, Hussein
Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto.

<HEADLINE> New Daily Appears in Iran to Replace Banned Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's moderates on Sunday
published a new daily Aftab Emrouz (Sun of Today) to replace the
just banned daily Tous and its predecessor Jameah (Society),
vowing to continue its pro-liberal campaign against the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Publisher of the daily, Jameah Rouz (Society of the Day),
issued a statement that it decided to publish Aftab Emrouz
following the failure of efforts by the Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance to reverse the ban on Tous, named after an
ancient Iranian city.
</P>
<P>
The publication of Aftab Emrouz showed the determination of
the moderates to uphold freedom of expression advocated by
President Mohammad Khatami and not to give up to the powerful
conservatives who dominate the legislative and judiciary bodies.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted the statement as saying
that the first issue of Aftab Emrouz had eight pages and was
printed in black and white, and as of Monday, the newspaper would
be printed in 12 pages and in color.
</P>
<P>
A branch of Tehran Justice Department on Saturday issued an
"effective immediately" ban on the pro-moderate daily Tous, which
started its publication on July 25 to replace the banned Jamaeh by
absorbing its staff.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came one day after the judiciary head Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi lashed out at the Minister of Culture and Islamic
Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani for giving green light to the daily's
publication.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance on Saturday
demanded the judiciary to revoke its ban order on Tous, arguing
that the points adduced against the publisher of the daily by the
court had already been fully explained to him and he had been
committed to observe those criteria in the future.
</P>
<P>
A group of hard-liners on Saturday attacked the office of
Tous, beating up its editor-in-chief Mashallah Shamsolwaezin, and
even threatening to kill him, the pro-government newspaper Iran
Daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The group accused Tous of using Jameah's staff and continuing
its path by publishing the similar contents with the same layout
and typography of the banned daily Jamaeh "only with a change of
name."
</P>
<P>
However, Mohajerani argued that the country's current press
laws did not ban the staff of a banned daily from transferring to
another daily.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Arms Inspector Arrives in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief arms inspector Richard
Butler arrived here on Sunday afternoon on a working visit for
talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on arms
inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, known as UNSCOM,
will present his bi-annual report on the development of weapons
inspection in Iraq to the U.N. Security Council in October.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will decide, based on his report, on
whether to continue sanctions against Iraq. The sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Butler's visit came amid sharp criticism from the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership issued a statement on Thursday after the
Security Council failed to agree upon a Russian proposal that
Iraq's nuclear file be closed and transferred to long-term
monitoring phase.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Iraq criticized UNSCOM and Butler for
working for the benefit of the U.S. scheme by deliberately
prolonging its tasks, and eventually keeping the embargo in place.
</P>
<P>
"The Special Commission is fully aware that all the
requirements of disarmament were fully fulfilled several years
ago. The weapons, hundreds of factories, apparatuses and equipment
have been destroyed," says the statement.
</P>
<P>
It says the forthcoming meeting between Aziz and Butler will be
a central indication of what will happen in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The statement warns that Butler will continue his well known
methods of "manoeuvring, misleading, arousing marginal issues and
prolonging its work indefinitely for the benefit of American
criminal scheme."

<HEADLINE> Expedition Challenges Yarlung Zangbo River Gorge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHSA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A team of 30 Chinese scientists and
adventurers is bound for the source of Tibet's Yarlung Zangbo
River, according to sources from the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Yarlung Zangbo River Gorge, which stretches 496 km and have a
average depth of 5,000 meters, presents a major challenge for any
adventurers. Several Chinese and foreign teams have failed in
attempts to negotiate the gorge, with a number of adventurers
killed in the process.
</P>
<P>
The current team, funded by the regional government, will spend
the next few months studying the environment, resources, ecology,
reasons for disasters and tourism resources along the Yarlung
Zangbo Gorge, the longest, deepest and perhaps most dangerous
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Team leader Yang Yong noted the lack of adequate information
concerning dangerous sections of the river prompted team members
to conduct an air survey using hot air balloons prior to
challenging the river by boat.
</P>
<P>
The air survey will provide valuable scientific data concerning
both the local geography and geological conditions. Yang also
explained that the hot air balloons can be used for rescue
operations in the sparsely populated remote region.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a well-known environmentalist, was a member of an
ill-fated Yangtze River expedition some 12 years ago. The float
trip ended tragically with the deaths of 11 people.
</P>
<P>
Float trips along China's major rivers have gained increasing
popularity amongst people wanting to test their courage. Yang's
team was selected from hundreds of volunteers from a cross the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The Yarlung Zangbo River, which finds its source on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, flows at the highest elevation of any river
in the world and features surging rapids and dangerous shoals.

<P>
PARIS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- One of the two former British
intelligence agents arrested last weekend by French intelligence
agency in Paris has been released, while the other will face
charge in a court on Sunday, said French judicial sources.
</P>
<P>
Richard Tomlinson, 35, who was a former agent of the M16 now
called Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), was arrested by the
French anti-espionage service, the DST, in a Parisian hotel
Friday afternoon at the request of the British authorities.
</P>
<P>
After the French authorities said that all the evidence
collected during Tomslinson's detention did not prove the
unspecified suspicion hanging over him, their British counterparts
said that it was not necessary to hold him any more.
</P>
<P>
However, David Shayler, 32, will be brought to the Palace of
Justice of Paris to face formal charges against him by a French
public prosecutor on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shayler, a former agent of the British counter-intelligence
service MI5, who was arrested Saturday afternoon in another hotel
in Paris by the DST, will face extradition for violation of the
British intelligence code Official Secret Act, said both French
and British judicial sources.
</P>

In london, a spokeswoman for the British Home Office said that
Shayler's "extradition will be sought to stand trial in the UK for
offences against the Official Secrets Act," Agence France-Presse
(AFP) reported.

ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif reiterated Sunday that his country is capable of defending
its geographical frontiers and Pakistan will make no defense pact
with any super power to safeguard its national security, according
to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be indebted to others to ensure our security
and stability. Today we are strong enough to defend our
frontiers," Sharif told a crowded press conference at the Lahore
airport upon his return from Colombo after attending the 10th
summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation

</P>
<P>
He said that India should realize its responsibilities in
restoring peace in the region and any unrest in the region would
not be in the interest of both India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"India should avoid irresponsible attitude at the Line of
Control and airspace violations of Pakistan," he said, referring
to the recent flare-up between Pakistani and Indian forces in the
disputed Kashmir.

Responding to a question whether he planned to convene a
meeting of the foreign ministers of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference to seek financial support for Pakistan, the
prime minister said, "We have decided to go ahead without any

DHAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation in the central
part of Bangladesh and around the capital city of Dhaka is likely
to improve, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, FFWC officials cautioned that flood situation in the
northern districts might deteriorate due to anticipated rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation in the Brahmaputra and Ganges basins might
remain unchanged during the next 24 hours, while that in the upper
part of the Meghna basin would continue to improve following
recession in the water levels of the rivers, FFWC officials were
quoted by the national BSS news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Monsoon is fairly active over Bangladesh, they said, urging the
departments concerned and the people not to relax their vigilance.
</P>
<P>
Since early July, this South Asian country has been seriously
hit by flood due to heavy rainfall in many places.
</P>
<P>
By Saturday, 37 districts out of the total of 64 had been
affected by flood, with over 17.5 million people being hit and
flood-related death toll rising to 253.
</P>
<P>
Besides, more than 5,000 kilometers of roads, 1,722 kilometers
of embankment and 2,215 bridges and culverts had been damaged and
about 200,000 hectares of crops washed away by the flood.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided not to seek financial aid from
abroad to provide relief and succor to the victims of the current
flood.
</P>
<P>
The departments concerned have already distributed over 11
million taka (234,000 U.S. dollars) and nearly 3,000 tons of grain
as well as large quantities of other relief materials among the
flood victims. They have also sent several thousand medical teams
to the flood-hit areas to treat patients with flood-related

controversial executive order on federalism President Bill Clinton

</P>
<P>
-- At a time when legislation is crashing to a halt all over
Capitol Hill, the standout survivor is an issue -- campaign
finance reform -- that has been pronounced dead so many times that
its boosters have lost count. Next week it will likely come to a
vote on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
-- Many of the world's largest corporations have yanked
hundreds of workers off their regular jobs, hired legions of
technical consultants and earmarked many million od dollars for
new electronic equipment. Known in geek-speak as "Y2K," the glitch
has become the top management concern at many organizations,
dominating boardroom discussions and forcing the postponement or
cancellation of other business projects.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In California politics, this lazy summer season is
traditionally the lull before the autumn storm, but the two major
party candidates for governors began trading thunderbolts on
Friday night in San Diego in the first of five promised debates.
</P>

-- The race for the leadership of the teamsters union is a

One 21-year-old Israeli soldier was killed and five others
wounded last Thursday in an ambush by the Hezbollah (Party of God)
guerillas in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The latest death brought to seven the death toll of Israeli
soldiers who have been killed in south Lebanon since the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied the 1200-square-kilometer border zone in
south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
However, an annual average of 35 Israeli soldiers have been
killed in the zone in fightings with Lebanese guerrillas in the
past years. This has fueled a heated domestic debate and a strong
call for a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The current Israeli government officially approved the United
Nations Resolution 425 on April 1, 20 years after it was
adopted. It agreed to pullback its troops provided that the
Lebanese government negotiates a security arrangement with Israel
on preventing cross-border attacks against its north.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon and its closes ally Syria have rejected the
Israeli proposal, citing that the U.N. resolution calls for
"immediate and unconditional withdrawal."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vaccinates Kids Against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has urged parents to send their children under five for polio
vaccination.
</P>
<P>
The two-day national immunization campaign against polio, a
disease often resulting in physical disablement, is expected to
end Sunday. Children under five years of age are required to
take doses of polio vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to inaugurate the campaign in Dar es
Salaam Saturday, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said polio
vaccination is very essential to children's health.
</P>
<P>
Kids under five are vulnerable to the virus which is
communicable.
</P>
<P>
He called for coordinated efforts on the part of parents in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who helped vaccinate a toddler at Mbagala
in the city, said the government strives to eradicate polio by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The target of the 1998 immunization campaign is to vaccinate
6.2 million children below the age of five years. Another
similar national campaign is to take place on September 12-13
this year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Name New National Soccer Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African Football
Association (SAFA) will name the new national coach within a month,
according to the local reports Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The post would be advertised next week along with the national
under-17 job, SAFA chief executive Danny Jordaan was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the new coach will end weeks of speculation
about who will succeed Frenchman Philippe Troussier, who vacated
the post after coaching the national team at the France '98 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said SAFA had already received applications from
individuals both at home and abroad, but he declined to disclose
their names.
</P>
<P>
He said the nation's football ruling body would cast its net
"as wide as possible" to get applications for the new coach.
</P>
<P>
The SAFA national executive appeared to be divided on employing
a local or foreign coach to replace Troussier, a Sunday paper
reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very sensitive issue that was under debate long
before Troussier left,...Some of us are of the opinion that South
Africa is too complex a country for foreigners to understand," the
paper quoted a senior SAFA executive as saying.
</P>
<P>
During Troussier's three-month reign, the coach drew severe fire
from players and soccer supporters for his handling of the squad
and eventually the team's dismal performance at the World Cup in
June.
</P>
<P>
However, there were reports that Jordaan had a personal desire
to lure Dutchman Ruud Gullit, former Chelsea coach, into the post.
</P>
<P>
Other possible foreign candidates are Yugoslav Bora Milutinovic,
the former Nigerian World Cup coach, and Brazilian World Cup winner
Carlos Alberto Parreira, who was fired by Saudi Arabia before this
year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
Local coaches who stand a real chance include national under-23
mentor "Shakes" Mashaba, and two South African premier league club
coaches, Gordon Igesund and Ted Dumitru.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Grants Help Jordan Balance 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign grants helped Jordan
balance the budget in 1997, the semi-official Jordan Times daily
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Jordan received 402 million U.S. dollars worth of
non-refundable grants from foreign countries, offsetting the
budget deficit, Fahed Fanek, economic advisor to the prime
minister's office, said in an editorial carried by the paper.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Jordan's budget deficit in
1997 stood at about 400 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most sizable grants were provided by Iraq in the form of a
50 percent rebate in oil prices, totaling 188 million dollars,
Fanek said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the United States granted Jordan 58 million dollars,
the European Union 46 million dollars, Japan 40 million dollars
and United Nations agencies 70 million dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign grants accounted for about 5.5 percent of Jordan's
gross domestic product in 1997, or 90 dollars per capita,
according to the economist.
</P>
<P>
The grants have guaranteed the inflow of hard currencies to
Jordan and increased its foreign currency reserves to 1.6 billion
dollars, Fanek said.
</P>
<P>
This has also helped foster people's confidence in the local
currency, Jordan dinar, and the economy in general, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Grants are crucial for a country like Jordan as long as it is
expected to service its inherited heavy debts and to finance an
intensive development plan to boost economic growth, generate more
jobs, and improve the standard of living of the population, or at
least prevent its deterioration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's foreign debts stood at 6.4 billion dollars at the end
of 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia Sunday claimed that they had captured the key opposition
base of Sheberghan, threatening the only Afghan major city out of
their control, said reports monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The defenses of troops loyal to warlord Rashid Dostum, one of
the strongmen in the anti-Taliban northern alliance, collapsed
following overnight fighting between the two sides, the reports
quoted a Taliban official as saying in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"Sheberghan has been totally captured after the enemy suffered
defeats yesterday," the official said, adding that the student
militia had also captured scores of heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, no independent confirmation of the claim was
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
The capture of Sheberghan, capital of Afghanistan's Jonzjan
province, threatens the anti-Taliban stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif,
around 100 km east of Sheberghan. Mazar-e-Sharif is the only
Afghan major city out of the Taliban's strict Islamic rule.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Post will introduce
three new souvenir items to tie in with the provision of new sales
outlets for postal souvenirs, the government department announced
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
These souvenir items are the new crystalline posting box, the
newly designed key rings and paperweights with different embedded
stamps including the 1997 10-HK-dollar definitive stamp, the
1.3-HK-dollar Year of the Tiger stamp and 1.3-HK-dollar Centenary
of Star Ferry stamp.
</P>
<P>
The sale of these new items and selected Postshop souvenirs
will be extended to all philatelic post offices from Monday to
provide better postal services, Acting Postmaster General Luk
Ping-chuen said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"This first pilot postshop was set up at General Post Office in
Central offering postal souvenirs which are elegant and valuable
for collection," Luk said.
</P>
<P>
"These postal souvenirs have been highly welcomed by the public.
Thus, Hongkong Post decided to extend the sale of these postal
souvenirs to all philatelic offices," he added.
</P>
<P>
The department is also introducing local and overseas mail
order services for the postal souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the massive revenue generated from philatelic
services and other postal services, Hongkong Post, which operates
on a self-financing basis, has earlier this year announced the
freezing of postal rates for the second successive year.

<HEADLINE>   Heavy Rains Leave 22 Dead in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Torrential downpours, which began
to sweep South Korea from Friday night, have made 22 people dead
and 71 missing and caused huge property damage across the country,
particularly in the southern part of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Disaster Prevention Countermeasures Headquarters
Sunday announced that as of Sunday afternoon, 22 people have been
confirmed dead and 71 others missing in Kyongsang and Cholla
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dead or missing were campers, who camped out by the
rivers and valleys of such areas as Mt. Chiri and Chinju, South
Kyongsang Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the heavy rainfalls have displaced 55 families and
damaged properties worth some 36.2 billion won (some 29 million
U.S. dollars) resulting from inundated farmland and destroyed
roads, bridges and buildings.
</P>
<P>
As rainfalls continued, the damage is likely to become greater,
said the headquarters office.
</P>
<P>
The downpour ranged from 49.7 mm to 267 mm throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit was Sunchon County, South Cholla Province,
which had 267mm of rainfall until 11 a.m. Sunday and 231.9mm and
221mm in Chinju and Sanchong counties, both in South Kyongsang
Province, respectively.
</P>
<P>
But weathermen forecast that 80 mm to 100 mm of more rain will
fall in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of other campers and mountain climbers are believed
still stranded in Mountain Chiri by downpours.
</P>
<P>
So far, the headquarters office has saved 1,345 lives by
mobilizing 1,579 rescue members, and 99 equipment and
vehicles. Thousands of military forces and civilians also took
part in the endeavor of rescue.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Exports Hit 13-Year Low in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's exports in July
tumbled 13.7 percent from a year ago to 10.2 billion U.S. dollars,
a new low since 1985, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and
Energy said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Exports stood at 10.2 billion U.S. dollars while imports
plunged 43.7 percent to 7.1 billion dollars, resulting in a
monthly surplus of 3.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The nation saw a trade surplus of 23.1 billion dollars in the
first seven months.
</P>
<P>
The July drop in exports was the biggest year-on-year decrease
since the nation experienced a 19.5 percent drop in January 1985.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Nationalized Commercial Banks Should </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bank Reform Committee (BRC) of
Bangladesh has recommended the closure of 1,300 branches of four
nationalized commercial banks (NCBs) and "forced retirement" of
excess 23,000 employees through "Golden Handshake".
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Observer daily Sunday quoted a recently-issued
BRC report as saying that it was impossible to make the NCBs
profitable without closure of the unprofitable branches and
reduction of the excess employees.
</P>
<P>
The four NCBs -- Sonali Bank, Janata Bank, Agrani Bank and
Rupali Bank -- have a total of 64,000 officials and employees
running over 3,600 branches at home and abroad, according to
Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sonali Bank, the country's largest commercial bank, has a staff
of more than 26,000 for over 1,300 branches, followed by Janata
Bank with 18,000 employees for 900 branches. And Agrani Bank has
14,000 employees for over 900 branches, while Rupali Bank has
6,200 employees for more than 500 branches.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the BRC suggested reducing the number of
branches and employees by at least 37 percent on the basis of
deposit per employee.
</P>
<P>
The deposit per employee in the NCBs was much lower than that
of the private banks, the BRC found.
</P>
<P>
The deposit per employee in the private sector banks is 7.8
million taka (166,000 U.S. dollars) while it is only five million
taka (106,000 dollars) in the commercial banks, the BRC report
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Considering the deposit ratio, the BRC recommended the closure
of 1,300 branches and reduction of 23,000 employees of the NCBs so
that the state-owned banks could run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the BRC also suggested the government constitute
separate task forces to unearth the irregularities in the NCBs,
identify the corrupt employees and take action against them.
</P>
<P>
Corruption in the NCBs was increasing and the banks could not
function properly without removing the irregularities, the BRC
report added.

ANKARA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has approved a bill on early parliamentary elections, the
Daily News reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Demirel signed the bill on Saturday for it to take effect, the
English-language newspaper quoted a statement issued by the

</P>
<P>
The Turkish Grand National Assembly (parliament) last Thursday
approved that the country's next general elections will be held on

Under Turkish laws, the current government will resign at the
end of this year to pave the way for a caretaker government

transitional period.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent coalition of the Motherland Party, Democratic
Left Party and Democratic Turkey Party was formed last summer to
succeed the former Welfare Party-led government which was forced
to resign under the pressure of the military for the alleged
attempt to undermine the country's secular systems.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Raises Cigarette Output Despite Anti-smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Defying a national anti-smoking
campaign, Egypt's tobacco giant the Eastern Tobacco Company has
decided to increase its production this year, the English-language
daily Egyptian Gazette reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the Eastern Tobacco Company will increase its
production to 60 billion cigarettes in 1998 from 54.8 billion
cigarettes last year.
</P>
<P>
That means it will produce an average of 164.4 million
cigarettes daily, or 2.74 cigarettes for every citizen.
</P>
<P>
To further boost its sale among domestic smokers who account
for one ninth of the whole population, the state-run company is
planning to launch new brands in the local market by the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
The company, which has a monopoly on the domestic market, is
doing a brisk business outside as well. It has clinched deals with
Russia and Ukraine to export 250 million cigarettes to these
former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
It has also received orders to supply the U.S. market with 12
million Egyptian pounds (3.5 million U.S. dollars) worth of
cigarettes, and provide 20 million pounds (5.9 million dollars)
worth of cigarettes and tobacco to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
And the company is considering the Iraqi demand for importing
Egyptian tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
With all the plans, the company seems set to run counter to
the government-sponsored campaign aimed to alert Egyptians of the
dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Hamdi al-Sayyed, head of the National Association of Physicians
said Friday the government has earmarked 300,000 U.S. dollars for
a tobacco awareness campaign targeting juveniles.
</P>
<P>
Figures released last year by the Health Ministry showed that
over 7 million Egyptians, or one in every nine, were smokers. And
alarmingly enough, 20 percent of students and women, 60 percent of
teachers and 40 percent of doctors smoked.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco advertisements are common in local publications and
street billboards in Egypt. Shisha smoking, a traditional pastime
of puffing on scented tobacco and herbal plants, is a common
street scene.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Bid for Jordan's Telecommunication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Two foreign companies are competing
to buy 40 percent shares of the Jordan Telecommunications Company
(JTC), which is to be privatized under a government plan, the
Jordan Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official daily quoted a government sources as saying
that the British Cable and Wireless Company has offered 320
million U.S. dollars for the shares and the Southern Bell Company
of the United States offered more than 600 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government decided in 1997 to sell 26 percent of
JTC's shares to a strategic partner in a bid to draw private
investments, update technology, establish incentive management
mechanism and increase the company's profits. The privatization
scope was later grew to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
But JTC head Ali Shukri Saturday criticized the partial
privatization plan of the company, Jordan's official news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
If JTC is to sell 40 percent of its shares, it should first
consider Jordanian citizens, especially its employees, not a
strategic partner of foreign countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Justifying the introduction of a strategic partner as a means
to bringing in new technology into the company or increasing the
volume of its (subscriber) base can not be accepted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that one of the bidders proposed to retain JTC's
employees for two years before laying them off, Shukri said that
this will create social problems, "something that we do not desire
at all."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government hopes to strengthen the role of the
private sector and reduce its direct involvement in the productive
sectors by privatizing state-owned companies.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Formalize Ties With Iraq, DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is going to
open diplomatic relations with Iraq, the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and three other countries, Foreign
Affairs spokesman Marco Boni confirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent newspaper reported that South Africa
would establish diplomatic ties with the five countries before
hosting the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit from August 29 to
September 3 in Durban, a port city in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Boni told Xinhua in a telephone interview that the story was
true. "The decision was made," he said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said agreements on tying the diplomatic knot
will be signed within weeks by Khiphusizi Jele, South African
ambassador to the United Nations, and his counterparts from Iraq,
DPRK, the Gambia, Bhutan and Vanuatu.
</P>
<P>
Boni also confirmed that South Africa's decision to formalize
ties with Iraq was related to the recovery of more than one
billion Rand (160 million U.S. Dollars) owed to South Africa's
Armscor company for weapons sold during the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
But this was only one of the reasons, said Boni in the
interview. Asked what was the most important reason, he replied
that the NAM summit was one of them.
</P>
<P>
South Africa feels that it would be uncomfortable having
countries at the NAM summit with which it does not have formal
ties.
</P>
<P>
Boni dismissed possible unhappiness on the part of the United
States and Kuwait over the forging of ties between South Africa
and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This move by South Africa should not "provoke negative
response" from these countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Zambia Call for More Pressure on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe and his Zambian counterpart Frederick Chiluba have called
for the exerting of pressure on Angola's opposition UNITA
movement to compel it to adhere to the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner here hosted by Chiluba at the weekend in
his honor, Mugabe urged peace-loving states to enforce the
sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council on the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) if it doesn't
comply with the peace accord signed in Lusaka in 1994, Zambia
Daily Mail reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Zimbabwean president also said countries in the
entire region are particularly disappointed that Angola finds
itself hurtling toward war when all evidence appeared to point in
the direction of peace and reconciliation on the basis of Lusaka
peace accord to end the country's two-decade-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who arrived Friday with 10 cabinet ministers for a
three-day visit, urged UNITA to demonstrate concretely its
declaration and dignity of continued commitment and unconditional
implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
At the dinner, Chiluba reaffirmed Zambia's commitment to
enforcing the Lusaka accord by exerting pressure on UNITA to
compel it to come to its senses and save the Angolan people and
the entire region from further destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts to achieve peace and prosperity would be rendered
futile and useless unless we are guaranteed peace, stability and
security in our region," said the Zambian president.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also expressed Zambia's concern over the continued
reversal of the peace process in Angola despite efforts and
resources placed by the international community at the disposal
of the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
UNITA's failure to comply with the requirements of the Lusaka
peace accord and U.N. resolutions has pushed Angola to the brink
of another civil war, Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the civil war has dire consequences not only
to Angola but also to the entire southern African region in terms
of displacement of people and loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
Angola's former rebel movement UNITA is said to have resumed
offensives and random attacks on civilian targets in late July,
leaving about two hundred people dead.

Mubarak's political advisor Ossama Al Baz met with a Palestinian
delegation led by senior negotiator Saeb Erekat, who briefed the

</P>
<P>
Moussa said he was told that Israel did not present any new

<P>
Presidential aide Baz told reporters Saturday after meeting
Erekat that all Arab parties are convinced of the Egyptian-French
initiative on holding an international conference to save the
Mideast peace process. He added that the future of the initiative
would be determined once the current round of Israeli-Palestinian
talks ends.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait supports the convening of an
Arab summit to tackle the faltering Mideast peace process provided
that it enjoys "all factors of success," Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the news agency, Kuwaiti Minister of
Information Yusef Mohammad Al-Sumait echoed Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak's remarks that the summit should not be a "media
demonstration," for this would not be acceptable under the current
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sumait arrived here Saturday on a regional tour, which will
also take him to Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait wants a political, not a media gathering where
insolvable issues would be discussed," Al-Sumait said, adding that
his country champions Arab unity and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Despite months of consultations and discussions, the Arabs seem
to have failed to agree on a summit, which was initially called
for by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, aimed at forging a
unified stance against Israel's intransigence in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Kuwait's perspective of relations with Iraq, which invaded
the Gulf emirate in 1990, Al-Sumait said the Kuwaiti people harbor
no grudge against the Iraqi people. But he hinted that Baghdad
should make a reconciliation overture first.
</P>
<P>
"It is the aggressor, not the victim, who should launch
initiatives, a human principle widely acknowledged," he said,
urging Iraq to comply with the relevant United Nations Security
Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Ministry Demands Revocation of Ban on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance is demanding the judiciary revoke its ban on the
moderate newspaper Tous, the official news agency IRNA reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of contacts between officials of the ministry and
the Justice Department of Tehran Province, a provisional agreement
for revoking the court order had been reached, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official of the justice department said a letter of
the ministry would be sent to the court to demand re-examination
of the case.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the ministry argued that Tous' publisher had
promised to observe the criteria set by the court after being
given a full explanation on the relevant restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Justice Department on Saturday issued an "effective
immediately" ban on the pro-moderate daily Tous, which started
publication on July 25 to replace the banned paper Jamaeh
(Society) and absorbed the latter's staff.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling came one day after Iranian judiciary head
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi lashed out at Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ayatollah Mohajerani for giving green light to
the daily's publication.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, who strongly supports freedom of expression
advocated by President Mohammad Khatami, argued Tuesday that
the current press laws do not impose restrictions on the
staff of a banned newspaper from being transferred to another
daily.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Promises Tough Crackdown on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Interior Ministry has
vowed to crack down on the rampant drug abuse in the tiny Gulf
state, local daily Arab Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Acting head of the Interior Ministry official Major Ahamad
Sharqawi was quoted as saying that the number of persons who died
of drug overdose has almost doubled during the first half of this
year compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
Sharqawi said that 24 Kuwaitis and four non-Kuwaitis died of
heroin overdose last year. "We are already seeing about one
overdose death per week or about three to four per month, an
increase of 75 to 100 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Owaid Mashan, general secretary of National Committee for
Drug Control (NCDC), said that drug trafficking in Kuwait has
grown to such proportions that it needs serious action.
</P>
<P>
"Not only does this poses a major threat to our young people,
but also to their families, neighbors, close friends and the
community as a whole," Owaid asserted.
</P>
<P>
Another NCDC official stressed that Kuwait's community needs
to be aware of the problem and not allow drugs to take
over the young people.
</P>
<P>
Family values could be undermined through drugs, and "without
family value, a country becomes vulnerable," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The drug issue has become a serious challenge to both the
Kuwaiti government and the society, as drug-related crimes
continued to rise alarmingly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait's Interior Ministry, there were 2,537
drug cases between 1991 and 1997, during which 4,456 persons
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Other official statistics showed that 1,068 drug dealers had
been arrested till the end of May this year.

<HEADLINE> More Zimbabweans Killed in Mining Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Thirty lives have been lost in a
series of mining accidents in Zimbabwe in the first seven months
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail newspaper quoted chief government mining
engineer Arjun Mandal as saying that the major causes of
death at the mines were rock falls and gaseous suffocation.
</P>
<P>
One in every thousand miners was killed each year which was
unacceptably high compared to other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 54 people were killed in 1997 in the mining industry
which employs a 64,000-strong workforce.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which is the continent's largest mining
country, had a fatality rate of one per thousand miners but this,
said Mandal, was because South African mines had worse conditions
such as longer mine shafts and mining at depths far much lower
than the local ones.
</P>
<P>
The official urged the mining management to instill proper
discipline, safety and working conditions so as to reduce the
number of accidents.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
and his vacationing British counterpart Tony Blair Saturday
informally discussed in Bologna global economic integration and
unemployment, the ANSA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Blair was on a two-week-long vacation with his family in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Prodi told reporters after their informal meeting, "we
discussed the importance of having deeper international
relations. We talked about the globalization of the economy, but I
think it's also important to create a sense of world politics."
</P>
<P>
"The economy has become global. So we also have to think
globally," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a completely different kind of market today," Blair
added at the press briefing, "And it requires a politics of ideals
and values, which are the traditional values of social justice and
individual opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about unemployment, Prodi said that Italy and Britain
had very different economic situations, and the challenges lay in
"harmonizing" their economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The next summit meeting between Italy and Britain is scheduled
for this coming November, and Blair is pushing for it to be held
in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest Drinking Vessel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
confirmed that the "Taohe", a kind of earthen pot, is the oldest
drinking vessel in China, dating back 6,000 years.
</P>
<P>
That puts it about 1,000 years earlier than when ancient
Egyptians began making wine out of grapes, scholars concluded,
based on textual research.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pots were discovered at some ancient ruins near the
Hemudu Culture ruins in Yuyao County (now city) in Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say that the relatively hot climatic conditions, the
type of farming, and the adequate rainfall in the Hemudu area
6,000 years ago provided good conditions for growing wine crops.
</P>
<P>
The Hemudu site was excavated in 1973 and covers 40,000
sq.m. It is the earliest known site of east coast Neolithic
culture, with evidence of rice cultivation and the domestication
of pigs and dogs and possibly water buffalo.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 of the 5,000 objects unearthed at the site are
made of bone. They outnumber the stone, pottery, and wooden
objects.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- After an initial setback on
Monday, equities recovered smartly and several key scrips even
posted handsome gains on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market
during the week on revival of buying by operators as well as
foreign funds and domestic institutions.
</P>
<P>
BSE sensitive index, after dropping sharply on Monday by over
86 points to 3085.17, recovered during the week and even forged
ahead to end the week at 3211.31 as against the last weekend close
of 3171.30, netting a gain of 40.01 points.
</P>
<P>
Though the market initially came under pressure due to bear
hammering on rumors of fresh crisis in the Asian markets, the
change of stance by bears, who suddenly covered their short sale
positions, provided opportunity to bulls to make fresh commitments
along with foreign institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
Sharp losses for the last 10 days demanded a technical
correction, brokers said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Protests Against India's Cross-Border Firing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan lodged a strong
protest Saturday with India against its "unprovoked firing" along
the Line of Control in the disputed Kashmir, killing and injuring
dozens of Pakistani civilians.
</P>
<P>
Additional Foreign Secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan summoned
India's Deputy High Commissioner Sharat Sabharwal here Saturday
afternoon and lodged the protest, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Such provocative actions undermine the prospects for
resumption of meaningful dialogue between the two countries," said
the protest note.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian officials rejected the accusation, saying
that Indian forces were firing in retaliation to that of Pakistani
forces, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The situation along the Line of Control was getting
increasingly tense over the past three days with exchanges of fire
between Pakistani and Indian forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the recent Colombo meeting between Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, the two sides made little concrete progress to mend
their damaged relations.
</P>
<P>
On May 11 and 13 India launched five nuclear tests, prompting
Pakistan to follow suit by detonating its own nuclear devices in
response.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear race is a blow to the international
non-proliferation efforts and has plunged the two nations into a
new era of tension.

<P>
According to initial results issued by the National Election
Committee (NEC) on Saturday, the CPP had won more than 2 million
votes in the multi-party election in 23 constituencies. The
Funcinpec Party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh gained about 1.5
million votes and the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) about 700,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
The exact numbers of seats each party could grab in the 122-
member National Assembly are not expected until August 19.
</P>
<P>
What is certain, however, is that the CPP did not get the
required two-thirds majority, or 82 seats, in the assembly to form
a one-party government. Therefore, a coalition government with
Funcinpec or the SRP -- perhaps even both, is in the offing with
the CPP, the largest political party which will assume the
premiership.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and the SRP dislike to see that happen but would
have to accept the reality in longer terms as the election has
been accepted by the international community, whose 700 observers
monitored the voting.
</P>
<P>
The two parties, licking their wounds after the election, have
to ponder why their predictions of big wins in the election did
not materialize and why the CPP, keeping a low profile during the
election campaign, emerged as the winner.
</P>
<P>
The CPP owed much to its grip of power since the early 1980s.
With strong support bases in most provinces, particularly in the
countryside, the CPP claims a 3.8-million membership, making up
more than half of the 5.4 million registered voters.
</P>
<P>
The CPP membership by far outnumbers its rival Funcinpec and
the SRP, and this overwhelmingness helped turn the tide in favor
of the CPP, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They said the CPP's control over the armed forces, police,
judicature and media could have had great influence on voters who,
having seen so much bloodshed in the war-torn country, desperately
want peace much more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
It was the belief of many voters that only the CPP is powerful
enough to bring about peace, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"What would happen if the CPP had been defeated and refused to
hand over power?" an Asian diplomat asked. "The people are afraid
of civil war in the post-election period, so they elected a party
which they think can secure peace."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the public was impressed by what the CPP had done
in facilitating peace and political stability in the country. It
was in the hands of the CPP that the problem of Khmer Rough was
almost resolved. With the defection of large numbers of Khmer
Rouge forces to the government, the guerrilla force, now having
only several hundred hard-core fighters hiding in jungles, is far
from being reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
The CPP also devotes its attention to economic and social
development, including the implementation of a market economy and
the construction of irrigation projects, roads and schools. All
these factors contributed to the CPP's popularity and victory.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between Funcinpec and the SRP weakened their
leverage against the united and well-organized CPP. During the
election campaign, the two parties, the only forces that can
confront the CPP, were locked in a bitter row. "If Funcinpec and
the SRP had joined hands in an alliance against the CPP before the
election, the result would have been much different," a Funcinpec
official said.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and the SRP, claiming that the polling and
vote-counting were rigged, now stand united against a common
adversary. They have vowed that they would not form a coalition
government with the CPP unless they get new elections in disputed
areas.
</P>
<P>
If they stick together, the two parties' combined strength
could keep the new parliament from meeting and deny the CPP the
chance to form a government, thus plunging Cambodia into a
constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
This might require King Norodom Sihanouk's intervention,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
But they said the two parties' acrimonious history, along with
what is expected to be intense pressure from foreign diplomats and
the king, will almost certainly cause Funcinpec to break away and
form a two-party coalition with the CPP, in exchange for some key
ministries and a promise of the crown for Funcinpec's leader
Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen, but I don't think it will last very
long," one Asian diplomat said of the parties' rejection of a
coalition.

YANGON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 490,923 tourists
visited Myanmar in the 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March,
the official New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the tourists who visited Myanmar in 1997-98, 64.1 percent

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is planning to organize a travel show later

following its tourism promotion campaign launched in Singapore
last month.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that foreign investment in Myanmar's
hotels and tourism sector exceeded 1 billion U.S. dollars in
March, the end of the 1997-98 fiscal year.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar increased import of cement
annually in the last five years to meet the growing need of the
country's extensive construction projects.
</P>
<P>
It imported 83.7 million U.S. dollars worth of cement in the
1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March, increasing from 11.5
million dollars in 1993-94, according to the latest official
Selected Monthly Economic Indicators.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the country's state enterprises produced
a total of 480,000 tons of cement annually in the last five years,
it is still far from meeting the domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
There are three cement factories in Myanmar with a combined
output of 480,000 tons annually.

<P>
KINGSTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen Latin American and
Caribbean countries vowed in a resolution to support China's
efforts for reunification on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed by the 17 countries attending a
three-day seminar reviewing friendly relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Despite great progress in the past 50 years, the resolution
said, relations between China and Latin American and Caribbean
countries still face severe challenges.
</P>
<P>
The biggest concern is that about 10 countries from this region
are maintaining official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged all the countries in the region to join
forces in supporting China's bid for reunification.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which will end on Sunday, is co-sponsored by the
Chinese Friendship Association with Foreign Countries and the
Jamaican-Chinese Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's Governor General Howard Cooke opened the seminar with
a speech, hoping that the seminar will make good in consolidating
friendship between China and countries in the region.

CARACAS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's foreign exchange
reserves amounted to 14.5 billion U.S. dollars at the end of July,
a 992 million dollar reduction from June, the Venezuelan Central
Bank reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 6.3 percent drop was the third most serious reduction so
far this year. The other two big drops were 7.2 percent in March
and 12.73 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The country foreign exchange reserves reached 17.8 billion
dollars at the beginning of this year, but declined to 14.8
billion dollars in April. Since then, they have shown a stable
performance with slight ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
Finance experts attributed the falls to the weakening of the
oil market and of the Venezuelan economy.

<P>
CARACAS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's unemployment rate
declined by 0.3 percent to 11.3 percent between April and June of
this year, the Labor Ministry announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This drop represents, according to a preliminary report
released by the ministry, a progress in the government plan of
ending the year with an unemployment rate between eight and nine
percent.
</P>
<P>
The 11.3 percent means a little more than one million of the
labor force estimated at around nine million people.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the unemployment rate was
estimated at 11.6 percent, an increase of 1 percent over the last
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan economy has been seriously affected by crude oil
prices on the international markets. Oil and its byproducts make
up 80 percent of Venezuelan exports.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the economic hardship, the Venezuelan government has
cut three times the national budget.

CARACAS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan basket of crudes
and byproducts closed the week with an average price of 10.41
U.S. dollars per barrel, an increase of 49 cents over the the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
The Energy and Mines Ministry's weekly statistics bulletin

of this year at 11.23 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil price was estimated at an average of 11.10 dollars per
barrel in the first seven months of this year, less than 13
dollars, which is the bench mark for the calculation of the
current national budget. The 1997 average was 16.32 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also
increased its basket price by 49 cents, after the average value of
its products went up from 12.03 dollars to 12.52 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Reforms to Break Up Oil Industry Monopoly in China </HEADLINE>

BEIJING, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The marketplace is waiting to

state-monopolized industry for decades, today's China Daily

<P>
The sector is due to turn from a monopoly to a state of limited
competition between producers, which is considered to be more
optimal for the country's general economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
The former monopoly of the oil industry has in effect become a
duopoly in onshore oil production since the establishment last
week of China National Petroleum (Group) Corp (CNPC) and China
Petroleum Corp (Sinopec). China National Star Petroleum Corp
(CNSPC) is not considered to be a big player in the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) confines itself to
offshore oil production.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's onshore oil extraction capacity of 150 million
tons, CNPC controls 67 percent while Sinopec controls 33
percent. In regard to the country's capacity to process 200 million
tons of oil, Sinopec accounts for 52.06 while CNPC accounts for
45.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the central government-orchestrated restructuring
program, all major onshore oil fields, refineries and
petro-chemical manufacturers were incorporated into the two oil
giants.
</P>
<P>
Government officials described this program as a big reform
measure. Governmental functions which CNPC and Sinopec had
shouldered over the past decades have been handed to a bureau of
the State Economic and Trade Commission. The new CNPC and Sinopec
are expected to operate as enterprises in the market economy sense.
</P>
<P>
Although still remote from perfect competition, which can
bring the marketplace into equilibrium in terms of production and
prices, the formation of the two State-owned oil giants was hailed
as representing a step moving further away from monopoly, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The control of crude oil prices held by CNPC and Sinopec's
control of oil products have evaporated as a result of the pricing
reforms.
</P>
<P>
More significant as part of the program is the freeing up of
oil pricing after decades of control by the central
government. From June on, the price of oil and oil products on
domestic markets have been allowed to float at international
market levels.
</P>
<P>
As trade barriers in terms of tariffs and import quotas exist,
CNPC and Sinopec, being no longer price makers, will be
competitors in the international Arena.

<HEADLINE> 3 Burning Points on Peak of Indonesia's Merapi Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Three burning points were seen on
the peak of Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most active volcano in
Central Java, according to reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Agency for Volcanic Research and Technological
Development Mas Atje Purbawinata told reporters on Saturday that
lava was still frequently flowing covering a distance of 2,000
meters towards Lamat river and Sat river.
</P>
<P>
It was observed that the volcano spewed glowing lava 66 times
from midnight till 6 a.m. on August 1, he said, adding that the
lava stream was still glowing with heat.
</P>
<P>
On July 31, Merapi spewed lava 216 times compared to 208 on
July 30.
</P>
<P>
Since its eruption on July 19, the 2,968-meter Merapi no longer
spewed hot clouds but volcanic materials continued to come out of
the crater so that the volcano was still in the alert status for
the people living around the mountain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mountain Lokon and Mountain Mahawu in North Sulawesi
Island have shown signs of increased activities over the past few
days, prompting the local administration to restrict the local
people's visits to other areas.
</P>
<P>
The 1,689-meter Lokon last erupted in 1991, and the 1,333-meter
Mahawu last erupted 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to officers who are monitoring the two volcanoes,
Mahawu spewed sulphuric smell at night and white thin clouds from
its crater.
</P>
<P>
The local people are told not to spend the night at their
plantations close to the two volcanoes and not to engage in any
activities near the areas.

LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A car bomb exploded in a town
center in Northern Ireland and caused injuries on Saturday, police
said.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were injured, none seriously, in the blast, in
Banbridge, about 40 km south-west of Belfast and buildings in the
town were damaged.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a telephone warning had been received and
officers were trying to move people from the area when the
explosion struck.
</P>
<P>
"Police were in the process of clearing the town center when it
went off," a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
There was no information on who planted the bomb, but media
reports believed it was done by dissident republican groups
opposed to the peace agreement in April to bring peace to the
British province after three decades of violence.
</P>
<P>
Banbridge, a largely Protestant town, was targeted earlier this
year by republican bombers.
