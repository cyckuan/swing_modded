<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges Support for African Peacekeeping Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday urged the U.N. Security Council to "provide all
necessary political and financial support" to enhance African
peacekeeping capacity.
</P>
<P>
He commended the three peace agreements endorsed at the latest
summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for showing the
resolve of the regional organizations to assume responsibility for
the resolution of conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the council on his July 6-11 trip to Africa and his
attendance from July 11 to 14 at the OAU summit in Algiers, Annan
said the accords are still fragile and it is imperative for the
council to strongly support them both politically and materially.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the Lome Peace Agreement on Sierra Leone, the
modalities for implementing the OAU Framework Agreement on the
conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the cease-fire
agreement for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"The success of these agreements will depend on the readiness
and the timeliness of support by the Security Council," said
Annan, who was optimistic about "a qualitative change" emerging in
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Annan said at his request, the U.N. is cooperating with the OAU
in preparing for a peacekeeping operation between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his tour of Senegal, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea
and Nigeria, he said what has struck him is the determination of
these west African nations to take primary responsibility for
finding solutions to their own problems.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, he said, he tried his best to dispel the
notion among a number of leaders that the "the United Nations is
losing sight of Africa's daunting challenges, as the focus is
increasingly shifting to other pressing needs".

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lending Hits New Record in Fiscal 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- New lending commitments from
the World Bank to client countries were up in fiscal year 1999,
which ended on June 30, reaching a record 29 billion U.S. dollars,
with disbursements at 24 billion dollars, the bank reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figures include both the market-rate loans made by the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and
the concessional loans made to the world's poorest countries
through the International Development Association (IDA). Both IBRD
and IDA are members of the World Bank Group.
</P>
<P>
World Bank's total lending commitments were 28.6 billion
dollars in fiscal 1998 and 19.1 billion dollars in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
"While lending commitments were on the rise, overall lending
quality also improved," the bank said. "Virtually all indicators
of project quality and performance improved over the course of
FY99."
</P>
<P>
"While we see for a second fiscal year that the financial
crisis has resulted in record lending, I am cheered to see the
increase in the quality of loans we have provided, as this points
to real results on the ground," said James D. Wolfensohn, World
Bank President.
</P>
<P>
The high level of lending commitments was due in large part to
the bank's continued support to East Asia. Lending to the Latin
America and Caribbean region also increased, partly in response to
ripple effects from the East Asian crisis and Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
IBRD loan commitments in fiscal 1999 amounted to 22.2 billion
dollars for 131 projects, compared with 21 billion dollars for 151
projects in fiscal 1998. IDA commitments were 6.8 billion dollars
for 145 projects in fiscal 1999, compared with 7.5 billion dollars
in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
IBRD/IDA combined gross disbursements during fiscal 1999 were
24 billion dollars, compared to nearly 25.5 billion dollars in
fiscal 1998. IBRD gross disbursements totaled 18 billion dollars,
compared with 19.8 billion dollars in fiscal 1998. IDA gross
disbursements in fiscal 1999 rose to 6 billion dollars, compared
with 5.6 billion dollars in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
New lending commitments to Africa in fiscal 1999 totaled 2.07
billion dollars for 56 projects. Of this amount, 2.06 billion
dollars were IDA credits (55 projects), and 5 million dollars were
IBRD loans. In fiscal 1998, combined lending to the region totaled
2.87 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the East Asia and Pacific region received the most in
new lending -- 9.76 billion dollars in new IBRD/IDA commitments
for 55 projects -- 8.75 billion dollars from IBRD and 1.01 billion
dollars from IDA. The region received 9.62 billion dollars from
IBRD/IDA in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, 2.56 billion dollars in new IBRD/IDA commitments
were approved in fiscal 1999 for 18 projects. Of this, 750 million
dollars were from IBRD and 1.81 billion dollars were from IDA.
Fiscal 1998 combined lending to the region came to 3.86 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The countries of Europe and Central Asia saw 5.29 billion
dollars for 74 projects approved for fiscal 1999 -- 4.35 billion
dollars from IBRD and 936 million dollars from IDA. This compares
with 5.22 billion dollars in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
Commitments by IBRD and IDA to Latin America and the Caribbean
in fiscal 1999 totaled 7.74 billion dollars for 51 projects, with
7.13 billion dollars in IBRD loans and 604 million dollars in IDA
credits. Loans to the region in fiscal 1998 were 6.04 billion
dollars from IBRD and 360 million dollars from IDA.
</P>
<P>
New commitments to the countries of the Middle East and North
Africa in fiscal 1999 amounted to 1.58 billion dollars for 22
projects, compared to 968 million dollars in fiscal 1998. Of this
amount, 1.19 billion dollars was in IBRD loans and 387 million
dollars in IDA credits. In addition to IBRD/IDA financing, an
addition 54 million dollars was committed through the trust fund
for the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Stepashin Urges Aid to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Prime Minister
Sergei Stepashin urged on Tuesday the United States to provide
assistance to Yugoslavia despite Washington's opposition against
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon at the National Press Club, Stepashin
said in summertime, the 10 million Serbs are getting by, but there
will be catastrophe in the winter.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has ruled out even one cent in U.S.
reconstruction aid to Serbia so long as Milosevic remains in
power.
</P>
<P>
"There are no roads. Enterprises have been destroyed. There is
no gas supply, no water supply in many areas of the country,"
Stepashin said. "We do not have to repeat the Kosovo scenario the
other way around."
</P>
<P>
On his second day in Washington, Stepashin had a breakfast
meeting with Vice President Al Gore and met with congressional
leaders on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, speaking just outside the Senate chamber, said he
would take up several issues with Clinton and Gore later in the
day, including economic relations, Iran, arms treaties and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We have removed many issues that have been there," Stepashin
told reporters, referring to differences over how to rebuild after
the U.S.-led air war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Urging businessmen to invest in Russia on Monday night,
Stepashin told hundreds of American business executives that
accounts of "criminalization" in Russia's transition from state
controls were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-U.S. relations has been pushed to its lowest point
since the end of the Cold War when the U.S.-led NATO conducted an
air campaign against Yugoslavia. Stepashin's visit is to mend the
strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Even when U.S.-Russian relations slumped because of Kosovo,
Stepashin said, "The economic ties held; the economic ties never
snapped."
</P>
<P>
He also assured the American businessmen that there will be no
return to the Cold War era. He said the ruble has been stabilized
and inflation checked, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin had
signed a law giving equal protection to foreign and domestic
investments.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Stock Market Slumps in First Half of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The total volume of shares traded
on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) in the first half of this year
has slumped compared with that for the same period last year and
analysts said this was due to investors dumping their shares on
the market.
</P>
<P>
 Diana Okine, research officer of the GSE, said that the
market was over-flooded by investors who off-loaded their shares
after making some gains over time, the Ghana News Agency (GNA)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 She also attributed the trend of continuous fall in the
All-Share Index to investor panic as share prices depreciate.
</P>
<P>
 The market index currently stands at 789.56 points. It
reached an all- time high of 1,201.08 points in May 1998 and
recorded an all-time low of 55.49 points in May 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics obtained from the GSE in Accra,
capital of Ghana Tuesday, the total volume of shares traded up to
the end of June was about 166 percent down from 18 million
compared with 48 million traded in the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
 The total volume of shares traded in the whole of last year
was 91,446, 520.
</P>
<P>
 The value of the shares in the first half of the year was 26
billion cedis as against 74 billion cedis for the same period in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Between May and June 1999 the Exchange recorded a percentage
change of negative 72 in volume of shares traded while the
percentage change for the full year of between June 1998 and June
1999 stood at negative 63 percent.
</P>
<P>
Okine said, "as unpredictable as the market is, nobody can
tell what may happen. Things could improve."
</P>
<P>
 She said the Exchange has adopted a number of strategies to
increase investor interest. These include promotions, training
programs, public lectures and the publication of success stories
of people who have benefited from investing on the market.

with material damage, destroying 97 homes and 3,587 households and
swamping 31,122 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Hail was reportedly an additional factor that caused the death

3,430 cubic meters of wood, 23 hydrotechnical sites, four trout
farms and two pheasant farms and disrupted electricity, rail
transportation, telecoms and natural gas distribution in places.

swelling creeks spilled over their banks, killing 13 people and
leaving 480 more stranded. Ninety-seven homes were destroyed and
so were 187 households, along with 30 bridges and footbridges. Six

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government approved
on Tuesday a program aimed at attracting Romanian specialists to
return to the homeland.
</P>
<P>
The program was elaborated by the National Education Ministry,
which proposed the Executive to encourage big investors to fund
scientific research, to hire good professionals, with
international experience, and pay salaries to them commensurate
with their value.
</P>
<P>
According to the Government spokesperson, the Executive decided
to ask the Education Ministry to work out regulations for granting
credits to young specialists to set up research, consultancy and
expertise units, to negotiate a loan of 10 million U.S. dollars
for equipping laboratories of university excellence centers, to
negotiate with the World Bank a pilot-program related to the
return to Romania of good professionals.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Radu Vasile asked that on the basis of the
Education Ministry's propositions, a national program regarding
the return to Romania of young Romanian specialists be presented
by September 1.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more and more young Romanian intellectuals
leave for foreign countries as a result of the difficult economic
situations at home.

NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Former allies of Ghanaian
President Jerry Rawlings Tuesday set up a break-away political
party when they received their certificate from the Electoral
Commission (EC) to become Ghana's seventh political party.
</P>
<P>
David Kanga, Deputy Director (Operations) of the EC, said the
commission has satisfied itself with the information it received
from the National Reform Party (NRP) executive.
</P>
<P>
The certificate qualifies the NRP to operate as a legal
political party, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Kanga urged the leaders to expedite action to elect
substantive national, regional, constituency and branch
executives.
</P>
<P>
 He asked them to present a record of the party's assets,
income and expenditure in written form to the EC in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of former Rawlings allies who said they were
dissatisfied with the lack of openness in the ruling National
Democratic Congress (NDC) demanded a change.
</P>
<P>
While some said the change should come from within, others led
by lawyer and farmer Augustine "Gossie" Tanoh, decided to break
away. They said they will contest next year's presidential and
parliamentary elections.

<P>
NICOSIA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will host next year's Miss
Universe pageant in May.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced here Tuesday by Cyprus' Minister of
Commerce, Industry and Tourism Nikos Rolandis and President of
Miss Universe Corporation Maureen Reidy.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Rolandis said the "Miss Universe"
pageant will promote Cyprus' tourism, the island's main source of
income.
</P>
<P>
He said it is an important international event and Cyprus will
try to make it the event of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
Reidy said Cyprus was selected among 12 candidate countries,
adding the island's ancient history played an important part in
the organizers' decision.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is the legendary island birthplace of Aphrodite, the
Greek goddess of love and beauty.
</P>
<P>
The Miss Universe pageant is believed to be the third most
popularly televised event worldwide after the Olympic Games and
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 2.4 billion viewers will watch the
pageant.
</P>
<P>
The 85 contestants from an equal number of countries are
expected to visit Cyprus for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Miss Universe 2000 will be awarded the Golden Apple prize,
reviving mythology, in which Aphrodite received the same prize
2800 years ago.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa in Fresh Bid for Congo (K) Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Zuma Tuesday traveled to Uganda and Rwanda in a
fresh bid to persuade rebel groups of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) to sign a cease-fire agreement reached on July 10.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki said in Pretoria after
meeting Congolese President Laurent Kabila that Zuma is going to
meet Ugandan and Rwandan presidents Yoweri Museveni and Pasteur
Bizimungu.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda are backing the rebel groups fighting Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the two rebel groups should sign the agreement as
soon as possible in order to enable the setting up of a joint
military commission to ensure that the cease-fire holds.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, along with his allies Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe,
signed the cease-fire agreement, as did Rwanda and Uganda. The
rebels did not endorse the treaty because of a dispute over who
was entitled to sign for them.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said a meeting to persuade the rebels to sign the
document is also under way between the rebels and Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said his army would be able to defeat the rebels should
they refuse to sign the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said rebels are starting to hand in their arms, and there is
a standstill of hostilities at most fronts.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the rebels are giving themselves up, there will be
less rebels to fight against us," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You should not doubt the capacity of the Congolese people to
win the war. Do you think Uganda and Rwanda have the resources to
sustain a war against Congo (K)?"
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said some military conflict is continuing, and should be
stopped as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the cease-fire agreement would
work.
</P>
<P>
Kabila arrived in South Africa Monday with a ministerial
delegation.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he denied recent news reports that he is in the
country to seek political asylum, or that he is on vacation with
his entire family.
</P>
<P>
He said the main objective of his visit is to seek renewed
cooperation between Congo (K) and South Africa -- which came to an
end because of the war.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said his delegation met a number of South African
business representatives.
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that the meeting was very positive. They
promised to come back, and they said they were in a hurry to take
part in the reconstruction of my country."
</P>
<P>
Ministers of the two countries met Tuesday to discuss
cooperation in a number of fields, including agriculture.

<P>
With their first meeting on July 11 aimed at rehabilitating
mutual trust crumbled by the hard-line policy of former Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak and Arafat are expected
to discuss substantial issues related to the peace process at the
second meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the implementation of the Wye agreement,
signed last October and then frozen by Netanyahu, will dominate
the 90-minute talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered interim deal calls for Israeli withdrawal
from another 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian measures to curb anti-Israel attacks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu halted the implementation of the agreement after
handing over 2 percent to the Palestinians in the first of its
three stages, citing alleged Palestinian violations.
</P>
<P>
Promising to reach a comprehensive peace with Israel's Arab
neighbors in 15 months, Barak has proposed that the two sides
combine parts of the Wye agreement with the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reports said Barak would ask Arafat to agree to
bypass the final stage of the remaining two phases of Israeli
troop withdrawals under the Wye accord or at least postpone it for
three to six months.
</P>
<P>
Israel is expected to transfer 5 percent of Israeli-controlled
areas to joint control, 1 percent to total Palestinian control and
another 7 percent already under joint control to total Palestinian
control at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Barak fears the withdrawal would stir storms among
far-rightists in Israel and cause friction between Israeli
settlers and Palestinians, and thus harm the chance of reaching
the final-status talks aimed at a permanent peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks will define the status of the
Palestinian entity, the fate of Jerusalem and the final borders
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israeli daily Haaretz said Tuesday that about 19 Israeli
settlements in the West Bank will be isolated in the Palestinian
areas after Israel carries out the withdrawals stipulated in the
Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for Arafat's agreement to his proposal, Barak may
offer a more appealing first withdrawal that would create
continuity in Palestinian territories, which the Palestinians
desperately need for the establishment of a future state,
Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer told Israel Army
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israel should turn 5 percent of areas under Israeli control to
joint Israeli-Palestinian control at this stage of withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
The United States has softened its opposition to Barak's
proposal after he paid a six-day visit to Washington in the middle
of the month. President Bill Clinton called on Arafat to hear
Barak's reasons.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA has repeated that it will not accept Barak's
proposal, calling for "complete and honest implementation" of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian official said Arafat would urge Barak at the
meeting to begin carrying out the troop withdrawals, release of
Palestinian prisoners and halt of Jewish settlement activities in
the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Arab Countries to Pour Investment in Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries are expected to
invest over 30 billion U.S. dollars in gas industry by the year
2005, according to the July issue of the Arab Oil &AMP; Gas magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation last year estimated
that Arab countries' capital investment in gas projects over the
period 1998-2003 is 17.29 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The possible rise is due to emergence of new projects,
particularly the Dolphin project in the Gulf and the export of
Libyan gas to Italy, said the magazine published by the Arab
Petroleum Research Center based in France.
</P>
<P>
The Dolphin project involves the supply of natural gas from
the North Field in Qatar to Oman, the United Arab Emirates and
Pakistan, and is expected to cost 8-10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report said 5 billion more dollars will be needed to
finance projects in Iraq once the embargo is lifted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, gas exports from the Arab countries
have more than tripled, from 21.6 billion cubic meters in 1989 to
70.9 billion cubic meters in 1998, with Algeria alone reaching
52.4 billion cubic meters last year.
</P>
<P>
With new projects planned in North Africa and the Middle East,
Arab gas exports are expected to exceed 100 billion cubic meters
by 2002-2003.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Arab countries are also producing more and more
natural gas to meet domestic demand, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries' natural gas consumption soared from 1.09
million barrels per day of oil equivalent (bpdoe) in 1985 to 2.56
million bpdoe in 1998, when gas accounted for 41.4 percent of the
region's total energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, Arab countries' total energy demand is
expected to rise to 8.57 million bpdoe, of which natural gas will
account for 4.7 million bpdoe, implying that consumption is set to
almost double between 1998-2010.

<HEADLINE> Good Trend Reported for EU Coal, Steel Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Growing demands and international
competition have led the coal and steel industries to grow
gradually but substantially in the European Union, officials of
the 15-nation bloc said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report just adopted by the European Commission on
investment in the coal and steel industries of the union, the
officials said that there was a marked increase in industrial
activity due to growing demand within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The ever increasing industrial activity had in turn had a
favorable impact on the steel market that saw a gradual and
substantial improvement in both volume and price.
</P>
<P>
Capital expenditure kept declining in the coal industry and the
decline was attributed to international competition and gradual
change of internal policies of the EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Capital expenditure in 1997 was 495.5 million ECU (471.9
million U.S. dollars), more than 18 percent down on the previous
year while the 1998 data showed a further drop, mainly as a result
of the slowdown in capital expenditure in Spain, Germany and
France.
</P>
<P>
The greater availability of coal on the international market at
prices which are competitive in relation to the high cost of
community production has led to a gradual tightening of policy on
aid and subsidies granted by EU member states to the community
coal industry.
</P>
<P>
Capital expenditure in the steel industry in 1998, however,
showed a marked increase of 12.7 percent, from 3,875.3 million ECU
(3,690 million dollars) in 1997 to 4,365.8 million ECU (4,157.9
million dollars) in 1998.

KAMPALA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has discussed the issue of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
with a South African delegation here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They discussed developments relating to the evolution of the
peace process in the DRC in the wake of the recently signed Lusaka
peace accord aimed at ending the conflict in the country, a press
release from the President's Office said Tuesday evening.
</P>

Kabila did not sign it because of disagreement over which rebel
group should sign on behalf of the rebel forces.

<HEADLINE> PMC Holds Cautious View on Regional Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian countries and
their 10 dialogue partners Tuesday echoed a cautious attitude
toward the recent signs of economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the opening plenary session of the Post Ministerial
Conference (PMC), many participants also expressed the hope that
ASEAN and its dialogue partners should cooperate in addressing
future challenges.
</P>
<P>
Attending the two-day conference are foreign ministers from the
10 member countries of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) and their dialogue partners such as the United States,
Japan, the European Union and Russia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the PMC, Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko
Koumura said despite signs of recovery in the Asian economies, it
is important to keep up efforts before a true and sustainable
development can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Koumura called on the international community to continue to
support these efforts "so that structural reform will be achieved,
human resource will be developed and social safety nets will be
established."
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said that his country is
interested in concrete economic projects related to the Hanoi Plan
of Action, especially in such fields as transport, oil production,
energy and scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The hard times are far from over," cautioned South Korean
Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young.
</P>
<P>
Asian economies "must guard against the complacency that small
successes tend to breed," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Of equal importance, the cooperation, assistance and
leadership provided by the major economies in staving off the
economic turmoil must be sustained so as to restore stability in
the region." Hong said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said that Asia is
now on the road to recovery, but "many challenges remain."
</P>
<P>
The challenges include, he said, the slow and difficult
recovery process, the need of setting up social safety nets for
the poor, security issues, transboundary crimes and ASEAN's
solidarity and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
He called on the dialogue partners to continue to cooperate
with ASEAN as the regional grouping prepares to face the
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said: "There is
still a long way to travel before we can confidently say that
we've seen a resumption of sustained economic growth in East Asia,
and there are still many potential risks."
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia welcomes the Hanoi Plan Action (HPA)
adopted by ASEAN as it is an ambitious range of initiatives to
hasten economic recovery and address the social impact of the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Australia, Downer said, will continue to work with ASEAN to
help it out of the depths of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the opening statement to the PMC, Singapore Foreign Minister
Shunmugam Jayakumar said the dialogue partners are invited to take
part in the Hanoi Plan of Action.
</P>
<P>
The HPA, said Jayakumar, is "an outward-looking plan as it
represents an open invitation to our dialogue partners to
cooperate with us in the many areas for the next six years."
</P>
<P>
"The HPA outlines the immediate and long-term priorities of
ASEAN and provides a comprehensive list of activities that ASEAN
hopes to undertake to bring us towards the ASEAN envision in the
Vision 2020," Jayakumar said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first in a series of concrete plans mapped out to
realize the Vision 2020, a long-term and broad blueprint for the
region, adopted by ASEAN leaders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis which began two years ago has caused
severe economic damage to many Asian economies, several of them
also suffering serious and political repercussions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that many of these economies have started to
show signs of economic recovery and are recording positive growth
figures, "the reforms still need to run their course before we can
safely declare ourselves as out of the woods," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Asian economies, the crisis also affected other
regions as it is an increasingly globalized world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To effectively resolve problems which have potential
transboundary effects, we need to work together and deal with them
collectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's 10 dialogue partners are Australia, Canada, China, the
European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea and
the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Germany signed three
agreements here on Tuesday within the framework of a bilateral
technical cooperation program.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by Jordanian Planning Minister Rima
Khalaf and Germany Ambassador to Amman Peter Mende, Jordan's
official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the first agreement, the German government will provide
3 million Deutsche marks (1.61 million U.S. dollars) to help
improve the efficiency of Jordan's customs administration.
</P>
<P>
One million marks (about 53,5000 dollars) will go to the
second deal to study the impact of Jordan's economic adjustment on
the agricultural sector, evaluate policies of the Agriculture
Ministry and guarantee the income of farmers.
</P>
<P>
The third agreement deals with a farming engineers training
program to create more jobs for young people in the agricultural
sector of the desert kingdom, which suffered an unemployment rate
of more than 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, German Ambassador Mende said in a
statement that his country will provide continuous technical aid
to Jordan, particularly in water and irrigation projects.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Blair Reiterates UK Government's Policy on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
issued an appeal for cross-party support for the Europe campaign
in a keynote speech on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the London Business School, he also launched a
blistering attack on the Conservatives, calling them extremists
for their position on Europe and the single currency.
</P>
<P>
"I will join men and women of all political persuasions and
none and give my active support to Britain in Europe campaign when
it is launched in the autumn," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party and some sections of the media were
moving from a position of Euroscepticism to holding a position
which was simply anti-European, he observed. This, he said, bore
"no logic" and was "damaging to Britain's interest and must be
resisted".
</P>
<P>
Blair described Conservative leader Hague's position on the
euro as a "fatuous fudge", saying that to have the option of
joining the single currency it was necessary to prepare.
</P>
<P>
Blair said when the Conservatives called for the cancellation
of plans for preparing for the euro and the re-negotiation of
Britain's membership of the EU they were really code words for
"being ready to leave".
</P>
<P>
During the speech, however, Blair did not redefine his
government's position on the euro. Addressing media speculation
over changes in policy, Blair said: "If the policy changes, I'll
tell you."

<HEADLINE> Israel Receives German-built Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli navy got a boost
Tuesday when it received the first of the three German-built
submarines designed to upgrade Israel's underwater fleet.
</P>
<P>
The diesel-powered Dolphin received a royal welcome when it
surfaced in Israeli waters off the northern port of Haifa after
about four-week voyage from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television reports showed six Israeli missile ships
circled the submarine while four F-16 warplanes flew overhead in
formation to greet the Dolphin.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reports said the submarine, among the most
advanced submarines in the world, can carry 16 torpedoes or
mines. It can also sneak undetected into ports as far away as the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Experts have said the three Dolphin-class submarines Germany
made for Israel can be equipped with small cruise missiles
carrying nuclear warheads, guaranteeing Israel a second-strike
capability in the scenario that Israel were attacked with nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards the ability of Iran and Iraq to develop
non-conventional weapons as the long-term threat to its national
security.
</P>
<P>
It asked Germany to help build two Dolphin-class submarines in
1989, but canceled the project a year later because it would cost
300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
After attacked by Scud missiles fired by Iraq in the Gulf War
in 1991, Israel renewed the project and added a third submarine in
the contract in 1994. Germany offered to pay for most of the cost.
</P>
<P>
The second submarine will be delivered in October and the
third in 2000, Israel Radio said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Airlines (EAL)
has earned 43.8 million birr (5.4 million U.S. dollars) net profit
during the fiscal of year 1997/98, said an annual report of the
airline available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A solid financial performance has made the fiscal year of
1997/98 the 19th consecutive profit year for the airlines, the
report quoted EAL executive officer Bisrat Nigatu as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bisrat said the highlight for 1998 was the inauguration of the
EAL's trans-Atlantic services initially to Washington, the United
States and then later to New York.
</P>
<P>
Other new routes to Lusaka of Zambia, Kuwait City of Kuwait and
Tel Aviv of Israel were added to the expanding network of the EAL
during the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Bisrat said, domestic services were also enhanced by
improvements to in-flight catering and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The full introduction into service of five Foker-50 aircraft
has significantly upgraded the airlines' domestic service, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The EAL, established 52 years ago, flies to 47 international
destinations, out of which 25 are in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says No Waste Water Treatment Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has not received any
equipment needed for the treatment of industrial waste water
though it signed contracts for the purchase of such equipments
long ago, said an Iraqi oil official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Northern Refinery Company Ali Hameed
Saleh said his company signed such contracts during the fourth
phase of the oil-for-food program which expired last November.
</P>
<P>
However, these contracts have not been implemented so far though
the U.N.-Iraq program is already in its sixth phase, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is in urgent need of these equipments to treat wastes in
the oil industry and to reduce environmental pollution, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf also urged
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to intervene to
expedite the delivery of spare parts and equipments for Iraq's oil
sector, said the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program which allows Iraq to export
limited amount of oil to buy humanitarian supplies, Iraq has been
allowed to spend 300 million U.S. dollars since the fourth phase
to buy spare parts and equipments for its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
But, Iraq says it has only received 50 million dollars worth of
oil spare parts under the fourth phase and that all the contracts
signed under the fifth phase have never been carried out at all.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused representatives of the United
States and Britain in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking and
delaying the contracts it signed with foreign countries under the
oil-for-food program.

<HEADLINE> S. African Public Servants' Strike Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A massive national strike by
South African civil servants appears to be inevitable after all 12
public service labor unions Tuesday flatly rejected a new pay
offer tabled by the government.
</P>
<P>
Three unions claiming to represent almost half of the country's
1.1 million civil servants said they would go ahead with a strike
Thursday if the state failed to improve its offer.
</P>
<P>
At least two other unions -- the Public Servants Association of
South Africa and the National Union of Public Service and Allied
Workers -- said further talks would be a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
Both were already organizing industrial action for next week.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's proposal by the state was the second improvement on
its initial offer of 5.7 percent. Last week it came to the public
service central bargaining chamber with a six-percent raise for 95
percent of civil servants, and 6.5 percent for teachers.
</P>
<P>
The latest offer is a 6.3-percent rise for most employees and
6.8 percent for teachers.
</P>
<P>
The government gave no sign that it intended acceding to the
10-percent salary increase unions were demanding.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Public Service and Administration Minister Geraldine
Fraser- Moleketi called on the unions to be "more flexible".

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Installations Bombed by U.S., </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Some civilian installations in
northern Iraq were bombed by U.S. and British warplanes on
Tuesday, said an Iraqi military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:00 local time (0600 GMT), 10
formations of enemy planes coming from Turkish airspace violated
northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Erbil and Neiveva provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes made 20 sorties over the region and bombed
some civilian installations, said the spokesman, adding that Iraqi
air defense units fired back.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention if there were civilian casualties in the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Eight formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming from
Saudi bases also violated southern Iraqi airspace in the day,
added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since the Unites States and Britain launched four straight
nights of massive airstrikes against Iraq last December, their
warplanes have made more than 10,500 sorties over the southern and
northern no-fly zones in Iraq, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from any possible attacks by the Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared many times that it does not recognize these
restricted zones, saying they were imposed unilaterally by the
U.S. and Britain without authorization from the United Nations
Security Council.

<HEADLINE> ICRC: Trade Embargo Hurts Iraqi People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The trade embargo against Iraq was
worsening the living conditions of the Iraqi people, said the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The civilian population of Iraq is continuing to suffer an
alarming deterioration of its living conditions as the country
enters its 10th year under U.N. embargo," the ICRC said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen surgical gloves being washed and dried for re-use
and doctors' greens splattered with blood -- direct consequences
of the embargo," Michel Minnig, who led an ICRC delegation to
Iraq, told reporters upon returning to Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based humanitarian organization said that in the
health system buildings were not maintained and expensive imported
equipment such as X-ray machines were not replaced. In addition to
that, Iraq is suffering from its worst drought since 1932.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC has decided to step up its work in the country and is
asking for an additional 7.7 million Swiss francs (about 5.1
million U.S. dollars) to bring its budget for Iraq in 1999 to 21.7
million francs.
</P>
<P>
It said it aims to repair the buildings of 12 of the 18 main
hospitals and 18 primary health centers, to supply one main
hospital in each of the 18 regions with surgical and other
equipment and to extend and improve river intake structures in
water treatment plants.

GENEVA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- United Nations agencies appealed for
434 million U.S. dollars here Tuesday to finance humanitarian
operations in Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Undersecretary-General Sergio Vieira de Mello stressed in a
statement that the amount sought by aid agencies was a fraction of the
billions of dollars spent on military operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The joint appeal was launched by agencies including the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, U.N. Development Program, Food and
Agriculture Organization and U.N. Children's Fund, as well as the
International Organization for Migration.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said that the appeal included 290 million dollars for
Kosovo and 144 million for other parts of Yugoslavia, but it added
that new challenges had emerged in Serbia and Montenegro where 170,000
Serbs, Gypsies and other non-Albanians from Kosovo have sought refuge
after Serb forces withdrew from the province.

<HEADLINE> Syria not to Disarm Palestinian Factions: PFPL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian faction leader
denied on Tuesday that Syria has asked the Damascus-based
Palestinian factions to disarm in the light of the latest
developments in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the People's Front for Palestine
Liberation (PFPL) George Habash said he and other Palestinian
faction leaders met Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam
earlier and discussed the political situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, the Syrian side did not ask them to stop
their anti-Israel military actions, Habash noted.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian official also said last week that his country does
not seek to meddle in the affairs of the Palestinian factions
residing in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official said his country does not interfere in the
actions or decisions the factions made to serve the national
legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said Syria intends to ban the military
struggle of the Palestinian factions in the country as Syria
seemed prepared to resume negotiations with the new Israeli
government under moderate Prime Minister Ehud Barak.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Policy Toward Cyprus Issue Remains Unchanged, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing U.S. State Department
special envoy for Cyprus, Thomas Miller, stressed here Tuesday
that Washington's position toward the Cyprus problem remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Miller, who is now in Athens on
a farewell visit before taking up his new post as U.S. ambassador
to Bosnia, said that the U.S. position in favor of a bizonal,
intercommunal federation, with a single sovereignty had not
changed, and would not change.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was making every possible effort to make it useful for
the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to sit down at the negotiations
table.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
So far, no progress has been made although the two communities
in Cyprus have already held rounds of talks under the auspices of
the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Miller said that he was more optimistic today than in the past
because he had seen the "positive messages" being conveyed from
the progress of the Greek-Turkish dialogue at senior foreign
Ministry officials level that opened Monday in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official also reaffirmed the strong interest by
President Bill Clinton for a solution of the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, UNDP Sign Agreement on Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government and the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) signed here Tuesday a
nine-million- Zimbabwean dollar (236,000 U.S. dollars) agreement
to facilitate the provision of technical assistance to the Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Zimbabwe's Finance Secretary Charles
Kuwaza said the project was being funded under the third party
cost sharing modality where the Swedish government would provide
funding through the UNDP for one year.
</P>
<P>
The other funding component is from the World Bank, the UNDP
and the Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
"The Zimbabwean government set up the National Y2K Committee in
July 1998 which is chaired by the Ministry of Higher Education and
Technology Ministry," he said.
</P>
<P>
The task force had embarked on a strategy that focused on key
public sector organizations and parastatals.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, he said, had shifted from one of raising
awareness to facilitating and supervising implementation
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
UNDP acting resident representative Chinwe Dike said the state
of preparedness of some key sectors of the Zimbabwean economy was
cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of adequate year 2000 readiness by the key sectors could
nullify the good work done by those who will be ready for year
2000," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It should be acknowledged that the six months remaining is
insufficient time to rectify and test all year 2000 problems," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem arises from the failure of computer software
and hardware as well as embedded systems to read and recognize the
date beyond December 31, 1999.

The CSO said net immigration, spurred by newfound economic
success and currently running at around 23,000 people per annum,
would be chiefly responsible for population growth because the
birth rate was likely to decline.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's birth rate has fallen dramatically from four births
for every woman in 1970 to only 1.93 last year, below the 2.1
level needed for a population to replace itself.
</P>
<P>
"Better education, greater female participation in the
workforce, better contraceptive availability and possibly even
religious factors have helped cut the birth rate," Gerry O'Hanlon,
director at the CSO, was quoted as saying by a Reuters report
filed from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, Ireland is still near the top of the
European league, with Spain, Italy and Greece posting the lowest
birth rates, the CSO said. Only Iceland outstripped Ireland, with
more than two births per woman.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- People who are not registered to
vote in the United Kingdom will be banned from donating money to
political parties of the country, British Home Secretary Jack
Straw announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
All donations of more than 5,000 pounds at national level and
1,000 pounds at local level will also have to be made public, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The home secretary set out the measures in a Commons statement
presenting the draft bill the government has drawn up on political
donations.
</P>
<P>
Straw told Members of Parliament that the government was
further proposing shareholder approval for company donations.
National spending limits for elections and referendum campaigns
would also be introduced.
</P>
<P>
An independent Electoral Commission would be set up to ensure
the rules were stuck to and to educate voters and encourage people
to turn out in elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the measures would restore the public's faith in
democracy and their political representatives.
</P>
<P>
The bill follows from Labour's 1997 general election manifesto
which promised that the party would "clean up politics,
decentralize political power throughout the UK and put the funding
of political parties on a proper and accountable basis".

<HEADLINE> UK to Privatize Air Traffic Control System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The British Government has
confirmed it plans to sell off the majority of the air traffic
control system, in the Labor Government's first privatization
since coming to power.
</P>
<P>
British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said on Tuesday
that 51 percent of National Air Traffic Services would be sold to
a private sector company.
</P>
<P>
The government is to retain a 49 percent "golden share" in the
organization and air safety regulation will be run independently.
Up to 5 percent of shares for sale will be reserved for NATS
staff.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said unions and others had called for safety
operations to be run separately for many years. But the move to
private ownership has provoked a hostile reaction from union
officials who fear it could undermine air safety.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister insisted the government had listened
to these fears in the past year, saying: "Safety in the air
remains the government's overriding priority and we are committed
to ensuring that the UK's excellent safety record is maintained."
</P>
<P>
It is expected the partial privatization will bring in about
500 million pounds (800 million U.S. dollars) to the government's
coffers, a BBC report said.

ANKARA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish technical delegation
will leave here Wednesday for Iran to investigate Tehran's
allegations that the Turkish planes bombed Iranian territories on
July 18.
</P>
<P>
Turkish diplomatic sources, who asked not to be named, said
that the delegation will meet the Iranian officials on Wendesday
in Urumia of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The release of two Turkish soldiers, who are kept in custody in
Iran, will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has said that the two
soldiers crossed into the Iranian border territory by mistake.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit also accused Iran, as a replacement of Syria, of
supporting the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Iranian government has denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1984

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar Tuesday spoke highly of China's contributions to the
region's economies hit by the Asian financial crisis and said
ASEAN looks forward to a more fruitful dialogue and cooperation
with China.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate ASEAN's
appreciation to China for keeping its promise not to devalue its
currency despite the tremendous pressures and difficulties faced
by China," Syed Hamid said in an address to the ASEAN-China
Dialogue in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"This had contributed significantly to maintaining stability in
the region's currencies and assisted ASEAN in its recovery
efforts," said Syed Hamid, the current country coordinator for the
ASEAN-China Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"China had also participated in international efforts, through
the IMF, thereby also facilitating ASEAN's economic recovery," he
said, adding that China's stimulation of its economy through
massive infrastructure development programs will provide ample
opportunities for ASEAN countries to benefit from trade and
investments with China.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed concerns about China's sincerity in assisting
ASEAN as "baseless." "As we have seen, China stood by ASEAN
throughout the whole recent turbulent period."
</P>
<P>
"By its actions, China has, indeed, proved to be a real friend
of ASEAN in times of need," he told the dialogue meeting.
</P>
<P>
On ASEAN-China relations, Syed Hamid said remarkable progress
has been made in several areas in the short span of time since the
two sides formally established dialogue relations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
China's commitment to develop cooperation with ASEAN is
demonstrated in the number of projects implemented under the
Dialogue, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said trade between ASEAN and China has been growing
significantly in recent years and joint efforts should be made to
continue to find ways to expand their trade, including barter
trade.
</P>
<P>
Other areas of cooperation should also be explored, including
science and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
He invited China to participate and cooperate with ASEAN in the
implementation of the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA), which is aimed
at achieving ASEAN's Vision 2020, a long-term and broad blueprint
adopted by ASEAN leaders in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The HPA, a six-year plan, offers an excellent opportunity for
cooperation between ASEAN and China, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN remains committed to ensuring that the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF) continue to play a leading role in promoting peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region, he said, adding that ASEAN
welcomes China's unwavering support for ASEAN to be the driving
force in the ARF process and looks forward to continuing working
closely with China.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated ASEAN's "appreciation to China for being
sensitive and responsive to ASEAN's needs in times of
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the content at the ASEAN-China Dialogue
would be further intensified," he added.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations plans to
provide assistance to Tanzania's general elections in the year
2000, according to a statement released by the United Nations
Information Center here Tuesday.
</P>

reached no agreement on Tuesday on how to carry out the
U.S.-brokered Wye agreement.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Revolutionizes Identification Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A technology that would put
an end to unauthorized access to personal computers and fraud over
the Internet, was launched in Johannesburg Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The application of the sophisticated radio frequency
identification technology is a world first and is expected to
revolutionize real time resource control, according to a press
release by the developer, Automated Identification Technologies
(AIT).
</P>
<P>
The system called "Link-it Orbiter" consists of three
components: a transmitter, a receiver and software, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The transmitter is worn as an ID or an access control card,
that is small enough to slip into a shirt pocket or clip onto a
belt. At regular intervals it transmits the user's exclusive
identification code to the Orbiter receiver which keeps the
computer operational.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the user walks away from the computer, the receiver
ceases to receive the code and automatically inhibits unauthorized
access. No action, other than the re-introduction of the valid
Orbiter transmitter, will allow access to the computer.
</P>
<P>
In the event of theft, no amount of tampering will reactivate
the mechanism because the method of data encryption is randomly
changing all the time. This will ultimately remove the incentive
for theft, as the computer will be immobilized.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of the system is its cost effectiveness,
according to the news release. The basic package which consists of
the receiver, the Orbiter, two access cards and the software will
retail at under 400 rand (66 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Any non-technical person will be able to install it and it is
not dependent on any external system," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough has been greeted with much enthusiasm and
interest by major information technology companies around the
world, AIT Chairman Michael Victor was quoted by the release as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"There is a vast emerging need for the automatic electronic
identification of people and assets, and the integration of the
obtained data in a meaningful resource control information system.
The Link-it Orbiter technology is a concept that is the start of a
new era in identification. The application possibilities are
endless," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inventor of the system, Terry Ashwin, said the technology is
not limited to personal computers. There are many other
applications like access control, motor immobilization, insurance,
banking, and correctional service industries.
</P>
<P>
"This technology is going to have a huge impact on the
prevention of fraud on the Internet," Ashwin said.
</P>
<P>
AIT has already opened a distribution office in Britain and is
about to open another office in Silicon Valley in California,
United States.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Fail to Agree on Who Signs Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The rebel factions of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), after a six-day meeting in
Tanzanian capital, have failed to reach an agreement on who should
sign the accord to end the 11- month war.
</P>
<P>
Emile Ilunga, chairman of the main rebel group -- the Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD), is still at loggerhead with Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba over who is the legitimate leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
The third rebel leader, Jean-Pierre Bemba of the Congolese
Liberation Movement (MLC) who occupies several northern towns, is
represented at the meeting by his Foreign Affairs Advisor, Kunka
Dominic.
</P>
<P>
The rebel factions met Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa at
the State House Tuesday morning before ending their talks.
</P>
<P>
Six African governments involved in the war signed a cease-fire
pact on July 10 in Zambian capital Lusaka. However, rebels refused
to sign following a leadership wrangle within their ranks.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian invited the rebels to hold a meeting to iron out their
 differences. The closed-door meeting was held in the White Sands
Hotel, some 15 kilometers north of the city center, a venue which
was apparently chosen to escape public attention.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga told reporters at his room in the hotel in the afternoon
before returning home that dia Wamba, who was deposed as the
leader of RCD, has no support from soldiers of the party.
</P>
<P>
"Wamba has no authority over our troops," Ilunga said, adding
that the soldiers have disowned dia Wamba and will no longer
follow the man's orders.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga said Wamba is lying to people that he still commands
RCD soldiers. "He is guarded by Ugandan troops," said Ilunga, who
is supported by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga, based in Goma in eastern Congo (K), said he would
express his appreciation to the Tanzanian government and Mkapa to
give them opportunities to explain the situation in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Wamba, who represents a RCD faction in Kisangani in northern
Congo, refused to meet reporters Tuesday, saying he felt
physically tired.
</P>
<P>
Sources said MLC maintains that it won't sign unless all rebel
groups sign.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian foreign minister Jakaya Kikwete, who chaired the
meeting, told Xinhua at the hotel that more talks will be held for
rebels but he declined to name the time and place.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is postponed," Kikwete said, adding that he will
brief the press Wednesday about the talks at his office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda have reportedly
assisted Kikwete during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Since the war broke out in Congo last August, Rwanda and Uganda
had been supporting rebels while Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia had
backed President Laurent Kabila's government.

WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) announced on Tuesday the completion of the midterm review of
the third annual arrangement under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) for Tanzania, and the approval of the
disbursement of 39 million U.S. dollars under the program.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth and last drawing, which brings the total
borrowed under the three-year ESAF arrangement to about 241.6
million dollars, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting eligible
members that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and to improve their growth
prospects. ESAF loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year
and are payable over 10 years with a five- and a half-year grace
period.

<P>
"Directors commended the authorities for their continued strong
macroeconomic policy implementation... appropriately tight fiscal
and monetary polices had allowed the inflation rate to decline to
the single digits for the first time in tow decades," IMF Deputy
Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sugisaki urged the government of Tanzania to make
further efforts in implementing structural reforms, especially in
privatization and banking sector reform.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Chief in Custody for Crop Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Lord Melchett, executive director
of the Greenpeace environmental activist group, was refused bail
Tuesday on charges connected with the destruction of
genetically modified (GM) crops.
</P>
<P>
Melchett, 51, was one of 28 people held at Lyng in Norfolk,
eastern England. The local magistrates court remanded him in
custody. The activists were charged with the destruction of half a
crop of GM maize during a dawn raid Monday, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
It was the third of seven farm-scale GM experimental sites to
be damaged or destroyed in the past eight weeks as campaigners
step up efforts to end controversial government trials, Reuters
said.
</P>
<P>
"The British public have made it very clear that they do not
want these GM farm-scale plans to go ahead. It is vital that the
crop is removed before it flowers, spreading GM pollution,"
Melchett, who is an organic farmer, was quoted as saying, accusing
the British government of being out of touch with a sceptical
public.
</P>
<P>
The crop was part of a government trial of GM crops, which have
met widespread opposition in Britain. Protests, crop damage and
rallies have grown commonplace as opposition mounts to what some
popular newspapers have called "Frankenstein foods."
</P>
<P>
Locals in Lyng had urged the government to destroy the maize,
fearing it would contaminate neighboring crops. Supporters of such
trials say they are vital to ascertain both the risks and benefits
of the fledgling science.
</P>
<P>
But the Labor government says the tide of protests could force
it to restrict information about the GM sites.

WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan are
discussing developing technologies for theater missile defense
system, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is an ongoing discussion between Japan and the United
States," Rear Admiral Craig Quigley said at a briefing.

"What we are actively discussing with the Japanese government

Quigley told reporters.

The newsletter Defense Week in its July 26 issue said that a
U.S.-Japan agreement could be announced next month to cooperatively
develop a new ship-launched missile-defense interceptor.

"What we are not discussing is the actual development or
testing or deployment of any system with the Japanese," Quigley
said.
</P>
<P>
"But there are a variety of ... technical disciplines that
would contribute to technologies that would be helpful in that
regard, and that's what we are still working very closely with
the Japanese on," he said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Ruling Party Loses Three Atlantic Provinces in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada's ruling Liberal Party has
lost three of its four Atlantic provinces with the closure of
elections in Nova Scotia province Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Country doctor John Hamm led his Progressive Conservative Party
to a victory of 29 seats out of the total 52 to form a majority
government in the Atlantic coast province.
</P>
<P>
The victory brings him abreast with Conservative premiers Pat
Binns of Prince Edward Island province and Bernard Lord of New
Brunswick province.
</P>
<P>
Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin now stands as the only
surviving Liberal premier in the Atlantic Canada region. Local
reports say even his majority took a hefty hit at the polls
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
What is behind the Liberal fall in Atlantic Canada tends to be
quite economic, according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail newspaper, in a news analysis, said
Wednesday that Ottawa's decision to reduce federal transfer
payments for health, education and social programs had tarnished
the image of the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
To compound the problem, the assistance packages for thousands
of fishermen put out of work by the collapse of cod stocks were
cut off a year ahead of schedule, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The analysis described Liberal Premier of Nova Scotia Russell
MacLellan as "ineffective" to secure good pensions and severance
packages for more than 1,500 miners, when federal Natural
Resources Minister Ralph Goodale announced the impending closing
and sale of the Cape Breton Development mines.
</P>
<P>
The Nova Scotia election was called last month after the
Liberal premier failed to have his health budget accepted by the
opposition Progressive Conservative Party and the New Democratic
Party.

<HEADLINE> France Rejects European Court Verdict on Police Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- France rejected on Wednesday a
verdict by the European Court on Human Rights, which condemned
France for violating human rights when five French policemen beat
up a drug trafficker in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The judgment of the European Court on Human Rights does not
impose on the French judge who remains the master of his decisions,
" said the French Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The European Court on Human Rights ordered on Wednesday the
French government to pay 500,000 francs (83,000 U.S. dollars) in
fines to a drug trafficker, who sued France for what he called "
torture" inflicted on him by French police.
</P>
<P>
The court said that the physical and mental damages done to the
drug trafficker make up an action of torture.
</P>
<P>
The five policemen involved in the case were condemned to
prison by a court in March 1999, but the verdict was half
overthrown by an appeal court which released four of them.
</P>
<P>
France's General Prosecutor has directed the country's supreme
court, the Cour de Cassation, to make a final decision expected
later this year.

BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A ten-part program titled "Let
Life Be Eternal" will be on shown on China Central Television
Station beginning August 2 to popularize ecological and life
sciences and the fight against superstition and pseudo-science, a
science official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xinshi, deputy director of the China National Natural
Science Foundation, said the mass media shoulder the great
responsibility of popularizing science among the people, and that
TV programs and films should deal with matters other than the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"Only by popularizing science can we defeat superstition and
pseudo-science," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi Ji, a program planner, said that the new TV series will
demonstrate, with abundant facts and full and accurate data, that
many scientists have experienced difficult struggles in the course
of their research into ways of maintaining human development while
at the same time protecting bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
"The formation of scientific theories is a rather arduous
process, not at all subjective guesses like Falun Gong. Therefore,
what scientists have done is respectable, while pseudo-science is
shameful and totally absurd," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Host More Talks for DRC Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Foreign Minister
Jakaya Kikwete said Wednesday that talks for rebels in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will continue to be conducted
here next week.
</P>
<P>
The talks aim to decide on who should sign on the Lusaka peace
agreement to end the 11-month conflicts in the DRC, Kikwete told a
news briefing in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of countries to attend the talks "could be
the same, could be more," hinting that other stakeholders in the
DRC war may also get involved in next week's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Rebel factions, invited by the Tanzanian government, held a
meeting during July 24-27 at the White Sands Hotel in the northern
outskirts of the city, but failed to reach an agreement on who
should sign the Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, described by a foreign ministry statement as to
have been held in a transparent manner, was chaired by Kikwete and
also attended by senior government officials from Uganda, Rwanda
and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Six African governments involved in the DRC war signed a
cease-fire pact on July 10 in Zambian capital Lusaka. However,
rebels refused to sign following a leadership wrangle within their
ranks.
</P>
<P>
The arch rivals, Emile Ilunga, who holds military power of the
main rebel group Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba, the founder of the RCD who was deposed as leader of the
party, have attended the meeting in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The third rebel faction, Congolese Liberation Movement under
Jean-Pierre Bemba, sent a spokesman named Dominique Kanku to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Although the factions failed to reach any agreement, Kikwete
said there is progress in resolving their differences as "they
speak very frankly and allow the talks to continue."
</P>
<P>
The minister said during the past days the rebels met Tanzanian
 President Benjamin Mkapa twice, before and after the talks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders for Manufactured Goods Rise Just </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
increased 64 million dollars in June to a seasonally adjusted
196.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
June's increase was just 0.3 percent, less than what the
government and analysts previously estimated. It followed a 0.8
percent gain in May and a drop of 2.4 percent in orders in April.
Last month's performance marked the sixth increase in the last
eight months.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment rose a sizable 2.7 percent
in June, led by an increase in demand for autos and car parts.
U.S. automakers are enjoying a good year of sales, hovering near
record levels.
</P>
<P>
June's rise in orders for transportation products followed a
strong 9 percent increase in May, slightly less than the
government initially estimated, and a sharp 12.5 percent decline
in April.
</P>
<P>
The transportation sector is often volatile from month to month
because it includes such big ticket purchases as airplanes.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Gasoline prices have jumped sharply in recent
weeks spurred by higher crude oil prices and increased demand
caused by recovering world economies.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the strength in transportation, overall orders for
durable goods would have fallen 0.4 percent in June, the fourth
decrease in the last sixth months.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, however,
rose a solid 2.1 percent in June, following a 0.8 percent decline
in May and a 0.3 percent advance in April.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturers have been battered by world financial
crisis, which has cut sharply into their overseas sales, and also
opened them up to stiffer competition from cheaper imports.
</P>
<P>
One of the U.S. industries that has suffered the most from the
global turmoil has been steel. June's report showed that the
industry is recovering slowly from the global crisis and may be
still feeling its lingering effects.
</P>
<P>
Primary metals, the category that includes steel, saw orders
pretty much hold steady in June, following a percent 0.5 percent
gain in May and 1.6 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for industrial machinery, the category which
includes computers fell a sharp 5.4 percent in June, the second
monthly decline in a row. In May, orders dropped 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of current
demand, also increased 0.9 percent in June.

<HEADLINE> No Severe Danger on Yangtze River Dykes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Though the water level at the
Jiujiang section of the Yangtze River has remained above the
warning line since June 30, there have been no reports thus far of
severe danger on the dykes thanks to local government's round-the-
clock flood-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
An official with east China's Jiangxi provincial flood-control
headquarters said the highest water level at Jiujiang reached 22.
43 meters, only 0.6 meter below last summer's record high.
</P>
<P>
Many danger spots along the river levee are now under control
after emergency solutions were provided by engineering technicians
and repair staff, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the province invested 700 million yuan to
rebuild or repair the river dykes to upgrade their ability to
fight flooding.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the flood season this year in mid-July,
the province has sent thousands of officials to keep 24-hour
watches on the dykes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Now, the water level at the Jiujiang section has fallen to 22.
08 meters, and will continue to fall in coming days, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports say a new flood peak passed Jinjiang in
central China's Hubei Province at 2:00 AM yesterday, with the flux
reaching 44,300 cu m per second, 14,000 cu m less than the
previous crest.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Jinjiang continued to fall for six hours
after the peak passed. A local flood-control official said that
this flood peak was not strong, and most of the flood water has
been absorbed into Dongting Lake and the river's major streams.
</P>
<P>
The new crest will not be dangerous, but will bring a longer
period of heavy flow at the Yangtze's lower and middle reaches,
the official said.

<HEADLINE> China Opening up Commercial Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China is further opening up its
commercial sector to provide a better investment environment for
overseas investors who expect to garner a slice of the huge pie.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities recently approved another joint project
by China Normart Enterprise Corporation and U.S. COSTCO to set up
a chain store in Beijing, and a dozen other projects are set to be
approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
China has opened more cities to overseas investors for joint
commercial businesses, with new regulations from the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) and the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
The Regulations On Overseas Investment in Commercial Business
For Trial Implementation allows overseas investors to establish
joint retail sales outlets in the capitals of all provinces,
autonomous regions, and a number of designated cities on the
Chinese mainland. Previously, this activity was confined to eleven
coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale business has been opened to overseas investors as
well, but is still restricted to the cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Retail and wholesale giants like the U.S. Wal-Mart and Germany'
s Metro have shown great enthusiasm in applying for new projects
since the introduction of these new regulations last month.
</P>
<P>
Ye Hui, director of SETC's overseas fund management department,
says that China has made these new commitments in full
consideration of the country's domestic situation, however "the
expansion of overseas involvement in retail and wholesale
businesses does not mean full-blown opening of the sector."
</P>
<P>
"China's attitude toward opening up has always been consistent,
but China will push the drive according to its own timetable," he
adds.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Sampras Cruise into Second Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- American rivals Andre Agassi
and Pete Sampras, who squared off earlier this month in the
Wimbledon final, faced little opposition from young countrymen
late Tuesday night and advanced to the second round of the $325,
000 Mercedes-Benz Cup hardcourt tennis event in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the top seed and defending champion, swept past 22-year-
old Jan-Michael Gambill, 6-2, 6-2. Sampras, who overcame Agassi to
claim his sixth Wimbledon title, needed only 54 minutes to
dispatch 17-year-old wild card Phillip King from nearby Long Beach,
6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The reigning French Open champion, Agassi became the No. 1
player in the world three weeks ago when he reached the final at
the All-England Club. However, he lost the top ranking this week
to Australia's Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, the second seed and 1991 champion, can reclaim the top
spot this week if he reaches the final. If he does, he would break
the record for total number of weeks at No. 1, passing Ivan Lendl
with 271 weeks.
</P>
<P>
France's Guillaume Raoux provided the day's biggest upset as he
eliminated third seed Tim Henman of Britain, last year's runner-up,
6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Raoux, a semifinalist here the last two years,
posted his first win in five meetings with Henman and avenged his
loss to the Briton here last year.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Lleyton Hewitt of Australia beat American Alex O'
Brien for the second time in two weeks, 6-3, 6-2. Hewitt beat O'
Brien 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Also, eighth seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa got past
American Geoff Grant, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2), and sixth seed Goran
Ivanisevic of Croatia swept past Max Mirnyi of Belarus, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In unseeded play, Sweden's Magnus Larsson crushed lucky loser
Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand, 6-2, 6-1; Australia's Andrew Ilie
topped Byron Black of Zimbabwe, 6-4, 7-6 (10-8); and Germany's
Axel Pretzsch beat Canada's Daniel Nestor, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Release 200 Opposition Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Wednesday released 200 opposition prisoners in a surprise move
coinciding with its major offensive against the forces of the
rival Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Taliban supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar ordered the release
in a special decree issued in Kandahar, headquarters of the
militia in southern Afghanistan, a Taliban diplomat here told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners have been handed over to the International
Committee of Red Cross which will make arrangements to transport
them back to their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
The "unilateral" release was ordered by Omar "out of sympathy
as they are fellow Afghans," said the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were captured in previous battles between the
Taliban and the anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner release came at a time when the Taliban launched
the long-waited summer offensive on the opposition alliance early
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the failure of peace talks last week in Tashkent,
Uzbekistan, the Taliban's offensive is believed to be aimed at
extending their control across the entire country.

<P>
The regulations also clearly outline the qualifications for
overseas applicants, their share-holding ratio, and specific
authorization procedures. This is regarded as the most specific
and comprehensive regulations regarding overseas investment in
commercial enterprises yet announced.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hai, an economist with the State Administration of
Internal Trade, points out that the entry of overseas businesses
will not seriously affect China's domestic commercial businesses.
</P>
<P>
China has only 21 state-approved joint retail enterprises, and
another 277 joint retail companies are authorized by local
governments. Their total sales volume remains below two percent of
all retail sales nationwide, he explains.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts believe that it is inevitable and necessary to
further open up the commercial sector. China has adopted a gradual
opening of its commercial areas so far.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the inflow of overseas capital can resolve the
financing problem of most domestic retailers, and on the other
hand, overseas investors will bring modern marketing patterns to
China, which will greatly benefit domestic enterprises, and also
mitigate the downward trend in China's utilization of overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
China has been considered one of the world's largest markets,
with huge potential. Official statistics show that total retail
sales nationwide hit 1.48 trillion yuan in the first half this
year, up 6.4 percent from the same period last year.

ISLAMABAD, July 28 (Xinhua) -- At least two persons were killed
and one other injured Wednesday in the latest rocket attack on the
Afghan capital city of Kabul by the anti-Taliban northern alliance
forces.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen rockets launched from positions of the troops loyal to
former defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood exploded in Kabul
Wednesday, sources from the Afghan capital told Xinhua.

The opposition forces have been rocketing Kabul during the past
week. Eight people were killed and 10 others wounded in a rocket
attack on July 24.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Wednesday condemned, in a statement issued
here, the northern alliance for rocketing the Kabul airport
Tuesday which narrowly missed a U.N. plane and two other planes.
</P>
<P>
The rocketing on the airport has disrupted the U.N.
humanitarian operations in Afghanistan which will not be resumed

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police helped taxation
administrations retrieve potential losses amounting to 600 million
yuan (72.3 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) attributed this success
to the intensified crackdown on tax-related crimes such as invoice
forgery, which began this year.
</P>
<P>
MPS sources said here today that more than 2,700 cases,
involving a total of 6.6 billion yuan (795.3 million dollars),
have been investigation and nearly 2,400 suspects arrested during
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has established a special center to deal with tips
concerning economic crimes provided by units and individuals, in
an effort to broaden investigation channels and scope. Half the
cases uncovered in the first half were the result of tips of this
kind.
</P>
<P>
Police and the administrations of taxation, customs, and
foreign exchange at all levels have joined hands in fighting tax-
related crimes. Nearly 40 percent of all cases under investigation
have taken advantage of sources and tips provided by relevant
administrations during the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
The MPS is now consulting with the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, the Supreme People's Court, and the State
Administration of Taxation on drafting relevant laws and
regulations to set up a practical judicial system.

<HEADLINE> China Plans To Abolish Plastic Fast-Food Containers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Newly developed degradable
packages, developed by the Institute of Chemistry under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, will replace plastic fast-food
containers in the future, said several experts at a news
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The new product will solve the problem of pollution by using
amylum plant fiber and rice husk as raw materials.
</P>
<P>
So-called "white pollution" can be seen all around the world
due to the widespread use of plastic food containers, and more
than 100 countries and regions have now prohibited their use.
Several cities in China including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan,
Hangzhou, and Fuzhou, have carried out the ban as well.
</P>
<P>
The two main substitutes in China now are degradable plastic
and paper containers. However, the first of these also causes
pollution in the process of degrading, and in the second instance,
waste water created during the production of paper pulp also is a
source of pollution.
</P>
<P>
The institute has now set up a production base in east China's
Zhejiang Province with an annual output estimated at over 1.9
billion boxes from 32 processing lines.
</P>
<P>
Related statistics show that the consumption of fast-food
containers in China reached some 10 billion in 1994, with a daily
use of 1.8 million in railway stations alone. The total figure is
expected to exceed 18 billion next year.

BUCHAREST, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Romania is likely to have its
own software technology by the year 2000, said Alexandru Borcea,
chief of the Romanian Association for Electronics and Software.
</P>
<P>
The association forwarded the Romanian government a letter
expressing willingness to build up the software technology, a
prerequisite for one billion U.S. dollars revenues in export,
Alexandru Borcea was quoted on Wednesday by the local Ziarul

</P>
<P>
According to the letter, the investment in a site expected to
sprawl 20,000 square meters would claim a total of 10 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government will come up with legislation and organizational
measures relative to this enterprise, based upon a study designed
by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Estimations made by the French magazine OI Informatique showed
that by the end of 1996 there were 25,000 computer graduates in
Romania, 109 per 10,000 people. Many Romanian computermen went
abroad to work for foreign companies and all of them scored high.
Their possible exodus to western labor market can not be stopped
but by a policy based on an economic reform, in which they could
be more often demanded, local analysts said.

aspiration of all people across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
He said that though the Taiwan authorities pose serious
interference, cross-Straits scientific and technological exchanges
are witnessing marked development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that by the end of last year, over 2,000
cross-Straits cooperation and exchange projects had been arranged,
and over 8,000 scientists and technicians had paid visits to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that greater numbers of Taiwanese
scientists and researchers have visited mainland areas over the
past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Hui said exchange and cooperation covered nearly all basic
research fields, including applied sciences and high-tech
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Hui said he believes that Lee's separatist remarks will be
firmly opposed by all scientist across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
A number of academicians with the Chinese Academy of Sciences
and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and professors from
Beijing and Qinghua universities lashed out at Lee Teng-hui's
separatist remarks at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants at the meeting have visited Taiwan and
were welcomed by their colleagues. They said Lee's remarks destroy
the foundation for steady development of cross-Straits relations,
damage the peaceful environment of the exchanges, and that the
remarks will surely be disagreed with by Taiwan compatriots,
including scientists.
</P>
<P>
They said they will make every possible effort to attain for
achievements in their own work, and contribute to reunification.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Founder's World-Outlook Fallacies Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The fallacies of the world
outlook preached by Li Hongzhi, founder of the outlawed Falun Gong,
can't hide his nature of ignorance and superstition, despite being
spread under the guise of supreme science.
</P>
<P>
So said a commentary in the seventh special issue of "Qiushi" (
Seeking Truth), a magazine of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Li disseminates his world outlook by piling up many modern
phases on astronomy, when actually he knows nothing about
astronomy, the article said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he used the term "light year," a distance
measurement unit in astronomy, as a time measurement unit,
confused nuclear fusion with nuclear fission, and blindly assumed
that the surface temperature on Mars (whose Chinese name literally
means "planet of fire") is much higher than that on Earth.
</P>
<P>
By taking advantage of people's desire to live longer and their
health concerns, Li created a mystical and horrible atmosphere in
an attempt to erode the minds of his followers, disturb public
order, and sabotage social stability, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article called on people to keep a sober political mind and
not be duped by Li's malicious fallacies. Though there exists a
wicked, superstitious, and decadent trend of thought in the world,
justice, scientific and progressive forces will finally win. The
future of the world belongs to those who hold up scientific truth,
the article noted.

<HEADLINE> EU Recovers Spending on Agriculture Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday it is recovering 232.1 million euro (243.7 million U.S.
dollars) from its spending in agricultural programs.
</P>
<P>
The money comes from two rejections the commission made, one
against a 148.6-million-euro expenditure on the European Union
Common Agricultural Policy in 1995 and the other against an 83.5-
million-euro expenditure declared later on for the same program.
</P>
<P>
Together with the money clawed back from earlier expenditures,
the commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, will
have recovered a total of 725.1 million euro from the EU member
states by this year.
</P>
<P>
The commission reviews each year expenditures on the Common
Agricultural Policy and decides whether some money already spent
by member states should be rejected and recovered.
</P>
<P>
The rejection is helped with the checks by the European Court
of Auditors that reports each year its findings of rates of error,
irregularity and fraud found in the EU budget managed by the
member states.
</P>
<P>
The European Union introduced the rejection system in 1993 to
improve an integrated control system.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) announced Wednesday that its total assets rose by 4.3
percent in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Exchange Fund as at the end of June 1999, total assets of the
Exchange Fund, comprising the accounts of the Exchange Fund and
its subsidiary companies, rose by 4.3 percent from 921.4 billion
HK dollars (118.1 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of December
1998 to 961.1 billion HK dollars (123.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
After deducting interest payable to the fiscal reserves, the
accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund increased by 10.1 percent
from 242.3 billion HK dollars (31.1 billion U.S. dollars) at the
end of December 1998 to 266.8 billion HK dollars (34.2 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of June 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The investment environment for the second half of 1999 remains
difficult. As the outlook on U.S. interest rates is uncertain,
volatility in global markets and exchange rates may stay high,"
said Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
"The HKMA will continue its prudent management of the Exchange
Fund to seek a steady return in a risk-controlled manner in
accordance with the guidelines set by the Exchange Fund Advisory
Committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA also published Wednesday figures released on a monthly
basis in the Exchange Fund Abridged Balance Sheet and Currency
Board Account for end of June.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, total assets of the Exchange Fund
increased by 25.4 billion HK dollars (3.3 billion U.S. dollars) in
the month of June to 952.9 billion HK dollars (122.2 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both foreign currency assets and Hong Kong dollar assets
increased, by 4.7 billion HK dollars (0.6 billion U.S. dollars)
and 20.7 billion HK dollars (2.7 billion U.S. dollars)
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Stop splitting China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, China's flagship
newspaper, will publish a commentary tomorrow criticizing Lee Teng-
hui for his "two states" statement.
</P>
<P>
The article says that Lee has gone too far along the road of
splitting the motherland. People of insight in Taiwan should have
a clear mind on the cross-Straits situation, and the article urges
them to join the mainland in stoutly interdicting the risky moves
of Lee and his followers.
</P>
<P>
Lee, fearing that cross-Straits relations will grow in a way
conducive to the reunification of the motherland, never fails to
put sand in the wheels whenever cross-Straits relations tend
toward relaxation and development, says the article.
</P>
<P>
On July 9, Lee redefined cross-Straits relations as "state-to-
state or at least special state-to-state relations" while being
interviewed by a radio station in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The article says that Lee's open remarks have totally unmasked
his scheme to separate the motherland, and his erroneous judgment
of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Lee was taking a political risk by jeopardizing the security
and happiness of the 21 million people living in Taiwan, using
foreign anti-China forces as the stepping stone.
</P>
<P>
By doing this, Lee has stigmatized the entire Chinese people,
including Taiwan compatriots, as enemies, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
China's reunification is the goal and historical mission toward
which the Chinese people have been struggling for more than a
century, and any provocation against it is doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
The article points out that Lee's "two-state" remark, an
attempt to split Taiwan from China's sovereignty and territory,
completely denies the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
"Cross-Straits relations would deteriorate if this attempt
prevailed," said the article, "peace across the Straits would no
longer exist, and China's approach to peaceful reunification would
finally be ruined."
</P>
<P>
Taiwan compatriots would be the victims suffering most if Lee

<HEADLINE> Li Hongzhi's Mother's Midwife Says Li Is A Swindler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JILIN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Pan Yufang, who was the midwife at
the birth of Li Hongzhi, the founder of the Falun Dafa, said that
Li has fabricated his birthday and background.
</P>
<P>
"Li was born on July 7,1952, not May 13, 1951 as he later told
his followers," said Pan, 80, who enjoys good health.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have shown that Li changed his date of birth to
coincide with the birthday of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism,
in an effort to deify himself.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, Pan was a midwife at the Shoushan Hospital
in Gongzhuling Town of Huaide County, Jilin Province, hometown of
Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Pan was an acquaintance of Li's family, and she recalled that
in the summer of 1952 she was invited to Li's home to deliver the
child. The mother needed an injection of oxytocic administered by
Pam to help deliver the baby.
</P>
<P>
According to Pan, Li's birth was normal.
</P>
<P>
Pan became a midwife when she was 21. "It would be harmful for
the Falun Gong practitioners to refuse medical treatment," she
said. "Without my help, Li and his mother would have been in
danger 47 years ago."

<HEADLINE> HK AmCham Welcomes U.S. Congress' NTR Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The American Chamber of Commerce
in Hong Kong (AmCham) commended Wednesday the United States House
of Representatives for voting in support of the renewal of the
Normal Trade Relations (NTR) for China.
</P>
<P>
AmCham noted that in spite of the recent setbacks to U.S.-China
relations, this year's 260-170 vote was only marginally lower than
last year's 264-166. The vote also signified that 60 percent of
members of the U.S. congress supported NTR renewal for China.
</P>
<P>
The House vote rejected a measure that would have overturned
President Bill Clinton's June 4 decision to extend NTR status for
China for another year.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the outcome," AmCham Chairman Jason
Felton said. "This strong bipartisan House vote for NTR will
hopefully set the stage for a resumption of WTO negotiations, and
pave the way for Congress to pass legislation granting Permanent
NTR for China once a commercially viable WTO agreement is reached.
"
</P>
<P>
"Despite the posturing each year, U.S. lawmakers ultimately
realize that healthy U.S.-China trade relations are in the best
interests of both countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The vote also bodes well for Hong Kong as a stable bilateral
relationship is critical for the economic well-being and recovery
of the HKSAR (Special Administrative Region)," he said.

<HEADLINE> Plane With 8 On Board Crashes in Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A twin-engine plane with eight
persons on board crashed Wednesday just minutes after it took off
in the northern Philippines, the Philippine News Agency (PNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The plane, belonging to Lepanto Mining Corporation, left Poro
Point, La Union Province, at 8:45 a.m. Wednesday on its way to
Mankayan, Benguet Province, a good 15-minute flight.
</P>
<P>
But the aircraft failed to land at its destination, prompting
the Philippine Air Force (PAF) to conduct a search and rescue
operation, but two PAF helicopters were prevented from sustained
flying due to thick clouds in the area.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Oban, PAF spokesman, said the rescue authority in
Benguet received a call at 3:15 p.m. from the Philippine National
Police (PNP) provincial office, which said a wreckage believed to
be that of the missing plane was sighted in a mountain.
</P>
<P>
PAF chief Willie Florendo said the two choppers will proceed to
the area first hour Thursday where the plane's wreckage was
sighted.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated plane was on a mission to survey over a school in
Mankayan to locate a site where a pupil was reportedly buried in a
landslide over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The eight on board include two pilots, an Australian engineer
and a mine consultants.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Sign Deal on Joint Rocket Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Khrunichev Space Center
and the U.S. Lockheed Martin company on Wednesday signed an
agreement to jointly develop a family of Angara carrier rockets.
</P>
<P>
The Angara family will include light, medium and heavy rockets
to meet every possible need in launching spacecraft of various
weights to various orbits, said Anatoly Kiselyov, director general
of the center.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Russia does not have light or medium
rockets because the manufacture of Kosmos and Tsiklon rockets has
been discontinued, the Interfax news agency quoted Kiselyov as
saying at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Proton, the heavy Angara will rely on fuel made of
ecologically safe material rather than on heptyl.
</P>
<P>
The recent crash of a Proton rocket in Kazakhstan gave rise to
fears of soil poisoning from heptyl and tension between Astana and
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Angara will launch spacecraft weighing up to eight tons
from equatorial launching sites into geostationary orbit. In
Russia Angara rockets will be launched from the Plesetsk
cosmodrome in the north.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Interested in START III Consultations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Russian Defense
Ministry official said Wednesday that his ministry is ready to
begin consultations on the START III strategic arms reduction
treaty "if an appropriate political decision is taken."
</P>
<P>
The unidentified official was commenting on reports that
during Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin's visit to the United
States both sides agreed to begin talks on the issue as early as
August, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is undoubtedly interested in signing the START III
treaty under which the number of nuclear warheads held by the two
sides is to be reduced to 2,000 - 2,500," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in this document because at a minimum it
will considerably cut down the U.S. nuclear potential," he said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Russia, given its economic circumstances,
has problems in maintaining a large nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
The official said the START II treaty, which calls for the
reduction of the two sides' nuclear warheads to 3,000-3,500 each,
should be ratified as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, Russian's lower house of parliament, has so
far refused to endorse the treaty in the aftermath of Washington's
military actions against Iraq and Yugoslavia and other sores in
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"For all its flaws, START II will benefit Russia, while START
III will finally equalize Russian and American strategic offensive
weapons arsenals," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding reports on the possible creation of a U.S.-Russian
joint "global" missile defense system, he said that it is
extremely difficult to create such a system.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, one might combine the scientific potentials of all
states. But it is practically impossible to integrate missile
defense systems into one network, given all the political and
technical nuances," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Roman Popkovich, who heads the State
Duma's Defense Committee, said Wednesday that the lower house of
parliament might ratify START II as early as October.
</P>
<P>
"But deputies will do so only under certain conditions. The
foreign-policy context must be favorable for taking such a
decision," Interfax quoted Popkovich as saying.

<P>
TOKYO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
met with visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen Wednesday
for talks on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
In their 30-minute meeting at the Japanese prime minister's
official residence, Obuchi and Cohen reaffirmed that Japan and the
United States will work together with South Korea to prevent the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) from test-firing a
ballistic missile, Kyodo News reported, quoting government
official.
</P>
<P>
On other issues, Cohen voiced the hope for progress on problems
related to U.S. military bases in Japan, including the relocation
of the Futemma Air Station in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was quoted as telling Cohen that the Japanese government
is working with the Okinawa government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo and Washington agreed in 1996 on the return of the
Futemma base in five to seven years provided that a replacement is
built in Okinawa to take over the base's heliport functions.

After his meeting with Obuchi, Cohen concluded his three-day
visit to Japan.

<HEADLINE> China Real Estate Market Losing Steam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The growth of China's real estate
market is decelerating as vacancies grow and sales decline.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) predicted today that
this downward trend will dominate the real estate market for the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
In a NBS report released today, the real estate index, which is
an indicator of the industry's health, dropped by 1.57 points from
May to 102.21 points in June, 0.73 points lower than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in the past 16 months that the index
dropped below the level of one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The NBS report shows that excess housing reached 68.86 million
square meters by the end of June, increasing 22.6 percent over one
year ago. The growth rate of excess was 5.1 percentage points
higher than in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
China sold 29 million square meters of housing over the past
six months, with the half-year growth rate of sales dropping by 9.
5 percentage points over the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Since a large quantity of lower-priced housing for low-income
people entered the market over the past six months, the average
housing price has dropped to around 2,000 yuan per square meter.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concerned Over Rocket Attack on Kabul: Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Wednesday
said it is extremely concerned over the disruption of humanitarian
activities by the rocket attack on the Kabul airport on Tuesday by
the anti-Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the U.N. Coordinator for Afghanistan
on behalf of U.N. assistance agencies operating in Afghanistan
said the rocket attack forced a U.N. plane, which was about to
land, as well as an aircraft of the International Committee of Red
Cross to turn back.
</P>
<P>
Three rockets launched from the anti-Taliban alliance's
positions north of Kabul hit the airport and its surrounding areas
during the agreed window for takeoff and landing of humanitarian
flights on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rocketing of the airport and military activity at the time of
agreed flights put the security of staff members and the
continuation of U.N. activities in jeopardy, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has expressed its concern and requested
clarification from the Northern Alliance in this regard, it said.
</P>
<P>
The international body has suspended its next flights to Kabul
pending the reconfirmation of the agreed security guarantee, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
At the recent "Six plus Two" meeting attended by Afghanistan's
six immediate neighbors plus the United States and Russia in
Tashkent, Uzbekistan, the two warring Afghan parties agreed to
respect the impartiality of the United Nations.

CANBERRA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's aviation system will
operate safely through the transition to the year 2000 (Y2k), a
senior official of the country's Civil Aviation Safety Authority
(CASA) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CASA Assistant Director Mike Smith said that while there is a
high degree of dependence on information technology at the
passenger carrying end of the aviation industry, most equipment
related to the safety of flight is not date dependent.
</P>
<P>
"If I was to summarize the state of readiness of the industry,
I would have to say that we have moved from fear of litigation to
confidence," Smith told a forum on the Y2K industry infrastructure
program in Melbourne, Victoria state.
</P>
<P>
Smith said Australia's major airlines had so far spent over 200
million Australian dollars (132 million U.S. dollars) on their Y2K
programs.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the work has been done, and they are on
track for certification as Y2K compliant by September 30," he
said.
</P>
<P>
CASA is also closely monitoring foreign operators and is
confident that Australian airports would achieve readiness, he

<P>
HAIKOU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest special economic
zone and the southernmost island province of Hainan reported an 8.
1 percent year-on-year increase in GDP growth in the first half of
this year, reaching 21.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
This was attributed to a continuous recovery from a slump in
economy in 1995, which was triggered mainly by a spree of real
estate development, according to local government officials.
</P>
<P>
Hainan as a tropical province has readjusted its development
strategy by making full use of its fine ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
It has been upgrading the good strains of grain that are high
yielding on 290,000 hectares of farmland. It also has 42,000
hectares for oil-bearing crops and 75,000 hectares for sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
As an important vegetable supplier for other inland provinces
in winter, Hainan boasts 95,000 hectares of vegetable fields and
can expect some 1.9 million tons of vegetables this winter.
</P>
<P>
Some 4.3 million tourists visited the island in the first half
of the year, 6.8 percent more than the figure for the same 1998
period.
</P>
<P>
The province also recorded 2.7 billion yuan in industrial added
value.
</P>
<P>
Hainan finished 4.5 billion yuan of fixed asset investment in
the first six months, up 1.3 percent. The province has raised 19
billion yuan for big infrastructure projects, such as a loop
expressway around the island.

CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Switzerland's ABB firm has won the contract to
rebuild two suburban Beirut power stations destroyed in Israel's
air assaults on Lebanon, the Al Mustaqbal newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted well-informed sources as saying that ABB beat
France's Al Stom by a margin below 500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contract's worth was not disclosed. But, the sources said
the offer was below the government's forecast of 18 million
dollars for the cost of repairs for the Jamhour and Bsalim power
stations.
</P>
<P>
The two stations were destroyed in Israel's air blitz on
Lebanon on June 24 during which three bridges and a telephone
relay station were also hit.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has received 66 million U.S. dollars from the
U.N. Compensation Commission to cover the losses that the
Egyptians suffered during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The money is to be distributed among 28,500 beneficiaries, the
Arab daily Al Hayat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiaries include the sixth and last group of Category
A who deserve compensation for forced departure, and the sixth and
seventh groups of Category C who deserve compensation for damages
in property up to 100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the paper, Egyptian Minister of Manpower and
Immigration Ahmed el-Amawi said the value of compensations for
Category A amounts to 19 million dollars in favor of 6,737
Egyptians, and 47.2 million dollars for the sixth and seventh
groups of Category C to be distributed among 21,000 people.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's tourism industry has seen a upturn this
summer as Arab tourists continue to flock to the country despite
the recent Israeli massive air blitz on the country.
</P>
<P>
Al Nahar newspaper Tuesday quoted Tourism Minister Artur
Nazarian as saying that the number of non-Lebanese tourists would
rise 30 to 48 percent to 350,000 to 400,000 this summer from
270,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of these tourists are expected to come from
oil-rich Gulf Arab states, he added.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted Director of the Kuwait Airlines office in
Lebanon, Mutab Al-Ajami, as saying that Kuwaiti tourists were not
deterred by the latest Israeli assault on Lebanon because most
Kuwaitis are well-aware of the true security situation on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
"We have already added three more weekly flights, raising
the number to nine from last year's six," Ajami said.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Official statistics show that Tunisia's production
of olive oil during the 1998 to 1999 season has amounted to
150,000 tons, less than the estimated production of 190,000 tons.

<P>
Olive oil production of the previous season only amounted to
90,000 tons. The season usually begins in November and ends in
March, the Egyptian daily Alam Al Yom reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Olive oil exports during the first five months of 1999 stood at

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Promote Vegetable Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is aiming to export 5.5
million tons of vegetables to overseas markets by adopting an
aggressive policy, Minister of Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperatives Pongpol Adireksarn said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has raised the annual vegetable production
target from 5.1 million tons to 5.5 million tons for the fiscal
year of 2000-2001 in view of the increasing export trend and high
domestic consumption, the Thai News Agency (TNA) quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new target was set after official statistics showed that
the exports of 3.4 million tons of Thai vegetables to the world
market had brought the country 11 billion baht (297.3 million U.S.
dollars) last year, Pongpol said.
</P>
<P>
The exports of Thai vegetables are likely to continue to grow
both in quantity and value, thanks to the weakening baht in recent
years, which had enhanced the competitiveness of the Thai
products, he said.
</P>
<P>
The most attractive Thai vegetables to foreign buyers include
corns, tomatoes, mushrooms and bean strains, with the United
States, the European Union, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore becoming
top markets.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the quality of Thai vegetables would also
be upgraded so that they would be toxic-free and not damage the
environment, Pongpol said.

<HEADLINE> The Elderly Must Live A Healthy Life: Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency released a
special commentator's article calling on the country's elderly to
live a scientific life.
</P>
<P>
It says that the Party and government is paying great attention
to the living conditions of the older population, and has drafted
laws and regulations to guarantee their interests.
</P>
<P>
However, the article says, some unhealthy and decadent ideas
have made their way into the minds of the elderly, harming them
mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
A typical example is Falun Dafa, or Falun Gong, concocted by Li
Hongzhi, which has taken advantage of the elder's desire to live
longer and healthier and has spread superstition and stirred up an
anti-scientific mentality among them.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong peddles nothing but spiritualism and theism to the
elder, the article points out, and its malicious fallacies have
deceived many of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Some elderly people who were not on the alert have become
psychopathic or even lost their lives, the article says.
</P>
<P>
When people become old, it is inevitable that they are easily
be stricken by diseases, and it is a common desire among the
elderly to take care of their bodies to enjoy longevity, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Facts have demonstrated that the only way for them to reach
this goals is to develop a scientific and optimistic attitude, as
well as a healthy and active life, rather than believe in some
heretical ideas that go against science.
</P>
<P>
The article urges the elderly to adhere to materialism and
cultivate the ability to identify any anti-materialism trick, and
to make a clear break with Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
If they cannot fully understand the danger of Falun Gong, the
hard-earned social stability can not be maintained, it explains.
</P>
<P>
The article says that the aged population has become a major
social factor in China, with 120 million people now above 60, thus
it is important to help them respect science and keep away from
superstition.
</P>
<P>
It is also imperative to strengthen ideological and political
education among the elderly, enrich their cultural life, and guide
them to study Marxism and Deng Xiaoping Theory, as well as science,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The commentary urges governments at various levels to offer
entertainment and sports activities that will be accepted and
loved by the elderly, such as creating playgrounds and clubs for
them.

Following the signing ceremony of the agreement, Aziz said that
the two countries would work together to enhance and cement
cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Describing the signing of the agreement as "good and
practical," Aziz said the two countries started with putting some
of its parts into effect by signing trade and agricultural
contracts. He did not elaborate on the contracts they signed.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Belarussian minister described the agreement
as very important, saying it is a leap from political talks to
serious and real economic action between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has taken into considerations of two essential
matters, namely the exchanges of ambassadors and opening two
embassies and the formation of an Iraqi-Belarussian joint
committee of economic and trade cooperation whose main task is to
set up a joint market between the two countries, said Zametalin.
</P>
<P>
He described the U.N. embargo clamped on Iraq as unjust and
called for the lifting of it, saying it is impossible to chock a
country of more than 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Iraq following
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin's Overseas-Funded Enterprises Increase Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded enterprises in
northern China's Tianjin Municipality recorded a total profits of
3.727 billion yuan (449 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of
this year, up 19 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released recently by the Tianjin
Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, over 4,200
such enterprises in the municipality reported an 11 percent
increase in their sales income, which amounted to 48 billion yuan
in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Exports of these overseas-funded enterprises also increased 23
percent to 2.15 billion U.S. dollars in the period. They accounted
for 70 percent of the city's total exports, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The increases in both profits and exports, which were achieved
against the backdrop of a weak domestic demand and continuous drop
of price index, show that most foreign-funded enterprises enjoy a
larger space to develop themselves in China, local trade officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The rise in profits also prompted the enterprises to expand
their investments in the first six months, the officials said. A
total of 78 enterprises increased their investments by 340 million
U.S. dollars, increasing 4.4 million U.S. dollars each on the
average and 57 percent over the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Prosecute Former House Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has decided
to prosecute former speaker of the House of Representatives,
Alhaji Ibrahim Buhari, for forgery and perjury allegations,
Attorney-General Senator Kanu Agabi said.
</P>
<P>
Agabi, who is also Justice Minister, said at a press briefing
in capital Abuja Tuesday that the police would continue its
investigation of allegations against Buhari, and "will have him
charged with the appropriate offenses in the appropriate court in
due time."
</P>
<P>
Buhari resigned last Thursday following revelations that he
forged his academic qualification and falsified his age from 29 to
36 years old to contest elections.
</P>
<P>
Agabi recalled that the House passed a resolution forgiving
Buhari and implored the nation to do the same, saying that "I
share that sentiment and the president was compelled to give
serious thought to that resolution."
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we must obey the law," he said, adding that "the
pardon is a part of the prerogative of mercy but not an arbitrary
presidential right of grace and power, but a constitutional
safeguard against mistakes."
</P>
<P>
Police public relations officer Young Arebamen was quoted as
saying that "our investigators are still doing their work, and so
we must allow them to finish before talking about prosecution."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some members of the House are said to be making
representation to President Olusegun Obasanjo in order to shield
Buhari from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
They said that it would amount to double jeopardy to prosecute
Buhari, who had already lost his office and his membership of the
House, and suffered unprecedented disgrace and humiliation.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Refugees Flee Into W. Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A rising number of refugees have
been coming into Zambia's Western Province from Angola, running
away from forced conscription by the UINTA rebels, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesman Dominik Bartsch disclosed in Lusaka Tuesday
that the refugees, whose number has not yet been ascertained but
whose last count was 50 a few days ago, are entering Zambia
through Sikongo border post.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper Wednesday quoted Bartsch as saying that the
UNHCR was studying the situation closely, adding that the
officials on the ground were taking care of the influx.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Zambia's North Western Province has
continued to experience a stable trickle of refugees who are
crossing into the country at an average of 15 persons a week.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of refugees settled at Mwange Refugee Camp
in that province has increased to 14,127 from less than 12,000.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot attribute the coming of refugees to war because it
is far from that border in the central highlands," he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
rebels have been reportedly conscripting civilians by force.

<HEADLINE> S. African Marathon Cheat Return Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A gold medalist who was found
cheating in last month's marathon race in South Africa have
returned his gold medal and is yet to face penalties, South
African media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Motsoeneng, 21, who cheated his way into the ninth place
finish in the 89.9-kilometer Comrades Marathon held in eastern
South Africa in June, on Tuesday returned the medal to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
He also returned the one ounce fine gold presented to the top
10 men and women in this year's race.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Motsoeneng agreed to repay the 6,000 rand (1,000 U.S.
dollars) prize money, which he says he has already spent, by the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
Arguably the world's largest ultra-distance road race, Comrade
Marathon attracts athletes from around the world to South Africa
every year, who would run the distance from Maritzburg to the sea
port Durban.
</P>
<P>
After appeals by fellow runners and the publication of photo
evidence, Motsoeneng admitted last week that he and his younger
brother Arnold, 19, had completed the race relay-style. They were
hitchhiked by motorists to various points along the route where
they exchanged clothing in mobile toilets.
</P>
<P>
The executive committee of the Comrades Marathon Association
will meet next month to decide what disciplinary action to take
against the brothers, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The brothers' respective provinces - they were registered with
Gauteng North and Free State respectively - were also considering
penalties to them.
</P>
<P>
The elder Motsoeneng could face a lengthy ban -- even life --
from taking part in road races as South African authorities are
keen to crack down on offenders in a bid to stamp out cheating in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Marathon officials said the incident had helped
heighten awareness of cheating in the race and more checkpoints
would be added along the route to make sure perpetrators do not
succeed in the future.

DALI, China, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Mild Seven Outdoor Quest,
one of the world's premier adventure races, is set to begin here
on Thursday with 24 teams from around the world participating.
</P>
<P>
Each team represents a high level of excellence in a type of
endurance sport, whether it be mountain biking, triathlon, or
adventure racing.
</P>
<P>
"The athletes asked that we make the course longer and tougher
than last year," said race director Murphy Reinschreiber. "And so
we did. The athletes we've assembled represent the best endurance
athletes in the world, and when they say they want a race that
lets them showcase their natural abilities, we're more than happy
to make the changes that will accomodate them."
</P>
<P>
The race is a four-day event, asking four-person teams --
comprising at least one opposing sex -- to contest a series of
outdoor disciplines each day. The team with the lowest cumulative
time after four days competitions will be declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
While defending champions Polar Spirit of Finland are favored
to win the events such as mountain biking, trail running, offroad
inline skating, kayaking, lake paddling, and mountaineering, this
year's longer format may favor teams as Encinitas Adventure Racers
(EAR), which is composed of Ironman triathletes, a group of
athletes more used to racing eight hours and more at a time.
</P>
<P>
The litmus test should be on Saturday, a 120 kilometers
combination of mountain biking, running, paddling and
mountaineering. Athletes will be racing from dawn to dusk.

LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Tuesday urged the Nigerian government to liaise with the
institution in appraising the country's looted money stashed away
in foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
While making the recommendation, a visiting IMF consultative
team promised to assist Nigeria to seek a "comprehensive yet
realistic" appraisal of the looted money, This Day newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Local media had put the amount of the loots at about several
billion U.S. dollars, which had been stolen by corruptive
officials of the former military regimes and transferred to banks
in Britain, Switzerland and other countries.
</P>
<P>
It has proved to be hard in retrieving the money since most
foreign banks ask for concrete evidence on the unlawful source of
the deposits before they agree to release relevant information.
</P>
<P>
But the evidence is difficult to obtain under most of the
circumstances.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Settle Permanent NTR with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China has demanded that the United
States settle its permanent Normal Trading Relations (NTR) issue
with China at an early date in accordance with the trend of times.
</P>
<P>
This will create favorable conditions for the continuous
development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade ties, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday voted by an
overwhelming majority supporting the extension of Normal Trading
Relations (NTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
The House, in a 260-170 vote, defeated a measure calling for
overturn of President Bill Clinton's decision to continue China's
NTR status.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of that, and this is a wise decision," Zhu
said, adding that the result once again shows that the move by
some people in U.S. Congress to undermine Sino-U.S. relations and
their economic and trade cooperation is unpopular.
</P>
<P>
The further growth of Sino-U.S. economic and trade ties on an
equal, mutual beneficial and stable basis accords with the
fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Village Abandons Plan to Sponsor Falun Gong Courses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A village in Japan has canceled a
plan to sponsor a course of classes on the practice of the Falun
Gong after the meditation group was banned by China last week,
according to a Kyodo News report.
</P>
<P>
The village of Misato in Nagano Prefecture, central Japan, had
planned to sponsor the classes at a community center, village
officials said, adding that the lessons were scheduled to begin
Wednesday and to be held three more times until August 25.
</P>
<P>
Now that Beijing has declared the group illegal, village
authorities deemed it inappropriate to hold such a course at a
public facility, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, China formally banned the Falun Gong and
prohibited all activities in support of the group, citing the
group had been engaged in illegal activities, advocating
superstition and spreading fallacies, hoodwinking people, inciting
and creating disturbances and jeopardizing social stability.

<P>
TOKYO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Wednesday, marking their first gain in six trading days, helped by
Tuesday's upturn on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 117.19 points, or 0.67
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 17,579.91.

The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 16.22 points or 1.13 percent to 1,
450.33.
</P>
<P>
Bargain-hunting was stirred after the Nikkei index lost more
than 1,000 points during the previous five trading days, and high-
tech blue chips were strong in response to Tuesday's surge in the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index in New York, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section fell slightly to 459.90 million
shares from 462.54 million shares Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Motor Corp. was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers exceeded
gainers 635 to 541 despite the rises in the Nikkei and TOPIX, with
133 issues ending unchanged.

JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's working meeting with
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat Tuesday
night failed to achieve any major breakthrough for the
implementation of the Wye River Memorandum, leaving the
Palestinians disappointed. But the two men did agree to set up a
preliminary working group to begin immediate discussions on
continuing the Wye process.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- After consulting with academics and industrialists, Finance
Minister Avraham Shochat intends to examine various steps against
Central Bank Governor Jacob Frenkel, including dismissing him from
the post, if he does not agree to lower interest rates. A senior
treasury source told Haaretz that the finance minister is
determined that he, not Frenkel, will ultimately determine the
country's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Finance Ministry is planning to cut child allowance and
level tax on rental income, warning that the public must prepare
for painful decrees. Finance Minister Avraham Shochat will discuss
with Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the matter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will decide within two
weeks whether to delay the implementation of the Wye
agreement. Syrian President Hafez al-Assad has delivered indirect
message to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, insisting that an
Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 border is the condition for
resuming the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Implement Energy Efficiency Improvement Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will implement an
industrial energy efficiency improvement project next month to
establish a strong institutional base to improve the efficiency in
energy usage.
</P>
<P>
The project to be implemented over a four-year period would
focus on eight small industrial sectors -- cement, ceramic,
foodstuff, glassware, iron and steel, pulp and paper, rubber and
wood-based industries identified to be heavy energy consumers, the
Energy, Communications and Multimedia Ministry said in a statement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to provide Malaysia with a strong
institutional foundation for energy efficiency improvement
initiatives and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from
local industries, it said.
</P>
<P>
The project will be implemented as part of global efforts under
the United Nations Global Environment Facility which serves as the
interim financial mechanism body for the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said a national steering committee headed by the
Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in the Prime Minister's Department
and co-chaired by Energy, Communications and Multimedia Minister
Leo Moggie will monitor the progress in the implementation of the
project to be carried out by the Malaysian Energy Center.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Provincial Falun Gong Leader Criticizes Li Hongzhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The head of a former Falun Gong
training center in China's Jilin province says he has seen the
true face of Li Hongzhi and has begun criticizing him for his
fallacies.
</P>
<P>
China deemed the Falun Gong organization, headed by Li Hongzhi,
to be illegal and banned it on July 22.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Jiao Lixun, 57, said he regretted
having joined Li's organization and helping him spread his tricks
and that he is upset because he has destroyed many happy families
by training them in Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Li was a cadre at the provincial government information center
and began practicing Falun Gong in 1992 when Li held a training
class in the provincial capital Jilin.
</P>
<P>
He said he was at first fascinated Li's claims about Falun Gong
's magical powers and soon got deeply involved in it. He was then
promoted to be head of the Jilin provincial training center and Li
told his class that he himself had cured many seriously ill people
in other parts of China with Falun Gong and even boasted that he
was the incarnation of a "heavenly Buddha."
</P>
<P>
Jiao said he got suspicious of Li's powers at one time but soon
gave up the suspicion after seeing people like professors and
retired officials joining Li's group. And, he was very confused
and upset when the Chinese government banned Falun Gong last week.
But, after watching TV and reading newspapers for the past several
days, he decided to give up the practice.
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Jiao said he thinks that if Li were a real Buddha,
he, once an adherent of Falun Gong, should have saved the life of
his granddaughter who lived only one day after her birth in 1997.
As a Communist Party member, Jiao said, he should stand behind the
government and call on all practitioners in the province to stop
practicing Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Halts Allocating Public Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has suspended allocation of public land under trusteeship of
central and local governments with immediate effect until further
notice, the Kenya Times newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a terse statement issued by the
presidential office Tuesday. No reasons were given for the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper holds that the order came after outcry from
the public, politicians and church leaders over alleged massive
illegal land allocation scams.
</P>
<P>
The public land meant for public utilities such as schools and
markets was prone to be abused by some corrupt government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's law stipulates that central and local governments have
a right to allocate the public land.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of the Kenya's capital city of Nairobi, Samuel Mbugua,
was accused of allocating plots to city councilors to buy their
allegiance during the mayoral elections scheduled for next week,
the East African Standard newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mayor admitted that he had issued several letters to
allocation for individual city councilors but denied that the
plots were meant to influence their voting.
</P>
<P>
The new ban on allocating public land is likely to derail
corrupt deals that tainted the Lands and Settlement Ministry and
tarnished the government' s reputation, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Burning of Shops, Houses Continues in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Rampaging mobs continued to burn
houses, shops, markets and vehicles in Ambon, capital of
Indonesia's Maluku province, Wednesday, according to the Antara
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the city remained tense, the agency said,
adding that people were on alert, guarding housing complexes
against possible attacks as security forces seemed unable to put
the situation under control.
</P>
<P>
"Streets have been blocked by the mobs. No one has dared to go
out, even to buy basic needs in the nearest market," a civil
servant of the provincial governor's office was quoted by Antara
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday afternoon, bomb explosions and gunfire could be
heard in the area, Antara said.
</P>
<P>
Fresh riots in the city broke out last Friday as a brawl among
residents of Poka and Rumah Tiga villagers in Baguala subdistrict
spread to downtown Ambon.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 people have reportedly been killed, 32 others
injured and one reported missing.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Indonesian Police Gen. Roesmanhadi said that an
army battalion is expected to arrive in Ambon Wednesday to help
restore peace in the riot-torn city.
</P>
<P>
"If this is not enough, we will send an anti-riot force which
will consist of policemen," he told reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Roesmanhadi said the riots were a continuation of the tribal
riots in Ambon which had already killed hundreds of people since
early this year.
</P>
<P>
Asked why riot provocateurs have not been identified until now,
he said the people have been reluctant to talk for fear of
becoming the target of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, about 60 percent of the population is Christian. Most
of the rest are Muslims, many of them immigrants from other
islands.

<HEADLINE> Inland Areas Help Tibet Train Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Over the past 14 years, about 5,800
Tibetan students who had studied in colleges, universities and
technical schools in China' inland areas have returned home and
played an important role in local economic construction.
</P>
<P>
In the period, a total of 19,444 Tibetan junior middle school
students have been sent to study in more than 100 schools in 25
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
This was in response to a central government's decision in 1984
to help the Tibet Autonomous Region train educated and technical
personnel in a bid to step up local economic construction.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the first batch of 1,300 Tibetan junior middle school
students were sent to inland areas for advanced study.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysian, British Firms to Cooperate in Designing, Making Aircraft Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Three Malaysian companies
will cooperate with British Aerospace (BAe), a commercial and
military aircraft manufacturer, not only in manufacturing but also
in designing high technology aircraft parts, an official of the
British company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to design components for civil and military aircraft
at the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) and manufacture them in
Malaysia," Steve Grigg, president of international corporate
affairs for British Aerospace, was quoted by the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama as saying in Langkawi, a resort
island in northern Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are underway with the three local companies -- SME
Aerospace, Composite Technology Research of Malaysia (CTRM) and
ExcelNet, a local company with MSC status, Grigg said, believing
that the idea of local companies designing hi-tech components for
BAe commercial and military aircraft with the help of BAe would
materialize soon.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Malaysia only manufactures aircraft parts with
designs originating from British Aerospace based in Farnborough in
the United Kingdom. "But now we are looking into areas where
highly sophisticated components for commercial and military
aircraft can be designed by Malaysians with the help of BAe at the
MSC," Grigg said.
</P>
<P>
SME Aerospace now manufactures pylons (a hi-tech part fixed
into both wings to carry missiles and bombs) for the Hawk, BAe
ground attack aircraft under a 42 million ringgit (about 11
million U.S. dollar) contract.
</P>
<P>
Besides, BAe and CTRM are negotiating to locally manufacture
the composite wing component for Airbus Industries, another
aircraft giant, while ExcelNet is now undertaking a one million
pound sterling contract in design work for military aircraft for
the British government, he said.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Launch Summer Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban launched
their long-awaited summer offensive early Wednesday with a
three-pronged attack across frontlines northeast of Kabul, sources
from the two warring Afghan factions confirmed to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources said they launched a three-pronged attack
against the opposition, the Northern Alliance, led by former
defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood in the areas of Tagab, Bagram
and Koh-e-Suf, north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition sources, who claimed to have intercepted
a Taliban radio message, told Xinhua that a total of 3,500 Taliban
soldiers have taken part in the summer offensive.
</P>
<P>
Taliban jet planes bombed the areas before their infantry
troops advanced to the opposition-controlled bases. The two sides
exchanged heavy artillery fire, said the opposition sources.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that the Taliban launched the attack at 02:30
Wednesday morning. Trucks loaded with Taliban soldiers were moving
to the areas north of the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here from Kabul quoted an opposition
spokesman as saying that the Taliban attacked positions around the
Panjsher valley, the stronghold of opposition commander Masood.
</P>
<P>
Roads south from Masood's area to the Taliban-controlled
territory were blocked and road from the capital to the eastern
city of Jalalabad and on to Pakistan was also blocked.
</P>
<P>
Opposition spokesman Dr. Abdullah (only one name) said, forces
loyal to Masood resisted the Taliban attacks. However, there were
no details of casualties.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Afghan Islamic Press, the Taliban
had advanced about two kilometers at Tagab and seized some heights
around Koh-e-Suf.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban Northern Alliance Wednesday continued its
rocket attack against the capital city of Kabul. There is no
report so far about the damage and casualties.
</P>
<P>
At least eight people were killed and more than 10 others
injured in a rocket attack by the alliance last Saturday. On
Tuesday, the Kabul airport was hit by three rockets launched from
the opposition bases.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Security Move in National Parks Lauded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy charge d'affaires
Michael Marine has commended the Kenyan government for beefing up
security in national parks to guarantee the safety of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Marine made the remarks Tuesday when he paid a courtesy call to
 Commissioner Francis Baya of Rift Valley Province in central
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the arrest of the bandits who robbed the American
tourists in the Maasai Mara Game Reserve, one of the most famous
national parks in Kenya, by the security personnel six weeks ago
had enhanced the east African country's image abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Wednesday quoted the charge
d'affaires as saying that Americans prefer Kenya as a tourist
destination.
</P>
<P>
He urged Kenya to uphold the present tight security in the game
reserves to attract more visitors.
</P>
<P>
While hailing Kenya for maintaining political stability, Marine
pledged his embassy's support for Kenya's recovery strategy
launched by President Daniel arap Moi last week.
</P>
<P>
The president and his newly-appointed head of civil service
Richard Leakey have vowed to reverse the culture of corruption and
inefficiency in the public service and other sectors.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills 153 Ugandans This Year: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 153 Ugandans have died
of cholera so far this year, Ugandan Commissioner for Health
Services Sam Okwarea has said.
</P>
<P>
About 3,053 cholera cases have been reported since 1999,
bringing the cumulative number to 52,216 since the last epidemic
and that of death to 219, the health official said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this high incidence of the epidemic to poor
sanitation conditions in such districts as Arua, Bundibugyo and
Mbarara in the west, especially in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision daily Wednesday quoted the official as saying
that communication problems also hindered the information flow
from various districts.
</P>
<P>
Okwarea urged the people to change some of their living habits
and the government to improve the sanitation conditions for the
people.

<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Wednesday welcomed the U.S.
House of Representatives' vote supporting the extension of Normal
Trading Relations (NTR) with China for another year.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the outcome of the debate. As the
mainland and the U.S. are our two largest trading partners, we are
naturally delighted that the mainland's NTR status in the coming
year is assured," a spokesman for the Trade and Industry Bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the extension would provide a useful
basis for Hong Kong businessmen to continue to plan their business
with the inland areas and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives, in a 260-170 vote, Tuesday
defeated a measure calling for the overturn of President Bill
Clinton's decision to continue China's NTR status, which was
formerly known as Most Favored Nation status.

<HEADLINE> Building Collapse Hinders Parliament Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Parliament failed to
conduct business Tuesday due to the collapse of the concrete roof
on the third floor of the Parliament Building.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Spokesman Kagole Kivumbi told Xinhua in a telephone
interview Wednesday morning that the collapse was due to old age.
</P>
<P>
"The building was built 33 years ago. During the rule of
(former Ugandan dictator) Idi Amin in the 1970s, there was no
parliament and so the building was abandoned. Now it needs so many
renovations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The plenary session of the Parliament will be held in the
International Conference Center today and MPs will discuss this
matter," he added.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials including Prime Minister Apollo
Nsibambi and Minister of Works John Nasasira have inspected the
building to assess the damage, Kivumbi said.
</P>
<P>
The roof of the chamber and the second floor were leaking for
most of the Tuesday morning and buckets were placed in the chamber
to tap the water.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's New Vision newspaper quoted Parliament Speaker
Francis Ayume as saying that the chamber would be put right within
10 days.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said Tuesday that alternative arrangements were
being made for the Parliament to conduct its business.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urged to Set up Special Bank to Develop IT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government was
Wednesday urged to create a special bank to finance the growth of
the information technology (IT) sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
Making the appeal in the Senate here Wednesday, Senator Ghazi
Hasbullah Ramli said the creation of such a bank would certainly
help those who are keen on expanding the idea on IT but are
facing difficulty in securing loans because they do not have any
collateral.
</P>
<P>
He said the setting up of such a bank was not only in line with
the national objective of creating a knowledgeable society in the
coming millennium but because ideas and intellectual property were
important capital components in any development besides structural
capital such as hardware.
</P>
<P>
He said that if a special bank could not be set up, at least a
special unit offering interest-free banking should be provided.

<P>
AMMAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Defense Minister
Alain Richard has reaffirmed his country's commitment to Jordan's
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
During a closed door meeting here with Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein on Tuesday evening, Richard also reaffirmed France's
commitment to the well being of the desert kingdom which is
suffering from foreign debts of some 6.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Richard, who paid a one-day visit to Amman Tuesday, discussed
with Abdullah bilateral ties and developments in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Their talks also covered ways of consolidating bilateral
cooperation, particularly in exchanging expertise in
defense-related fields and conducting joint military drills.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Richard also met with Jordanian Prime
Minister and Minister of Defense Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh and
Chairman of the Jordanian Joint Chiefs of Staff Mohammad Malkawi
for talks on bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and France are expected to hold joint military
exercises this year in line with programs agreed upon between the
two countries, but the date and the scale of the war games have
not been fixed yet, Jordanian officials said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Leaves Baghdad After Closing UNSCOM Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. technical team, in charge
of removing toxic chemical agents left behind by the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and closing its Baghdad laboratory, left here
on Wednesday morning after fulfilling its task.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team destroyed the VX nerve gas samples found in
UNSCOM's Baghdad laboratory on Tuesday, diplomatic sources close
to the team told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team, which comprises four chemical experts from the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague
and an independent biological weapons expert, began the
destruction of the chemical agents and mustard gas samples left
behind by UNSCOM, which is in charge of disarming Iraq, last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The chemical agents and mustard gas samples were neutralized
by these U.N. experts through chemical process inside the
chemical laboratory and biological room.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team's work was originally scheduled to last three
days, but the finding of the VX nerve gas samples in the lab
delayed their work because UNSCOM did not report to the U.N. Security
Council on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team reported the finding to the U.N. last weekend and
had to wait for instructions from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. reached an agreement last month on the
composition of the technical team to close UNSCOM's Baghdad lab
where one kilogram of mustard gas and VX nerve gas were reportedly
left behind by UNSCOM before it withdrew from Iraq last December.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has not resumed its work of weapons inspections in
Iraq since last December when the United States and Britain
launched four-night airstrikes against Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi
won their respective openers while Tim Herman was upset in the
Mercedes-Benz Cup tennis tournament in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked Sampras eliminated the 17-year-old rookie
Phillip King 6-1, 6-2 within one hour, including six aces while
giving up only 10 points in his serve.
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was going to ace me on every point," said King
who was making his ATP Tour debut, "there wasn't much I could do
when he hits a winner."
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Andre Agassi beat Jan-Michael Gambill 6-2, 6-2 in a
late match, while Tim Henman suffered his defeat of 6-3, 7-6 (7-4)
against Frenchman Guillaume Raoux.
</P>
<P>
"I was moving very well and making him hit two or three good
shots," Agassi said. "This is the best I've played bar-none. I'm
more focused, smarter and stronger."
</P>
<P>
Henman, the third seed from England who is ranked a career-high
fifth in the world, had never lost a set to Raoux in four previous
matches.
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't start feeling involved in the match until he
trailed 3-1 in the second set and it was too late.
</P>
<P>
Raoux continued a habit of knocking off top players in Los
Angeles. He sent Goran Ivanisevic packing last year before losing
to eventual runnerup Henman in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Raoux defeated Mark Philippoussis and Patrick Rafter
in a run to the semis.
</P>
<P>
Three other seeded players in action during the day all won
their respective match, with sixth-seeded Ivanisevic defeating Max
Mirnyi of Belarus 6-3, 6-3, No. 7 Lleyton Hewitt of Australia
downing Alex O'Brien 6-3, 6-2 and eighth-seeded Wayne Ferreira
eliminating Geoff Grant 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Speaker Backs Anti-poverty Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives will give all-out support to the government's
drive to eradicate poverty in the country, Speaker Manny Villar
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Villar made the remarks when reacting to the president's State
of the Nation Address delivered Monday marking the opening of the
second joint session of the 11th Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to support President Joseph Estrada's
anti- poverty objectives," Philippine News Agency quoted Villar as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Villar, several pending economic-related bills are
aimed at improving the economic conditions in the country by
encouraging the growth of business.
</P>
<P>
"This will lead to employment opportunities for Filipinos," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Providing jobs for countrymen, Villar added, is the best way to
eradicate poverty and improve the quality of life of Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Citing the significance of entrepreneurship, Villar said
several measures to propagate business are awaiting action in the
House. Among them are bills to promote rural industries to boost
rural economies.
</P>
<P>
"An entrepreneurial revolution will help eradicate poverty and
spread wealth to the countryside," he said.
</P>
<P>
The House is also committed to developing the agricultural
sector, where two-thirds of Filipinos are employed, by enhancing
productivity, he added.

<HEADLINE> Quality Of Imported Red Wine Called Into Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The quality of some brands of dry
red wine imported into China is not as good as is expected,
according to the National Wine Quality Supervision Center.
</P>
<P>
The Center's Ma Peilian and a dozen other specialists tried
five imported dry red wines and five domestic products and said
that some brands of imported dry red wine are dark in color and do
not taste very good and one imported wine do not meet required
quality standards.
</P>
<P>
But Caberna, which is produced by the Zhang Yu Winery Co. of
China, was praised by the specialists as a Chinese wine that could
compete on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiming, an oenologist at Northwest University's Wine College,
points out that the transporting of imported wine is important in
relation to quality. Wine has a long journey in coming to China
and usually takes more than a month from European countries, he
says.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the center suggests that the price of imported wine
is usually double or triple that of Chinese products and many
consumers prefer to go for the former because they take it for
granted that the quality is greater. Ma attributes this to a lack
of ability to distinguish good wine.
</P>
<P>
China had rapid growth in red wine production in 1996, when
there were 600 wine companies nationwide. But, a third couldn't
take the intense competition and went bankrupt. The industry
scaled output down to 300,000 tons last year. Some popular
domestic brands, like Zhang Yu, Great Wall, and Dynasty, have
reported stable sales and have about half the market.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yu Winery extended its market share to 35 percent last
year, with sales of more than a billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Goes Further in Pan Am Gold Rush, Cuba Has a Big Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States went
further in the Pan Am medals rush here on Tuesday despite the
Cubans' daily gold output surpassed their arch rivals for the
first time since the beginning of the two-week Games.
</P>
<P>
Cuba netted six gold to the Americans' five, thanks to their
male gymnasts' overwhelming performances at the Winnipeg Arena.
But the United States stood atop on the overall standings with 31
golds against Cuba's 21.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Canada also fared well, landing five golds, four of them
from the gymnastics individual competitions and the fifth from
roller hockey.
</P>
<P>
Americans' golds came from athletics and shooting. In the
University of Manitoba Stadium, U.S. athletes captured three of
the five golds on offer, with Lance Deal putting on a Games record-
breaking performance to take the men's hammer title.
</P>
<P>
Lance's mighty throw set a new record of 79.61 meters, cutting
more than two meters off the previous best mark of 77.24.
</P>
<P>
Men's pole vault title and women's shot put went to his
teammates Patrick Manson (5.60m) and Connie Price-Smith (19.06)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
U.S. shooting team's medal streak continued on Tuesday as they
swept all three golds at stake at the Pan Am Trap and Skeet field.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Kimberly Rhode tied her best mark of 132
hits to take the women's double trap title.
</P>
<P>
Lance Bade added a gold in the men's double trap final while
national champion Rebecca Snyder hit seven 10s to finish first in
the women's sport pistol event.
</P>
<P>
Cuba hauled in half of the ten Pan Am individual gymnastic
golds at stake while hosts Canada almost emulated them by netting
four at the Winnipeg Arena.
</P>
<P>
Eric Lopez emerged as the Prince Charm of the Pan Am gymnastics
as he chalked up three individual golds to lead his country's
domination on the men's field.
</P>
<P>
The individual all-round winner completed a five-gold feat
after adding men's pommel horse, rings and parallel bars golds to
his individual all-round and team title.
</P>
<P>
Lopez's teammate Abel Santos and Arazay Perez secured the men's
and women's vault golds for Cuba with a score of 9.587 and 9.450
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Canada also had a great day. On women's individual
apparatuses, Canadian girls demonstrated grace and grit which took
them to the women's team title last Saturday, rushing three of
four golds at stake.
</P>
<P>
The only gold slipping off the Cuban and Canadian hands was men
's floor, which was clinched by Argentine Eric Pedercini with a 9.
400.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Demanding Better Telecoms Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sources from the China Consumers' Association say that
consumers' associations had approximately 7,880 complaints about
telecoms services during the second quarter of this year, a rise
of almost 49.5 percent from the same period last year, and
complaints about goods and services were up 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
China cut telecommunications fees in March, and as a result,
sales of telecommunications products increased more than 30
percent in the first half, according to State Internal Trade
Administration sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the telecom services pricing system still has room for
further improvement, the paper quoted an association member as
saying. Most of the consumer complaints had to do with random
charges by local bureaus, poor service, and installment delays.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Bolivia
played to a scoreless draw in a Group A match at the
Confederations Cup here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia controlled the game in the early stage of the game, but
failed to organize an effective attack.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia fought back with attacks led by Hussein Sulamini,
Ibrahim Al Harbi and Nawaf Al Temyat and had created several
chances to score. However, their attempts were either erratic or
crashed by brilliant goalkeeper Carlos Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
"The final score is bad for the teams," Bolivian coach Hector
Vieira said. "It was an open game that no one could control. Now
we know we have to face Mexico, the best team in the group."
</P>
<P>
Bolivia, which drew with Egypt on Sunday, will face Mexico in
its last group match on Thursday. Saudi Arabia, a 5-1 loser to
Mexico, will play against Egypt.

<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Cuba hauled in half of
the 10 Pan Am individual gymnastic golds at stake while hosts
Canada almost emulated them by netting four at the Winnipeg Arena
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eric Lopez emerged as the Prince Charm of the Pan Am gymnastics
as he chalked up three individual golds to lead his country's
domination on the men's field.
</P>
<P>
The individual all-round winner completed a five-gold feat
after adding men's pommel horse, rings and parallel bars gold to
his individual all-round and team title.
</P>
<P>
The winning point of his hat-trick triumphs came as 9.700, 9.
650 and 9.550 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Lopez's teammate Abel Santos and Arazay Perez were inspired to
their own glories as Cuba showed its prowess before the world
championships begins October in Tianjin, China.
</P>
<P>
Santos won the men's vault with a score of 9.587 while Perez
vaulted to women's title on 9.450 points.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Canada also had a great day. On women's individual
apparatus, Canadian girls demonstrated grace and grit which took
them to the women's team title last Saturday, rushing three of
four golds at stake.
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Tousek capped the Canadian efforts with a day-high 9.712
points on the floor after an earlier 9.662-point victory from the
uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
Her teammate Lise Leveille posted a 9.612 to contribute a
balance beam gold.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Jeltkov, the men's individual all-round silver
medalist, struck gold this time, his 9.700-earning performance on
the horizontal bar driving the packed crowd to a boiling point.
</P>
<P>
The only gold slipping off the Cuban and Canadian hands was men
's floor, which was clinched by Argentine Eric Pedercini with a 9.
400.

SEZ) in east China's Fujian Province had a GDP of 19.12 billion
yuan from January to June, up 15.9 percent on a year-on-year basis,

special economic zones with preferential policies and special
administrative methods to attract more overseas investment. Hainan
Province then followed suit in 1988 and is now the largest SEZ in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In economic performance, Xiamen was 2.3 percentage greater than
Shenzhen, which was in second place out of the five SEZs.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen had 25.69 billion yuan worth of industrial output in the
first 6 months, up 28 percent from the same period last year, It
was also high on the list of the country's 42 major cities in

BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A series of activities intended to
help Chinese teenagers improve themselves and learn more about the
environment and survival have begun in four Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese capital, Beijing, a large number of teenagers
are expected to take part in summer camps that teach them how to
endure hardships by camping in the open country and learning about
survival.
</P>

In the southwestern city of Kunming, the World Horticulture
Exposition is being used to make people more aware of the
environment when survival camps visit the expo to learn more about
the environment and nature.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Yichang in central China's Hubei Province,
there will be camps along the Yangtze River where participants
learn about the river's water resources, vegetation, and
environment.
</P>
<P>
The summer camping activities are part of a project sponsored
by the Communist League of China to help Chinese teenagers and the
League plans to encourage more camps to teach teenagers about
survival, labor, the environment, self-protection, and history.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle Columbia
concluded its mission and returned to Earth late Tuesday after a
quick trip to orbit to drop off the world's most powerful X-ray
telescope.
</P>
<P>
Shuttle Commander Eileen Collins, the first U.S. woman ever to
command a space flight, took manual control of Columbia at some 9,
090 meters, executed a 236-degree right, overhead turn and landed
the shuttle at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral in
Florida, the United States, at 11:20 p.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
The landing seemed to go more smoothly than Friday's launch,
which came after two delays and was plagued by a possible hydrogen
fuel leak and a short circuit. Neither problem affected the ride
home.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts accomplished their main goal just seven hours
into the flight, flawlessly releasing the 1.5 billion U.S. dollar
Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which began a five-year journey to
search for signs of black holes and study galaxies and quasars.
</P>
<P>
Chandra is using its thrusters to eventually reach an orbit
extending one-third of the way to the moon.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Says Li Hongzhi's Fallacies Reflect Dangerous Political Aims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A article in today's "People's
Daily" says that Li Hongzhi's malicious fallacies in his doomsday
message come from political motives.
</P>
<P>
It says that Li Hongzhi preached that the earth will explode
and that doomsday is coming and that no government can solve the
problem and that only he is the proper ruler of the world, which
cannot do without him.
</P>
<P>
His purpose is crystal clear, the paper says. He deceived a lot
of people by deifying himself with the aim of taking the place of
the government and rule the world. His acts betrayed his malicious
political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that the illegal gathering outside the
Communist Party and central government compound at Zhongnanhai in
Beijing on April 25 was a signal that Falun Gong sect is not a
simple problem and that people should be vigilant.
</P>
<P>
And, if people were not so clear about the essence of the Falun
Gong organization before the gathering, they should be more sober-
minded now because Li Hongzhi has the evil aim of developing Falun
Gong into a political force that can be used against the
government and Party.
</P>
<P>
It says that 16 cases examples given by the Xinhua News Agency
provide a bloody lessons about Li doing evil instead of spreading
benevolence and of harming people instead of saving them. If some
practicers could not see the danger of Falun Gong before, they
should be aware of its harms from these bloody lessons now. Li
took advantage of Falun Gong to realize his political aims.
</P>
<P>
But, it says, deceit can not last long and is sure to be
exposed and this has been shown by the support the Chinese people
gave to the CPC Central Committee decision to ban Fa Lungong.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. Company Stirs Controversy in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-level committee appointed
by the Sri Lankan government has joined environmental and human
rights groups opposing the leasing of phosphate mines to a U.S.
mining company for its alleged disregard of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The people of Eppawela in Sri Lanka's North Central Province
and various environmental and human rights organizations started
mass protests since the government recently approved leasing the
deposits at Eppawela to the U.S. Freeport McMoran company.
</P>
<P>
In a committee report published on Wednesday, the National
Science Foundation Committee on Eppawela said that if a proposal
made by the U.S. company is implemented it would result in severe
environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
Mining of the deposits can also cause social disturbances and
destruction to national heritage and if exploited must at all
times serve the national interest, the committee said in the
report.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka which promoted the project
has said the government without making any investment would
receive 10 percent free equity from the project if it went through
with it.
</P>
<P>
However, Ceylon Mercantile Union leader Bala Tampoe said 12,000
residents of Eppawela will lose their land if the project is
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Tampoe said Freeport McMoran has an infamous international
record particularly in regard to its mining operations in
Indonesia and has been condemned in the United States as the
"world's worst polluter."
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. company's proposal, the deposit was to be
used at a rate of 1 million tons per year to produce 60,000 tons
of phosphate fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Apart from phosphate processing, the company is allocated
another 3.6 million tons of raw phosphate for export during the
first 12 years of operation, said the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the proposal would exhaust the presently
known reserves of Eppawela rock phosphate in 30 years with
insignificant economic benefit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Currently around 50,000 tons of rock phosphates from Eppawela
are used as direct application fertilizer in tea, rubber and
coconut plantations, the three pillars of Sri Lanka's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
If phosphate deposits are exhausted within 30 years then
phosphate fertilizer needed for long-term crops will have to be
imported at a very high cost.
</P>
<P>
It will cost the U.S. company 5 U.S. dollars per ton of
Eppawela rock phosphate while the current import price is in the
range of 75 dollars, the committee report said.
</P>
<P>
The committee report suggested that around 350,000 tons of rock
phosphate should be exploited per year and single super phosphate
and partially acidulated phosphate rock are the recommended
products.
</P>
<P>
It said that at such a rate of exploitation the resources will
not only meet the nation's needs but also last at least for 200
years.
</P>
<P>
The world's known reserves of phosphate will be depleted in 50
years, the committee quoted surveys by the U.S. Bureau of Mines as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Even the base reserves of phosphates in the world would last
for only 150 years and once the reserves deplete future
exploitation will need advanced technology which will be costly,
the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member committee which comprises senior academics has
recommended that fresh worldwide tenders be called to set up a
phosphate factory emphasizing the amount to be exploited and the
products to be made.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the American transnational company will
stop at nothing to get a mining license from the government to
plunder the valuable national asset of the Eppawela deposit
wholesale for its short-term commercial gain, estimated at over 5
billion U.S. dollars," Tampoe said.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Promote Ties With ASEAN: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China will further identify
options for bilateral cooperation with various ASEAN countries in
the new century so as to bring their mutually beneficial
cooperation onto a new level, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be done through strengthening the China-ASEAN full
dialogue mechanism, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who has held discussions with his counterparts from ASEAN
countries and their dialogue partners here in the past few days,
said in an interview with Xinhua that he reached broad consensus
with them on ways of promoting a 21st century-oriented partnership
of good-neighborliness and mutual trust between China and ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Tang attended the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the
Post-Ministerial Conference (PMC) and the China-ASEAN Dialogue
between July 26 and 28 after the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, or the
ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting, which was held on July 23 and
24.
</P>
<P>
These meetings, which were held against the backdrop of the new
and significant changes in the international and regional
situation, were important, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said he had had extensive and in-depth discussions with
his counterparts in the past few days on political, economic and
security issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The meetings proceeded in a candid atmosphere and the
discussions were useful, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is natural that the participants held divergent views on the
current situation and differed on some other issues, he said. It
is precisely because there are differences that it has become all
the more necessary to boost dialogue, deepen understanding,
enhance trust and promote cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ARF, the most important regional forum for multilateral
security dialogue and cooperation, needs, by way of increased
dialogue, to make vigorous explorations on new security concepts
and new security-seeking modalities under the general trend of
peace, development, cooperation and stability that all countries
in the world aspire after in the post-Cold War period, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
What is particularly important is that the purposes and spirit
enshrined in the U.N. Charter and the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence and other basic norms governing international
relations, must be adhered to, he said.
</P>
<P>
In handling relations between states, the multilateral security
dialogue and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region should be
aimed at mutual respect instead of the strong bullying the weak,
mutual cooperation instead of confrontation and seeking consensus
instead of imposing one's own views on others, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only by this way, can the ARF have lasting vitality and play a
positive and practical role in maintaining and enhancing security
and cooperation in the region, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
China is happy to see and backs the expansion and strengthening
of ASEAN, an important force in the Asia-Pacific region for peace
and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the China-ASEAN Dialogue on Tuesday, the Chinese foreign
minister said, he had a friendly exchange of views with his ASEAN
counterparts on how to develop a 21st century-oriented partnership
of good-neighborliness and mutual trust between China and ASEAN
and they reached broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has decided to attend the summit
meeting of ASEAN leaders in November in Manila, the Philippines,
and China has agreed in principle to accede to the protocol to the
Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang also praised the host Singapore for its commendable
efforts to make the ASEAN meetings a success.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds Attracted to Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua)-- China is to open its environmental
protection sector more to international investment and
collaboration in the next three years, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English language newspaper quotes Xie Zhenhua,
minister of the State Environmental Protection Administration, as
saying that joint ventures will be encouraged in environmental
monitoring, pollution treatment and ecological conservation.
</P>
<P>
International co-operation will focus on treating pollution in
major river basins, oceans and cities, and on environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government welcomes loans and grants from
governments and world organizations, and also encourages overseas
business people and no-governmental organizations to invest in the
environmental protection industry and carry out exchanges and co-
operation with China.
</P>
<P>
SEPA plans to conclude bilateral co-operation agreements or
memorandums with 40 more countries by 2002.
</P>
<P>
If the target is reached, a worldwide network of bilateral
environmental co-operation will be set up covering all five
continents, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
China has signed 30 environmental co-operation agreements and
memorandums with 27 countries including the United States, Canada
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has received 3.6 billion U.S. dollars in loans
and more than 420 million U.S. dollars in grants from foreign
countries and international organizations for environmental
protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Xie noted that SEPA will set up some international development
parks for the environmental protection industry in the next three
years, reports the paper.

<HEADLINE> Henman Eliminated from Mercedes-Benz Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tim Henman, the world
's fifth-ranked player, was eliminated by Frenchman Guillaume
Raoux 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in the first round of the Mercedes-Benz Cup
in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Henman, third seed of the tournament, had never lost a set to
Raoux in four previous matches.
</P>
<P>
"He's always a pretty dangerous player," Henman said after the
match. "Early on I let him dictate things too much. Very rarely
did I put him under pressure."
</P>
<P>
Henman said he didn't start feeling involved in the match until
he trailed 3-1 in the second set. By then, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
"It was windy and it was tough for him to make a good approach.
He missed a lot," the Frenchman said.
</P>
<P>
Raoux continued a habit of knocking out top players in Los
Angeles. He eliminated Ivanisevic last year before losing to
Henman in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Raoux defeated Mark Philippoussis and Patrick Rafter
to get to the semis.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)U.S. House Votes for Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Tuesday voted by an overwhelming majority to
give support to the extension of Normal Trading Relations(NTR)
with China.
</P>
<P>
The House, in a 260-170 vote, defeated a measure calling for
overturn of President Bill Clinton's decision to continue China's
NTR status, which will allow the entry of Chinese goods into U.S.
market at the same low tariff rates offered to most other nations
for another year.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Clinton's decision, which was made public on June
3, have argued that cutting off trade ties with China would worsen
U.S.-China relations as a whole and undermine American business
and consumer interests.
</P>
<P>
"While we have a boom in our economy, there is no question that
in order to sustain this economic boom we're going to have to
continue to maintain our technological leadership and expansion in
trade," said Representative Charles Rangel, the ranking Democrat
on the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that the whole thing for the next century is going "to
be trade, trade, trade and more trade".
</P>
<P>
Trade groups here hailed the House vote as a signal for
continued efforts by the U.S. government to strengthen business
ties with the most populous and economically promising country in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business
federation representing more than three million businesses and
organizations of every size, sector and region, praised the House
for "resisting protectionism, opening markets and securing jobs
for American workers" in its vote for normal trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
Dana Mead, Chairman of the Business Roundtable (BRT), lauded
Tuesday's vote as "the opening round in the fight to finally
open the world's largest marketplace to American workers, farmers,
products and companies".
</P>
<P>
"China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is the
next key step -- one we hope Congress will take promptly, once a
final market-opening trade agreement is reached," he said in a
news release.
</P>
<P>
Philip M. Condit, Chairman of BRT International Trade &AMP;
Investment Task force and Chairman &AMP; CEO of the Boeing Company,
said in a statement that the House vote is "a clear demonstration
that Congress and the Administration continue to believe that
normal trade with China is crucial to not only strong and stable
commercial relations, but to the broader U.S.-China relationship."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that this strong signal will help move
forward the process of negotiating China's accession to the WTO,
thereby laying the foundation for U.S. extension of permanent NTR
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Business Coalition for U.S.-China, in a news release,
welcomed the overwhelming vote by the House in support of
continued NTR to China, describing it as an indication of "the
strength of bipartisan Congressional support for U.S. engagement
and for stable and improved U.S.-China relations".
</P>
<P>
The vote, and the equally overwhelming 87-12 Senate vote on the
Smith Resolution last week, "clear the way for speedy resumption
of negotiations over the terms and conditions for China's
accession to the World Trade Organization," said the group which
consists of 1,200 leading American companies, trade associations,
and farm organizations.
</P>
<P>
United Technologies, a 25.7 billion-dollar, Fortune-50 company,
also gave blessings to the House vote, saying that it offered
support to "hundreds of thousands of American jobs, a strong U.S.
economy, and an increased standard of living for Chinese
employees."
</P>
<P>
Ruth R. Harkin, senior vice president for international affairs
and government relations of United Technologies Corporation, said
in a statement that China, with a quarter of the world's
population, provides a market with enormous potential for both
large and small U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing China into the WTO and granting it permanent normal
trade relations will make doing business with China fairer and
easier for American companies, resulting in the creation of
high-paying, quality jobs and a stronger, more competitive U.S.
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administrations, no matter whether they come from the
Republican or the Democrat Party, have won an uninterruptive
support for the annual renewal of China's NTR, used to be known as
MFN (Most Favored Nation), from the Congress ever since 1980,
despite the ups and downs in relationship between the two
countries in the past two decades.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) will expel its top women's shuttler Mia Audina
from its training program after she requested permission to reside
in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with her husband Tylio Lobman.
</P>
<P>
PBSI executive director Karsono said the decision was made on
Monday in a meeting of chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, the PBSI
official in charge of athletes development Mangombar Ferdinand
Siregar, head coach Christian Hadinata, vice secretary-general
Tanri Bali and himself.
</P>
<P>
"Mia requested that she be allowed to move to the Netherlands
but keep playing for Indonesia. But Subagyo declined the request
and ordered me to speak to Mia," Karsono was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I talked to her this (Tuesday) afternoon at about 4 p.m. and I
conveyed PBSI's decision, but she insisted she would move to the
Netherlands. I also explained to her that she would be expelled
from the National Training Center if she insisted on doing so. She
can't play for Indonesia if she lives in the Netherlands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Karsono ruled out the possibility of a change in the decision.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of paperwork. PBSI is waiting for Mia's
letter saying she wants to move to the Netherlands, and then we
will issue a letter on her expulsion. The decision is final. We
also will send a letter to the International Badminton Federation
(IBF) and official sponsor Yonex on the matter," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, 19-year-old Mia declined to give a definitive
answer on whether she would join Tylio, who was born in Suriname
but holds Dutch citizenship, in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"Tylio has business with some friends there and it will be hard
for him to
find a job here due to the uncertain circumstances. Tylio has
always supported me in my effort to qualify for the Olympic Games
next year in Sydney. I really want to compete in the Olympics,"
the Olympic silver medalist said.
</P>
<P>
Former coach Retno Kustiyah regretted Mia'a decision and feared
it would destroy her chances of competing in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"If she was expelled from PBSI now, she might not be able to
play in the Olympics. An IBF regulation says she can play for
another country if she has lived there for about two years.
</P>
<P>
Retno said it was a pity Mia's career was in jeopardy when she
should be in the prime of her career.
</P>
<P>
Coach Liang Chiusia claimed to have no idea of Mia's future
plans.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a PBSI source as saying that Mia sold her
Toyota Corolla and would sell her land in Bekasi as she prepared
to move. Mia's mother died earlier this year and she is estranged
from her father.

QUITO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian government has denied
that Colombian guerrillas are operating in the country, according
to the local press Tuesday.

JAKARTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Weightlifting,
Powerlifting and Body Building Federation is seeking to send five
lifters to the World Championships in Athens, Greece, the
Indonesian Observer reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The event will be the qualifying showcase ahead of the Sydney
Olympics next year.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary Djoko Promono conceded that, financially, the
federation would seem prepared to send only Sri Indriyani to the
event, which will run from November 21 to 28.
</P>
<P>
"We had expected to dispatch five lifters, but we only have
money enough for Sri Indriyani so far," Djoko said, adding that
the five should include two males and three females but he did not
name them.
</P>
<P>
Djoko said that Sri had been prioritized to go given the fact
that she was fully prepared for the event.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Indriyani gets financial support from the Olympic
Solidarity program. We have yet to ensure money for others," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sri, 21, has managed to lift 84 kilograms in the snatch in the

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Economy Dampens in First 5 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's economic growth slowed
down in the first five months this year with major economic
indexes falling considerably compared with the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the Central Statistic Bureau show that
industrial output during the period rose only 6.2 percent, less
than half the rate registered in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The export of industrial products climbed by 17 percent to half
the growth recorded a year ago while the foreign trade deficit
reached 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, up 320 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports to European Union countries increased 11 percent, but
still 16 percentage points less than that posted in the first five
months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
While economic growth dragged, macro-economic leverage also
deteriorated in Hungary during the period, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The national budget deficit topped 391 billion forints (about 1.
6 billion dollars), up 70 percent, while the international balance
in trade reached 820 million dollars in the red, almost double on
a year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts believe that the slackening of the EU economy
has posed a great impact on Hungary's economy, especially its
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The 78-day NATO air campaign against neighboring Yugoslavia is
also blamed for the slow down of the Hungarian economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- During the first six months of
1999, 42,000 Sri Lankans found employment in Saudi Arabia which is
the largest job market for Sri Lankan migrant workers, according
to the latest survey issued Monday by the Bureau of Foreign
Employment here.
</P>
<P>
At present 250,000 Sri Lankans are employed in Saudi Arabia
while around 125,000 others are holding jobs in Kuwait which has
been the second largest employer of Sri Lankan workers. The
United Arab Emirates, with 105,000 Sri Lankan workers, is the
third prominent job supplier for the country's migrant workers,
the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Higher salaries paid by employers and several welfare measures
including medical facilities provided to migrant workers have
induced more and more Sri Lankans to seek employment in the Middle
East, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.2 million Sri Lankans working abroad,
bringing a large amount of foreign exchange into the country, and
80 percent of them are female. Around 70 percent of the Sri Lankan
workers are currently in the Middle East countries and others are
employed in countries such as Cyprus, the Maldives, Italy,
Singapore and China's Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> EU Consumption of Banned Synthetic Drugs on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU), in
addition to having between 750,000 and one million heroin addicts,
is consuming more banned synthetic drugs.
</P>
<P>
The EU has registered "a dramatic rise in the consumption of
amphetamines and ecstasy," which has already surpassed that of
hashish, said director of the EU Drug Unit Police (EUROPOL) Willy
Braggeman.
</P>
<P>
Braggeman explained that the use of amphetamines and ecstasy is
not restricted to weekends, and their wide availability hinders
police seizure operations.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in spite of the number of deaths caused by
these synthetic drugs each year, "their modern and youthful image
means their popularity has not diminished."
</P>
<P>
For Braggeman, the development of new technology, such as the
Internet, has helped organized crime make transnational deals.
Crime groups are also taking advantage of frequent and large-scale
free movement of people, goods and capital across borders of EU
member states.
</P>
<P>
Georges Esteivenart, director of the European Observatory of
Drugs and Toxins, said the EU's main task in the next few years
would be to fight against the consumption of synthetic drugs, such
as ecstasy and amphetamines.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Science books started becoming
more popular in the Chinese capital after the government banned
the Falun Dafa sect on July 22.
</P>
<P>
Special shelves have been set up in major Beijing bookstores
for books on astronomy, geology, and biology, and on anti-
superstition. An executive with Sanlian, a large Beijing bookstore,
says they have added 60 different science books and have sold 1,
000 copies in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The founder of Falun Dafa (Falun Gong), Li Hongzhi, has said
that the earth will soon explode, causing many people to commit
suicide, so the bookstore has arranged lectures on this so-called
"1999 catastrophe", with astronomers explaining why in fact the
earth is safe and this has increased sales.
</P>
<P>
At the Capital Book Building, about 200 copies of "Aspiring to
Science and Eradicating Superstition" have been sold in two days.
</P>
<P>
One customer said that Falun Gong's popularity was a result of
the lack of scientific information among the general public, so he
had decided to read more about astronomy and biology.
</P>
<P>
Many publishing houses have decided to use this in a related
way. Xinhua Publishing House, for example, has released a new book,
"Exposing The True Face of Falun Gong", which has become a best
seller.
</P>
<P>
And many people have called People's Publishing House to order
several new books, including "A brief Introduction to Materialism
and Atheism".
</P>
<P>
People have also been going to the National Library to borrow
these books in greater numbers.

PRAGUE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic registered a
sharp decline in its foreign trade deficit in the first half of
1999, according to statistics released by the Czech State
Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade saw a robust growth in the period
with imports at 224 billion koruna (5.3 billion U.S. dollars) and
exports at 196.7 billion koruna (4.7 billion dollars), up 1.6
percent and 9.3 percent respectively compared with the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade deficit in the first half of this year was 27.
3 billion koruna (650 million dollars), down 32.5 percent from the

</P>
<P>
The deficit for the entire year is estimated at 60 billion
koruna (1.43 billion dollars), which will be the lowest in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Economists attribute the notable decline to a series of
austerity policies taken by the government. A seven-percent tariff
rate was imposed starting on June 1, which involves three fourths

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Companies Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's banking,
telecommunications and electricity industries are upbeat that
their computerized systems will be fully prepared for the
millennium bug by the end of 1999, The Jakarta Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Bank Indonesia Sjahril Sabirin said the central
bank is 95 percent ready and over 74 percent of about 160 banks
operating in the country already have their banking systems Y2K
compliant.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the entire Indonesian banking sector will be
compliant before the end of the year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia expects all its systems and infrastructure to be
Y2K compliant before the end of August, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sjahril said that thus far the government has yet to decide
whether to impose bank holidays by the turn of the century to
avoid banking activities from being affected by the millennium
bug.
</P>
<P>
However, Bank Indonesia's Director of Technology and
Information Ending Fajar said the bank planned to impose a one-day
holiday on December 30 for banks to print all data as a backup in
case of system failure.
</P>
<P>
Y2K refers to problems computerized systems will face at the
turn of the century, when their two-digit-year counters fail to
distinguish between 1900 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The glitch may cause computers to shut down or fail to function
properly. Power supplies may drop, telephones and transportation
systems may stop operation and automated banking transactions may
fail.
</P>
<P>
State telecommunication company PT Telkom's head of information
system division Wim Mozardi said the country's local fixed lines
and domestic long-distance telephone services are 80 percent ready
in case of Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
Telkom would have its most critical system, including billing
and satellite transmission, completely Y2K compliant by September,
Mozardi said.
</P>
<P>
Telkom would prepare copies of all types of telecommunications
made from December 1 to December 31 as backup on reliable mediums
to anticipate possible computer failure.
</P>
<P>
Another state-owned telecommunications company PT Indosat,
which controls the country's international long-distance
telecommunications service, said it is also prepared for the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state-owned electricity company PT PLN said it is 96
percent ready for Y2K problems and expects to complete its
compliance program by the end of September this year.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Jonathan Parapak of the government's Y2K team said
the government expects that export-oriented industries will obtain
certification on Y2K readiness to boost their competitiveness in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
"The process of getting Y2K readiness-certified should not be
seen as a burden for those companies but a solution to the Y2K
problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
As the year 2000 is approaching, Indonesian companies are
struggling to make themselves Y2K compliant. The severe economic
crisis that has battered the country's economy and ruined its
companies has left a significant number of companies ill-prepared
for the millennium bug.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela, Mexico Refute U.S. Oil Anti-Dumping Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and Mexico will join
hands to counter dumping charges filed by a U.S. oil group,
visiting Venezuelan Minister for Energy and Mines Ali Rodriguez
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is "a cascade of arguments to bury" the
anti-dumping case brought to the U.S. Department of Commerce by
Save Domestic Oil Inc., a group of independent U.S. crude
producers.
</P>
<P>
The Oklakoma-based organization filed the petition on June 29,
asking the government to impose penalties against oil imports from
Iraq, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, which they claim are
selling oil at government-subsidized prices to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the action "is a rash idea" which may "create
such a disturbance in the market" that even the "U.S. government
will not allow it" to continue.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told reporters last
Friday that he saw little chance of success of the lawsuit as "it
does not appear that this group has widespread support." Without
sufficient backing, the Commerce Department may dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia have all refuted the dumping
accusation, saying they are selling oil at agreed international
market prices.
</P>
<P>
The visiting minister also said Venezuela and Mexico would
renew the San Jose agreement on August 3 to provide crude to
Central American and Caribbean countries under favorable
conditions.

BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
People's Daily
</P>
<P>
-- A People's Daily commentary calls for all-out efforts to
solve the problem of insufficient demands in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and
the State Council have recently unveiled a series of major
policies and macro-economic tuning measures, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to step up efforts in implementing an active
fiscal policy, bring into full play monetary measures, and
supplement these with economic levers such as taxation and prices
so as to spur up consumption, investment and export demands, and
ensure a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the economy,
it says.
</P>
<P>
-- People in the provinces of Sichuan and Jiangxi continues to
criticize Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua Daily Telegraph
</P>
<P>
-- A commentary by the Xinhua News Agency says that there is
no space in the world for the existence of Lee Teng-hui's "two
states" remarks, which preached "state-to-state" relations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Lee's remarks have not only aroused unanimous opposition from
the international community, but also reinforced the wide
acceptance of the "One China" policy and further isolated Lee Teng-
hui, it notes.
</P>
<P>
The reason Lee's "two states" remarks have been rebuffed
internationally is that it violates the basic norms of
international laws which stipulate that in a sovereign state,
there is only one government representing its sovereignty, the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
-- People in various localities expose and criticize Falun Gong,
and vow to maintain the social stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- The Chinese and U.S. governments will work together to
improve Sino-U.S. ties, a decision that is in the best interests
of both countries, high-ranking officials of the two countries
agreed.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to Sino-U.S. ties and is
willing to conduct constructive consultations with the U.S. on the
basis of equality and mutual development, Chinese Foreign Trade
Minister Shi Guangsheng said to visiting U.S. Under Secretary of
Commerce David Aaron.
</P>
<P>
-- China is to open its environmental protection sector more
widely to international investment and collaboration in the next
three years, a top official said in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Efficient Energy Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China is taking measures to
promote energy conservation technologies to meet a tremendous
demand for high-quality energy, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
China's annual consumption of coal, which accounts for 76
percent of the country's total energy resources for commercial use,
are expected to triple by 2020, along with a rapid increase in the
use of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
"Energy conservation using advanced technologies is still the
best way to tackle the energy shortage," Zuo Liming, director of
the State Economic and Trade Commission's Energy Conservation
Information dissemination Center (SECIDC), was quoted by the
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, China's industrial enterprises are consuming more
energy than developed countries based on the same amount of output,
which not only increases costs, but aggravates environmental
pollution.
</P>
<P>
"It is of vital significance that available effective energy
conservation technologies are fully publicized and promoted to the
enterprises," Zuo said, adding that only 20 percent of the market'
s technological potential has been explored.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SECIDC, established last year with a 35-
million-U.S.dollar donation from the Global Environment Foundation
to disseminate industrially practical energy conservation methods,
will develop 100 exemplary cases of energy-efficient products and
provide technological guidance to China's enterprises during the
next five years.

WINNIPEG, Canada, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Pan Am royal guest
Princess Anne has received the aboriginal name Ogimaakwens from
members of the Anishinaabe Nation during a traditional native
ceremony at the Aboriginal Center in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
Loosely translated as Chief Princess, the newly-named
Ogimaakwens sat among a group of about 150 people with a handful
of aboriginal elders.
</P>

Queen Victoria was the first to be honored with an Anishinaabe
name, after treaties were signed during her reign. She was given
the name Gichi Ogimaa Kwe, meaning supreme leader of or
spokeswoman of the Crown.

<P>
Princess Anne, member of the International Olympic Committee (
IOC), was here for the Pan Am equestrian competitions, indulging

<HEADLINE> Australian Gallery Gets Major Hockney Painting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Gallery of Australia
has acquired a major oil painting by David Hockney at a cost of 3
million U.S. dollars, the Canberra Times said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The painting, titled A Bigger Grand Canyon, measures two meters
high by 7.4 meters wide and is composed of 60 canvases, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Hockney, born in England in 1937, moved to California, the
United States, during the 1960s. He has been engaged in tackling
the panoramic subject of the Grand Canyon, which he has described
as unphotographable, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The painting exceeds Jackson Pollock's Blue Poles, bought by
the gallery in 1973 at a cost of 858,000 U.S. dollars, which is
4.8 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
Brian Kennedy, director of the gallery, was quoted as saying
the work was bought in February this year through a U.S. art
dealership in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
But he and one of the gallery's senior curators, Jane Kinsman,
had seen the work during its completion in Hockney's California
studio last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Agree to Start Talks on Arms Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Russia
agreed on Tuesday to begin talks on START III and the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty next month in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and
visiting Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepashin reaffirmed that
it is in the interests of both the U.S. and Russia to reduce their
nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we both understand that there are ballistic
missile threats we both face that do not come from each other,
but from other nations. That is why it is important...to discuss
implications for the ABM Treaty should the United States decide to
deploy a National Missile Defense," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
The ABM Treaty was signed in 1972 between the Soviet Union and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Gore, Stepashin told reporters
that the Russian government will try to persuade the Russian
parliament, Duma, to approve the START II, under which both sides
will cut their nuclear arsenals to 3,500 warheads by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-U.S. relations has been pushed to its lowest point
since the end of the Cold War when the U.S.-led NATO conducted an
air campaign against Yugoslavia. Stepashin's visit is to mend the
strained relations.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement reaffirmed the importance for ensuring the
continued vitality of the U.S.-Russian relationship and
encouraging "practical cooperation of benefit to both countries."
</P>
<P>
Both Gore and Stepashin told reporters that they are satisfied
with the outcome of their meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are entering the 21st century. We have to enter it as
friends," Stepashin said. "We have to understand each other. We
have to respect each other."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the meeting went "extremely well", Gore stressed:
"I'd like to say on a personal note that I have enjoyed my
friendship with Sergei Stepashin."
</P>
<P>
"In this new era, strong U.S.-Russia ties will be an essential
component of American national security and global stability,"
Gore said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin and Gore will meet in the evening again before the
Russian prime minister leave Washington for Moscow late Tuesday
night.

<HEADLINE> An Unrepentant Bailey Defends His decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Former world record
holder Donovan Bailey said he is not sorry about his decision to
turn down Athletics Canada's (AC) late approach and opt out of the
men's 100m race at the Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it wasn't a choice that was made by me, so I can't
regret something I have no control over," the Pan Am poster boy
said after warming up with the 4X100 relay team at the University
of Manitoba Stadium, where he'll run the first leg of the event in
tomorrow's heats and then in Friday night's final.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian was referring to AC's original decision not to
name him to run in the 100 after he, just recovering form an
archilles injury, finished only the third place behind Bruny Surin
and Brad McCuaig at the Pan Am trials in June.
</P>
<P>
Surin withdrew almost immediately to compete in the more
lucrative European Grand Prix and Bailey was asked to take his
place. The defending Olympic champion, whose pride appeared to
have been hugely hurt, declined and went to his Toronto training
base.
</P>
<P>
"I made a decision when the decision was made for me that I was
not going to run the 100," he said. "I'll say it 1,000 times: I
was not selected. If I'm not selected, I then make a decision that
I'm going to take a couple of days off and rest. If I was selected,
then I'd go back and train for it."
</P>
<P>
Bailey has been paid 200,000 Canadian dollars by the Winnipeg
Pan Am Games committee to promote and endorse the tournament. When
asked why the so-called ambassador of the Games wasn't here for
Friday night's opening ceremony, he said:
</P>
<P>
"I've never been at an opening ceremony because it's five or
six hours of ceremonial type things and us sprinters, when we're
competing, we have to rest our legs in order to bring back a medal.
"
</P>
<P>
Bailey's previous best mark of 9:84, which he set at the
Atlanta Olympics three years ago, was shattered by American
Maurice Greene whose new record stands a stunning 9:79.
</P>
<P>
Greene, who said his priority was the world championships in
Spain in August, also snubbed the Pan Am Games.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Rowing Champion also Winner in Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Four months ago, Emma
Robinson underwent surgery for thyroid cancer.
</P>
<P>
The Winnipeg rower completed a golden come-back by bringing
home Pan Am gold yesterday at Lake Minnedosa, as she and partner
Theresa Luke powered gracefully past the 20-km pairs competition.
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel proud to be able to compete at home,"
Robinson said after she and Luke finished eight seconds ahead of
Americans Karen Kraft and Missy Ryan. "I'm really happy to be here
and I'm happy that things seem to be fully recovered."
</P>
<P>
Robinson's determination to resume training within days of
surgery and radiation treatment has inspired Luke to achieve her
best. "I'm able to say, 'Wow, if she can do that, I can do that
and more.'"
</P>
<P>
Other than a few days when she had to stay away from her
teammates because she was radioactive, Robinson said health
problems have not affected her training.
</P>
<P>
The type of thyroid cancer Robinson faced is much more
treatable than most cancers, giving her a 95 per cent chance of
surviving at least another five years.
</P>
<P>
Robinson, a medical student at the University of Toronto, said
cancer made her pay more attention to the world outside of rowing,
but it also reaffirmed her decision to take a two-year leave from
medical school to train for next year's Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
She now has less than a month to get ready for the World
Championships in St. Catharines, Canada, where she is expected to
qualify for the Olympics in both the pairs and women's eight, and
has a good chance of winning gold.
</P>
<P>
Teammates have been blown away by how Robinson dealt with her
cancer, but the Winnipegger minimizes it, "I just wants to be
treated as a rower," she said.

<HEADLINE> Holmes Given Chance for Athletics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- British national 800 and 1,500-
meter records holder Kelly Holmes has been chosen to represent
Britain at the World Championships in Seville, Spain next month.
</P>
<P>
In the first wave of selections announced on Tuesday, Holmes,
who won bronze and silver medals over the distances in the 1995
Championships, has been given the option of making up her own mind
which event she runs in.
</P>
<P>
After winning a fourth 800m title on Sunday, Holmes said: "My
focus is still definitely on the 1,500 but I am trying to keep my
options open.
</P>
<P>
"I need a couple more races at the top level to find out what
my strengths and weaknesses are. At the moment I'm aiming for the
1,500m."
</P>
<P>
The team selection contains few controversial choices although
last year's European javelin silver medallist Mick Hill will be
relieved to see his name on the list after finishing fourth behind
Steve Backley, Nick Nieland and Mark Roberson in the trials.
</P>
<P>
The selectors are clearly banking on the experience and
consistency of Hill who has failed to make the final on only one
occasion, the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, having competed in
every major championship between 1986 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Others chosen in addition to Diane Modahl, who missed the
trials, are the injured triple jumpers Jonathan Edwards and Ashia
Hansen and high hurdler Tony Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
High jumper Ben Challenger and Radcliffe were given exemptions
from taking part in the Birmingham meeting having proved
themselves with victories in the World University Games and
European Challenge.

<HEADLINE> English Football Adopts Rugby Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The 10-yard law, adapted from rugby
union, is to undergo trials in English domestic football next
season, the BBC reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Referees will be able to move the ball 10 yards towards the
offending team's goal if a bookable offense, such as dissent or
time-wasting, is committed after the ball is placed for a free-
kick.
</P>
<P>
The law will initially only be applied in the Auto Windscreens
Shield and two divisions of the semi-professional Central Midlands
League.
</P>
<P>
But a Football Association spokesman said that if the measure
proved successful it was "quite feasible" that it could be
introduced as a permanent change to Law 13 in time for the 2002
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The experiment began in Jersey last season, where it is
understood to have been hugely successful in reducing the
unnecessary delays that can arise from the awarding of free-kicks.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, the world governing body for football, is keen to reduce
such disruptions and improve the flow of the game at the highest
levels.
</P>
<P>
The FA said that it is not aware of any other country adopting
the same initiative.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, we are the guinea pigs and we are very happy
to be so," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It raises the possibility that a player who, for example,
repeatedly dissents could see his team pushed back 30 or 40 yards,
although he is likely to be carded before such a situation arises.
</P>
<P>
And if the law is invoked within 10 yards of the penalty box, a
free kick inside the box will be awarded, reviving an almost
extinct aspect of the game.

<HEADLINE> Anelka Transfer Abandoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Arsenal have taken troubled striker Nicolas Anelka off the
transfer list, apparently bringing to an end his protracted
attempt to leave Highbury.
</P>
<P>
But Lazio, the Italian club that was preparing to sign him for
22 million pounds, said that talks over the player's future were
not at an end.
</P>
<P>
A statement on Arsenal's Internet site said: "It has always
been Arsenal Football Club's wish to retain the services of
Nicolas Anelka.
</P>
<P>
"He is an exceptional young talent and it remains our primary
concern that the player respects his contract with the Club. "
</P>
<P>
The Gunners confirmed conflicting rumors that separate
negotiations were held with two Italian clubs - Lazio and Juventus
- but "it would appear that personal terms were not concluded and
therefore a transfer to either club was unable to proceed".
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that manager Arsene Wenger's
priority is "to have the team fully settled and prepared for the
forthcoming campaign".
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of a firm agreement for the transfer of Nicolas
Anelka, the club has withdrawn the possibility of the player
departing, and expect him to resume full training with Arsenal
this week."
</P>
<P>
However, Lazio refused to accept the Gunners' statement, saying:
"We deny that at this point talks with Arsenal over the possible
sale of the player are concluded, directly or indirectly."
</P>
<P>
Anelka had threatened legal action if his desire to join the
Rome club was not met. It is unclear if he still intends to
proceed with any action.
</P>
<P>
Anelka had been on the verge of signing for Juventus, before
being immediately loaned out to Serie A rivals Lazio, according to
reports in the Italian press.
</P>
<P>
The Italians were thought to have put together a deal
reportedly worth 80,000-a-week, with a player swap - Thierry Henry
- as part of the package.
</P>
<P>
The latest twist to the transfer saga was unveiled at a meeting
in Rome on Monday between Lazio's owner, Sergio Cragnotti, and
Juventus director general, Luciano Moggi.
</P>
<P>
Cragnotti, broke off talks last week with Arsenal after the
club refused to reduce their 20m price tag for French player.
</P>
<P>
The new deal would have met Arsenal's demands in full, and seen
Juventus winger Henry join the Gunners before the start of the new
season.

WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Wednesday voted by an overwhelming majority to
give support to the extension of Normal Trading Relations(NTR)
with China.
</P>
<P>
The House, in a 260-170 vote, defeated a measure calling for
overturn of President Bill Clinton's decision to continue China's
NTR status, which will allow the entry of Chinese goods into U.S.
market at the same low tariff rates offered to most other nations
for another year.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Clinton's decision, which was made public on June
3, have argued that cutting off trade ties with China would worsen
U.S.-China relations as a whole and undermine American business
and consumer interests.
</P>
<P>
"While we have a boom in our economy, there is no question that
in order to sustain this economic boom we're going to have to
continue to maintain our technological leadership and expansion in
trade," said Representative Charles Rangel, the ranking Democrat
on the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that the whole thing for the next century is going "to
be trade, trade, trade and more trade".
</P>
<P>
Trade groups here hailed the House vote as a signal for
continued efforts by the U.S. government to strengthen business
ties with the most populous and economically promising country in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business
federation representing more than three million businesses and
organizations of every size, sector and region, praised the House
for "resisting protectionism, opening markets and securing jobs
for American workers" in its vote for normal trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
Dana Mead, Chairman of the Business Roundtable (BRT), lauded
Wednesday's vote as "the opening round in the fight to finally
open the world's largest marketplace to American workers, farmers,
products and companies".
</P>
<P>
"China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is the
next key step -- one we hope Congress will take promptly, once a
final market-opening trade agreement is reached," he said in a
news release.
</P>
<P>
Philip M. Condit, Chairman of BRT International Trade &AMP;
Investment Task force and Chairman &AMP; CEO of the Boeing Company,
said in a statement that the House vote is "a clear demonstration
that Congress and the Administration continue to believe that
normal trade with China is crucial to not only strong and stable
commercial relations, but to the broader U.S.-China relationship."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that this strong signal will help move
forward the process of negotiating China's accession to the WTO,
thereby laying the foundation for U.S. extension of permanent NTR
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Business Coalition for U.S.-China, in a news release,
welcomed the overwhelming vote by the House in support of
continued NTR to China, describing it as an indication of "the
strength of bipartisan Congressional support for U.S. engagement
and for stable and improved U.S.-China relations".
</P>
<P>
The vote, and the equally overwhelming 87-12 Senate vote on the
Smith Resolution last week, "clear the way for speedy resumption
of negotiations over the terms and conditions for China's
accession to the World Trade Organization," said the group which
consists of 1,200 leading American companies, trade associations,
and farm organizations.
</P>
<P>
United Technologies, a 25.7 billion-dollar, Fortune-50 company,
also gave blessings to the House vote, saying that it offered
support to "hundreds of thousands of American jobs, a strong U.S.
economy, and an increased standard of living for Chinese
employees."
</P>
<P>
Ruth R. Harkin, senior vice president for international affairs
and government relations of United Technologies Corporation, said
in a statement that China, with a quarter of the world's
population, provides a market with enormous potential for both
large and small U.S. businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing China into the WTO and granting it permanent normal
trade relations will make doing business with China fairer and
easier for American companies, resulting in the creation of
high-paying, quality jobs and a stronger, more competitive U.S.
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administrations, no matter whether they come from the
Republican or the Democrat Party, have won an uninterruptive
support for the annual renewal of China's NTR, used to be known as
MFN (Most Favored Nation), from the Congress ever since 1980,
despite the ups and downs in relationship between the two
countries in the past two decades.
