<HEADLINE> Cyprus Calls for Measures to Cope with Severe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- To mark the upcoming World Water
Day, Cyprus today issued an announcement appealing to the public
to economize on water resources to cope with a continuing
drought.
</P>
<P>
The official announcement, issued by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment to mark the
occasion that falls on Sunday, said that this year's World Water
Day is dedicated to the weather and water supplies in cities, a
topic which is of particular interest to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"City expansion makes water shortage more acute, affects
natural water resources and increases transport costs," the
announcement added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus covers its water needs to a great extent from annual
rainfall and this makes the island dependent on weather
conditions, especially when a continuing drought hits the island
country.
</P>
<P>
The announcement also noted that water supplies in the island's
reservoirs are at their worst record in the past 10 years and fall
far short of half of their capacity.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Cypriot government adopted strict measures
to save fresh water as the island's water reserves are currently
at the lowest level since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The measures include reduction of water supply and increase of
water reserves.
</P>
<P>
Since January, water supply to the households in the country
has been reduced by 20 percent, with the water supply provided
only three days a week. Water for farming purposes has also been
decreased by up to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to alleviate the water shortage, the
Cypriot government has invested to construct the first
desalination plant on the island, which will be operational next
month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government also approved a plan for setting up a
second desalination plant near the southern town of Larnaca,
which will be completed by 1998.

<HEADLINE> More Resources to Fight HIV/AIDS Urged in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia'sn government ministries
have been urged to budget for resources to combat the HIV/AIDS
pandemic which is killing many people in the country.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Deputy Minister of Health Nkandu Luo at
a HIV/AIDS conference for government permanent secretaries in
Livingstone, Southern Province, today.
</P>
<P>
She said that the control of HIV/AIDS cannot be left to the
national AIDS program alone as the ministry of health needs
support and cooperation from other government ministries,
non-governmental organizations and other cooperative partners.
</P>
<P>
Luo said the Ministry of Finance has no budget for fighting
AIDS. ''you cannot fight HIV/AIDS without money, the Ministry of
Finance must understand and allocate enough resources to
ministries for the fight and control of HIV/AIDS,'' she urged.
</P>
<P>
Luo appealed to the Ministries of Education, Science and
Technology, Youth and Sports, Information and Finance to take a
great challenge in fostering the fight against HIV/AIDS by
contributing in their respective roles.
</P>
<P>
The pandemic of HIV/AIDS is particularly grave among the youth
with many of them in the age group of 14 to 25 years dying of the
disease.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged for Water Preservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Day for Water was
observed here today as Ethiopians were urged to use water
economically and carefully, conscious of the depletion and
unbalanced distribution of the water resource.
</P>
<P>
The call came from a statement issued here today by the
Ministry of Water Resources which noted that water is one of the
natural endowments decisive for civilization to thrive.
</P>
<P>
However, it said saline sea and ocean water is 97.5 percent of
the world water body while the remaining 2.5 percent is found in
the form of ice and underground water among which only 0.3
percent of the world water is potable.
</P>
<P>
referring to water shortage in the world, the ministry said
polluted water is the cause for 50 percent of communicable
diseases in the world and 20 percent of the world population have
no access to clean water, adding that about 25 million people,
most of whom are in developing countries, die of water-borne
diseases annually.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, which is now engaged in studying and formulating
policies to speed up the activities geared toward water
development, pledged its support to efforts for water development
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The World Day for Water is observed on March 22 every year in
line with resolutions of the 47th conference of the United
Nations. The theme of this year's celebration is "Water Scarce".

TIRANA -- Albania's presidential spokesman today dismissed
calls for embattled President Sali Berisha to quit, saying it was
unacceptable to force a legally reelected president to resign.
</P>
<P>
In response to fresh calls by rebels in southern Albania that
Berisha should resign, Genc Pollo said Berisha was reelected by
parliament and it was unacceptable to force the president to
resign with a gun pointed at his head.
</P>
<P>
Berisha was re-elected unopposed to a second five-year term by
a parliament dominated by his Democratic Party early this month.
But he is facing the worst unrest of his rule.

WASHINGTON -- The United States has decided to send several
hundred of troops to West Africa for a possible evacuation of
U.S. citizens from Zaire, Pentagon said in a statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Defense has directed the U.S. European
Command to deploy enabling forces, consisting of several hundred
personnel, as part of contingency planning for a possible future
evacuation from Zaire," it said.

However, this deployment does not represent a U.S. commitment
to any particular course of action, the statement added.

UNITED NATIONS -- For the second time in two weeks, the United
States on Friday vetoed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution
calling upon Israel to call off its plan to build 6,500 Jewish
housing units in Jabal Abu Ghneim, east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen members voted in favor of the draft resolution which
was sponsored by the Arab countries. The United States cast the
lone negative vote. Costa Rica, a non-permanent member of the
council, abstained.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Al-Kidwa, the permanent observer of Palestine to the
United Nations, harshly criticized Washington for vetoing the
draft in the aftermath of Israel's actual commencement of the
building of the new settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim.

HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government will this
year provide an additional 4.9 million U.S. Dollars for
Zimbabwe's family planning program, U.S. First Lady Hillary
Clinton said here today.
</P>
<P>
In her statement at Harare's Kuwadzana clinic, Mrs. Clinton
expressed satisfaction with Zimbabwe's efforts to educate women
in modern methods of family planning amid growing concern about
Africa's bloated rate of population growth.
</P>
<P>
''We will build on that commitment and I am happy to say that
the United States government through the United States Agency for
International Development will this year make available a further
4.9 million U.S. Dollars,'' said the First Lady.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the funds will be used to purchase contraceptives
while the remainder will go toward supporting private sector
initiatives to promote family planning in society.
</P>
<P>
Harare Director of Health Services Lovemore Mbengeranwa said,
''our main emphasis now is to include men and the youth in the
program in light of the threat caused by HIV/AIDS in the city.''
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe are making efforts to bring the country's population
growth rate from the current 3.1 percent to match the world
standard of about 2.5 percent per annum.

HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's largest seed company,
Seed Co Ltd, is developing new seed varieties expected to benefit
the country's farmers, particularly those in drought-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
The company has already established a 900,000 U.S. Dollars
research station which it says has so far contributed to
increased research on seed varieties.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the company Barry Mccarter today said
research by the company had already resulted in new short season
and drought-resistant varieties of maize, sorghum, soya-beans and
sunflower seed.
</P>
<P>
The investment by the company at the research station included
developing the irrigation system, seed handling facility and
fencing the area. About 100 hectares of the total land is for
research purpose.
</P>
<P>
The extensive research program was expected to benefit farmers
in the country and the southern African region.

LUANDA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the
Angolan/South African Association of Friendship and Business
Development (CADAS) is important as it will consolidate bilateral
ties on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
This was said by Minister of Trade Gomes Maiato at the
ceremony of the founding of the CADAS here today on behalf of
Premier Franca Van-Dunem.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the CADAS will contribute to the
stability and development of southern Africa and to the promotion
of bilateral trade and exchange so that more joint ventures will
be set up in the future, Maiato noted.
</P>
<P>
Since both countries belong to the Southern African
Development Community, he said, the setting up of the CADAS
becomes more significant in that it will promote the development
of friendship and ties of cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
As a non-governmental organization, the CADAS is aimed at
promoting social and economic development of the two countries
and the exchanges of various organizations and personnel.
</P>
<P>
It will promote the establishment of joint structures on the
current basis so as to implement common projects, and the
exchanges in the fields of culture, technology, science and
sports.

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Al Gore started
his Asia tour on Saturday, aimed at expanding "cooperation" with
China and moving the relations between the two countries forward.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, an administration official said Gore's
visit to China was seen as "part of progression of steps that are
designed to help the United States and China move their relations
forward, hopefully can lead to direct contact at the highest
political levels.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to future exchanges of visits between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, which was
decided at the Asian-Pacific Economic and Cooperation meetings in
the Philippines last year when the two president held discussions
over the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
In his four days of visit to China, Gore will also "explore the
interests of the Chinese government in having a closer and highly
structured dialogue with us about the interrelationship between
economic development and environmental concerns," the
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
"He is going in furtherance of the Clinton administration's
objectives of attempting to expand the range of cooperation with
China, assist us to improve the relationship, create the basis for
entering the next millennium, the next century as partners," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In his eight-day trip to Asia, Gore will first stop in Japan
and hold talks with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto before
heading to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
After his visit to China, he will go to South Korea and visit
the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean Peninsula on Saturday before
returning to Washington.

Henie as the Norwegian won the first of her 10 world figure
skating titles in 1927.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Michelle Kwan took silver coming back from
fourth place after short program. Kwan actually won the free
skating with a superb artstic presentation.

<P>
Vanessa Gusmeroli of France, second in the short program
competition, won the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Lipinski, who had won the U.S.national tournament and the

the third consecutive major competition since the beginning of
February. She had marks of all 5.8 except for one 5.7 and 5.6 in
artistic.
</P>
<P>
Lipinski needed every jump and every mark to hold off Kwan, who
made a determined bid to hold on to the title that she won last
year.
</P>
<P>
Kwan did six clean triples and only scaled down one triple to a
double. Her program showed her maturity and gained two 5.8s and
seven 5.9s for presentation.

<P>
Gusmeroli held on for a medal with a program that started off
roughly but smoothed out.
</P>
<P>
Irina Slutskaya of Russia was fourth, battling back after a
hard fall in Friday's short program and practice Saturday
morning.

himself with the peace process here.
</P>
<P>
In a short briefing to newsmen at the airport here, Annan said
he was glad to visit Angola as the U.N. Chief and an African, a
country in which the United Nations has large scale peace-keeping
missions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Angolans are now tired of the war and eager
to achieve lasting peace, and so is the international community.
</P>

Annan hoped that Angola's peace process would make major
progress in the formation of a national united and reconciliation
government in recent days during his visit to the benefit of the
realization of lasting peace in Angola.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Wraps Up Visit to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI. March 22 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir today wrapped up a two-day visit to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) on a mediation offer by the Gulf state to help end
the escalating civil war in southern and eastern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Bashir discussed with UAE President Zayed Bin
Sultan al Nahyan the UAE's offer, which was made in February, on
helping the Sudanese government and rebels to realize
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The UAE offer underlines that resolving the current crisis in
Sudan needs consensus among all the Sudanese parties and factions.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also reviewed the latest developments of the
situation in Sudan in general.
</P>
<P>
Bashir said his country welcomed the UAE initiative as it does
not seek anything except establishing peace and stability in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese rebel alliance has hailed the UAE's offer last
month. The alliance groups the Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), the main southern rebel group, the Umma Party and the
Democratic Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
Nahyan stressed that the UAE would do its best to help Sudan go
out of its current crisis and achieve national reconciliation
among all of the Sudanese factions so as to maintain territorial
integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he called on the Sudanese leader to improve
Sudan's relations with its neighboring countries, according to UAE
news agency WAM.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Sudan and its neighbors Uganda and Eritrea
remained tense recently. Sudan has repeatedly accused the two
countries of being behind the rebels in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir arrived here Friday for a stopover on his way to
Pakistan where he will attend a summit of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference. He is scheduled to visit Yemen on his return
trip back to Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Strives to Promote Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Premier Kassu Ilala
said today his government is striving to improve infrastructural
development, organizational efficiency and information
dissemination to promote foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting observing Ethiopia's Export Day, Kassu said the
government is working to diversify export products, taking
advantage of the conducive atmosphere in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The government has plans to boost industrial production both
in quality and quantity, coupled with mineral resource
development which will be a promising source of revenue in
foreign trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier said policies concerning loans, investment,
tax and hard currency were revised to further enhance foreign
trade, an integral part of the revitalization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Exporters were allowed to keep a part of their earnings in
hard currency as an incentive to promote their involvement in the
sector, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia earned 2.8 billion Birr (about 430 million U.S.
Dollars) from the export sector last year. Among them, private
exporters earned some 1.5 billion Birr (about 230 million U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is the third annual Export Day observed in Ethiopia.

MAPUTO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Meningitis has claimed a total of

the fatal disease broke out in the middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed in the latest issue of the local weekly

But local residents said the toll could be much higher as many
deaths were not registered by the authority.
</P>
<P>
They said meningitis is currently still prevalent in Namuno
County of the province.
</P>

Doctors are even worried over a possible spread of the

<HEADLINE> 3 S. Leonean Journalists Charged With Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Three local journalists,
accused of spying, will spend the weekend at the maximum security
prison here after a Freetown magistrate court turned down defense
lawyers' application for bail on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The journalists from the bi-weekly newspaper Expo Times will
be brought to court again next Monday, state radio said here
today.
</P>
<P>
They include Ibrahim Seega-Shaw, the paper's publisher and
editor-in-chief, Charles Roberts, editor, and Gibrril Koroma,
general editor.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said between January and March this year, the
three newsmen "obtained secret official documents or extracts
containing secret military information which might be used
directly or indirectly by an enemy for use against the state."
</P>
<P>
They were arrested by the police last Wednesday after the
paper carried an article by Koroma under the heading "Abacha's
Wild West Gangsterism", accusing the Nigeria military leader of
"committing a serious blunder by detaining Foday Sankoh (former
leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front)" in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian High Commission in Freetown had later issued a
statement explaining that the Nigerian government was in no way
connected with the ousting of Sankoh from the leadership of the
RUF.
</P>
<P>
"Sankoh arrived in Lagos over a week ago with some of his
aides carrying arms and ammunition in clear contravention of
international law and he was subsequently arrested and detained,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone Association of Journalists also "dissociated
itself completely from the views expressed in Koroma's article as
it reflected the unshared opinion of the author," said the
Nigerian statement.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists in Freetown said today they are not sure
whether the article has any direct connection with the spying
charge.
</P>
<P>
The paper, in its Friday issue, gave a background to the
arrest of the three journalists, saying eight detectives who went
to the newspaper's office in central Freetown "carried a warrant
empowering them to search the premises for subversive documents".
</P>
<P>
In an accompanying editorial on Friday under the heading "No
Ill Feeling Meant", the paper said the article "was not an
editorial but an opinion."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore the article should not be seen as sending bad
signals in our cemented diplomatic relations with Nigeria, a
country that has really committed its military personnel just for
the sake of sustaining peace in the sub-region," the editorial
went on.
</P>
<P>
"We believe Nigeria has the right to maintain its internal
policies by arresting a criminal like Foday Sankoh who they
perceive to have breached the law of the land," it concluded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign diplomats in Freetown said they were
"surprised over the serious charges slammed on the three
journalists as it is the first time since independence in 1961
that any sierra Leonean or foreign national has been charged with
spying."

MOGADISHU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Mogadishu's Abgal clan elders
and those of the Habar Gidirs agreed at the end of the two-day
meeting here today on the suspension of hostility and the
releases of the hostages in northern part of the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to convene a broad-based meeting
next Wednesday to execute the agreed clauses.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held following the killing of eight men in the
capital Mogadishu by clan militiamen during the last two days.
</P>
<P>
The people of Mogadishu were shocked by the new wave of
killings. The victims included a former striker from the Somali
National Football Team, Bashir Abshir Dhorre who was killed in
north Mogadishu on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The tension in the capital turned high as Italian special
envoy to Somalia Giuseppe Cassini began his visit to Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Cassini, who arrived in the Somali capital on Thursday, has
met politicians from North Mogadishu as well as Hussein Aidid and
Osman Atto, the two major faction leaders in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Cassini, who is committed to bringing the warring factions to
the negotiation table, is also lobbying for the reopening of

<HEADLINE> Inauguration of Liberia's Electoral Body Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Controversy over the chairmanship
had delayed the inauguration of the Electoral Commission of
Liberia for the second time on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today said the induction of commission,
widely regarded as a landmark in the peace process in Liberia,
did not take place as expected in capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
A message from Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha who
is also chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), meanwhile, restated the need for Liberians to work
together in the interest of their country instead of the warring
factions.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the election of the chairman had resulted
in a 2-2 tie between Henry Andrew and Veteran journalist Gloria
Scott, at which point the chairwoman of the Liberia Council of
State used her constitutional power to interfere and Andrew was
elected.
</P>
<P>
But then Charles Taylor, Liberia's largest faction leader who
presented Gloria Scott, was displeased, claiming that the process
was unfair, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, the ECOWAS
chairman is now still confident of Ruth Perry's ability to run
the affairs of Liberia and the May 30 election date remains
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"Time is not on our side but we are managing peace and could
not rush into any decision that would precipitate conflict or
derail the transition program," said Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
The new date for the inauguration of the electoral commission
has been set for April 2, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Tunisia Strives to Raise Phosphate Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia is striving to increase its
phosphate output from six million tonnes to between seven and 7.5
million tonnes annually during the ninth Five-Year Development
Plan (1997-2001), according to the latest issue of "Mine Echoes"
magazine.
</P>
<P>
The annual phosphate output of the country has remained 6
million tonnes for the past 10 years, the magazine said. It said
that Tunisia's phosphate sector is going all out to raise
production capacity, maintain quality and reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
Phosphate is one of the major mine resources in Tunisia. Its
mines are mainly located in Qafsa province, central Tunisia,
and contain abundant reserves estimated at 2 billion tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia, the fifth largest phosphate producer in the world,
has produced phosphate ore, and its derivatives are the most
important exports of the country.
</P>
<P>
The depression seen by the world phosphate market for several
years has negatively effected Tunisia's phosphate sector.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia's state-owned Qafsa General Phosphate Company, which
was founded in 1897, supervises all processes of production and
exports of phosphate.
</P>
<P>
The company established a joint venture, the Sino-Arab
Company, with China in the Chinese city of Qinhuangdao in 1988
for the production of azotic fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine, the U.S.-based World Institute for
the Development of Phosphate has issued a document, saying that
the Qafsa phosphate in Tunisia is among the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Tunisia's phosphate output has been growing thanks
to increasing world demand for the product and the  phosphate
price hikes in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the phosphate output amounted to 7.16 million tonnes
against 6.3 million tonnes in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In view of the growing demand for phosphate in the world
market, the Tunisian government has planned to develop its
national phosphate output steadily, striving to raise the average
yearly output to 7.5 million tonnes during the period from 1997 to
2001.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these objectives, the Tunisian government has
decided to increase investments, renovate equipment, upgrade
researches in phosphate production and join world information
networks.

<HEADLINE> US Investments in Egypt Rise to 460 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investors are taking part in
191 projects in Egypt covering industry, agriculture, tourism and
services with an aggregate value of 460 million dollars, according to
an Egyptian daily today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. participation in the productive projects reached 25
percent of its total investment in Egypt which amounted to around
2 billion dollars, and half of the money has flown into the
petroleum field.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. investment in Egypt represents a mere 0.3 percent of its
aggregate investment all over the world and 3.5 percent of the
total foreign investments in Egypt, according to Al Ahram, the
leading Egyptian daily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, indirect U.S. investments began to flow into the
Egyptian stock market in 1996, taking in new shares of the public
business sector companies.
</P>
<P>
Reports show that U.S. indirect investments in Egypt are
expected to surge in the coming stage as a result of President
Hosni Mubarak's five-day visit to the U.S. on March 8-12.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's meetings with representatives of giant companies are
well expected to contribute to increasing direct U.S. investment
in the fields such as airport, highways, power generation and
harbors, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
bilateral trade volume reached 3.713 billion dollars last year
as exports to the U.S. markets amounted to 713 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade between Cairo and Washington accounts for
11.3 percent of the 34.2 billion dollar aggregate U.S. trade with Arab
countries. The bulk of the 15.994 billion dollar U.S. imports are
oil products.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aid to Egypt is expected to continue at the current
level, said the report, noting that the U.S. regards the economic
aid as part of the strategic relations between the two countries
and also its support to the economic reform program in
Egypt.

<HEADLINE> No Extraordinary Step to Mend Rift With Singapore: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today said he does not want to put any condition
on the Singaporean government to mend the diplomatic furor between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is not going to do anything extraordinary regarding
the matter, he said at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on
his return from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his cabinet accepted on Wednesday Singaporean
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's apology over his controversial
remarks on Johor, a southern state of Malaysia bordering Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In a sworn affidavit he made on January 27 in a court hearing
on defamation cases against opposition Workers' Party member Tang
Liang Hong, Lee described Johor State as a place "notorious for
shootings, muggings and car-jackings," which touched off the
diplomatic furor.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's strong reaction to the remarks forced Lee to make
the unconditional apology.
</P>
<P>
While accepting Lee's apology, the Malaysian government said
it would take time to restore its friendship with Singapore to
the previous level.
</P>
<P>
Some Malaysian parties demanded that Lee's son, Lee Hsien
Loong, who also signed the affidavit, should also apologize.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hsien Loon, who is Singaporean deputy prime minister, was
quoted as saying on Saturday that his father's apology was "his as
well."

<HEADLINE> China to Redouble Meteorological Research Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The head of China's
Meteorological Bureau said here today that research efforts will
be stepped up and a special group be formed to cope with urban
water problems with meteorological measures.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Meteorological Day, which is
today, focuses on the problems associated with weather, cities,
and water.
</P>
<P>
Wen Kegang, the bureau's director, said that China always pays
attention to the service of meteorological departments, to urban
development, and the people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Wen told Xinhua that his bureau is helping cities across China
to minimize loss from floods, providing information to reservoirs
for water conservancy, upgrading the atmospheric quality, and
improving climate with artificial measures.
</P>
<P>
Weather has a great impact on the water resources of cities
throughout the country, Wen said, adding that southeastern coastal
regions are rich in water while western and northern China
are comparatively short of water.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that approximately half of the country's
600-plus cities lacks water, and 110 are in serious water shortage.
</P>
<P>
With growing urban population, the water problem is sure to
become increasingly grave, Wen noted, saying that the research
group will strive to guarantee the healthy development of cities.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Bombing Suspect Arrested in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi national Hani Abdel Rahim Al
Sayegh has been arrested here on suspicions of being "engaged in
terrorism" and being a threat to the security of Canada, reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
He is suspected of being involved in the truck-bombing that
ripped through an apartment complex and killed 19 U.S. servicemen
at a U.S. barracks in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, last June.
</P>
<P>
Sayegh was arrested Sunday after Canada's Solicitor-General
Herb Gray and Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard signed a
special security certificate.
</P>
<P>
The court will hold a closed-door hearing within a week on
whether Sayegh's arrest is justified.
</P>
<P>
If the court rules against him, he will be entitled to an
extradition hearing, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has welcomed the arrest, saying it was
grateful for "the vigilant actions of Canada."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said it hopes to
send agents here soon to question Sayegh.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Frequent Load-shedding Hits Bangladesh's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Acute shortage of electricity and
near-daily load-shedding has caused huge losses to Bangladesh's
fragile economy and scared away the badly-needed investment.
</P>
<P>
Identifying poor gas supply as the main reason behind the
present power shortage, Energy Minister Nooruddin Khan said that
the peak hour demand is 2,000 MW against the available generation
of 1,650 MW though the installed capacity in the existing plants
is 2,200 MW.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the peak hour demands, The Dhaka city government has
ordered the closing of the commercial and shopping centers after 7
pm and announced a ban on ceremonial illumination and staggering
of the industrial holidays to distribute the power loads over the
week.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is very critical... the loss is huge. The
frequent loadshedding is now the major problem of the economy,"
said ASM Quasem, the president of Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (DCCI).
</P>
<P>
ASM Quasem said the industry is facing power cut for four to
five hours a day. The service sector and the agriculture-- the two
other major sectors of the economy-- are also being affected by
the power shortage.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no official statistics about the losses being
incurred by the economy, businessmen said that over 25 per cent of
the total working hours were lost during the last few weeks due to
load-shedding.
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey by chambers and trade
associations, the value of production loss due to power failure
during the 1995-96 fiscal year was 32.638 billion Taka (about 816
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association
(BGMEA), however, said the production loss in the ready-made
garment sector, the highest foreign exchange earner, is over 500
million Taka (12.5 million U.S. dollars) a day in recent days.
</P>
<P>
"We are the worst victim of the widespread power failure," said
BGMEA President Mostafa Golam Quddus, explaining that frequent
loadshedding means the exporters will fail the shipment deadline
of exporting finished goods.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the garment exporters have informed us that orders
worth thousands of dollars were canceled by foreign buyers due to
failure in timely shipment, which is caused by production delay,"
Quddus said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local and foreign investors, worrying about the
impact on economy of the electricity shortage, have dumped shares
of companies, triggering falls in Dhaka share prices.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Stock Exchange benchmark index fell 16.39 percent or
249.82 points to 1273.85 in the past week ending on March 20. The
index continued to fall to 1240.04 point on the first day Saturday
of current trading week.
</P>
<P>
To rebuild the confidence of investors, the government last
week announced a series of short and medium term measures to
increase the generation of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Energy officials said after completion of rehabilitation works
in all the generation plants in next June, additional 92 MW power
would be added to the total generation while a 210 MW second unit
plant would be commissioned in Chittagong District in July.
</P>
<P>
More power would be available next year with the commissioning
of three barge-mounted power plants by the private sector with 100
MW capacity each within February next year and commission of the
sixth unit of the Ghorashal Plant (210 MW) by June next year, the
officials added.

<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee, held a meeting here today with members of a
Hong Kong youth delegation, who are here to attend celebrations of
the 100-day countdown of Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to the Hong Kong delegation, Hu said Hong
Kong's return to the embrace of its motherland will be a
significant event in Chinese history, will be the successful
realization of the scientific concept of the "one country, two
systems", and a milestone in the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 1997 is an extraordinary year in China's
development, and two events attracting worldwide attention will
take place.
</P>
<P>
One is that the Communist Party of China will convene its 15th
national congress, to push forward the reform and socialist
modernization drive in a new era; the other is that the Chinese
government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,
and the six million Hong Kong compatriots will exercise their
right of being masters of their own destiny, he went on.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed the hope that the young people in Hong Kong will
carry forward the spirit of loving the motherland and Hong Kong,
and make concerted efforts for Hong Kong's progress and its smooth
transition as well as its long-term prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he hoped that they will increase exchanges with
young people in the inland areas, in order to jointly create a
splendid 21st century for the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were Li Keqiang, first secretary of the
Chinese Communist Youth League Central Committee as well as other
high-ranking officials from the league and the All-China Youth
Federation.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong youth delegation, composed of 44 members, arrived

<HEADLINE> Syria Slams US for Second Veto of UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Syrian daily "Al-Thawra" today
slammed the U.S. for its second veto of a U.N. draft resolution on
baring the construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also blasted the Israeli government for
undermining the Middle East peace process with the breaking of
ground on the settlement construction in defiance of mounting
international criticism and an Arab outcry against its move.
</P>
<P>
The state-run newspaper said the Israeli government "mourns
over" the peace process while "burying it under the wheels of
its bulldozers and tractors" on Jabal Abu Ghoneim (also known as
Har Homa) mount of East Jerusalem, "to establish the de facto
settlements and land mines upon the ruins of peace."
</P>
<P>
By using the veto once again against a draft resolution for
halting the Jewish settlement, "the United States told the Arab
and the international community as a whole that the U.S.
protection of Israel is a top priority regardless of any other
considerations or the peace process itself," the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Following a veto of the U.N. draft resolution on the Jewish
settlement plan in Har Homa on March 7, the U.S. vetoed again
Friday the European-sponsored U.N. resolution against the
settlement building plan, saying that it opposed the project and
that the Israelis and Palestinians should work out their problems
without "interference from the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
On the role by the U.S. in the peace march, the paper noted
"After the United States had insisted on being a co-sponsor of,
and a full partner in the peace process, it regrettably proved to
be unwilling to contribute to the peace-making process on the
grounds of justice and the previously-established agreements."
</P>
<P>
The paper asserted that the U.S. "favors Israel against the
Arabs and serves Israel's greediness and aggressive and
expansionist plans in a highly-biased way."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. favors Israel, thus undermining the its "credibility
as a neutral co-sponsor" of the peace process, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra urged the Arab states to work actively for
convening an Arab summit as soon as possible in order to prevent
Israel from its expansionist settlement.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Israel for Jewish Settlement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority Yassar Arafat today slammed Israel for its plan
to build Jewish settlement in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Extraordinary Summit of the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) here today Arafat said "Al-Quds and its
surroundings are a trust which God put on our shoulders."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli plans were flagrant violations of the U.N.
resolutions and the U.S. brokered agreements between Palestinians
and Israel, said Arafat on behalf of the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli designs were a challenge which could
provoke Muslims and Christians and other believers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also criticized Washington for vetoing
the resolutions moved in the Security Council condemning Israeli
plans.
</P>
<P>
He urged Muslim leaders, "to act quickly and seriously to
save," Al-Quds from Zionist clutches.
</P>
<P>
Arafat suggested the formation of a special committee of the
Islamic Summit to strengthen the role of OIC in saving the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion Arafat also hoped that the forthcoming
dialogue between Pakistan and India will help resolve the pending
issues, including the Kashmir problem, between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward for the solution of the Kashmir problem
according to the international resolutions," he said at the OIC
meeting marking the golden jubilee celebrations of the

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Takes Measures to Resolve Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino has recently called on all Albanians to work together to
resuscitate the country from its current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fino, who was appointed prime minister of the all-party
government by President Sali Berisha earlier this month, said that
the country's interests should be considered paramount in
resolving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the urgings of the new government, many retired soldiers and
cops have returned to their duty and taken up the responsibility
of restoring order with the help of many volunteers.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that people have food and other necessities, the new
government has suspended added value tax on imported crops and
sent SOS signal to the international community to seek
humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the situation in the capital has been under
control in recent days and the closed international airport has
been reopened.
</P>
<P>
And though the situation in many rebel-held towns in the south
still remained tense, most of them are now under the control of
the citizens' councils.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been gripped by chaos since the collapse of
high-risk government investment schemes earlier this year which
led to thousands of people losing their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The following protests soon turned violent and the situation
severely worsened when angry protesters started to loot army
depots in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
Right now, Italy is preparing to send emergency health supplies
to Albania and Greece has also pledged 3 million U.S. dollars in
aid.
</P>
<P>
The Europe Union and the International Red Cross are also
contemplating sending aid to Albania.

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- India and Russia are actively
considering concluding an inter-governmental protocol for
supplying two light water nuclear power reactors to New Delhi, the
Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The protocol is expected to be firmed up during the three-day
visit of Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda to Moscow beginning
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, when signed, would revalidate an agreement
reached between the two countries during the 1988 visit of former
Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev for construction of two
1,000 MW nuclear power reactors by Russia at Kudankulam in India's
Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
There was no follow up action after the signing of the
agreement because of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and
certain other reasons, according to official sources.

<P>
TOKYO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto expressed caution today about making Russia a full
member of the Group of Seven (G-7) forum as agreed upon at the
U.S.-Russian summit in Helsinki last week.
</P>
<P>
Moscow can continue its participation in "G-7 plus one"
dialogue on such issues as terrorism and the environment but
should be kept out of discussions on development and international
finance and trade, the prime minister told reporters at his
official residence.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto attributed the caution to the territorial dispute
between Japan and Russia. Japan has been demanding the return of
four northern islands from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin reached an
agreement in Helsinki last Friday on co-opting Russia on to the
club of industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The G-7, which groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan and the United States, has operated with the participation
of the former Soviet Union and later Russia since 1991 in selected
political, environmental and antiterrorism issues.
</P>
<P>
The annual summit of the G-7 plus Russia is expected to be held
in Denver, Colorado in June.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebel Leader: No Ceasefire Before Mobutu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel leader Laureant
Kabila has said he will not quit fighting until he defeats
Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Kabila made the vow while addressing a rally of 5,000 people
in Kisangani on Saturday, a report reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly said at the rally that he will not quit until
Mobutu resigns.
</P>
<P>
"Do you want a ceasefire?" Kabila asked. The crowd hissed
and shouted: "No!" "Keep on going, keep on going."
</P>
<P>
"There won't be a ceasefire before negotiations. That is
it," Kabila said.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean rebels have reportedly occupied one fifth of Zaire
since their rebellions in eastern Zaire last October. They
captured Kisangani, the third largest city of Zaire, last
weekend. They are just 200 km away from that country's second
largest city of Lubumbashi in southern Zaire and are heading for
the diamond-trading city of Mbuji-Mayi.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said his forces will reach the Zairean capital of
Kishasa by June this year. enditem

<P>
BAGHDAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Justice Minister Shabib
Al-Maliki, head of the Iraqi delegation to the summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, met with a senior
official of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Islamabad,
Pakistan, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Maliki and Sheikh Hamad Bin-Mohammed
Al-Sharki, governor of Al-Fujairah Emirate of the UAE, is the
first political contact between Iraq and the UAE since the Gulf
crisis in 1990, said Arab diplomatic sources who refused to be
identified today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is of special importance as it falls in the
framework of the efforts to normalize relations between Iraq and
the other Arab Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
It was held on the fringe of the OIC summit and both sides
discussed issues of common concern on the agenda of the summit as
well as ways of strengthening the Islamic solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has repeatedly called for canceling the U.N. economic
sanctions imposed in August, 1990, on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan urged Arab
countries more than a year ago to put an end to their disputes
with Iraq and allow Iraq to come back to Arab community.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the UAE sent two shipments
of assistance to Iraq, including foodstuffs and medicines.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Sure to Succeed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese official
stressed here today that the "one country, two systems" principle,
initiated by Deng Xiaoping, will be successfully carried out in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a symposium attended by young people from Hong Kong
and the mainland to greet Hong Kong's forthcoming return to its
motherland, Wang Fengchao, vice-director of the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said to implement to
the letter of the "one country, two systems" principle which is
held by the Chinese government to solve the Hong Kong question, is
the demand for China to realize its Four Modernizations and to
maintain the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is a necessary measure to maintain a peaceful
Asia-Pacific region, and to ultimately achieve the peaceful
reunification of the motherland, he added.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, Hong Kong will return to the embrace of its
motherland, Wang said, noting that the whole Chinese people
including the Hong Kong compatriots have been expecting and
striving towards this end for 150 years.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years ago, Deng Xiaoping, when meeting with the former
British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, said, if China couldn't get
back Hong Kong in 1997, 48 years after the founding of the
People's Republic of China, none of the Chinese leaders or the
government could explain it to the Chinese people, even to the
world, Wang recalled.
</P>
<P>
These words give a full expression to the determination of the
Chinese government and its people to resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, he emphasized.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- College students as well as
students of primary and middle schools and their teachers in
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, today begun to
donate money for casting a "wake-up bell", to mark the 100th day
countdown from the return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The three-ton bronze bell is expected to be 1.997 meter tall,
which will be put in the Jinghai Temple in Xiaguan district of
Nanjing, where 99 years ago the Treaty of Nanking was signed
between the imperial court of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) and the
British government. Hong Kong was ceded to Britain according to
the terms of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
At the sponsorship of the relevant Jiangsu provincial
departments, the bell is expected to be completed in mid May and
an inauguration ceremony for both the bell and the pavilion to
install it will be held on June 1. It is intended to remind the
Chinese people not to forget national humiliation but to be
vigilant in times of peace and rejuvenate the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> PNG Prime Minister Refuses To Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under mounting pressure to step down over the political crisis,
Julius said in a recorded address to the nation that "I swore to
the constitution and I have to live by it," Australian Associated
Press from Port Moresby reported.
</P>
<P>
leaders of several opposition parties today banded together to
call for Julius to step down and will continue to push for his
resignation when parliament resumes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution of PNG, a Prime Minister can be removed
by a vote of no confidence by the 109 members on the floor of
parliament, however, the option to move such a motion cannot be
invoked 12 months from a national election, with one due in June.
</P>
<P>
People's National Congress leader Bill Skate said they were
trying to force him to stand aside on moral grounds after he lied
over the 37.5 million US dollar mercenaries contract.
</P>
<P>
The mercenaries contract, which was signed between the PNG
government and Sandline International (a British firm), was the
fuse that sparked the current crisis after defense force chief
Jerry Singirok asked the prime minister to resign over the hiring
of mercenaries last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer today refused to
rule out sending troops to PNG to help restore order after a week
of rioting and looting in Port Moresby, since defense force chief
Singirok was sacked by the Julius government.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the Australian Defense Force's upgrading of its
level of readiness was precautionary measure as the government had
responsibility to protect the 10,000 Australian citizens in PNG.
</P>
<P>
However, a report from Port Moresby said, the PNG Watch Council
for Socio-Economic Justice tonight warned that if Australian
troops entered PNG under any circumstances, including to help
Australian citizens, PNG civilians would fight back.
</P>
<P>
"We will defend our sovereignty," a Watch Council leader said,
"every Australian in PNG will become a prisoner of war, which
would be a very, very bad thing, and we don't want that," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Apply DOTS Treatment for TB Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Health Minister
Adem Ibrahim has said his ministry will further expand
tuberculosis (TB) treatment strategy of the World Health
Organization (WHO), known as direct observed treatment with
short- course (DOTS), across the country in a bid to control the
spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to mark the World TB Day to be observed throughout
the world on March 24, the minister said ''as the strategy is
believed to help curb the spread of TB we will continue to expand
DOTS adopted by the WHO.''
</P>
<P>
He said as the five-year development program gives prime
attention to the prevention and control of TB after malaria and
Hiv/Aids, the country would exert maximum efforts in applying the
strategy.
</P>
<P>
He hoped to treat 85 percent of TB patients to be diagnosed till
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said little was known about the actual extent of the spread
of the disease owing to the absence of a comprehensive survey at
a national level. It was the primary cause of the death of
patients at hospitals in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, the number of TB cases reported to
the country's health institutions had almost doubled in the last
ten years. enditem

 Implemented, Says Malaysia
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today Malaysia would not have diplomatic
relations with Israel as long as it did not abide by the decision
of the peace treaty with Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He said he had written to Israel prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres to
express the Malaysian stand.
</P>
<P>
"As long as he (Netanyahu) did not abide by the decision of
the peace treaty (with Palestine), we will not have diplomatic
relations", he told reporters on his return from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He said it was Tel Aviv that had asked for diplomatic
relations between Malaysia and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the statement when asked whether the government
decision to allow the Israeli cricket team to play in an
international championship here reflected a change in
Malaysia-Israel relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the government decided to allow the Israeli cricket
team to play here to make them realize that a multiracial and
multireligious society can live in peace in a country like
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia hoped that the young Israeli cricket
players would then inform their countrymen back home about the
situation here and explain that Islam did not oppress or suppress
other religions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cricket team will be among 22 teams taking part in
the International Cricket Council Trophy which starts here
tomorrow.

Wang said: "It is 100 days before Hong Kong turns over a new
historic page, and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity
and stability is our common wish and historic task."
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal requires not only the correct policy of
the Chinese government, but also the concerted efforts of the
majority of the Hong Kong compatriots, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the general situation in Hong Kong is sound at present,
and the main framework of the SAR government has been established.
</P>
<P>
In the process of forming the SAR, the central government's
policy of "facing the Hong Kong people and relying on them" was
carried out, and the people in the various circles of Hong Kong
also contributed a lot to it, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there would not be the current sound
situation of Hong Kong without the active participation of the
local people who love the motherland and Hong Kong as well as
their hard work, besides the correct leadship of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
As Deng Xiaoping said before, the past prosperity of Hong Kong
was mainly created by the people in Hong Kong with the Chinese
people as the mainstay, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
Since the Hong Kong compatriots could create prosperity in the
past, it is entirely believable that they can make the region more
prosperous and stable after 1997, with the support of the
motherland, Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced the hope that the people in the Hong Kong United
Youth Association will inspire more young people to learn and
safeguard the Basic Law, to actively participate in Hong Kong's
social affairs, while increasing exchanges with the inland areas,
in order to make more contributions to Hong Kong's economic
prosperity and social stability.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HKSAR Taking Shape Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The formation of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has been progressing quite
smoothly as the time to the handover of Hong Kong to China enters
the 100-day countdown.
</P>
<P>
So far the HKSAR government, the Executive Council and the
legislative body have all been formed and are busy making
preparations for the handover, while various social and economic
preparations are also underway with satisfactory progress.
</P>
<P>
Looking back at all the key events that took place in the past
more than one-year, all efforts made in forming the SAR have been
in strict accordance with the Basic Law and the principles of "one
country, two systems", "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" and "a
high degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
On January 26, 1996 the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR was
 officially established in Beijing, which was authorized to form
the first SAR government and legislative body and take on various
preparatory works concerning Hong Kong's economy, laws, culture
and society.
</P>
<P>
In order to well organize the Selection Committee for the first
 HKSAR government, in April the Preparatory Committee carried out
extensive consultation in Hong Kong. In early November, a widely
representative group of 400 was selected as the Selection
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In December Tung Chee Hwa was elected by the Selection
Committee as chief executive of the HKSAR. This is a major event
in the handover process and Tung's winning largely increased Hong
Kong people's confidence in the future.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who is a very successful businessman and well-known for
his wisdom to challenge difficulties, has been widely accepted by
the Hong Kong people for his credibility and capability.
</P>
<P>
On 21 December, 60 members of the Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) were elected in Shenzhen. These 60 members,
including 33 incumbent Legislative Councilors, will work on the
HKSAR's legislative affairs until the first Legislative Council of
the SAR is set up in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the PLC, more and more Hong Kong
people have offered their support as they come to understand the
importance and necessity of the PLC to the long-term stability and
 prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On January 24 this year, Tung Chee Hwa announced the line-up of
 the 15-member Executive Council of the SAR. As an advisory body
to the Chief Executive, the Executive Council has already been
holding regular meetings to work on social and economic affairs
relating to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity after the
handover.
</P>
<P>
On February 20 Tung Chee Hwa announced a list of 23 principal
officials of the first government of the SAR, which retains nearly
 the whole team of the incumbent government secretaries, except
the Attorney-General, who is not a Chinese citizen, and
Commissioner of Independent Commission Against Corruption, who
offered to retire.
</P>
<P>
This is a significant step in the forming of the SAR
government, and it has been widely accepted and praised by the
Hong Kong people who believe this would greatly benefit the
stability of Hong Kong's highly efficient civil service team.
</P>
<P>
The civil service team, led by Chief Secretary Anson Chan who
will assume the office of the Administrative Secretary of the SAR
government, also welcomed the move and all pledged their loyalty
to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The latest development was the secondment of some incumbent
government officials to Tung's office. On March 11, Michael Suen
and Irene Yau were seconded to Tung's office as Secretary for
Policy Co-ordination and Director of Information and Public
Relations.
</P>
<P>
Elsie Leung, Secretary of Justice of the SAR government, who
has already been assisting the Chief Executive on a range of legal
 issues, will officially join the Chief Executive's Office on
April 1.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa said that the HKSAR has made a good start,
although there are still much work to do in the remaining 100
days.
</P>
<P>
The achievements made so far have greatly encouraged the whole
community and Hong Kong people have never been so confident about
their future.
</P>
<P>
This could be seen in the number of emigrants which fell
considerably last year than in the previous years, and many who
moved to foreign countries have begun to come back.
</P>
<P>
All Hong Kong economic sectors and social groups have so far
expressed their support for the HKSAR government and many of them
organized committees to celebrate the handover.
</P>
<P>
At midnight of June 30, a grand ceremony will be held to mark
the handover, and guests from all over the world will come to see
this historic occasion. By then all preparations for the SAR would
have completed, and the HKSAR Government, the PLC and other
functional bodies would start operation immediately.

<HEADLINE> State Enterprises still Mainstay of China's National Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A nation-wide industrial survey
has shown that China's state-owned enterprises turn in over half
of the taxes from all industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Despite booming township and village enterprises, state-owned
enterprises still take the leading role, especially in the energy,
raw materials and high-tech sectors, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that at the end of 1995, the total assets
of state-owned enterprises was 4.747 trillion yuan (572 billion US
dollars), 53.7 percent of the country's total industrial assets.
</P>
<P>
With regard to industrial output, state industrial businesses
take either a dominant or switch role in coal mining and crude and
gas exploitation, chemical industry, medicine, metallurgical
industry, electric power industry, transportation, and water
supply.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the state listed 15,668 large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, which accounted for only 0.2
percent of the number of entire industrial enterprises, but their
assets made up 44.5 percent of the total, and they turned in 48.8
percent of taxes to the state.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Marks World Meteorological Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The National Meteorological
Services Agency of Ethiopia today said meteorological services have
a great impact on the socio-economic development of a country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to mark the 47th anniversary of the World
Meteorological Day, which falls today, Tesfaye Haile,
General Manager of the agency said as a follow-up to the Second
United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, or otherwise known
as Habitat ii, which was held in Istanbul, Turkey last year, the
theme chosen for this year by the Executive Committee of the
World Meteorological Organization was ''weather and water in
cities''.
</P>
<P>
He described the theme as appropriate and timely especially in
view of the enormous pressure which the rapid rate of urban
population growth is exerting on the environment and the resources
of the planet.
</P>
<P>
He said that the impact of recent droughts in large urban areas
including Addis Ababa was further evidence that droughts are not
just a rural problem, adding that with continuous improvements
in climate research and prediction, it was possible to provide some
warning in advance of the onset of extreme weather events.
</P>
<P>
The World Meteorological Organization was established on March
23, 1950. enditem

<HEADLINE> OIC Secretary General Supports Pak-Indian Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Azeddine Laraki, Secretary
General of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), said
today that OIC supported the forthcoming dialogue between Pakistan
and India.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural OIC Extraordinary Summit at the
National Convention Center here today Laraki said that OIC would
continue its endeavors to find a peaceful settlement of the
Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
OIC favored an objective dialogue between India and Pakistan
which can ease tension and lead to solution of the Kashmir
dispute, Laraki said.
</P>
<P>
The people of Kashmir, he said, should be given their right to
determine their future under the relevant UN resolutions and
provisions of the Simla agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir dispute, he said, continued to attract the
attention of OIC. But it had "to be included in the agendas of its
meetings as it has not yet found a solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Palestinian issue, Laraki eulogized their steadfastness and
the resolve by their leadership to fight for their rights.
</P>
<P>
OIC supported the Palestinian National Authority in the
on-going negotiations for a just and comprehensive solution of the
issue, Laraki said.
</P>
<P>
He said the question of Al-Quds Al-Sharif, the refugees, the
borders, the water resources and settlements should all be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
The OIC, he said, was endeavoring to ensure the recognition and
the exercise of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian
people, including their rights of return, self-determination and
the establishment of their own independent state with Al-Quds as
its capital.
</P>
<P>
Laraki reiterated that the Palestinian question was the core of
the problem in the Middle East. He said peace cannot be
established in the region unless the Palestinian people are
enabled to regain their full rights.
</P>
<P>
The OIC Secretary General said the issues such as Afghanistan,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia and the conditions of Muslim
refugees, Muslim communities and minorities all over the world
were equally important.
</P>
<P>
"All are just causes which, more than ever before, require our
solidarity and mutual support to find appropriate solutions," he
said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Article Marks 100th day in Countdown of HK's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, published a commentator's article today to mark
the 100th day in the countdown of Hong Kong's return to its
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The article, entitled "Looking Forward to the Great Historic
Moment", characterizes Hong Kong's upcoming return as turning a
new page in the Chinese people's struggle for reunification of
their motherland.
</P>
<P>
With the return, the paper says, the Chinese nation will wipe
out its 100-year old disgrace. It will also mean that two
different social systems will exist in the Chinese territory at
the same time, and that socialism with Chinese characteristics
will become more vigorous.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the preparatory work for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) since the signing of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration, the article notes that all the preparatory
work, from the formulation of the Basic Law to the formation of
the first SAR government, was well done, and many problems were
effectively resolved.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong is currently prosperous in economy and stable
in society, more people are convinced that the Chinese government
will faithfully fulfill its commitment, eliminate outside
interference, and resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong in accordance to its set principles, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Facts in the 13-year transitional period also show that it is
the Chinese government who truly expects a long-term prosperous
and stable Hong Kong, and it is the Chinese people who truly care
for the practical interests of the six million Hong Kong
compatriots, it emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
The article also praises the "one country, two systems"
principle proposed by Deng Xiaoping, saying this great concept
provides a practical way to solve the Hong Kong question left over
from history.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented creation of this concept also shows the broad
mind and extraordinary wisdom of Deng Xiaoping as a great
statesman.
</P>
<P>
the successful application of the principle to Hong Kong, the
article continues, will not only give an example to solve the
questions of Macao and Taiwan, but also provide a way to settle
complicated disputes in the international communities.
</P>
<P>
The article says that a flourishing China has provided a
guarantee for the return of Hong Kong and for its long-term
prosperity, while a prosperous and stable Hong Kong will surely
play a unique role in the modernization drive of its motherland,
the article notes.

of achieving an average 30-32 percent growth rate in annual

These measures aim to increase the exports of processed

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Promote Export-Oriented Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is promoting an
export-oriented economy in order to accomplish the country's goal
of achieving an average 30-32 percent growth rate in annual
exports during the 1996-2000 period, Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
said today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said more effective measures should be taken to
boost production and business operations in the implementation of
a policy to encourage exports.
</P>
<P>
These measures aim to increase the exports of processed
products and reduce the exports of raw materials and
semi-processed products.
</P>
<P>
In 1996-2000, Vietnam is expected to see a 15 percent annual
increase in exports of raw materials and semi-processed products.
</P>
<P>
It is also essential for Vietnam to expand the exports of
electric and electronic goods, industrial machinery, services and
intellectual products.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-invested business sector, which grossed about 400
million U.S. dollars from exports in 1995 and 800 million dollars
last year, must increase its proportion in Vietnam's exports, the
VNA said.
</P>
<P>
With their advantage in capital investment, technology and
market, foreign-invested businesses can contribute as much as 70
percent of the total export volume of processed articles, it added.
</P>
<P>
Positive changes have taken place in Vietnam's exports, with an
average increase of 26 percent annually in 1991-95 and 33.2
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has signed 70 trade agreements with foreign countries,
accounting for two-thirds of its current trade partners around the
world.
</P>
<P>
Despite a high growth in export volume in recent years, the per
capita export value in Vietnam was only 73 dollars in 1995, less
than half the world average (170 dollars) due to its very low
starting point.

<HEADLINE> Sinosauropteryx Fossils on Display in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 fossilized remains
of ancient birds from the late Jurassic Period that had been
excavated from western Liaoning Province, northeast China, were
put on an exhibition for the first time in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Exhibition of Primitive Bird Fossilized Treasures
from Western Liaoning", the display will last until April
30. Exhibits include the unique fossils of the Sinosauropteryx and
Confuciusornis, and other fossilized treasures of ancient birds.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today, Ji Qiang, curator of the
China Museum of Geology, announced that they are exhibiting two
pieces of fossilized Sinosauropteryx, one representing the ancient
bird at the baby stage and the other at the fully-grown stage. He
held that the Sinosauropteryx is a transitional type between a
certain kind of minor dinosaurs and the Archaeopteryx found in
Germany in 1861.
</P>
<P>
On displayal also includes the latest finding of a fossil for
Protarchaeopteryx, which is believed to be from the same age as
that of the Archaeopteryx of Germany.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits support a four-stage evolutionary theory of birds
advocated by Curator Ji. The four stages are the period of
Sinosauropteryx -- capable of running but not able to fly, the
period of Archaeopteryx -- capable of gliding, the period of
Confuciusornis -- capable of short-distance flight, and the period
of real birds which have long-distance flying capability.
</P>
<P>
An international group was specially organized by the Academy
of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia to inspect the discoveries
made recently in western Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group say that the exhibits are not just a
national treasure of China, they are a global treasure. They also
expressed their gratitude on behalf of the international
scientific community for the generosity China has shared this
treasure.
</P>
<P>
On the group are John Ostrom, Professor Emeritus of Yale
University, Alan Brush, Prof. Emeritus of Connecticut, Larry
Martin, Prof. of University of Kansas, as well as Dr. Peter
Wellnhofer with Bavarian State Museum of Germany, who are all
internationally-reputed experts in the study of ancient birds.
</P>
<P>
These experts said they had been astounded by the amount of
work accomplished by Chinese colleagues. "In no other place in the
world is so much of a fossil community, from such a crucial time
when the nature of the whole world began to change, preserved so
well," they added.

grand parade to mark the 100-day countdown for Hong Kong's return
to her motherland.
</P>
<P>
The parade from the Victoria Park to Southern Playground Field
through the downtown section was organized by the Hong Kong Island

</P>
<P>
Around 9 o'clock in the morning, people began to gather in the
park in light rain. Lam Kin Lai, a member of the Hong Kong

Kong's return to her motherland has become a hot topic among his
schoolmates and now more and more students at his school are

</P>
<P>
Before the march started, a celebration ceremony was held in
the Victoria Park with lion-unicorn dances and performances of
silver band, which attracted a large crowd of local residents and
visitors.
</P>
<P>
In an inauguration speech, Wong Sau Ching, vice-chairman of the
HK Island Celebration Committee, said that the Hong Kong Island
people are excited at the coming historical day when Hong Kong

autonomy" and under the leadership of the HKSAR government, Hong
Kong people will turn the territory into a better one, he said.

At 10:20, the parade started. At the head of the march, there
were Zheng Guoxiong, deputy-director of Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch, Tsang Hin-chi, member of the Standing Committee of
the Chinese National People's Congress, and Ang Ching Yuan,
chairman of the HK Island Celebration Committee.
</P>
<P>
While they marched along the main streets such as Hennessy Road
and Johnston Road, the paraders were waving mini-sized national
flags of China and regional flags with white Bauhinia and carrying
various banners, reading "Hong Kong People Unite to Greet HK's
handover," "Celebrate 100-day Countdown for HK's Return to
Motherland" and "Hong Kong People Look Forward to Reunion with
China."
</P>
<P>
The one-hour parade drew thousands of viewers in the Victoria
Park and along the street. A 77-year-old lady in a wheelchair
said that she was very pleased to see Hong Kong will return to
her motherland.
</P>
<P>
The lady named Ho got up early this morning, and when she heard
the sound of drums, she asked her daughter to take her in the
wheelchair to the Park.
</P>
<P>
She said that she cannot miss the celebration for the 100-day
countdown for Hong Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
John Van Den Bosch, a Canadian businessman, was excited at the
scene. He said that he was lucky to see the 100-day countdown
celebrations in Hong Kong today.
</P>
<P>
Bosch, who is for a short stay in Hong Kong on his way to

<HEADLINE> State Bearing Enterprise Raises Funds through Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A newly-founded state bearing
enterprise raised funds through a recent stock issuance in a bid
for long-term development.
</P>
<P>
Wafangdian Bearing Holding Co., established on Saturday, is a
share-holding corporation formed by 32 local departments and
companies with the former Wafangdian Bearing Co. Ltd. as its
mainstay.
</P>

the company is slated to go public on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on
March 25.

<P>
According to local sources, the issuance, offered last month,
raised more than 400 million yuan besides distribution expense.
</P>

percent.

<HEADLINE> Tuberculosis Plagues Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis plagued Kazakhstan
in recent years, making the country top all other former Soviet
republics in incidence, disability and mortality rates associated
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figures, among every 100,000
people in Kazakhstan, 67 developed the epidemic, 14.5 were
disabled and 26.4 died of the disease in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, cases of tuberculosis continued to increase with 4,500
people killed by this disease, twice as much as those of several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed the country had an estimated 60,000
sufferers of tuberculosis by the end of January 1997.
</P>
<P>
This widespreading of the disease was attributed to lack of
timely treatment because of low living standards and deep cut in
health budgets across the country.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Health Vasili Devyatko said that it is the
medical workers' top priority to fight the disease and the
government will use 400,000 U.S. dollars to buy medical

<HEADLINE> Canada Supports Moi's Peace Efforts for Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian official has urged
Western nations to support home-grown resolutions of Zaire crisis
initiated by African leaders, according to a Sunday Times report
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the visiting Canadian Secretary of State for
African and Latin American Affairs, Christine Stewart, as saying
that her country fully supported the resolutions adopted at the
two Nairobi summits over the conflict in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
She noted that recommendations reached at the March 19
mini-summit in Nairobi in seeking peaceful solutions of the Zaire
crisis should be supported by all Western nations interested in
peaceful governance in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian official stressed, "there is a great need for the
African leaders to be encouraged to solve the problems affecting
the good governance in the continent on their own."
</P>
<P>
"What we need is only to support what they have resolved and
give them the necessary support," Stewart added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Calls for Joint Actions to Meet Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif calls for joint and coordinated actions to respond to the
challenges facing the Islamic countries at the threshold of the
21st Century.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the Extraordinary Summit of the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC) held here today, Sharif said that the
Islamic countries were facing daunting internal and external
challenges, and to meet these challenges "we need to focus on a
joint and unified strategy."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the elements to meet internal challenges, Sharif
said the Islamic countries needed to revitalize their societies
and economies to ensure balanced development and to generate rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
"This demands greater focus on education and health,
development of human resources and infrastructure. These are the
pre-requisites for sustained growth and development in an
increasingly competitive world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that "it is essential to ensure political stability
in our sates. Relations between Islamic governments and their
peoples should be conducted on the basis of true Islamic
principles of democracy, social justice and respect for human
rights."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic world must regain its confidence and pride in its
own traditions and culture, which was uprooted by centuries of
colonialism and imperialism, the Prime Minister added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said that "we need to take effective and
coordinated action to meet the external challenges faced by the
Islamic world."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said that those Islamic peoples, who are
suffering under foreign occupation and oppression must be
protected and defended.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to evolve a united position on the
issue of Weapons of Mass Destruction," he said, adding that the
Islamic States are the principal focus of concern regarding
proliferation of these weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We should jointly demand the complete elimination of all
weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said that the Islamic countries have to promote
closer integration of their economies to maximize the advantages
of mutual trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The concept of an eventual Islamic Common Market through the
intensification of regional and sub-regional economic cooperation
offers tremendous prospects for improving the socio-economic
conditions of the Islamic peoples, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
President of Gambia Yahya Jammeh, Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority Yassar Arafat, Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel and Secretary General of OIC Azeddine Laraki also spoke on
the occasion.

<HEADLINE> HK Overall Crime Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The overall crime in Hong Kong
was down 20.8 percent during the first two months of 1997 compared
with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Security Lai Hing-ling said on Saturday that there
has been a continuing improvement in the general state of crime
and criminal cases fell in most categories.
</P>
<P>
But there were increases in homicides, armed robberies, and
wounding and serious assault. Homicide cases rose by 200 percent
from nine to 27 cases, but he pointed out that this figure
included 17 deaths from a Karaoke bar arson in January.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a campaign against pornography launched by Hong Kong
police has seen the seizure of more than 6,000 obscene articles
and over 50 arrests in the first two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the three-month campaign was indecency in print
and on CD-ROMs and VCDs.
</P>
<P>
Lai said pornography on the Internet was not targeted because
of the huge range of legal and practical problems, but a publicity
program to stop vendors selling pornography to children would soon
be launched.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Wanda Surge Ahead in China's Professional League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Dalian Wanda
managed a 1-0 home victory over Yanbian Aodong in the second round
of China's professional soccer league and surged ahead with 6
points.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions extend their unbeaten streak to 36
games and top the 12-team league with six points from two games.
</P>
<P>
The sole goal of the match came at the 23 mintue as forward
Wang Tao received a pass from Wei Yiming and beat the Yanbian
goal-keeper with a fierce shot.
</P>
<P>
The match was mostly dominated by Dalian Wanda, though Yanbian
Aodong had some chances in the second half, they failed to convert
any of them.
</P>
<P>
It was the second straight defeat for Yanbian Aodong. They
lost their opening round match 0-2 to last season's runners-up
Shanghai Shenhua on March 16.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua dropped to the second place in the team
standings as they were forced to a 1-1 draw by guests Sichuan
Quanxin.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai team, coached by a Bulgarian, led 1-0 after four
minutes. But the Sichuan Quanxin refused to give up and after 25
minutes of fierce attacks, they were finally awarded with an
equalizer.
</P>
<P>
The Vanguard Huandao, who suffered a 0-2 loss to Dalian Wanda
in the first round, played an inspiring game against Tianjin
Lifei.
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards conceded a goal due to a fatal error made by
defenders and goal-keeper in the first half. But they fought back
in the second half and Gao Feng levelled the scoring with a
shot just out of the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
In other matches played on Sunday, Guangdong Hongyuan beat
Beijing Guo'an 2-1, Jinan Taishan tied with Guangzhou Apollo 0-0
and the August First drew with Qingdao Hainiu 1-1.

<HEADLINE> Some Countries Betray Mozambican Army, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Mateus Ngonhamo, Deputy Chief of
the General Staff of the Mozambican Armed Forces for Defense has
accused some countries of having "betrayed" the Mozambican army.
</P>
<P>
The general made the accusation in a recent interview with the
Savana Weekly, according to the reports today by the Mozambique
Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ngonhamo said some countries are helping South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania expand their armies and
upgrade their military equipments, but they had refused to
help the Mozambican army. "I don't know why," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Mozambique without a powerful army could not stand up
to the test of unexpected incidents.
</P>
<P>
He said their reluctance to help Mozambique was linked with
the "political problems" existing in southern Africa for
centuries. However, he did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Flight Training Center to Be Set up at HK New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's flag-carrier Cathay
Pacific Airways is expected to build its two billion HK dollar
(256.4 million US dollars) flight training center at the New
Airport at Chek Lap Kok, according to today's South China Morning
Post.
</P>
<P>
The report said a formal announcement is expected in the next
few weeks, ending months of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The airways said more than a year ago that it would keep its
training base in the territory rather than develop a new complex
in Australia, but a final decision on the site has been held up
while the airline carries out extensive financial and technical
appraisals of various sites for what will be the airline's second
biggest investment.
</P>
<P>
Cathay is spending 3.5 billion HK dollars (448.7 million US
dollars) on new headquarters and a hotel at Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
The report said in-house studies are believed to show marginal
benefits in locating the complex at Chek Lap Kok rather than
develop it at any other proposed sites in the territory.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hong Kong's Future to Be Brighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- With 100 day from July 1 for
Hong Kong's handover, Hong Kong people are becoming increasingly
confident in the future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar to mark the event held in Wen Wei Po, the
participants held that with the powerful backing from the Chinese
mainland and under the leadership of the future government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Hong Kong people
will build a better Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ambrose Lau Hong-chune, chairman of the Hong Kong Progressive
Alliance, said that the 100th day in the countdown of Hong Kong's
return to her motherland is a day of great significance.
</P>
<P>
He added that every Hong Kong citizen will treasure the
historical moment and cherish his responsibility in the
implementation of the principle of "One Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
Many participants noted that Hong Kong's return to her
motherland will contribute to the reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Hin-chi, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of
Commerce, said that Hong Kong's return to her motherland marks not
only the beginning of a new era of the territory, but also a new
horizon for the reunification of the whole Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He said it is China's economic reforms and opening up and the
progress achieved in the past 17 years that ensure that Hong Kong
have a smooth transition in its returning to her motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the support of the Central Chinese
government, Hong Kong people have overcome many obstacles and
difficulties in preparations for the establishment of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Some participants said that the sound situation in the Chinese
mainland has produced positive effects on Hong Kong's smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chark Tim, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade
Unions, said that the sustained economic growth and stability in
the Chinese mainland promoted Hong Kong's prosperity in the latter
period of Hong Kong's transition.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the past year has seen the successful election of
the HKSAR's Chief Executive and Provisional Legislative Council,
followed by the appointment of the members of the Executive
Council and senior government officials, Lee said that the
progress has laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's future
development.
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants at the seminar held that Hong Kong's
return to her motherland will usher in a new period for the
cooperation between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
They noted that without the support from and cooperation with
the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong can hardly maintain its status as
an international financial, trade and shipping center as well as
its competitiveness in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Ngai Shiu-kit, member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and
of the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR, said that "China
Factor" will continue to be a great impetus to Hong Kong's
economic growth in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects that after July 1, the trade links between
Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland will be closer and cooperation
between the two sides will bring about more opportunities for Hong
Kong's development.

<HEADLINE> Collective Action Plan Imperative for Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari urged here today the Islamic world to adopt a collective
plan of action for its renewal and renaissance.
</P>
<P>
Leghari made the appeal while inaugurating an extraordinary
summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) held here
today to celebrate Pakistan's Golden Jubilee year of independence.
</P>
<P>
"The first step must be to acknowledge our internal and
external weaknesses and vulnerabilities," Leghari said.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic nations must arouse the consciousness of their
governments and peoples to the urgency of taking deliberate
decisions for economic and social development and modernization,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the nations must revive and re-assert within the
nations and societies the principles of justice and the rule of
law which have always imbued Islam.
</P>
<P>
"Glorious traditions provide us with clear guidelines to
strengthen our institutions and promote peace, harmony and
progress within our nations and societies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said the nations must revive the ability of their
societies to acquire education and learning, to apply science and
to create knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"We must make a collective commitment to make the promotion of
education, science and technology the highest priority of our
national endeavors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that the nations must take decisions to promote
unity within the Muslim world and to overcome divisions and
differences.
</P>
<P>
"We must contribute to peaceful reconciliation in Afghanistan
on the basis of the Islamic principles of equity and justice
taking into account the interests of all groups and the people of
Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested to create a permanent Summit Committee to mediate
disputes and differences that exist or may arise among Muslim
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the nations must pursue greater economic,
trade and financial cooperation among Islamic countries as a means
of accelerating growth and socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Our cooperation is essential to maximize the advantages of
mutual trade and investment and to remain competitive in the
increasingly open and globalized world economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Kashmir issue, Leghari said that Kashmir is an
Islamic cause.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmiri people have been ruthlessly denied their right to
self-determination, as prescribed in several binding resolutions
of the Security Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a just solution of the Kashmir dispute, in
accordance with the United Nations resolutions, is essential to
ease the tensions which have afflicted relations between India and
Pakistan over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said Pakistan desires good relations with India.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, these must be founded on the principles
of the UN Charter, including respect for each other's sovereignty
and independence.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tension Remains High Between Israelis, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- As tension remains high
between the Israelis and Palestinians following the suicide
bombing Friday, Israeli border police shot and injured two
Palestinians this morning near the West Bank town of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred following Friday's suicide bombing
attack in Tel Aviv, which killed three Israelis and wounded 46
others, and two days of confrontation between Israeli soldiers
and Palestinian protesters in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
following the attack, and the home of Moussa Ranimat, the bomber
and a member of Hamas, was sealed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli General Security Service Chief Ami Ayalon met Friday
night with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) security heads
and demanded the immediate rearrest of some 150 prisoners
released by the PNA over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani blasted PNA
President Yasser Arafat for giving the green light to "terrorist"
organizations and for failing to prevent attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of Palestinians rushed to the area between
Palestinian and Israeli-controlled Hebron to hold demonstrations
Friday and Saturday, leaving dozens of Palestinians and several
Israelis wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army said that soldiers fired some live bullets when
"their lives were in danger", adding 12 soldiers and border
policemen and an Israeli boy were lightly wounded in the two days
of clashes.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the total closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, the Israeli army also imposed a curfew on H2, the area of
Hebron still under Israeli control, and ordered Palestinians in
H1, the area under Palestinian control, and H2 to remain in their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The latest unrest came after the Israeli government decided to
go ahead with the construction of a new Jewish neighborhood in
Arab East Jerusalem despite strong warnings from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians term the construction as another Israeli attempt
to Judaize Jerusalem, a city which the Palestinians see as the
capital for their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that Israel's insistence to build on Jabal Abu
Ghneim (Har Homa) "violates the signed accords, and contradicts
the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejected
allegations that his government's decision to build new Jewish
homes in Har Homa created the conditions for the Friday suicide
bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
He held the PNA responsible for the attack and demanded the
PNA to rearrest the recently released 150 leaders of Hamas and
Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials condemned the suicide bombing attack, but
rejected charges that Arafat had given Hamas a "green light" by
releasing some of the organization's activists.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is due to convene a meeting of the inner cabinet
today to discuss the security situation after Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held a special meeting with
top security brass Saturday night.

<P>
SAN DIEGO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 local people and
Californians from Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities
today visited two Chinese naval vessels lying at anchor here.
</P>
<P>
The destroyers and an oiler arrived in the Naval Base San Diego
Friday morning, the first visit ever to the continental United
States by Chinese flotilla.
</P>
<P>
Visitors fell into a long line as the two destroyers began to
open to public at 13:00, local time. Two hours later, the line
grew to at least 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Most eye-catching in the line were wheel-chairs, baby carriages
and boy scouts.
</P>
<P>
Most of those in the queue had never seen Chinese naval ships
nor sailors before.
</P>
<P>
Those interviewed expressed their good impressions. Marvin
Delgado, 75, said that he had been a sailor for 17 years and
visited naval vessels of several foreign countries. "It's my first
time to see Chinese ships. They are nice-looking and the sailors
are well behaved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from the local Chinese community carried banners and
flowers when coming in large groups organized by their
associations. There are hundreds of such associations in Los
Angeles alone.

ISLAMABAD, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) is holding an extraordinary summit here today to
celebrate Pakistan's Golden Jubilee year of independence.
</P>
<P>
The grouping of 54-states was founded on September 25, 1969 in
Rabat, Morocco, when the first-ever meeting of the leaders of the
Islamic world was held.
</P>
<P>
The Charter of the OIC aims to strengthen the solidarity among
the member states, to promote cooperation in the political,
economic, social, cultural and scientific fields, and to work to
eliminate racial discrimination and all forms of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
The OIC has main bodies, secondary organs, institutions and
specialized committees.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Summit Conference is the supreme body of the OIC
entrusted to examine questions of vital importance and spell out
the Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Conference meets every three years or whenever the
interests of the Muslim nations so require. To date, seven summit
conferences have been held.
</P>
<P>
The OIC's second principal body is the Islamic Conference of
Foreign Ministers. It is responsible for defining the policies to
be followed.
</P>
<P>
It meets every year and has so far held 24 meetings, the last
one in Jakarta, Indonesia, in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the General Secretariat is the executive organ of
the OIC and the International Islamic Court of Justice is yet to
be established.
</P>
<P>

DAR ES SALAAM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Muslims in Tanzania have been
urged to build primary and secondary schools than just giving
priority to the construction of mosques.

Tanzania Vice-President Omari Ali Juma made this urgement

Muslims, saying the rich should be generous to the poor by
helping them out of poverty.

NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram said that roughly one percent economic growth might

eight percent economic growth was possible if the pace of

he said he had targeted an economic growth rate of seven
percent in the current fiscal year keeping in view the dismal
performance in both power generation and crude oil production.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- More suspected cases of dengue
fever, a mosquito-transmitted disease, have been reported from
different parts of New Delhi, The Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Following the first such case reported earlier this week, at
least four more cases have been reported in various Delhi
government hospitals during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The blood samples of the patients have been taken to relevant
authorities for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, malaria cases are also coming in large numbers to
the government-run hospitals in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Health experts believe that the sudden increase in mosquito
population is responsible for these cases.
</P>
<P>
They say the increase in the number of mosquitoes was due to
their resistance to pesticides and mosquito repellents, suggesting
that the authorities would have to think of new control measures.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Saturday that the
government was geared up this year to tackle dengue.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have made all arrangements. A dengue action plan
has already been formulated."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people died and nearly 10 thousands hospitalized in
a breakout of dengue fever in the capital last year.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rises Marginally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation rose marginally by 0.01 percentage points to 7.79
percent for the week ending March 8, after maintaining a steady
decline for two weeks, Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The rate stood at 4.9 percent during the corresponding period
of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation had shed 0.13 percentage points during the two
previous weeks before the trend was reversed.
</P>
<P>
However, the official wholesale price index (WPI) for "all
commodities" (base 1981-82=100) for the week under review declined
to 322.6 (provisional) as against 322.7 (provisional) during the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
This is for the 102nd week that the inflation rates have
maintained single digit levels.
</P>
<P>
The rise in inflation during the week under review can be
attributed to higher prices of commodities such as wheat and salt.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Forum on 100-day Countdown for HK's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Well-known figures from both
China's inland areas and Hong Kong gathered at a forum here
Saturday to mark the 100-day countdown for Hong Kong's return to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The participants reviewed the history of Hong Kong and the
process of its return to the motherland, gave a brief account of
its present society, economy, ane the bright future.
</P>
<P>
They all described Hong Kong's return as a major event in the
contemporary history of China and even in the world.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that only when the principle of "one country,
two systems" put forward by Deng Xiaoping is firmly implemented,
can Hong Kong have such a good situation in its economic growth
and people's full confidence in its future and is it possible to
ensure China's resumption of exercising its sovereignty over
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) reflects a series of specific
principles of "one country, two systems", "the Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy for various
aspects such as politics, economy, culture, education and
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law has provided a guarantee for maintaining Hong
Kong's long prosperity and stability, they added.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that Hong Kong's return to the
motherland constitutes the first step of the country's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to grasp this favorable chance to bring into
full play the special role of Hong Kong as a special
administrative region, and promoting the extensive exchanges across
the straits and realize the reunification of the motherland
through applying the principle of "one country, two systems" at an
earlier date.
</P>
<P>
The forum was jointly sponsored by the People's Daily and the
China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification.

<HEADLINE> Venus Downs Capriati to Set Date with Hingis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Former American tennis prodigy
Jennifer Capriati could not change the rule of the day and was
sent home by 16-year-old compatriot Venus Williams in the second
round of the Lipton Championships on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Williams, projected widely as a sure bet future top-10 player,
scored a 7-6, 3-6, 6-2 victory over the 28th seed. Capriati, who
turns 21 next week, squandered a 5-1 first-set lead as her latest
comeback efforts continued to be faltering.
</P>
<P>
Williams will be undergoing the real test when she faces
Martina Hingis, who was soon to be world number one, in a battle
of 16-year-olds in the third round.
</P>
<P>
In the men's second-round event, world number one Pete Sampras
keeps marching along by crushing 77th-ranked Adrian Voinea of
Romania 6-2, 6-0 in a swift 48-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Thomas Muster was dragged into a third set, but
walked away unscathed with a 6-4, 2-6, 6-1 victory over
69th-ranked Grant Stafford of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Australian Open runner-up Carlos Moya of Spain, the seventh
seed, also successfully sailed along the tournament with a 7-6,
6-4 second-round victory over Argentine Marcelo Charpentier.
</P>
<P>
American badboy Jeff Tarango, once banished from Wimbledon for
bad behaviour, had another tempermental moment.
</P>
<P>
Tarango claimed a spectator had taunted him and threatened to
kill him and the tempestuous American was ready to abandon his
match unless the fan was removed from the stands.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred with Tarango down 5-7, 0-40 to eighth
seed Marcelo Rios of Chile. The 72nd-ranked Tarango eventually
completed the match after losing the second set 6-2.

<HEADLINE> OAU Summit on Zaire to Focus on Cease-fire: Salim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 22 (Xinhua) -- How to make the Zairean rebels
accept a cease-fire before talks is "one of the challenges"
facing an extraordinary summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) to be held in Lome, Togo on March 26, OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua during his flight to
Lome for the summit, Salim said the summit will discuss what kind
of mechanism should be set up for the implementation of a
five-point U.N./OAU peace plan on the Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan, adopted by the U.N. Security Council on
February 18, provides for an immediate cease-fire, the withdrawal
of foreign forces, negotiations and elections as well as the
protection of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has accepted the peace plan, but the
rebels led by Laurent Kabila still insist on talks before a
truce.
</P>
<P>
Salim added that "it is one of the challenges that face the
OAU summit to end the hostilities between the warring parties" to
facilitate a political solution to the escalating crisis in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Lome summit will be attended by all members of the OAU
Central Organ of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution, Zaire and all its neighbors, African
members of the U.N. Security Council, and Kenya and South Africa
which initiated the special initiative, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on western powers' positions on the Zaire
conflict, he said, "different western countries have different
historical interests and different relationship with Zaire."
</P>
<P>
But "it is important that we need to work together with the
rest of the international community for the purpose of the
Zairean people to end the present fighting," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the OAU summit, a meeting called Nairobi III
initiated by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi will also be held
in Lome to discuss how to reach a negotiated solution to the
Zaire conflict.
</P>
<P>
Salim revealed that Kenya, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Uganda,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Cameroun, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Congo will be
represented at the brief meeting to be held on the evening of
March 25.
</P>
<P>
He further said that all these countries will attend the OAU
summit in Togo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is
scheduled for Kinshasa on Monday to invite Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Kabila to be present at the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Main Opposition Enforces Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) enforced a nationwide strike today to
protest transit and power import from India, subregional grouping
and government's "failures" to resolve problems affecting public
life.
</P>
<P>
The 8-hour shutdown, from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. (local time),
dramatically reduced the number of vehicles running on the street
though all public offices and most shops still remained open.
</P>
<P>
BNP chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia on March
19 announced the strike, the first major street protest against
the nine-month-old government of Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
To make the strike a success, the BNP brought out torch
processions Saturday throughout the country. It is reported that a
number of clashes occurred at different places and some BNP
activists were arrested.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, a day after the strike was called, four
top-ranking leaders of the BNP were arrested on charges of their
involvement in activities affecting law and order.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has decided to face this strike
through administrative measures. The police administration was
seen active to check possible violence during the strike.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is now in Islamabad attending
a special summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference, on
Friday gave a cold shoulder to the strike called by the BNP.
</P>
<P>
"Let them do the strike. Take it easy and don't try to resist
it. If they take the course of violence, the law will take its own
course," she told a high-level meeting of her ruling Awami
(people's) League.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Businessmen Urge Government to Scrap Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen in Nepal urged the
newly formed government to scrap a value added tax (VAT) regime,
which they said could pose a negative impact on the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
A group of leading businessmen met with Finance Minister
Rabindra Sharma Saturday to apprise him of the problems related to
the implementation of the upcoming VAT system, urging the
government to withdraw the decision on the new tax.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's former government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba had decided
to introduce the VAT from the 1997-98 fiscal year starting in
mid-July with a view to increasing national revenue and preventing
tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba government stepped down earlier this month after
losing a confidence vote in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen here are hopeful that the new government under
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, which took office 10 days ago, will lift
the decision of implementing the new tax system.
</P>
<P>
They argued that under the present circumstances the country
lacks of thorough studies and adequate preparations for
implementing the VAT.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sharma reportedly told the business leaders
that the government is firm to make tax administration more
effective to generate revenue.
</P>
<P>
So far the new government has not yet given any signal about
its position on the VAT issue, but officials of the VAT department
said that the new tax will be put into force as earlier scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns NATO Against Its Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The NATO eastward
expansion will revive divisions and suspicions in Europe,
Russian State Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznyov said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Attempts to create a European security system around NATO
which is a rudiment of the Cold War and plans to expand it to the
East will inevitably lead to new divisions and revive the
psychological climate of suspiciousness and hostility." Seleznyov
told the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
On debates of the Duma deputies with their foreign counterparts
in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Western European Union
Assembly on NATO's expansion, he said,"there is no consensus on
this issue even among Western parliamentarians themselves."
</P>
<P>
He complained that "the fire is also fanned by some legislators
from East European countries and ex-Soviet republics, whose
speculations on 'Russian threat' have become a powerful tool
for 'forcing tears and cheap credits out of the West'".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he criticized foreign officials for giving assent to
Russia on many points in private discussions but favoring NATO's
expansion plans at formal meetings.
</P>
<P>
During the Russia-U.S. summit held in Helsinki, Finland, on
Thursday and Friday, Russia failed to convince the West to give up
its plan of NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Russian lawmakers consider the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly as
the "core of the parliamentary dimension of a new" Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to tap the Assembly's potential in full in
order to ensure reliable security in Europe and create an
efficient mechanism for resolving disputes by political means, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Russia is interested in a consistent
development of relations with the European Union in all areas
under its recently-ratified Agreement on Partnership and
Cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov noted that the task of building a new Europe is one
of the priorities of Russia's parliamentary ties with foreign
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today condemned the United
States for sending subversive material to the country, calling it
"an abuse of the prerogatives international law grants to the
diplomatic mission".
</P>
<P>
An official statement issued by the Cuban Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said that on February 28 an open suitcase with pocket-book
size copies of the "Plan of Support for Transition in Cuba"
arrived in Havana in a foreign airline flight.
</P>
<P>
The text of the transition plan is "a document offensive to the
sovereignty and dignity of Cuba," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It is a diplomatic practice axiom, stated in the Convention of
Vienna, that a diplomatic mission cannot commit illegal actions on
the territory of the host country, added the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry sent a letter to the United States Section
of Interests to protest this new attempt to subvert Cuba through
the use of the diplomatic pouch.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry said that the law of reaffirmation of
the dignity and sovereignty of Cuba, passed recently by the Cuban
Legislative Assembly, considers it illicit to distribute material
that facilitate the application of the so-called Helms-Burton law
or of U.S. propaganda against the island country.

TIRANA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino today dismissed the rebels' call for the resignation of
President Sali Berisha, saying it would cause a power vacuum in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who have controlled most of the southern part of

In a joint statement issued in the city of Tepelena on Friday, the

Berisha resigned.

"The government has a more important mission than asking for
the president's resignation," Fino told foreign media after
holding talks in Tirana with a group of rebel leaders from
southern port city of Vlore.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between Fino and the rebels since
Fino took oath as prime minister of the all-party national unity
government earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been plunged into chaos since the collapse of
high-risk investment schemes earlier this year, in which nearly
every Albanian family lost money. Berisha was blamed for not
stopping the schemes in time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of most political parties represented in the
government have made clear they want an end to Berisha's
presidency, but by democratic means.
</P>
<P>
However, Berisha noted in an interview with a Spanish TV
station today that he will not resign.
</P>
<P>
But he agreed to hold new parliamentary elections by June and
promised to quit if his party lost the fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to deliver on a promise of elections by June, Fino
said the elections would not be considered democratic or fair if
they were held while fighting raged.
</P>
<P>
Another topic at the meeting was reopening the port to allow in
foreign aid shipments.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we could re-establish order, get humanitarian aid, and
improve economic standards, but there will be problems in the
collection of weapons," Fino said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leaders at the meeting promised Fino they would
stabilize the situation in Vlore so it could serve as an example
for the whole country.
</P>
<P>
So far, the European Union has expressed its willingness to
help supply humanitarian aid to Albania if security improves.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Three steel needles of unknown
origin were removed from a 24-year-old man's brain, after having
been there for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
A group of physicians, led by Professor Zhang Xiang at Xijing
Hospital in northwest China's Xi'an, in a two-hour operation
successfully removed a 4.5-cm long needle and two 3.5-cm long

the city's Baqiao District.
</P>
<P>
Li had suffered from migraines and convulsions frequently
since childhood, and local doctors diagnosed him as suffering from
epilepsy, but he did not respond to treatment.
</P>
<P>
Nothing happened until he came to Xijing Hospital, where
doctors discovered the problem, but said that the needles might
have been inserted into his brain when he was about one year
old. Who did it and why remained a mystery.
</P>

Now he has made a full recovered from last week's operation

<P>
SHENZHEN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, China's first of the
five special economic zones (SEZ) has become one of the most
attractive invesment areas in inland areas for the business people
of the Taiwan region.
</P>
<P>
A total of 363 million US dollars-worth of invesment from
Taiwan flowed into Shenzhen last year, setting up 231 enterprises
in the booming city adjacent to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This brought the total number of Taiwan-funded enterprises in
Shenzhen to more than 2,300 by 1996, with a combined contractual
investment volume of more than two billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen now has 27 Taiwan-funded firms with investment
exceeding 10 million US dollars each. Some of which cost more than
50 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among Taiwan's top 1000 companies, 35 have set up joint
ventures in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan business people intend to build a five-square-kilometers
industrial park in the city. Construction work on
one-square-kilometer land is expected to be completed during the
first phase, to introduce a group of Taiwan-funded hi-tech
projects in the fields of chemicals, computers and parts,
household appliances, building and decoration materials, and light
industrial products.

<HEADLINE> Bidding For Three Gorges Project Becoming Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Three Gorges Project on the
Yangtze River has become a juicy pie for producers of engineering
equipment, who are trying to slice a piece with public bids.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a quarter of the 200 billion yuan needed in investment
for the project will be spent on purchase of engineering
equipment for dam-building.
</P>
<P>
However, China has to order most of the equipment from abroad
since few domestic producers can meet the challenges of the dam
with their products.
</P>
<P>
Overseas producers of engineering equipment from Japan, the
U.S., Germany, and Sweden have won most of the orders for
engineering equipment over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Overseas producers have provided about 80 percent of the
equipment running at the construction site of the Three Gorges Dam
Project, including excavators, bulldozers, concrete mixers and
self-unloading trucks.
</P>
<P>
Some overseas companies even took joint action in order to win
in the public biddings.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Mitsubishi Corp won a 17.82 million US dollar
order last December, who jointly took part in the bidding with a
French and an American company.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese producers of engineering equipment have also
started bidding for project orders, and three allied Chinese
companies took an order valued at 10 million dollars last July.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Region's Fast Growth In Light Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
in northwest China has seen rapid development of its light and
textiles industries in the past several years, according to a
local official.
</P>
<P>
The two sectors accounted for 40 percent of the region's total
industrial output last year, the official added.
</P>
<P>
He attributes the development of the two sectors to rapid
growth in agriculture. The region now produces mainly sugar,
canned foods, fruits, furs and leather, and wine .
</P>
<P>
Sugar output totaled 500,000 tons last year, ranking fourth in
China. Tomato products amounted to 160,000 tons, leading the
nation.
</P>
<P>
In the textiles industry, the state's strategy of shifting
weaving spindles to the west from the eastern parts of the country
has paid off. Since the early 1990s, Xinjiang has introduced one
million spindles to the region, bringing the numbers of spindles
to 1.8 million last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the region's cotton processing
capacity is expected to reach three million spindles, making it
one of China's key textile industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
The region now not only has a comprehensive textile industry
but also new name-brands for leather and cashmere goods on both
the domestic and global markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China's leading telecom
company is to enter the country's thriving computer market in hope
to diversify its business scope, according to today's Business
Weely (China Daily).
</P>
<P>
"Telecommunication technology is developing so fast as
telephones, video-conferencing, Internet and other
person-to-person communications are being modernized," Zhang
Qingzhong, president of China National Posts and
Telecommunications Industry Corp. (PTIC), was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Telecom companies are afraid of being squeezing from the
market in which computer and telecom technologies have already
been highly integrated in one," he explained the motive behind the
involvement for his company into a fresh new market.
</P>
<P>
To ensure quality development in the computer manufacture, PTIC
insists on cooperation with established foreign firms, according
to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
PTIC this year will focus on developing such new technologies
as telephone switching, asynchronous transfer mode technology,
synchronous digital hierarchy, code division multiple access flex
paging and multi-media computer.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the needs of a market-oriented economy, the state
corporation is changing its mandated management by allowing three
of its 160 subsidiary factories to go public.
</P>
<P>
Last year, PTIC's sales topped 16.5 billion yuan, up 21 percent
from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the president as saying that PTIC's sales
would grow at least 20 percent this year to exceed 19.8 billion
yuan (2.4 billion US dollars).

JOHANNESBURG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- World Boxing Union (WBU)
super-bantamweight champion Cassius Baloyi retained his title here
on Saturday with a narrow points win over fellow South African
Anton Gilmore.

All three judges scored the fierce 12-rounder in Baloyi's

his previous 15 professional bouts, lacked his usual fire.
</P>
<P>
In the fight which marked the first-ever world title bout
between two South Africans, the challenger Gilmore, launching the
attack to Baloyi from the opening bell, forced the defending
champion in rounds eight and nine to be in serious danger of
giving up his crown.
</P>
<P>
However, Baloyi managed to fight back in the last three rounds,
and did just enough to keep his grip on the title he lifted from

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Witnesses Achievements on "Governing Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A number of law enforcement personnel who were poorly trained
or who broke the law have been removed from their posts.
</P>
<P>
Since the second half of last year, Chinese courts at all
levels have begun reforms of judicial procedures to develop an
open, effective, and clean judicial system.
</P>
<P>
In Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province,
the city television station has live broadcast some cases every
week so that people can see a case from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
The live broadcasts made the judicial process more transparent
and helped improve people's legal awareness.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say they believe that improving people's legal
awareness is an important step toward "governing the country
according to the law."
</P>
<P>
People involved in legislation and the mass media have been
paying greater attention to urging people to protect their rights
and interests by relying on the law.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of lawyers now play a more important role in China
and more people have come to use the law to solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Ministry of Justice, over
250,000 enterprises and units have legal advisors. Chinese lawyers
now deal with 1.04 million civil, criminal, economic, and
administrative lawsuits a year, and handle 450,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Ping, a professor at the Chinese University of Political
Science and Law, says that the essence of the legal system is that
laws are more authoritative than power, and that power must be
controlled by law.
</P>
<P>
Chinese legal experts here believe that "governing the country
according to the law" will have a great impact on developing the
socialist legal system, safeguarding the stability and development
of the country, and building the socialist market economy, as well
as on political reforms.

<HEADLINE> Polish National Assembly Passes New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Poland's National Assembly passed
a new constitution today with two thirds of votes in favor, the
Polish Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution, which replaces the 1952 constitution,
contains totally 237 articles in 12 chapters besides the preface.
</P>
<P>
"It ensures the development of a market economy at the same
time as guaranteeing the necessary level of social security of
citizens," lower house speaker Jozef Zych said.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution states that Poland's economic system is to
be a "social market economy based on the freedom of economic
enterprise, private property as well as solidarity, dialogue and
the cooperation of social partners."
</P>
<P>
The draft said that "the Polish state guarantees legal
protection of every man's life" and guarantees free
publicly-funded basic health care for all regardless of income and
free education, although it admits the possibility of some charges
for higher education.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution, the parliament is allowed to
overturn the president's veto with three-fifths of votes in the
lower house rather than the present two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
The president would also have less say in appointments in the
foreign, defense and interior ministries.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution enshrines equal rights for all churches
and religious organizations and the state's impartiality towards
all religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly made great changes to the 1952
constitution in April 1989 and, based on that, adopted an interim
constitution in 1992 for the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
The draft, which the deputies to the Assembly began to draw up
in 1993, will go to President Alexsander Kwasniewski, who has 60
days to introduce amendments to the draft.
</P>
<P>
The draft will then be returned to the National Assembly for a
final reading and vote and will then be submitted to a national
referendum, which officials said might be held on May 25.

<HEADLINE> Oil Contributing One Third of Xinjiang's Output Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Oil and petro-chemical industries
now contribute one third of the total output value of this remote
Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the achievement to the region's
vigorous efforts in tapping easily-found natural resources in the
locality, mainly oil and coal reserves, over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The region has invested some 50 billion yuan in oil exploration
since the 1990s and has built a dozen new oilfields, forming an annual
production capacity of 17 million tons of oil, according to local
sources.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has completely set up its oil and petro-chemical
industries, supported by scientific research, prospecting and
drilling, production, transportation, and logistics departments.
</P>
<P>
It has built three major oil production centers -- Karamay,
Tarim and Turpan-Hami oilfields and three oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
Construction has also started on five other petrochemical
projects in the autonomous region, inhabited mainly by people of
Muslim background.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has also built more than 700 coal mines
and has formed an industrial cartel supported by geological
prospecting, designing, coal mining and coal chemical
sectors. Coal mines of the region produced 27 million tons of coal
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, electricity is now available to 90 percent of
Xinjiang's administrative villages after the establishment of a
power network in Xinjiang, which is supported by hydro, thermal
and wind power stations. The region generated 13.2 billion kwh of
electricity last year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Witnesses Achievements on "Governing Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- March 15 is China's Consumers'
Rights Day. Chinese lawyers, law enforcement agencies, the media,
and consumers joined their efforts to expose, criticize, and
punish manufacturers and sellers of shoddy or fake goods around
March 15.
</P>
<P>
This is a typical act of Chinese people to safeguard their own
rights and interests according to a law -- the Consumers' Rights
and Interests Protection Law.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Chinese people's sense of self-protection
according law has been promoted in other fields.
</P>
<P>
After China fixed the goal to "govern the country according to
law" in 1995, the Chinese government adopted a series of measures
to ensure the gradual achievements of that goal.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, China's top leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng
and Qiao Shi stressed time and again the importance of "governing
the country according to law."
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiafu, famous legal expert who once gave lectures on laws
in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the government, to senior
officials, said: "governing the country by law is the inevitable
outcome of the Chinese society."
</P>
<P>
He believed that "governing the country according to law" meant
to respect and safeguard the authority of the national
constitution and the laws, officials at all levels must
administrate according to law.
</P>
<P>
He added that "governing the country according to law" firmly
opposes "replacing laws with one's words" and "placing power above
laws," but advocates instead that all citizens are equal before
the law.
</P>
<P>
Wang said conditions for realizing "governing the country
according to law" include a complete legal system, widespread
democracy and a complete supervision system, fair and strict
systems of law enforcement and jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
A host of facts proved that China has made steady development
in practising "governing the country according to law."
</P>
<P>
As the basis of "governing the country according to law," the
country has achieved marked progress in its legal building,
including the drawing up of the framework of laws on building the
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
To improve the qualities of judges and prosecutors and other
law enforcement personnel, China has been running a series of
training classes.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Crashes Again In Lipton Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi's losing streak
ran to five matches Saturday as Australian Scott Draper defeated
the defending champion 7-6 (7-6), 6-1 at the ATP Lipton
Championships in Florida.
</P>
<P>
It marked the fourth consecutive first-round straight-set loss
for Agassi. His last victory was in the quarter-finals at San Jose
last month when he beat Grant Doyle 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Draper hit a service winner en route to his victory in the
tie-breaker. He finished off the former world number-one in 80
minutes, reaching the third-round at the 2.45 million-dollar event.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who will be 27 next month, has won the Wimbledon,
U.S. Open and Australian Open titles -- but has not won any ATP
title in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Agassi was not the only seed to vanish as the second-round
games came to an end.
</P>
<P>
German Boris Becker withdrew with an injured right wrist and
sixth-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden fell to Canada's Daniel
Nestor 7-6 (11-9), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
The 14th seed Tim Henman of Britain went down 6-7 (4-7), 6-2,
6-3 to Spain's Julian Alonso, a 20-year-old qualifier from
Barcelona who made his debut in the hardcourt tournament.
</P>
<P>
Third-seed Michael Chang extended his winning streak to 11
matches by beating fellow American and qualifier Mark Merklein
6-3, 7-6 (7-4). He now faces a third-round meeting with Spain's
Sergi Bruguera.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Refutes Rebels' Call for Resignation of President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino today dismissed the rebels' call for the resignation of
President Sali Berisha, saying it would cause a power vacuum in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who have controlled most of the southern part of
the country, have been calling for the resignation of Berisha.
In a joint statement issued in the city of Tepelena on Friday, the
rebels reiterated that they would not lay down weapons unless
Berisha resigned.
</P>
<P>
"The government has a more important mission than asking for
the president's resignation," Fino said in an interview with
Reuters in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
"It would create an institutional vacuum if Berisha were to
resign," he added.

<HEADLINE> OAU Summit on Zaire to Focus on Cease-fire: Salim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, March 22 (Xinhua) -- How to make the Zairean rebels
accept a cease-fire before talks is "one of the challenges"
facing an extraordinary summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) to be held in Lome, Togo on March 26, OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua during his flight to
Lome for the summit, Salim said the summit will discuss what kind
of mechanism should be set up for the implementation of a
five-point U.N./OAU peace plan on the Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan, adopted by the U.N. Security Council on
February 18, provides for an immediate cease-fire, the withdrawal
of foreign forces, negotiations and elections as well as the
protection of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has accepted the peace plan, but the
rebels led by Laurent Kabila still insist on talks before a
truce.
</P>
<P>
Salim added that "it is one of the challenges that face the
OAU summit to end the hostilities between the warring parties" to
facilitate a political solution to the escalating crisis in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Lome summit will be attended by all members of the OAU
Central Organ of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,
Management and Resolution, Zaire and all its neighbors, African
members of the U.N. Security Council, and Kenya and South Africa
which initiated the special initiative, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on western powers' positions on the Zaire
conflict, he said, "different western countries have different
historical interests and different relationship with Zaire."
</P>
<P>
But "it is important that we need to work together with the
rest of the international community for the purpose of the
Zairean people to end the present fighting," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the OAU summit, a meeting called Nairobi III
initiated by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi will also be held
in Lome to discuss how to reach a negotiated solution to the
Zaire conflict.
</P>
<P>
Salim revealed that Kenya, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Uganda,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Cameroun, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Congo will be
represented at the brief meeting to be held on the evening of
March 25.
</P>
<P>
He further said that all these countries will attend the OAU
summit in Togo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is
scheduled for Kinshasa on Monday to invite Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Kabila to be present at the
summit.

<P>
SARAJEVO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- the newly-elected president of
the Bosnian Federation on calls for close cooperation between
ruling parties of the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, in an interview
published on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Soljic, president of the federation and a Croat, told
the local newspaper Vecernje Novine, that without political
agreement between Muslims' Democratic Action party (SDA) and Croat
Democratic Union (HDZ), the federation government can not function
properly.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the two parties need to speed up the
establishment of authorities in the federation to prevent a new
war from erupting.
</P>
<P>
"Through irresponsible policy and armed threats, everything
that had happened could be repeated, and in that case, no one
normal would try to reintegrate Bosnia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soljic, who was defense minister of the federation, said that
he did not belong to the hardline wing of the HDZ and as
president, he would try to be realistic, seeking "open dialog,
tolerance and mutual respect".

BAGHDAD -- The Japanese Cosmo Oil Company signed a contract
with the Iraqi Oil Marketing Corporation on the purchase of
900,000 barrels of the Basra light oil from Iraq, the first oil
deal between the two countries in eight years, local daily
Al-Gomhouriya reported today.
</P>
<P>
The oil will be shipped from April 10 to 25 from Al-Bakr
seaport in southern Iraq.

the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq following Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- An Iraqi oil official stressed the recently-set up
Iraqi-Russian joint venture for drilling and oil reclamation will
play a significant role in Iraq's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Iraqi Drilling Company Ibrahim
Abdul-Karim said "The new firm is a joint venture between the
Iraqi Drilling Company on one hand and two Russian companies
namely Roz and Zdensht on the other," the Iraqi News Agency
quoted Abdul-Karim as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The two Russian firms will bring to Iraq hi-tech equipment in
the field of drilling and updating the standing oilfields.
