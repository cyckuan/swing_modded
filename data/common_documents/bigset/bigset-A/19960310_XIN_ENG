<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed, 5 Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
and four wounded today by a land mine planted by guerrillas near
the Lebanese-Israeli border, and another Israeli soldier was
injured this morning in guerrilla bombardments at an Israeli
position.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that the two
Israelis were killed and four others wounded when an Israeli
military vehicle was destroyed by a mine at noon today near the
international border.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the operation, announcing in a statement that
its guerrillas launched the bomb attack at an Israeli patrol deep
inside an Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, also
announced that they mounted an attack in the morning at an
Israeli convoy in the Bint Jbail area, and shelled the Israeli
positions at Haddatha and Shaf, but it failed to mention the
casualties caused by the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian Amal movement announced that its guerrillas
attacked this morning the Israeli positions at Qalaa Ash-Shqif,
Burj, Ali At-Taher and Dabsheh.
</P>
<P>
It said in another statement that its militants ambushed an
Israeli patrol between the Israeli positions of Burj and Ali
At-Taher, but it did not specify any casualty among the Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio confirmed that an Israeli soldier was wounded in
the shelling by guerrillas targeting the Israeli position of
Dabsheh, adding that the wounded has been transferred to a
hospital inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the guerrilla attacks, the Israeli forces
from their positions in the bordering buffer zone bombarded today
a number of suspected guerrilla bases in south Lebanon, causing no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Security sources stressed that today's operations did not go
beyond daily trades of fire between the Israeli occupation forces
and Lebanese guerrillas in south Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of suicide bombings in Israel in the past
half a month, Hezbollah has reportedly evacuated its cadres from
south Lebanon to other sectors of the country, closed its clinics
and social service centers in the area and put its guerrillas in a
maximum alert, in preparation for an Israeli revenge.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army has also closed all the checkpoints to the
Israeli-occupied border strip, preventing an entry of Palestinians
who could be deported by the Israeli authority, as a penalty for
the suicide bombings.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Respond on Invitation to Attend Anti-Terrorism Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
will clarify Monday whether his country will attend an
international anti-terrorism summit, which is scheduled to be held
in Egypt next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This move, which is contradictory to an earlier report that
Lebanon will boycott the summit, was announced by Lebanese Foreign
Minister Fares Boueiz here today.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi will make the position known in a reply message to
U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Lebanese foreign minister said
in a press conference at his ministry late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that Hrawi had received a letter from Clinton, who
invited him to attend the anti-terrorism summit to be held in
Sharm el Sheikh, an Egyptian Red Sea resort in the southern part
of the Sinai peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call between Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and
Syrian President Hafez Assad last Friday, the two sides reportedly
took a united stand on the summit conference, an anonymous source
said earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul predicted that the
anti-terrorism summit is doomed to failure since it is aimed at
"satisfying Israel."
</P>
<P>
Dalloul maintained that it will be an "astonishing strange"
conference, because it terms those carrying weapons for a
liberation of their land as terrorists while describing those
occupying the land as fighting against the terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi called on the countries to attend the anti-terrorism
summit not to ignore "the daily practice of aggression against
Lebanon and its South."

tried immediately.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, starting from Meskel Square, walked to the

Receiving the protesters, Hailemariam Woldu, representative of
the Administrative Council of Addis, said the government has
given due attention to finding out who was behind the tragic
death of the late Hayelon.
</P>
<P>
Hayelon was head of the Operation Department of the Ministry
of Defense. The alleged assassin, Jemal Yasin Mohammed, is the

<HEADLINE> Moussa Describes Anti-Terrorism Summit as Continuation of Madrid Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here today that the upcoming international
anti-terrorism summit will be a continuation of the 1991 Madrid
Peace Conference with the aim of giving the peace march a momentum.
</P>
<P>
The Summit for Peacemakers follows the same course of the
Madrid Peace Conference, which launched the Middle East peace
process, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The summit, co-hosted by Egypt and the United States, is
scheduled to be held in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh
Wednesday to discuss means of maintaining the Arab-Israeli peace
process and fighting against terrorism that jeopardizes the
regional peace march.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the countries which will participate in the
summit took part in the Madrid Peace Conference.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one countries have been invited to attend the summit and
20 world leaders have confirmed their participation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the peace process can not be maintained without
the support of world leaders who are keen on maintaining it.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister denied that the peace process has reached
a deadlock, saying that it is currently facing some obstacles
which called for holding the summit to eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the Israeli closure of the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip, saying that the measure contradicts with what it had
committed to and as a result, the Palestinians are currently
facing severe difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is now making preparations intensively for the upcoming
summit through contacts and consultations with leaders and
high-ranking officials of other countries concerned, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit, to be attended by some 30 world leaders and
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was hurriedly
arranged in the wake of the recent four suicide bombing attacks by
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), which claimed 57 innocent
lives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Minister of Interior Hassan Mohamed el-Alfy
today called on Egypt's various security bodies to draw up
emergency security plans and be totally on alert to guard against
any security breakdown during the summit.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, under Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, also held
a meeting today to coordinate preparatory work for the summit.

<HEADLINE> Crown Prince on Decision to Allow US to Use Jordan for Surveillance Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's decision to allow the
U.S. planes stationed in the kingdom to fly surveillance flights
over southern Iraq is aimed at carrying out U.N. resolutions,
crown Prince Hassan said Saturday, reported the local press today.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time since the United States, Britain and
France set up a no-fly zone to Iraqi aircraft south of the
32nd parallel in August 1992 that Jordan will be used as a base
for operation.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, the allied forces have used air bases in the Gulf
and U.S. aircraft carriers as a launching pad for the surveillance
operations aimed at protecting the Shiite Moslem population in
southern Iraq from raids by the Iraqi government forces.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan, quoted by the English daily Jordan Times,
said Jordan's role in this matter emanated from the U.N.
resolutions and its geographical location in this region.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian decision of involvement in the surveillance
flights over southern Iraq was announced during King Hussein's
visit to the United States, which is widely believed to focus on
coordinating their stands vis-a-vis Iraq and making a political
change in the internationally isolated country.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Marwan Muasher, who is accompanying the
king on his visit to the U.S., announced Friday that 34 American
planes "will carry out surveillance operations over southern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced Thursday that 12 F-15 planes, 18 F-16s
and four KC-135 refueling aircraft would be deployed in Jordan in
April or June to help support the peace process and regional
security.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said the U.S. planes will also take part in joint
maneuvers with the Jordanian Air Force, adding that exercises with
the U.S. are aim at giving Jordanian pilots the needed F-16
training and experience.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti pledged Friday that Jordan
will not permit the kingdom to be used for attacks against any
Arab country.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince noted that upcoming joint Jordanian-U.S.
military exercises would offer Jordanian pilots the chance to
train on new aircraft until the kingdom receives the F-16 fighter
jets promised by the United States.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that joint exercises with the U.S. were not
anything new and such exercises were going on for years and the
exercises should be seen separate from the U.S. surveilance
operations over southern Iraq.

LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
said today that his talks with the delegation of the Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP) on Monday will be historic event, according
to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Bruton is presiding over the annual conference of his ruling
Fine Gael party this weekend in the capital of the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
Bruton said he hoped that his talks in Dublin with the UUP
delegation led by its leader David Trimble, who opposes
reunification of Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic, would
speed up reconciliation between republicans and loyalists in
Northern Ireland which is necessary for permanent peace in the
conflict-torn province.
</P>
<P>
The Irish premier on Saturday night accused the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) of training volunteers, targeting people for
assassination and developing new weapons during its 17-month
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
He urged the IRA and its political Sinn Fein to "stop thinking
in terms of threats and start thinking in terms of peaceful
persuasion".
</P>
<P>
He told his party conference that Sinn Fein could only take a
seat at the planned all-party talks on the future of Northern
Ireland on June 10 if the IRA restored the shattered ceasefire.

<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind confirmed today that his government will begin
considering whether to hold a referendum on the single European
currency.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report, the foreign secretary said that
he had been asked by Prime Minister John Major to draw up a
discussion paper on the circumstances in which a referendum "might
be useful".
</P>
<P>
Malcolm said he would distribute the document to fellow
ministers this week.
</P>
<P>
If the current schedule for the European monetary union is
maintained, Britain will have to decide in early 1998 whether to
give up the pound for the Euro.
</P>
<P>
After a period of relative quiet, it seems that dispute on
Europe is back to the agenda of the Conservative government and
party.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Prime Minister Major and his Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke will square up for a battle of nerves
over calls for a referendum on EMU.
</P>
<P>
Major made no secret of his support for the referendum, while
Clarke, an enthusiastic supporter of the single European currency,
has made veiled threats of resignation if the prime minister
succumbs to the demand for a referendum commitment.

<HEADLINE> Bank Robberies on Rise in Washington Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of bank robberies
is increasing in the Washington-Baltimore region.
</P>
<P>
Even increasingly high-tech methods for preventing and
detecting bank robberies are not stopping such crimes in the
Washington area, the Washington Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Though the number of robberies nationwide declined by 25
percent nationwide last year, it rose by nearly that much in many
parts of the Washington area compared with 1994, according to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
In the Washington area and nationally, suburban banks are just
as likely to be robbed as urban ones, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit jurisdiction in the Washington region has been
Mongomery county, with the number of bank robberies rising by 163
percent, to 50, according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials attributed the rise in bank robberies
in the Washington region to increased drug abuse, the increasing
mobility of the population and a higher concentration of bank
branches in certain areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas today said that he would try to resolve the current
political crisis on the basis of the opinions tendered by the
leaders of all political parties and with their help and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During his separate meetings with the leaders of the three
major opposition parties, the president appreciated their good
gesture in responding to his invitation promptly with a view to
ensuring social peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Biswas, however, did not mention which specific steps he would
take.
</P>
<P>
The president today first met with Sheikh Hasina, president of
the largest opposition party -- the Awami (People's) League.
</P>
<P>
Other opposition leaders who held talks with the president
included Rahman Chowdhury, acting chief of the Jatiya (National)
Party, and Matiur Rahman Nizami, deputy chief of the
Jamaat-e-Islami.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the opposition leaders submitted to the
president separate memorandum which included release of the
remaining political prisoners, cancellation of last month's
general elections, formation of a caretaker government,
resignation of the government and holding fresh polls within May.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also hoped the president would take positive steps
in averting the present situation and said they would sincerely
cooperate with him.
</P>
<P>
Later today, the government released three opposition leaders
-- Hossain Manju, secretary general of the Jatiya Party, Hossain
Manju, mayor of Chittagong city, and Mohiuddin Chowdhury from the
Awami League.

<HEADLINE> UK Urges Sinn Fein to Secure IRA Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government urged Sinn
Fein once again today to "sign up to the principles of democracy"
in resolving the Northern Ireland conflict and secure a truce by
the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC TV, Ulster political development
minister Michael Ancram reiterated that Sinn Fein could only take
part in all-party negotiations on the future of the crisis-laden
province scheduled for June 10 if the IRA revived its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Ancram said,"We want to see Sinn Fein part of the all-party
peace process, but if they continue to exclude themselves we
cannot help them."
</P>
<P>
He said all parties should show flexibility to move the peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the biggest
Protestant political party in Northern Ireland, stressed that
all-party talks on Ulster's future should go ahead either with or
without the IRA's political wing.
</P>
<P>
UUP leader David Trimble told Sky TV today that Sinn Fein did
not have a veto on democracy.
</P>
<P>
UUP deputy leader John Taylor said the IRA leadership was
divided over its bombing campaign and it needed only one vote to
reinstate the ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Ladejo Retains European Indoor Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Du'aine Ladejo of Britain
retained his title of the 400 meters event in the European indoor
athletics championship here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ladejo clocked 46.12 seconds to retain the gold he won in Paris
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Pierre-Marie Hilari was second at 46.82 and Italian
Ashraf Saber third at 46.86
</P>
<P>
Briton Ladejo, who is also the European outdoor champion but
whose world championship hopes were dashed by a hamstring injury
last summer, led from the gun to head off the challenge of Saber.
</P>
<P>
Saber remained in second place until the final stride when
Pierre-Marie Hilaire pipped him on the line for the silver.
</P>
<P>
Carla Sacramento of Portugal won the second track gold decided
on the final afternoon session of the championships being held in
wintry Stockholm's Globe Arena.
</P>
<P>
She ran an intelligent 1,500 meters, moving to the front with
a lap and half to go to overtake Catalina Ghiorghiu of Romania,
the fastest European in the world indoors this year.
</P>
<P>
She also managed to hold off the challenge of defending
champion Yekaterina Podkopayeva of Russia, who two years ago
became the oldest gold medallist in a major championship when she
won this title at the age of 41.
</P>
<P>
Although she failed to retain her title, a silver medal at 43
was a remarkable achievement against competitors half her age or
less.
</P>
<P>
Sacremento clocked four minutes 08.95 seconds, Podkopayeva
4:09.65 and Malgorzata Rydz of Poland, who beat Ghiorghiu for the
bronze, was clocked at 4:10.50.
</P>
<P>
Dragutin Topic of Yugoslavia, who won the European outdoor
title six years ago, had the high jump gold with a clearance of
2.35 meters ahead of Leonid Pumalainen of Russia (2.33) and
Steinar Hoen of Norway (2.31), the European outdoor champion.
</P>
<P>
Renata Nielsen of Denmark took the women's long jump title
with a modest leap of 6.76 meters.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Conduct Nuclear Test: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto said here today that Pakistan will not conduct any
nuclear test but will carry on with its peaceful nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in her chamber at the Parliament House,
Benazir Bhutto said, "We have a clear policy about our peaceful
nuclear program and will stick to it unless threatened."
</P>
<P>
"However, we don't feel there is any threat to Pakistan's
security presently," she added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she expressed concern over the reports that India
will conduct a nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
"It could have serious consequences," she said.
</P>
<P>
Some US officials had accused India and Pakistan of preparing
for nuclear tests this year.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about accusations from the US that
Pakistan had obtained ring-magnets from China, Bhutto said, "We
have checked with our people and they have denied obtaining any
such items."
</P>
<P>
"We have asked the US to give us more information in this
regard," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said, "We want to solve this issue as we have good
relations both with the US and China and don't want to affect
them."
</P>
<P>
Responding to another question, Bhutto denied that there was
some threat of war with India.
</P>
<P>
However, she said there was tension between the two because of
the pending issue of Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Coal Producing Giants Map out Production Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner
Mongolia, China's three major coal producing giants, are to
accelerate production of coal to meet the country's increasing
demands by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Coal production of the two provinces and the region is referred
to in Premier Li Peng's Report on the Outline of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and
the Long-Range Objectives to the Year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Coal is expected to make up 90 percent of China's total
consumption of energy by the end of this century, despite the
government's effort to promote production of oil and
hydroelectricity.
</P>
<P>
China plans to produce 1.4 billion tons of coal by the year
2000 while Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia are expected to
produce 574 million tons of coal by then.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest producer, turning out one quarter of the
national total or 78 percent in trans-provincial coal transfer,
Shanxi will concentrate on the construction of major coal
production bases while closing down the small coal fields with an
annual capacity of less than 30,000 tons, according to provincial
governor Sun Wensheng.
</P>
<P>
He said the province will produce 400 million tons of coal by
the year 2000 and sell 300 million tons to other provinces and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the province will focus on the construction of power
generation units of capacities reaching 300,000 kilowatts. The
installed power generating capacity in the province will reach 18
million kw in 2000, generating over 800 billion kw of power
annually.
</P>
<P>
With around 260 billion tons in coal deposit and promising
explorable prospects, the northwestern Shaanxi Province is
expected to come next to Shanxi, said Chen Andong, the provincial
governor.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi produces 38 million tons of coal annually with an
explorable ability of 50 million tons. The province's exploring
capacity is expected to 74 million tons by the end of the century
and 145 million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the province has listed the exploration of coal,
natural gas and petroleum on the top of its economic agenda. With
China's largest natural gas reserves, the province also plans to
speed up the development of northern Shaanxi, a poverty-stricken
area with abundant coal deposit.
</P>
<P>
Uliji, chairman of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, voiced
optimism for coal production in the region. With construction of
five large coal fields in Jungar, Helinhe, Yuanbaoshan, Yiminhe
and Dongsheng, he said, the region has pushed annual coal
production capacity from 43 million tons in 1991 to 64 million
tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the region will strive to produce 100 million
tons of crude coal, sell 100 million tons of coal to other
provinces and export three million tons by the end of this
century.

<HEADLINE> Development of Culture and Ethics Stressed at NPC and CPPCC Sessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Many participants to the ongoing
sessions of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference ( CPPCC) stressed the
importance of developing advanced socialist culture and ethics in
China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the NPC Standing Committee, said
public morality and family and professional ethics must be given
much attention along with the country's economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hanqing, an NPC deputy from Guangdong Province, said the
quality of people is the key to achieving the goals of the
country's medium and long-range development programs.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have qualified people, we can only get half the
result with twice the effort, or worse, all our previous efforts
may be wasted," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said, "It is dangerous for a
country or nation not to have fine traditions and ideological
props.
</P>
<P>
"Social development cannot rely on money alone. We should
advocate dedication and hard work among our people."
</P>
<P>
Hou Lu, a playwrite and NPC deputy, said the country's overall
development must rely on an improvement in the quality of the
entire nation, expressing his regret that some local cultural
departments are using their buildings as places for recreational
activities.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Quan Wenfu, a provincial official in Jiangxi Province,
said the public, youngsters in particular, must have a better
awareness of laws.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhun, a noted writer and CPPCC member, said a basic
requirement in the improvement of socialist culture and ethics is
self-restraint among the people.
</P>
<P>
Guo Yizong, a professor of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and
a CPPCC member, said the ideological and ethical quality of a
nation is an important component of its comprehensive national
strength.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese nation has always valued ethics, and traditional
morals are a vital component of its splendid culture," Guo said.
"Advanced ethics and a booming economy are two wings for China's
take-off."
</P>
<P>
Feng Jicai, a writer and a CPPCC member said, "It is easy for a
man to get rich, but difficult for him to get civilized."
</P>
<P>
Movie star and CPPCC member Li Moran said the emergence of
social evils have resulted from a backslide in ideological and
ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
Su Min, a director at the Beijing People's Arts Theater and a
CPPCC member, said it is important to raise the ethical quality of
parents and governmental officials.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to think that a child with lofty ideals will come
out of a family with poor ethics, and the minimum requirements for
government officials, as implementors of state policies, are that
they should be upright, just, considerate for the people and
conscientious about work, Su said.
</P>
<P>
According to CPPCC member Shao Hengqiu, there used to be 307
bookstores in Beijing at the time of the founding of New China
four decades ago, but there were only 112 last year.
</P>
<P>
Shao said China has more than 2,000 libraries, a quarter of
which, however, buy fewer than 800 books a year. Many counties
even do not have a library.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Member on Promoting Chinese Culture in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A social activist in Hong Kong
emphasized the importance of enhancing education of Chinese
culture in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong people, especially the younger generation there,
should know more about the traditions and current situation of the
Chinese nation when Hong Kong's return to the motherland draws
near," said Van Lau, chairman of the board of directors of the
Hong Kong Institute for the Promotion of Chinese Culture.
</P>
<P>
"Many Hong Kong people, especially the younger generation, have
some problem understanding the Chinese nation due to their
education received from the West," said Van, who is attending the
on-going annual session of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) here.
</P>
<P>
Van Lau was born in Guangdong Province and received his
university education in Taiwan. He moved to Hong Kong in the 1960s
and engaged himself in sculpting.
</P>
<P>
He and some other people in Hong Kong set up the institute in
1985, which in its early days was aimed at expanding Chinese
traditional culture and promoting exchanges between Chinese and
western cultures. It organizes more than 100 performances,
exhibitions and symposiums each year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, the institute has shifted its
emphasis on publicizing Chinese culture among Hong Kong's young
people, who are given opportunities to pay visits to the mainland.
The institute has also managed to publish some books and
newspapers about Chinese culture, noted historical figures and
events.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ICRC Official Urges Release of Bosnian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The three Bosnian sides still
hold some 220 prisoners, 160 of whom must be released "immediately
and unconditionally," an International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The warring sides, who had to release all prisoners by January
19 under the Dayton agreement, had so far released 806 captives,
said Francois Bellon, chief representative of the local ICRC
office.
</P>
<P>
"Out of the remaining 220 prisoners, 160 must be released
immediately and unconditionally, while 60 persons are suspected of
war crimes," Tanjug news agency quoted Bellon as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Bellon said most of the 160 prisoners are in Muslim-controlled
prisons.
</P>
<P>
Although the ICRC staff would continue to visit all 220
prisoners, they were discovering new prisons and registering new
prisoners every day in Bosnia, Bellon said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to efforts for a speedy release of all prisoners,
ICRC is also tackling the problem of those missing, Bellon said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Serbs and Muslims have claimed that thousands of their
own people were missing during the three-and-half-year civil war
that ended last November.
</P>
<P>
Bellon promised that the Red Cross would continue to send
humanitarian aid to the Bosnian Serb state Republika Srpska and to
assist Serbs who are moving out of Serb sections of Sarajevo which
should be placed under the Muslim-Croat federation's jurisdiction
by March 20.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Serbs have fled their homes in Sarajevo
for fear of possible reprisal from their former enemies who would
rule the whole capital city just within 10 days. Three of the five
Serb sectors in Sarajevo have already been placed under
Muslim-Croat administration.
</P>
<P>
"We see the developments in Sarajevo as another drama and we
cannot calmly observe another exodus, which is taking place after
the conclusion of peace and which brings new human tragedies,"
Bellon said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Member on Promoting Chinese Culture in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A social activist in Hong Kong
emphasized the importance of enhancing education of Chinese
culture in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong people, especially the younger generation there,
should know more about the traditions and current situation of the
Chinese nation when Hong Kong's return to the motherland draws
near," said Van Lau, chairman of the board of directors of the
Hong Kong Institute for the Promotion of Chinese Culture.
</P>
<P>
"Many Hong Kong people, especially the younger generation, have
some problem understanding the Chinese nation due to their
education received from the West," said Van, who is attending the
on-going annual session of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) here.
</P>
<P>
Van Lau was born in Guangdong Province and received his
university education in Taiwan. He moved to Hong Kong in the 1960s
and engaged himself in sculpting.
</P>
<P>
He and some other people in Hong Kong set up the institute in
1985, which in its early days was aimed at expanding Chinese
traditional culture and promoting exchanges between Chinese and
western cultures. It organizes more than 100 performances,
exhibitions and symposiums each year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, the institute has shifted its
emphasis on publicizing Chinese culture among Hong Kong's young
people, who are given opportunities to pay visits to the mainland.
The institute has also managed to publish some books and
newspapers about Chinese culture, noted historical figures and
events.
</P>
<P>
"Traditional Chinese culture acts as a bond for all Chinese in
China and abroad, and its influence in Hong Kong should be
enhanced. It ensures the long-term prosperity and stability in
Hong Kong," he said.

<P>
DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's top opposition leader
Sheikh Hasina today said the ongoing non-cooperation campaign
would continue until the formation of a neutral caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with President Rahman Biswas, Hasina told
reporters that she urged the president to form a neutral caretaker
government immediately and order fresh general election within May
to resolve the country's current political crisis.
</P>
<P>
No formal reaction from the president is available now.
</P>
<P>
"There is no constitutional prime minister in the country now.
The president enjoys all executive powers under the Constitution
and he should form a neutral caretaker government and announce
fresh poll in May," said Hasina, who is president of the largest
opposition party Awami (People's) League (AL).
</P>
<P>
The major opposition parties launched a non-cooperation
campaign Saturday to press for the resignation of the government
to pave the way for holding fresh polls under a neutral
government.
</P>
<P>
The government has urged the opposition to withdraw its
agitation program "without causing more sufferings to the people."

<HEADLINE> Oman Stops Efforts to Convene GCC Emergency Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sultanate of Oman, current
chairman of the Gulf Cooperation Council, GCC, today announced
its efforts to convene the group's emergency meeting have been
stopped.
</P>
<P>
The Omani Ministry of Foreign Affairs today issued an
announcement saying that the Sultanate has stopped its efforts to
convene an emergency Ministerial Council meeting (foreign
ministers) called by Qatar to discuss the coup attempt against the
government of Qatari Emir of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalid al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Oman has stopped its efforts made by it
since late February because the mediation of the Sultanate "could
not get support" from other GCC member states. The GCC groups
Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain
and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Government on February 20 called for an urgent
meeting of the GCC foreign ministers to discuss the failed coup
attempt which took place on February 17 in the Qatari capital of
Doha. It insists on holding such an urgent meeting ahead of the
ordinary meeting scheduled to be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
between March 16 and 17, to get the GCC support for Doha's stance
on the foiled coup attempt. But the response was weak.
</P>
<P>
Some of the member states insisted on holding an ordinary GCC
foreign ministers meeting in Riyadh only and some also asked Oman,
the group's current head, to hold consultations with Qatar to
investigate its claims of "outside involvement" in the failed coup.

<HEADLINE> Deepening of Reform Key to Change of Economic Growth Mode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Economic efficiency lies at the
center of China's endeavors for a change of its economic growth
mode, and higher efficiency is to be achieved mainly by deepening
the reform of the economic system, especially that of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shulian, a member of China's top advisory body and a
research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said
a change in the country's economic system and economic growth mode
is the key to fulfilling its development goals for the next 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The economist pointed out that the basic problem that impedes
an optimization of China's industrial structure remains its
economic system.
</P>
<P>
"With the majority of state-owned enterprises staying out of
market competition and lacking vitality, it is difficult to
redistribute resources for better efficiency," he said.
</P>
<P>
After more than a decade of practice, a correct path for reform
of state-owned enterprises has been found, of which the main
points are:
</P>
<P>
--With the goal of establishing a modern enterprise system for
state-owned enterprises, the majority of them should be
transformed into self-run businesses actively joining in market
competition.
</P>
<P>
-- China should stick to the policy of developing an economy of
many ownership forms with the state-owned sector playing a
dominant role.
</P>
<P>
-- Large state-owned enterprises and enterprise groups should
be the focus of the reform.
</P>
<P>
-- Increase technological progress.
</P>
<P>
-- A separation of government and enterprise should be pursued.
The economic functions of the government should be shifted to
formulation and implementation of macroeconomic controls,
improvement of infrastructure, and creation of a good economic
environment.
</P>
<P>
-- Supplementary reforms should be carried out, focusing on the
establishment of a clear managerial, supervisory and operational
system for state-owned assets, and accelerated establishment of a
social security system.

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposed to Anti-Terrorism Summit in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran today strongly condemned the
anti-terrorism summit expected to take place in the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, calling it "a political game" by
the West.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran government expressed its opposition to the
forthcoming summit by publishing editorials in three newspapers
-- Iran News, Akhbar and Resalat.
</P>
<P>
"This week's scheduled anti-terrorism summit in Egypt is only
a Western political game," said an editorial published by the
English daily Iran News.
</P>
<P>
The liberal Persian daily Akhbar said in its editorial that
the U.S. would exploit the results of the summit in Sharm el-
Sheikh for its own benefit.
</P>
<P>
"Sharm el-Sheikh summit will have to depict a new face of
terrorism so that the U.S. will be able to label anyone it
likes to label as terrorist," the daily noted.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Persian evening newspaper Resalat attacked the
summit as "an attempt to label anything that falls outside of the
category of compromise with Israel as terrorist."
</P>
<P>
It said that Iran was "the steadfast bulwark against the line
of compromise" with Israel, adding that "no policy of
intimidation" has been able to shake Iran's resolve.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the European Union (EU) was against the
American policy of isolating Iran. It further predicted that the
tension between the EU and the U.S. would become manifest at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
"Sharm el-Sheikh will be the venue where the conflict between
the U.S. and the EU will out in the open," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Saturday, Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said Iran would take part in any
international conference that was organized by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.N., as an organization which is responsible for peace
and security in the world, invites us to a conference for fighting
against terrorism, it would be quite justified that all the
U.N.-member countries would take an active part in such an event,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
In the face of wide-ranging accusations against Iran for being
behind the bombing attacks in Israel, Velayati vowed its strong
support for the Palestinian cause, adding that"we strongly support
the Palestinian cause because the Palestinians have lost their
territory."
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that it is Israel, not Iran, should be blamed for
the recent bombing attacks that put the Arab-Israeli peace process
on hold.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in the occupied territory is based on the past
and present policies of Israel. This is the result of their
failure," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Development of Culture and Ethics Stressed at NPC and CPPCC Sessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Many participants to the ongoing
sessions of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference ( CPPCC) stressed the
importance of developing advanced socialist culture and ethics in
China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the NPC Standing Committee, said
public morality and family and professional ethics must be given
much attention along with the country's economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hanqing, an NPC deputy from Guangdong Province, said the
quality of people is the key to achieving the goals of the
country's medium and long-range development programs.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have qualified people, we can only get half the
result with twice the effort, or worse, all our previous efforts
may be wasted," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said, "It is dangerous for a
country or nation not to have fine traditions and ideological
props.
</P>
<P>
"Social development cannot rely on money alone. We should
advocate dedication and hard work among our people."
</P>
<P>
Hou Lu, a playwrite and NPC deputy, said the country's overall
development must rely on an improvement in the quality of the
entire nation, expressing his regret that some local cultural
departments are using their buildings as places for recreational
activities.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Quan Wenfu, a provincial official in Jiangxi Province,
said the public, youngsters in particular, must have a better
awareness of laws.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhun, a noted writer and CPPCC member, said a basic
requirement in the improvement of socialist culture and ethics is
self-restraint among the people.
</P>
<P>
Guo Yizong, a professor of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and
a CPPCC member, said the ideological and ethical quality of a
nation is an important component of its comprehensive national
strength.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese nation has always valued ethics, and traditional
morals are a vital component of its splendid culture," Guo said.
"Advanced ethics and a booming economy are two wings for China's
take-off."
</P>
<P>
Feng Jicai, a writer and a CPPCC member said, "It is easy for a
man to get rich, but difficult for him to get civilized."
</P>
<P>
Movie star and CPPCC member Li Moran said the emergence of
social evils have resulted from a backslide in ideological and
ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
Su Min, a director at the Beijing People's Arts Theater and a
CPPCC member, said it is important to raise the ethical quality of
parents and governmental officials.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to think that a child with lofty ideals will come
out of a family with poor ethics, and the minimum requirements for
government officials, as implementors of state policies, are that
they should be upright, just, considerate for the people and
conscientious about work, Su said.
</P>
<P>
According to CPPCC member Shao Hengqiu, there used to be 307
bookstores in Beijing at the time of the founding of New China
four decades ago, but there were only 112 last year.
</P>
<P>
Shao said China has more than 2,000 libraries, a quarter of
which, however, buy fewer than 800 books a year. Many counties
even do not have a library.

<HEADLINE> August First Beats Beijing in League Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion the August
First kept its unbeaten record after scoring an away victory 96-76
over Beijing Shougang in the playoffs of the Chinese Basketball
League here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The August First, who topped the league standings by winning
all the 22 matches in the preliminary rounds, took a narrow 47-42
halftime lead as their players were apparently not in good form.
</P>
<P>
However, the more experienced visiting players found themselves
in the second half, stretching their lead to 20 points before
sealing the win.
</P>
<P>
Beijng Shougang set up a dead clash against the August First
after losing to Guangdong Hongyuan in the deciding match last
Wednesday, which made it stand at the fourth place in the
preliminary rounds.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Guangdong Hongyuan traveled to
Anshan, Liaoning Province to edge out Liaoning Angang 81-79.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong squad, who finished second in the preliminary
rounds, led the third placer Liaoning 23-16 soon after the start.
</P>
<P>
Led by their star Wu Naiqun, who scored a game-high 23 points,
Liaoning Angang pulled back to build up a halftime lead 41-35.
</P>
<P>
The more experienced Guangdong Hongyuan, who had several
veteran Chinese nationals in court, managed to level the score at
48-48 in the 12th minute of the second half.
</P>
<P>
But Guangdong Hongyuan gained no superiority and trailed 72-74
with five minutes remaining after a seesaw play.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning missed a chance in the last minute and had to give up
the match 81-79.
</P>
<P>
In Tieling, Liaoning Province, Gong Xiaobin's all game-high 30
points and 13 rebounds failed to lead the visiting Shandong to a
victory in a thrilling match against first stage eighth finisher
Shenyang Army.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang took the win less than two minutes before the final
whistle after the score tied at 65-65.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Urge Revision of Bankruptcy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China should revise its
bankruptcy law as quickly as possible, said a deputy to the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Cai Lulun, who is also governor of the People's Bank of
China Hunan Branch, said a revised law will help promote a sound
development of microeconomic activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The existing law is serious flawed," he said. "Irregularities
in the handling of bankruptcy cases have caused serious losses of
state assets and chaos in the country's credit system."
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy law was enacted in China in 1986. More than 160
enterprises nationwide have since entered legal proceedings for
bankruptcy, and over 90 have been ruled bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
The governor said implementation of a bankruptcy law is an
inevitable result of efforts to develop a market economy in China
and plays a key role in establishing a competition mechanism for
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 40 percent of China's state-owned enterprises
are running in the red. A bankruptcy system exerts pressure over
these enterprises, compelling them to improve management.
</P>
<P>
However, Cai pointed out, being enacted before the government
set the goal of establishing a socialist market economy, the
existing bankruptcy law lacks accuracy and comprehensiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the law's flaws and questionable designs of some
people, some enterprises have tried to evade paying debts by
declaring bankruptcy, severely harming the legitimate rights of
debtors, especially those of state-owned commercial banks."
</P>
<P>
In many bankruptcy cases, enterprises' properties are evaluated
below their true worth, disposal of assets is not conducted
openly, and mortgage loans from banks are not paid on a priority
basis, causing an extremely low rate of debt discharge by bankrupt
enterprises, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Bank loans account for over 80 percent of the total amount of
state-owned enterprises' working capital in China. If enterprises
deliberately evade debt payment by declaring bankrupt, the biggest
loser will be state-owned banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue deserves serious attention," he said.
</P>
<P>
A motion proposed by Cai and seconded by 30 deputies has been
submitted to the ongoing NPC session, in which revision of the
present bankruptcy law is urged.
</P>
<P>
The revised law should include strict provisions on application
of bankruptcy to guarantee judicial fairness, reduce costs for
bankruptcy, and protect debtors' rights with added stipulations on
punishment of criminal acts in such cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Financial and Economic Committee of the NPC has made
investigations into flaws of the bankruptcy law currently in
effect.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese military leaders Zhang
Zhen, Zhang Wannian, Chi Haotian, Wang Ke, and Wang Ruilin today
joined more than 100 generals in planting trees in the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
The officers joined local officials in planting about 230
pines, poplars, and ginkgos in the Wild Animal Forest Park, which
is to be built into the country's largest artificial wild animal
preserve, in the southern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Military leaders and soldiers have been active in green
activities for 15 years, since the National People's Congress
launched a nationwide tree-planting program in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
During the Eight Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), they planted a
total of 54,000 hectares of grass and trees.
</P>
<P>
After planting two pine trees, Vice-Chairman of China's Central
Military Commission Zheng Zhen, said that tree-planting can bring
benefits to this as well as to coming generations.

In the field of medicine, it is to expand production of
traditional medicines, improve processing of primary products,
replace preparations, and industrialize biological technology.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the province's annual medicine production is
expected to reach 50,000 tons, and the output value of new
products will account for 20 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Hebei's machinery industry will work on producing automobiles
and spare parts, and equipment for key projects.
</P>
<P>
In the electronics industry, emphasis will be on tricolor tube
parts, and liquid crystal screens, as well as other high-tech
products.
</P>
<P>
By increasing the production of steel plates, banding, and
tubing in six major steel enterprises, provincial production
capacity of iron and steel is expected to reach 12 million tons by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the province is to make efforts to develop
new building materials and push production and export of cement,
plate glass, and ceramics for buildings and sanitation use.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the five-year period, the output of cement and
plate glass will reach 35 million tons and 25 million standard
cases.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Symposium on Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called on the various local governments to step up efforts
in strengthening the work of family planning in order to reach the
goal of keeping China's population below 1.3 billion by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at a symposium on family planning held here
today by the Chinese central government. Among those attending the
symposium were Premier Li Peng, as well as Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan,
Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, and Hu Jintao.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged local governments to become familiar with the
importance of controlling population from the strategic viewpoint
of maintaining sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is imperative that local governments put
population control, the preservation of resources and protection
of the environment on the top of their agendas to create a
favorable environment for future generations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has made progress in its family planning
work and has effectively curbed the rapidly-growing population
trend, but, he warned, it is still an arduous task. There are
still problems in both rural and urban areas, in disparities
between regions, and in difficulties in putting family planning
into practice in a mobile rural population in the cities.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng urged local government representatives at the
symposium to make a clearheaded appraisal of the population
situation in their regions at present. He called on local
authorities to combine family planning with poverty alleviation
and to take steps to help those rural households which practise
family planning to lead better lives.
</P>
<P>
As for the family planning programs among the mobile rural
population in cities, the premier urged the public security,
labor, industry and commerce, and civil affairs departments to
make joint efforts in order to do a good job.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, state councillor and head of the State Family
Planning Commission, briefed the symposium on the country's
present population situation and the latest developments in family
planning.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Hainan provinces also
made speeches at the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Special Programs In Africa To Alleviate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A large number of African
countries have realized the need for carving out special programs
for the poor people of their countries, according to the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
The number of poor people in Africa constitute 16 percent of
the world's destitutes and are likely to make up 30 percent of
the total by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
In Mali, priority attention is accorded to the poorest
segments of the population. Out of a social security fund created
for this purpose, 13 million Francs CFA have been allocated to
the immediate needs of the poor. The fund is anticipated to
enable the vulnerable people to have access to basic social
services.
</P>
<P>
In Zaire, a project is being implemented with the assistance
of France, the objective of which is to provide credits for the
least fortunate members of the population.
</P>
<P>
In Burkina Faso, a project on food security and nutrition
strives to improve the fate of the low-income groups in
drought-prone areas. At the household level, the main objective
of the project is to assist the rural poor in diversifying their
sources of income and in ameliorating their nutritional in-take.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, the government has taken several initiatives to
support people most vulnerable to the negative impact of economic
reforms. Three programs have been adopted. They include a program
to prevent malnutrition, a food-for-work program and another
program for urban self-help, all of which aim at providing short
term relief.
</P>
<P>
In Malawi, measures have been embarked upon to improve the
living conditions of the poor through the development of human
capital and the expansion of employment opportunities as well as
rise in income.
</P>
<P>
In Senegal, the government has decided to design an action
program aimed at combating acute poverty. A consultative
committee consisting of ministers is expected to discuss the
types of actions required.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Sperker: International Summit Must Examine Reasons for Spread of Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian Council
Ahmed Qurei said today that the international summit of peace
makers to be held in Egypt must examine reasons for the spread of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Qurei, also known as Abu Ala, said in an interview with
cairo-based Sawt Al Arab (Voice of Arabs) Radio that the summit,
to be held in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Wednesday is
of special importance as it will deal with means of countering
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be co-hosted by Egypt and the United States, was
hurriedly arranged in the wake of four suicide bombings in Israel
within nine days, which left 61 people dead, including the bombers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official hailed Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's call for convening the conference, expected to be
attended by some 30 world leaders, including U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The entire Middle East peace process is at stake as a result of
the acts of violence perpetrated by its opponents, Qurei told the
radio.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Israeli measures taken against the
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank following the suicide
bombings by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian speaker said that the measures violate the
agreements between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Occupation returned to the West Bank," he said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members On Widening Income Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A widening income gap in China
has been a focus of discussions among members of its top advisory
body since its annual session opened on March 2.
</P>
<P>
A widening income gap is an important issue that may affect
social stability, according to many members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the view in panel discussions on Premier Li
Peng's report on China's development plans for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Member Li Hongchang, president of Jilin Provincial Federation
of Industry and Commerce, called on the central government to
strengthen macroeconomic controls by law as well as economic and
administrative means to put a stop to the trend.
</P>
<P>
He called for efforts to adjust taxes for high-income
individuals and establish social security and pension systems for
low-income workers. An effective mechanism must be established to
encourage the rich to help the poor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Member Gu Shengzhu, an economics professor Wuhan University,
conducted a survey on income gaps among individuals, which shows
that such gaps have been widening by 50 percent each year. The
economist attributed the expansion of high-income groups to unfair
wealth distribution.
</P>
<P>
"The government should crack down on economic crimes of all
sorts," he said. "Particular attention should be paid to
punishing people who abuse power for personal gains."
</P>
<P>
In the public economic sector, he said, dividing state assets
among individual workers under various guises and high payment of
wages and bonuses at the expense of the enterprise is a serious
problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
To narrow income gaps, he said, governments at all levels
should strengthen administration over state assets, set a ceiling
for workers' pay and put a stop to uncontrolled distribution of
wealth in high-efficiency state enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang University Students Donate Corneas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 teachers and
students of Shenyang University in east China's Liaoning Province
have signed agreements to donate their eyes to the General
Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command, in the event of their
death.
</P>
<P>
China presently has about 3.5 million people suffering from eye
diseases, some of whom are in urgent need of corneal transplants
to restore or save their eyesight.
</P>
<P>
However, the country can only do about 1,000 transplant
operations annually, because of serious shortages of corneas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country established its first eye bank at the
Liaoning hospital, but there are still few donors. In fact, many
people in China still don't feel comfortable in donating parts of
their bodies because of traditional beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The local TV station pointed to the hospital's difficulties in
finding donors in one of its programs this month, and, as a
result, the university launched a campaign on March 4, calling on
students to sign an agreement to donate their eyes if they should
die.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 teachers and students answered the call, and signed
up for donating their eyes to the hospital in future.
</P>
<P>
Cen Jiheng, a student in the English Department, said that 12
of his 26 classmate volunteered, and that he would tell his
children or relatives to comply with his wishes in future.

<HEADLINE> Iran Opens Airport on Disputed Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran today inaugurated an airport
on Abu Musa island which is the center of a long-standing dispute
between Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that Iranian Transportation
Minister Akbar Torkan said at the opening ceremony that the new
airport will attract investors to the island.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that with the establishment of the airport
tourism will be given a boost at Abu Musa.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that with the execution of development plans for the
Abu Musa island, it will be turned into a major commercial and
tourism center," Torkan said.
</P>
<P>
With only eight days left to the Iranian new year called
Nowruz, Torkan said that the airport could be used by Nowruz
vacationers there.
</P>
<P>
Situated in an area of 230 hectares, Abu Musa Airport has a
runway, parking area for the planes and a terminal with an under-
roof area of 2,500 square meters. The airport can handle about 700
incoming and outgoing passengers per day.
</P>
<P>
A dispute has existed since early 1970s between Iran and the
UAE over the islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tonb and Lesser Tonb,
which are strategically situated at the mouth of the Hormuz
Strait, the gate way to the oil-rich Gulf.
</P>
<P>
On November 30, 1971, one day before the British troops'
withdrawal and two days before the proclamation of founding of the
UAE, Iranian troops occupied the Greater and Lesser Tonbs and took
control of half of the Abu Musa island under an agreement it
reached with the UAE on joint administration of this island.
</P>
<P>
In September 1992, Iran declared it was the sole owner of
the island of Abu Musa.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has affirmed its historical rights over the three
islands and called upon Iran for an unconditional dialogue through
international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Iran has rejected UAE's call, saying that "there is no doubt
about Iran's sovereignty over the Abu Musa Island and the Lesser
and Greater Tonbs."

<HEADLINE> Iran Insists on Banning Satellite Dishes (2) (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But government critics here have charged that many people are
not respecting the ban.
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that satellite dishes facing the west were
placed over the rooftops. If you drove on the hills you could see
them shining under the rays of the setting sun," one critic said.
</P>
<P>
Now they are taken from the rooftops to the terraces, yards,
backyards, wherever they can get a good reception," he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that many people dismantled their satellite
equipment after the ban went into effect.
</P>
<P>
"But that is because they were afraid of the heavy fine that
would be levied against anyone who uses satellite dishes," he
added.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference today, Larijani claimed that the
results of a research done by IRIB's Research Division showed
that 83 percent of the people found satellite programming quite
offensive and wanted it banned.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iranian families were concerned about what their
children saw on television, adding that the officials were forced
to take action on the satellite dishes due to "the flood of
complaints" they received from the families.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that Rafsanjani was against the
imposition of the ban.
</P>
<P>
"Before the ban went into effect, he even suggested at a
cabinet meeting that the government should produce the satellite
dishes to sell it to the people," the source said.
</P>
<P>
"His suggestion, which met the opposition of a quite number of
ministers, was that the government should establish its monopoly
on the production and sale of the dishes before the private
sector got involved in it," added the source.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that there has been a disagreement between
Rafsanjani and Supreme leader Ali Khamenei not only on the issue
of banning the satellite television but also on who controls
IRIB.
</P>
<P>
The constitution of Iran gives Khamenei mandate over IRIB,
which has grown into a mammoth organization with over 15,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Khamenei appointed Larijani as IRIB Director to take
over the job held by Rafsanjani's brother Mohammad Hashemi.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi's critics charged that he was not neutral during the
presidential elections in 1993 which inducted Rafsanjani into his
second term of presidency. Some employees under his leadership
were attacked for liberal minds and for not strictly observing
the Islamic codes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Insists on Banning Satellite Dishes (1) (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed its
insistence on banning satellite dishes as part of efforts to
fight against Western cultural intrusion despite widespread
international opposition.
</P>
<P>
Ali Larijani, President of Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting (IRIB), said at a press conference that due to the
obscene and violent scenes shown on satellite television, the
Iranian parliament was urged to legislate the ban on the
ownership and use of the satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
"Our society is a religious society. Hence, we are against
information pollution," he said.
</P>
<P>
He brushed aside allegations that Iran put the ban on
satellite dishes in a bid to create a barrier for news and
information from around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The ban on the satellite programming is aimed at protecting
the culture. We are not against the flow of information. People
who want news are using shortwave radio," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, "the banning of satellite dishes is a
cultural question not a political question."
</P>
<P>
The ban went into effect here last April despite opposition by
some liberal officials following a vote at the Parliament. Since
then, Iranian armed policemen have confiscated 2,250 satellite
dishes.
</P>
<P>
But, the ban of the satellite dishes came under attack by many
people and even government officials. Some people are bold enough
to put on the dish again on the roof or in the bottom of swimming
pools in a bid to prevent any inspection from the police.
</P>
<P>
Faezeh Hashemi, the younger daughter of Iran's moderate
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, last week attacked the ban on
satellite dishes, saying that the ban was the result of a wrong
policy.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot limit the satellite or video movies. I believe
that the policy of limitation and banning is a wrong policy," she
noted in a local daily Akhbar.
</P>
<P>
Sa'eed Raja'ie Khorassani, a parliament representative from
Tehran, has been among the vocal opposition to the ban on the
satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
He told a group of foreign reporters that he was still against
the ban on satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
"However, I think that because it has become the law, people
should respect the ban," he added.

<HEADLINE> Bidding for Pakistan Bank Early Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Bankers Equity
Limited (BEL), a development financial institution, will be put
for bidding in early April after the completion of due diligence
process, said a senior official here today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Privatization Commission (PC) Abdullah Yusuf said
that the four parties shortlisted for the BEL were given one week
to complete their process of due diligence.
</P>
<P>
As a listed company with the Karachi Stock Exchange, BEL's
market value was visible which would enable it to get a good price
from the bidders, said the secretary.
</P>
<P>
Management control and 26 percent shares of the BEL would be
privatized in the first phase.
</P>
<P>
The BEL was formed in 1979 to act as a development bank for
private industrial project.
</P>
<P>
It had assets of 14.9 billion rupees (425 million US dollars),
deposits of 5.1 billion rupees (148 million dollars) and capital
and reserves of 1.3 billion rupees (38 million dollars) as of June
30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
BEL had an investment portfolio of 2.4 billion rupees (69.7
million dollars) as of June 30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Three national banks, including Muslim Commercial Bank, the
Allied Bank of Pakistan and the United Bank Limited, have been
privatized since Pakistan started its privatization process in
1988.

Two more banks, the largest national commercial bank of Habib

FUZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in east China now
has 350 villages with 100 million yuan worth of output annually
and 746 with 50 million yuan worth of production, thanks to the
government's efforts at the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
Fujian also has 12 poverty-stricken counties where more than
500,000 peasants are not well-fed. To help them find relief from
their poverty has becomes a major task for the rural grass-roots
units, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The province has made a special effort to speed up
poverty-relief work in rural areas by setting up a poverty-relief
responsibility system, and encouraging local officials to contact
the troubled counties and townships directly so that they can more
easily direct the work and give full support in the use of
technology, funds, and many other aspects.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, 1.6 million rural people escaped poverty and another
300,000 people have had enough food and clothing in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income for the province's rural population exceeded
2,000 yuan (about 235 US dollars) in 1995, putting the province
seventh in China, up from 20th in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Maintaining a Dream of Building More Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- He's a busy man, but he's happy,
since his shipyard now not only builds fishing vessels for
domestic use, but also for foreign customers.
</P>
<P>
He is Sun Lianguo, shipyard director of the Qiandao Fisheries,
in Zeku Township in east China's Shandong Province, and he's in
the middle of a big deal.
</P>
<P>
His shipyard was fortunate enough to have made a deal to build
10 one-thousand-ton ocean-going fishing vessels, which the Chinese
Government has decided to present to Ghana. His factory is set to
sign the contract for the 20-million-US-dollar project in Beijing
very soon.
</P>
<P>
In describing the project, Sun, who has been repairing and
building fishing vessels for 20 years, said happily that, "It's
not the first time for us to build fishing boats for foreign
countries." His shipyard built a pair of 400-horse-power trawlers
for Korea three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The shipyard was just a small rural workshop in the past,
employing a grand total of four fishermen and operated on fixed
capital of no more than several tens of thousands of yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Sun was made director of the shipyard, and he was
determined to turn his factory into the biggest in the eastern
part of Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Now, his dream has come true: they went from building the first
pair of 270-h.p. fishing vessels in 1991 to building more than 500
ships in the past five years. Fixed assets of the shipyard rose to
40 million yuan (some 6.8 million US dollars) from those several
tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the shipyard, with less than 200 workers, built 38
pairs of powerful fishing vessels and had a total output value of
120 million yuan (some 14.4 million US dollars), as well as over
12 million yuan (about 1.4 million US dollars) in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Sun gets even more optimistic when he talks about the
future. The shipyard is going to build more than 100 powerful
vessels this year both for domestic and overseas clients.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi President Meets Opposition Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas today held discussions with opposition leaders on dialogue
to resolve the country's prolonged political impasse, but no
breakthrough was made.
</P>
<P>
According to a reliable source, the president first held talks
with Sheikh Hasina, chief of the largest opposition party -- the
Awami (People's) League, and the two sides made no breakthrough
during their over one-hour-long discussion in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Hasina reiterated that the opposition wants a resolution of the
political crisis through dialogues with the ruling Bangladeshi
Nationalist Party (BNP), but "we can not make compromise to our
basic demand", that is, cancellation of BNP-held "farcical"
February 15 elections, resignation of the present "illegal"
government and holding of fresh sixth parliamentary elections
under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the president held discussions separately with
leaders of other major opposition parties including the Jatiay
(National) Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
Friday night, BNP Chairperson and Prime Minister Begum Khaleda
Zia promised to meet the opposition's demand and requested the
president to take initiative for dialogue among all political
parties to resolve the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since the prime minister's fresh move was welcomed by the major
opposition parties, the president arranged today's discussions
with the opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
No details were available about the talks, but it was learned
that a news briefing will be held tonight.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Meeting on "Taiwan Independence" Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a meeting
here today to discuss a Chinese book on the "independence of
Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siyuan, vice-chairman of China's National People's
Congress Standing Committee, contributed the title of the new book
which was published by Tuanjie Publishing House and compiled by
Peng Qingyuan, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The book is the second to expose the "Taiwan independence"
plot. The first was edited by Jia Yibin, honorary vice-chairman of
the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The new book discusses Lee Teng-hui's activities in dividing
the motherland by using a strategy of false reunification and true
independence, and refutes his advocation of "two Chinas by
stages", or a "life community", or "sovereignty belonging to the
people", as well as other fallacies.
</P>
<P>
It analyzes Lee's reasons for his actions, which have seriously
harmed relations across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan's future,
and affirms the feasibility and significance of peaceful
reunification and the "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
The book calls on the people across the Taiwan Straits to be
united in holding the banner of patriotism higher and resolutely
opposing the scheme of "Taiwan independence", and contribute more
to the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Cheng and some other participants delivered speeches at the
meeting, describing the book as significant in safeguarding the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Zhu Peikang, secretary-general
of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the
Chinese Kuomintang.

<HEADLINE> Heath Reiterates Desire for European Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Former British Prime Minister
Edward Heath said today that he still wanted the UK "to be at the
forefront of making the European Union work better and more
closely together."
</P>
<P>
In an article written exclusively for the newspaper News of the
World, Heath, who took Britain to the European Union (EU) in 1973,
said that in the 15-state club, Britain can still enjoy far
greater influence over its direction than most people in his
Conservative party believe possible.
</P>
<P>
He criticised the Eurosceptics in the Tory party, saying that
the alternative to full membership of the EU is a simple
one: impotence and isolation.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister argued that the British Empire has
gone and Britain now is certainly not a world power.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and China regard Britain first and
foremost as part of the EU and it is on that basis they wish to
deal with Britain, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We might want, and need, special relationships with them, but
they do not want them with us," he said.
</P>
<P>
After analysing the difference within the Tory party on the
EU's Common Fisheries Policy, Heath maintained that the
Conservative government should go back to Europe, make its case
calmly, reasonably and positively and negotiate a new policy.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that time and again, "our whole attitude to
Europe is one of being negative from the start."
</P>
<P>
He said the Conservative party should not tolerate the cheating
"which has been alleged, albeit largely by the Eurosceptics."

<HEADLINE> Defunct International Bank in UAE to Give First Payout in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Depositors and creditors of
the defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will receive their first payment
this summer.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the UAE central Bank published here today by
"Gulf News" said the Abu Dhabi Court of first instance has passed
a judgement terminating the Court Receivership for BCCI SA
Luxembourg effective March 4 and transferring all matters within
its control to the recently-appointed liquidators.
</P>
<P>
The central bank urged all depositors and other BCCI Creditors
to deliver their filled forms by April 5, 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped the UAE liquidators will accomplish verification
of Proof of Debt forms in an expeditious manner in order for them
to submit the verified forms to the global liquidators in
Luxembourg for payment of the first dividend at the beginning of
Summer, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not say the concrete percentage of the
depositors will receive. But earlier reports said more than
30,000 creditors in the UAE will receive compensation representing
 up to 40 percent of their deposits.
</P>
<P>
Before the closure of the BCCI on July 5, 1991, the bank was
one of the largest Arab-owned financial institutions with assets
of over 20 billion U.S. dollars, according to the Bank's 1990
balance sheets. Deposits with BCCI's eight branches in the UAE
were estimated at some 1.22 billion dollars before it was shut
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
On January 31, 1995, a Luxembourg court approved a
1.8-billion-dollar compensation offer by majority shareholders for
the nearly 250,000 creditors worldwide, clearing the way for
payouts after more than two years.
</P>
<P>
The majority shareholders in Abu Dhabi held 77.4 percent of
BCCI's shares.
</P>
<P>
The bank was shut down after auditors reported massive fraud
and loan losses in a scandal which seriously undermined the
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 creditors who were dealing with the 400 branches
of the BCCI in around 70 countries had lost their funds when the
bank was shut.

ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Privatization
Commission (PC) has initiated the process of privatizing Habib

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Rising Swiss Karin Roten scored
her first World Cup win with perfect timing in the season's final
event, a slalom in Lillehammer, Norway on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Roten, 20, who had burst into the limelight by taking second
place behind Italian Deborah Compagnoni in the giant slalom at
last month's world championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain, clocked
a winning two-leg time of one minute 51.85 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden, who won world championship gold in
both the slalom and the combined event, ended the season with a
second place in 1:52.08.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegians continued to shine on home snow with Marianne
Kjoerstad using a storming second run to move up nine places to
third with a total time of 1:52.80.
</P>
<P>
There was disappointment for Swiss Marlies Oester who set the
fastest time in the first leg but fell on the upper part of the
course in the second.
</P>
<P>
She got up and managed to reach the finish line but lost
considerable time and ended last.
</P>
<P>
Wiberg, who missed Saturday's giant slalom to rest a knee
injury, said she had not felt any pain.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Elfi Eder, who had already sealed victory in the
slalom World Cup with three wins and two second places, straddled
a gate and fell on her back in the first leg.
</P>
<P>
Newly-crowned overall World Cup queen Katja Seizinger of
Germany also skied out in the first leg after just a few gates.
</P>
<P>
Martina Ertl came fifth to overtake Austrian Anita Wachter in
the overall World Cup standings and end up second behind
Seizinger.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Join in Voluntary Tree Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) took part in tree planting in
Beijing today when the NPC session adjourned.
</P>
<P>
Also taking part in the voluntary tree planing activity were
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun and other leaders.
</P>
<P>
They planted over 200 cypresses in the Beijing Tiantan Park.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 15th anniversary of the voluntary tree
planting campaign, which was launched by the retired Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping and decided by the NPC.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Afforestation Commission headed by
Jiang Chunyun, the voluntary tree planting drive has made
remarkable contributions to greening the country.
</P>
<P>
China's forest coverage rate has risen to 13.9 percent
from 12.7 percent in the 1980s, and almost all the barren
hills and mountains in 12 provinces have been turned green.
</P>
<P>
The urban greenery coverage rate has increased to 22.1 percent
from 19.2 percent in the same period, a commission official said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have joined the public in planting trees every
year around the March 12 "National Voluntary Tree Planting Day."
</P>
<P>
Today's activity is meant to further enhance public awareness
of the voluntary tree planing campaign, according to an organizer.
</P>
<P>
The long-term draft plan for national economic and social
development under review by the current NPC session proposes
protecting existing forests and trees, and afforesting more areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition to building tree belts across northeast, north and
northwest China, along the middle and up reaches of the Yangtze
River, and along the coasts, China will build more tree belts
elsewhere to protect the environment, the draft plan says.

LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's Steve Collins knocked
out Neville Brown of Britain to retain his World Boxing
Organization (WBO) super-middleweight champion at the Green Glens
Arena, Millstreet, County Cork, Ireland, on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Collins was announced to win the bout by the referee in the

The end came in the 11th round when Collins unleashed a right

<HEADLINE> Leading Gold Producers Draft Output Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The leading gold producers in
China have vowed to increase gold production and tap new gold
resources in the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-
2000).
</P>
<P>
Hebei, the third-largest gold base in China, plans to raise its
annual output to 18,610 kg by the year 2000, 31 percent more than
the figure for 1995, the journal "China Gold" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The proven reserves of gold in Hebei are expected to be
increased from 132 tons to 190 in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has urged its gold mines to turn out
15,000 kg of gold this year as a good beginning for the target of
the Ninth Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Shaanxi Province, one of the 10 major gold
producers in the country, is expected to produce 82,500 kg of gold
in the coming five years, with the annual gold output reaching
19,200 kg by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Lingbao City in central China's Henan Province has designated
1996 as a "year for geological prospecting" and raised 19 million

<HEADLINE> Better Life for Beijing's Low-income Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Low-income families and workers
from enterprises which have closed or slowed production are living
better lives thanks to a series of measures taken by the municipal
government.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the city's finance and labor
bureaus earmarked 80 million yuan (9.67 million US dollars) for
helping 127,000 workers from 282 companies, and helped 59,000
unemployed workers find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government place great importance on
improving the standard of living of low-income residents and
workers who have difficulties in making ends meet, local officials
said.
</P>
<P>
A series of regulations based on on-the-spot studies of
low-income families' living conditions were made.
</P>
<P>
Many of these people, who have difficulties finding work, do
not qualify for social welfare benefits. Under the new
regulations, these people are included in the welfare program. By
the end of 1995, 3,070 seriously disabled people received a total
of 890,000 yuan (over 17,000 US dollars) in relief funds.
</P>
<P>
New regulations also include those that compensate low-income
people for price increases in some consumer goods, increase their
retirement pensions and relief funds, and establish a minimum wage
to guarantee a basic life for workers.
</P>
<P>
Some departments have jointly set up a relief fund to help
other families whenever they have difficulties, and the municipal
finance bureau has decided to allocate two million yuan (about
240,000 US dollars) each year for disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
Civil service departments earmarked 1.48 million yuan for
helping poor rural families, 2,485 of whom were able to escape
poverty last year. They helped 644 poor families build new houses
and 73,000 disaster victims in suburban areas and 50,000 people
living around Miyun Reservoir to solve their problems.

</P>
<P>
Forty-two men and four women, aged between 17 and 35, were

<HEADLINE> More Jobs for Guangzhou's Redundant Female Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou's unemployed women
workers are now finding it easier to get a job thanks to a program
launched by the city's trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The program is intended to help women who have been laid off
find a new job by arranging 1,300 different training programs.
</P>
<P>
More than 170,000 female workers have attended the training
courses, and some 160,000 of them have mastered at least two
skills.
</P>
<P>
A study has shown that, in 1995, the city dismissed some 15,000
female employees from their jobs, and more than 60 percent of them
say that a lack of professional skills was the greatest obstacles
to finding another job.
</P>
<P>
To help women workers improve their personal characteristics
and to provide more skills, Guangzhou's trade unions opened
training classes on computers, accounting, cooking, electrical
engineering, sewing, driving, and other skills.
</P>
<P>
This year, at least half of Guangzhou's total number of women
workers are expected to master at least two skills, while trade
unions are cooperating with labor departments, employment
agencies, and work units to find positions for unemployed women
workers.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows To Step Up Fight Against Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has vowed to step up the campaign against tax
evasion to enhance social and economic development in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He made this commitment when addressing the Dar es Salaam
Elders Council at the State House here on Saturday, stressing,
"I will not sympathize with tax evaders at all."
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said he had spent most of his time to map out
economic revival strategies aimed at creating a conducive climate
for donor support and foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The president added that he was pre-occupied with finding ways
to plug gaps in revenue collection, one of the weaknesses which
scared off donors.
</P>
<P>
He further said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was so
far satisfied to the extent of calling upon donor countries to
resume disbursement of funds to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa observed that control of transit goods which
caused loss of millions of Shillings through selling the
commodities in the country was another area needing to be
curbed.
</P>
<P>
He said tight measures had been imposed towards
budgetary control to restore financial discipline. "This is what
I have been doing during my hundred days in office".
</P>
<P>
The president added the 1996/97 budget, which was currently
being prepared, would ensure that the government operated within
it, which was another condition set by the donor community.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, march 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government stands
to lose at least 10 billion pesos (400 million US dollars) a year
in revenue leakage, if additional incentives are granted to the
export sector under the Export Development Act (EDA).
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance (DOF) said over the weekend that it
expects the 10 billion pesos (400 million US dollars) revenue loss
on top of losses resulting from other existing incentives.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 28.7 billion pesos (1.148 billion US dollars)
in revenues was lost by the government due to incentives provided
to exporters.
</P>
<P>
The DOF is currently sorting out some issues before it
implements certain provisions of the EDA, which include some
legalities and safeguards.
</P>
<P>
Under the EDA, which is to be implemented in 1997, specific tax
credits will be granted on the basis of export performance.
</P>
<P>
On the safeguards, the DOF said the proposed implementing rules
and regulations as drafted do not protect taxpayers from
fraudulent claims of unscrupulous exporters.
</P>
<P>
The DOF, therefore, stressed the need to set up an effective
mechanism to validate transactions between exporters and importers
and an information system to determine relations between them.

<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Transfield Defense
Systems PTY LTD. will build two vessels for the Philippine navy,
which is modernizing its fleet of World War II-vintage ships.
</P>
<P>
Naval officials said at the weekend the Australian government
has agreed to provide a grant to finance 35 percent of the cost of
the search-and-rescue vessels, and a low-interest loan to cover
the balance.
</P>
<P>
They said the vessels would be used to patrol maritime
boundaries, where marauding pirates reportedly prowl.
</P>
<P>
Transfield has proposed to provide more vessels to the
Philippine navy and to share technology crucial in developing
local capability to assemble ships and manufacture naval
components.
</P>
<P>
The firm will soon choose a local partner for its planned
venture and establish a representative office in Manila to handle
its interests in the engineering, infrastructure, marine and naval
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Transfield, which has built frigates, patrol boats and other
naval vessels for Australia, New Zealand and other pacific
nations over the past decade, has 7,000 employees and an average
yearly turnover of 1.2 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama No Longer A Religious Leader: Tibetan Deputy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- More and more Tibetan Buddhism
believers have become aware that the Dalai Lama is no longer a
religious leader but a root cause for social turmoils in Tibet, a
Tibetan deputy to the National People's Congress in session said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Losang, an official of a neighborhood committee of Chengguan
District in downtown Lhasa, said "the Dalai Lama has long been
engaged in instigating secessionists to make troubles in Lhasa but
none of the 2,100-strong dwellers in our neighborhood were
involved."
</P>
<P>
Under the rule of the Dalai Lama in Old Tibet, the community
where Losang now lives and works was a residential area for serfs
to toil in the Potola Palace, according to Losang.
</P>
<P>
With his own father, a serf, tortured to death by lamas because
he was too poor to return usurious grain, Losang became a street
boy in childhood.
</P>
<P>
"We lived like beasts of burden, he recalled. "But we have
become masters of our own destiny and would never allow our old
days to return."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, he would not forget the day of March 10
of 1959, the day the Dalai clique staged an armed rebellion in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Like Losang, and many other Tibetan deputies to and members of
the current NPC session and the session of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference National Committee have pledged
their support for national unity and opposition to the
secessionist activities of the Dalai clique.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet

<HEADLINE> "Team Spirit" Drills Replaced by Other Exercises,  Pyongyang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang said today that the
United States and South Korea have not really suspended their
"Team Spirit" joint military exercise this year, but have replaced
the annual joint training with other joint or individual drills.
</P>
<P>
The official paper Rodong Sinmun charged in an article today
that Washington and Seoul have staged a series of war games on the
Korean peninsula and in its surrounding waters, rendering the
announced suspension of "Team Spirit" training utterly
"meaningless."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. and South Korea announced that they would
cancel the annual "Team Spirit" joint military manoeuvres this
year.
</P>
<P>
The joint exercise has been held every year since 1976, except
for 1992 after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
signed the nuclear safeguards accord with the International Atomic
Energy Agency, and 1994 when the DPRK was discussing the framework
agreement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
But facts show that the United States is not interested in the
implementation of the framework agreement, signed in October 1994,
the official newspaper said, adding Washington still pursues a
Cold War policy against Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
On March 5, the same newspaper strongly condemned the United
States and South Korea for starting a joint military exercise in
Texas on March 2, saying that such a drill was not conducive to
peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula.

<HEADLINE> India's Major Parties Kick off Election Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Congress Party
and the major opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have
virtually kicked off their campaigns for the coming general
elections before the exact schedule is announced, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Congress Party President and Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
Saturday kicked off his party's poll campaign by using an indirect
route -- a carefully planned one-day visit to his home
constituency of Nandyal in Andhra Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
When inaugurating a railway project in Nandyal, Rao unfolded
his party's strategy for the coming elections in his slogan: "Give
me stability and I will give you prosperity."
</P>
<P>
"Stability is the essence of development," he said, saying
history is witness to the fact that lack of stability leads to
economic downfall.
</P>
<P>
On another occasion in his stay in Nandyal, Rao announced he
would seek re-election to the Lok Sabha (House of the People) from
his home constituency.
</P>
<P>
The BJP kicked off its campaign for the general polls with a
massive rally in Kochi, Kerala state, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The party projected its parliamentary party leader Atal Behari
Vajpayee as its prime ministerial candidate and pledged to provide
a corruption-free government with accountability and probity in
public life.
</P>
<P>
Along with the launching of its 10,000-kilometer 35-day Yatra
(election trip) that would pass through 16 states, the BJP called
for the prosecution of Prime Minister Rao for his alleged
involvement in various scandals.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Convenes Meeting of District Party Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao is holding a meeting here today of leaders of the
ruling Congress Party at the district level to discuss the party's
strategy for the general elections, the Patriot newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, the first of its kind in the history of
the Congress Party, comes just a few days before the Election
Commission is expected to announce the schedule for the general
elections and assembly (state parliament) polls in six states.
</P>
<P>
The exercise is important for the party to chalk out the poll
strategy as presidents of the District Congress Committees would
be detailing the ground level situation directly to the party
leadership, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It will thereby give the party leadership the much needed
feedback about the local issues and problems and the impact of
developments like the hawala bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
By convening the meeting, Rao brushed aside for the second time
the demand by some senior party leaders for convening the Congress
Working Committee, the supreme decision-making body of the party,
in the wake of the hawala case.
</P>
<P>
The hawala case is an 18-million-US-dollar bribery scandal
implicating at least 20 leading politicians in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Prime Minister Rao held a meeting of the Congress
Party leaders at the Pradesh (state) level to discuss poll
preparations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting passed a resolution hailing Rao's action in the
hawala case as the first step towards cleansing politics and
calling for full support for him.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Withdraws Ceasefire Offer for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The military wing of the Hamas
organization, Izzadin Kassam, has withdrawn its offer of a
three-month halt to anti-Israeli violence and vowed to take more
bombing attacks, according to Israeli reports today.
</P>
<P>
Izzadin Kassam today issued a statement saying that it decided
to withdraw the ceasefire offer because of joint Israeli and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) crackdown on the
organization, including numerous arrests of its activists by the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made after four Hamas suicide bombing attacks
in the past two weeks, which left 58 people dead. A Romanian
construction worker, who was injuried in the Jerusalem suicide
bus bombing on March 3, died Saturday night, putting the death
toll of the attack to 59.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security forces and police have been on high
alert in the event of possible more Hamas attacks.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat Saturday night met with a
delegation of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) headed by
Deputy CIA Director George Tenet in Gaza in what was
viewed as an unprecedented push for collaboration against
Hamas activists.
</P>
<P>
The hour-long, secretive meeting was held at Arafat's
vacation home in Beit Hanoun near the Erez Checkpoint,
according to Palestinian sources.
</P>
<P>
However, officials close to Arafat refused to confirm or
deny the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The CIA told Arafat that he had to arrest five key Izzadin
Kassam figures believed to be behind the recent wave of suicide
bombing attacks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat presented the group with a list of security requests
such as equipment, specially trained dogs, funds and expertise
to discover explosives, as well as training of Palestinian police
for counter-terrorism operations.

PHNOM PENH, March 10 (Xinhua) -- King Norodom Sihanouk of
Cambodia, who has been diagnosed to have a brain tumor and
thrombosis, hinted that he might quit the throne because of his
ill health, the national television reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent from Beijing dated March 8, the monarch said
that once he cannot work for Cambodia any more, National Assembly
President Chea Sim shall be named as the regent, and that after
his demise, his successor should be chosen by the Throne Council
in accordance with the constitution.

Under the Cambodian constitution, president of the National
Assembly assumes the duty of acting head of state in the absence
of the king, and the Throne Council is composed of top executive,
legislative and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk's letter, which was addressed to his son First Prime
Minister Norodom Ranariddh, was televised today.
</P>
<P>
The king, who has been in Beijing for some time for medical
checkups, said he will return to Cambodia on March 11 as
scheduled, but his health problems will one day fail him in
"serving our beloved country and people."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Boycott Anti-Terrorism Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has decided to boycott an
international anti-terrorism summit, which is to be held in the
Egyptian Red Sea town of Sharm el Sheikh next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed official source said here this morning that the
Foreign Ministry is expected to inform the U.S. government of its
the decision in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
The summit, called for by the United States, is reported to aim
at working out an extensive strategy against the terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Lebanon is not enthusiastic with the
participation in a fear of an obscurity between the terrorism
and occupation.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call between Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and
Syrian President Hafez Assad last Friday, the two sides took a
united stand towards the summit conference, the anonymous source
said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul predicted that the
forthcoming anti-terrorism summit is doomed to failure since it
is aimed at "satisfying Israel."
</P>
<P>
Describing the summit as an "astonishing strange" conference,
the defense minister asked rhetorically why those carrying weapons
for liberating their own land are labeled "terrorists" and those
occupying the land are described as fighting against
terrorism.

DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Three people were shot dead and at
least 80 others injured in Chittagong, the largest port city in
Bangladesh, in violent clashes Saturday, the first day of the
opposition-called indefinite "non-cooperation" campaign.

Sporadic explosions ripped through the city's commercial areas,
where opposition activists held rallies and processions, the

<HEADLINE> HK To Be Biggest International Financial Market in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is expected to become
the largest international financial market and the most important
foreign trade "window" in China after its return to the country in
July 1997, said a HK deputy to the on-going the National People's
Congress (NPC) session.
</P>
<P>
Huang Diyan, an advisor of the Bank of China's management
bureau for Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, told Xinhua that "No other
cities, including Shanghai, can replace it."
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Shanghai and Hong Kong will be
complementary instead of one replacing the other, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will mostly flex its muscle in the Yangtze River
Valley and and stands facing the Far East, he noted, while Hong
Kong will be more geared to the Asia-Pacific region, especially in
Southeast Asia, and with southern, southeastern and southwestern
China regions at its back.
</P>
<P>
The growth prospects for Hong Kong is "beyond any doubt"
because of its central geographical location in the Asia-Pacific
region, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
As on the important impact of the return of Hong Kong on China,
Huang added, HK will boost its complementary relationship with
Shanghai. He also noted that China's refrom and opening drive has
made Hong Kong an important "bridge and channel" through which the
Chinese mainland raises funds and expands foreign trade and
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Huang cited Hong Kong as the largest trade partner of the
Chinese mainland and said that two thirds of the amount of
overseas funds reaches China via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as more Chinese enterprises get listed in Hong Kong,
he said, the HK stock market has become the most important
overseas market from where China raises funds.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the financial market on the mainland, Huang said
"it is yet to be developed on the whole."

<P>
HARARE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said that the government would soon come up with
legislation to give the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe powers to
control interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He revealed the government intention yesterday while accusing
banks of profiteering through outrageous interests on loans.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a campaign rally in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city, Mugabe said a lot of emergent businesses had
collapsed because of high interest rates. He said he did not
understand why interest rates had remained so high.
</P>
<P>
He accused banks and other financial institutions of being
usurers bent on profiteering by taking advantage of demand for
cash in the country.
</P>
<P>
''A lot of our people are eager to start business ventures but
high interest rates are crippling their initiative. there are
very few countries in the world which are charging interest of
around 40 percent like some of our banks. I call this
profiteering. It looks like these people have made a fortune for
years, we need legislation to control this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the government was currently trying to establish a fund
which would bear low interests to help people to start business
ventures. enditem

<HEADLINE> Authorities Take Pains to Disengage Farmers, Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Can farmers and elephants live in
peace with each other? It is a headache for the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Elephants and farmers are locked in a battle for land in south
and east Sri Lanka and neither side seems to be gaining.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Wild Life Department (WID) said today that 13
elephants were killed by villagers in the past two months while
eight farmers were trampled to death and many others injured by
elephants.
</P>
<P>
As some villages in Ampara district, eastern Sri Lanka, have
encroached on jungle land where wild elephants used to roam, the
elephants often go on a rampage attacking people and destroying
crops and sometimes houses.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have regularly retaliated by shooting the elephants and
electricuting them, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The WID said the elephant population in Sri Lanka is estimated
at between 2,500 and 3,000, while 60 to 70 of them are killed
every year by hunters who go for their tusks and by farmers
protecting their crops.
</P>
<P>
The government has made efforts, including installing
patrolling systems to scare away elephants, to curb the elephant's
threat to people's life as well as prevent the extinction of the
wild elephants, said the WID.

<P>
HAVANA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuba signed a sports co-operation
agreement with Brazil here on Saturday to promote the sports
exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the two countries will not only
exchange expertise in the events that both have an advantage, such
as volleyball, athletics, waterpolo and handball, but also render
help to each other's weaker events.
</P>
<P>
Reynaldo Gonzalez, chairman of the Cuban Sports Commission,
said he hoped Brazil would offer help in soccer and swimming.
</P>
<P>
Cuba boasts numerous coaching talents in baseball, boxing,
weightlifting and wrestling, which could boost Brazilian
competitiveness in these events, Gonzalez added.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 50 sports experts were working in the South
American country.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, Japan, Iraq Aim for Olympic Berths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The soccer squads of
South Korea, Japan and Iraq have arrived here for the Asian Zone
Olympic qualifiers, and all were confident of winning their berths
for the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, composed of 23 footballers aged between 18 to 23,
aimed to win all the qualifiers for its outing although its coach
acknowledged that each of the eight Asian teams in the
second-round qualifiers has the potential of entering the finals
in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
South Korean captain Park Choong Kyoon claimed his team would
qualify for the Atlanta Games without losing a single match.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Park conceded that both China and Saudi Arabia, also in
Group B along with Kazakhstan, are strong in counterattacks with
excellent defence, and his Korean team has to establish its
upperhands in the defence in order to defeat the two opponents.
</P>
<P>
Coach Anetoli Bychovats of South Korea seemed more conservative
in projection, saying that the eight squads are the strongest in
Asia, with comparable potential and no definite winning edge over
another.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, who arrived here Saturday night, said they were
confident of grabbing one of the three berths in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Their coach said his team, whose players were the top cream of
J-League, had prepared for two years and could beat any opponent
in the tournament to kick off next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi coach also expressed similar confidence, despite the
fact that his team had only prepared for two months.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Iraq, United Arab Emirates and Aman share Group A, whose
top two teams will advance to the semi-finals along with those two
from Group B.
</P>
<P>
The finals will be staged on March 27.

KAMPALA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Minister for Public
Service Shiekh Abdul Karim Harelimana said here yesterday the
Rwandan civil service was facing serious manpower shortages.
</P>
<P>
The minister is in Uganda for discussions with the ministry of
public service.
</P>
<P>
Shiekh Harelimana disclosed that most posts in the civil
service in his country requiring professionals were vacant
because a large number of civil servants were killed during the
1994 genocide while others ran to exile.
</P>
<P>
He said only the unskilled staff had returned from exile in
significant numbers.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan civil service, he explained, had about 40,000
employees but the government lacked resources to pay and train
them, therefore their productivity was low.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country had manpower shortages in
engineering, computer science and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Harelimana also disclosed that Rwanda would soon send a
seven-man team to Uganda to study the public service system.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Concessions Needed to End Bangladesh's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A positive sign dawned in the
two-year-old political impasse in Bangladesh as the opposition has
agreed to sit in dialogue under the initiative of President Abdur
Rahman Biswas in efforts to resolve the country's prolonged
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here said an end to the government-opposition
conflict may depend to a large extent on how many concessions they
will make over the key issue of the sixth parliamentary elections
held on February 15.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) scored an
overwhelming victory in the elections, which were boycotted
mainstream opposition parties led by the Awami (People's) League
(AL), the largest opposition party in the country. The opposition
calls the elections "farcical" and demands their cancellation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued last night, AL President Sheikh Hasina
said she agreed to sit in dialogue and asked President Biswas to
fix a date for the discussion.
</P>
<P>
"A formal letter was sent to Hasina Saturday night inviting her
to sit in discussion with the president at 11:00 Sunday morning,"
a spokesman for the president's office said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, also chairperson of the BNP,
Friday asked the president to invite all the political parties in
the country to a dialogue on the formation of a non-party
caretaker government to supervise fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
One week ago, Khaleda offered an olive branch to the
recalcitrant opposition by agreeing to the establishment of a
non-party government for all future general elections and
promising early polls to elect the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition parties rejected Khaleda's proposals, which
they said "neither mentioned any specific schedule of the next
general elections nor when the prime minister would resign."
</P>
<P>
The opposition called the proposals "an attempt to legalize the
February 15 farcical elections."
</P>
<P>
They launched a "non-cooperation" campaign against the results
of the polls and called on President Biswas to take the initiative
to form a neutral caretaker government for the next elections
since "the BNP government has become illegal."
</P>
<P>
In a swift reaction to Khaleda's fresh move Friday night, the
opposition parties described it as "good sense" and a "good
gesture" of the government in its efforts to resolve the political
impasse.
</P>
<P>
But they also voiced concern that Khaleda's move might be aimed
at frustrating the opposition's campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The facts remain that we are not budging an inch from our
basic demands -- resignation of the prime minister and scrapping
of the February 15 farcical polls," an opposition leader said.
</P>
<P>
BNP leaders, arguing that the February 15 elections were a
constitutional necessity, said, "if the sixth parliament is
canceled, where shall we amend the constitution (for forming a
caretaker government to supervise future general elections)?"
</P>
<P>
The new round of the opposition's indefinite non-cooperation
campaign started Saturday, when at least three people were killed
and about one hundred others injured in clashes between government
opponents and police and BNP supporters in Chittagong, the largest
port city in the country, and in the capital city of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
There are obvious obstacles to the final resolution of the
political impasse in Bangladesh despite the positive attitudes now
adopted by both the government and opposition.
</P>
<P>
The legality of the February 15 polls is a key issue, on which
the two sides must make further concessions, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Concludes Peace Mission To Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzainia's retired president,
Julius Nyerere, concluded his peace mission to Burundi and left
the central African nation on Saturday, according to a news
dispatch from Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
The African elder statesman, known as "Mwalimu" (meaning
teacher in local language Kiswahili) arrived in the Burundian
capital on march 7 in an effort to mediate and settle the crisis
between the two ethnic communities -- the Hutus and Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Burundi, Nyerere met Burundian President
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, and former Tutsi presidents
Pierre Buyoya and Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, Prime Minister Antoine
Nduwayo, a Tutsi. He also met leaders of the Hutu-dominated
FRODEBU party and the Tutsi-dominated UPRONA party as well as
UN special envoy to Burundi Marc Faguy.
</P>
<P>
"Nyerere left after two days of high-level talks aimed at
increasing dialogue between the two opposing sides in the
strife-torn country," a Western diplomat was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere's staff was quoted as saying that Nyerere's low
profile trip would lay the ground for more talks at a so-called
"Great Lakes" regional summit on March 16-18 in Tunis.

and Hutu armed militiamen have brought the central African nation
to the brink of a nationwide civil war. At the end of February, a
international meeting on refugees was convened in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, to seek a solution to the Burundi crisis and its impact
on neighboring countries. The meeting mandated Nyerere, who is
able to talks to the both sides in Burundi, to use his prestige
of "Mwalimu" in the continent to find a solution to the crisis in
the central African nation.

(12) Slavery System
</P>
<P>
The United States has an ignominious history in its treatment
of blacks, who were subject to the system of slavery for 89 years,
from independence in 1776 to the passage of the 13th amendment to
the Constitution in 1865 which abolished slavery.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the slavery did not die out completely. The
Mississippi State legislature did not pass a law abolishing
slavery until as late as February of 1995.
</P>
<P>
With the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
slavery on the mainland was ended, except in the case of Tibet. In
1959, out of respect for the Tibetan people's wishes, the Chinese
government undertook democratic reforms there, abolishing the
feudal serf system. With that action, all remnant forms of slavery
were wiped out across the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
(13) Gap between the Rich and Poor
</P>
<P>
The United States has the worst record of polarization among
industrialized countries. According to official figures for 1995,
the top one percent of the population own 40 percent of the
country's wealth, an amount that exceeds the wealth of all those
belonging to lower classes who account for 60 percent of the
country's total population.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Business Week in 1994, the top 20
percent of the population receive 44.6 percent of the country's
total income. But, the bottom 20 percent earn 4.4 percent of the
country's total income. The income earned by the former is more
than ten times that of the latter.
</P>
<P>
In China, a 1994 survey conducted by the State Statistics
Bureau of the top 20 percent of households and the bottom 20
percent of households showed the following: incomes of the top 20
percent were three times the incomes of the lowest 20 percent in
cities and towns; the former were six times the latter in the
countryside; and the weighted gap between the rich and poor when
both urban and rural areas were taken into consideration, was 5.6
times. This demonstrates that the distribution of wealth has a far
narrower gap than in the United States.

24. Attitude towards international documents on human rights.
</P>
<P>
Up to now the US has not entered the International Convention
on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the
Child or other important international conventions on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
China, however, since the restoration of its legitimate seat in
the UN in 1971, has been adopting an active attitude towards the
international conventions on human rights passed by the UN. It has
so far entered 15 such conventions, including the above-mentioned
ones, and conscientiously performed its duties prescribed in the
conventions.
</P>
<P>
China has always been a co-sponsor of the motion on the
resolution on development rights in the UN Human Rights Committee,
actively taking part in formulating and supporting the UN to adopt
the Declaration on the Rights of Development. However, the US has
opposed the designation of development rights as a category of
human rights. It is the only country among the Western countries
that has voted against the Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Full enjoyment of human rights requires all countries in the
world to devote painstaking efforts before they can reach this
noble objective. Virtually no country in the world can style
itself as being perfect in terms of human rights conditions. Due
to limitations in historical and economic development, China has a
long way to go before it realizes the goal of fully enjoying human
rights. However, it is a basic fact that China has been doing much
better than the US in terms of equally enjoying and universally
guaranteeing basic human rights and freedom. The US, on the other
hand, should make greater efforts to improve its domestic human
rights conditions. The US is not qualified at all to feed its own
arrogance and make indiscreet remarks or criticisms against China
on this matter.

23. The encroachment on human rights of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States has launched some 70 wars and invasions
against other countries in the over 200 years since its founding,
causing countless casualties among foreign civilians. Moreover, US
troops used bacteriological weapons and defoliants against
civilians in the Korean War and the Vietnamese War. The US is the
only country in the world to disregard international law to the
extent of sneaking an attack on the presidential palace of another
country, kidnapping the president and meting out punishment
according to its own law. Over a long period of time the US has
built many military bases around the world and stationed several
hundred thousand soldiers there. American soldiers have committed
many crimes against the human rights of the people who live
there. A case in point is that in 1995, three American soldiers
raped a 12-year old girl student in Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which possesses the world's largest nuclear
arsenal, has conducted the most nuclear tests in the world and is
the only country that has ever used nuclear weapons. Moreover, the
US has never undertaken not to use nuclear weapons first.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the number of nuclear tests carried out by China
accounts for only about 4.1 percent of that of the US, and the
amount of nuclear weapons China possesses accounts for only 1.2 to
1.8 percent of the figure of the United States. China has
unilaterally promised on the first day of acquiring nuclear
weapons that it will never be the first to use them and that it
will not use or even threaten to use them against nuclear-free
countries or regions.

22, Testing on human bodies.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched massive nuclear tests and chemical
weapons tests with living people after the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
According to US official sources, in the 30 years after World
War II the federal government conducted 1,400 different
radioactive experiments in which 23,000 people were used as guinea
pigs. However, this figure did not include the experiments
launched by the US Department of National Defense and Department
of Energy.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the US Department of Energy, the United
States has done nuclear testing on human beings many times. In the
48 disclosed nuclear radiation experiments with human bodies as
targets, about 1,200 people have suffered nuclear radiation.
</P>
<P>
The sources also released that from 1945 to 1963 those hundreds
of thousands of US troops who were marching near the atomic bomb
testing spot in Nevada State had 400 times higher rates of blood
cancer than the average rate of US residents.
</P>
<P>
The United States also used human bodies for experiments with
chemical and biological weapons, including testing human bodies
with chemical reagents, psychedelic and poisonous bacteria. The US
army has publicized the names of 12,000 people who might have been
harmed by its chemical experiments.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation of the General Accounting Office
of the US Congress, from 1940 to 1974 the US government
experimented on 500,000 people (including blacks, soldiers, women,
children and retarded persons), among whom 210,000 were,
unconsciously in most cases, affected by radioactive materials.
Moreover, the United States also collected human tissues from
abroad for nuclear testing and conducted experiments for
bacteriological warfare upon human bodies in some African, Asian
and European countries, which brought about all kinds of "strange
illnesses".
</P>
<P>
Such inhuman things have never happened in the People's
Republic of China.

(21) AIDS.
</P>
<P>
As a result of increased homosexuality and promiscuity, AIDS
has become a serious social problem which is threatening to the
lives of Americans.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in 1993 from the Center for Disease Control showed
that 339,000 people in the US were suffering from the killer
disease. More than 200,000 people have died of the disease since
it first appeared in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, statistics showed there were 25.4 cases of AIDS for
every 100,000 people in the US, the highest incidence in the
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has become the number one killer of American men aged 25
to 44, and the fourth killer of American women in the same age
group.
</P>
<P>
AIDS not only is killing more sufferers, but also is bringing
disastrous consequences to the coming generations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one third of the babies in the US born to
mothers with AIDS contract the disease and eventually die of it,
and two thirds of them are orphaned because the mothers die.
</P>
<P>
There does not exist in China the AIDS disaster that has been
plaguing the US.

20. Narcotics abuse.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest drug market in the world and
also the developed country which has the highest percentage of
drug addicts. At present, about 20 million US citizens take
marijuana, six million take cocaine and 500,000 take heroin. Every
year nearly 500,000 die from of drug taking. Over 230 in every
100,000 people commit crimes relating to drugs. About 80 percent
of the prisoners took drugs or were involved in drug-related
problems before they were imprisoned, and 60 percent of the
prisoners are drug criminals.
</P>
<P>
Drug taking not only damages the health of the drug takers, but
also causes disastrous consequences to the unborn
generation. Since the 1980s when "crack" became widespread, there
have been more and more babies born to addicted mothers. According
to statistics, every year about 11 percent, or 375,000, of
new-born babies in the United States are harmed by drugs while
they are still embryos.
</P>
<P>
China has been effectively cracking down on crimes relating to
drugs according to laws. Although a few people are involved in
drug taking or trafficking in China, the situation in China is far
from that in the United States, where drug taking runs rampant.

19. Domestic Violence.
</P>
<P>
In China, conjugal love, family democracy, respect for seniors
and love for juniors are the mainstreams of the relationship among
family members. Violence only afflicts some one percent of the
Chinese families.
</P>
<P>
But domestic violence in the United States is more serious than
in any other country in the world. According to a US national
women's organization, the number of women who die as a result of
domestic violence every five years is equal to the number of
Americans who died in the Viet Nam War.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, each year, six million women are injured
and some four million women are victims of the domestic violence,
and one third of the US women will be attacked by their
partners. Moreover, 15-25 percent of the pregnant women are beaten
and every year there are 170,000 women who are attacked when they
are five-to-nine-months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Each year two million US women are seriously injured in
domestic violence and one million US women are so maltreated by
their husbands, former husbands or boyfriends that they have to go
to hospital. Among every 14 couples there will be a case of
violence, and arms are used in 40 percent of such cases. Every
year 2,000 to 4,000 women are beaten to death, among whom 1,500 are
killed by their husbands. Half of all the homeless women and
children left their families to escape domestic violence.

18. Gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
It is clearly stipulated in China's Constitution that women
enjoy equal rights with men in the fields of politics, economy,
culture, society and family life, while in the US such
stipulations are not covered by its Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In China female deputies take up 21 percent at its current
Eighth National People's Congress which began in 1993 and more
than 20 percent at local people's congresses at all
levels. However, in the US Congress, even after the elections in
1992, a year called the "Women's Year", female lawmakers only
accounted for 10 percent or so and 18.4 percent at legislatures at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
While female staff members in China's government departments
account for 31 percent of the total, the figure in corresponding
US departments stands at 22 percent. And while the number of women
among China's senior leaders accounts for 19 percent, the figure
in the US is less than 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Job opportunities for women above the age of 15 are only 65
percent of those for men in the US, while in China, the proportion
 of women employment stands at 81 percent. Women's unemployment
rate is twice high as men's in the US, but for Chinese women it is
only 13.4 percent higher than that for men.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 Chinese female technicians took up 35 percent of the
nation's total, while in the US the proportion was 12.2
percent. The Chinese Constitution stipulates that men and women
enjoy equal pay for equal work, yet in the US neither practically
nor legally can women receive equal pay for equal work as men.
</P>
<P>
The monthly income for China's urban female workers account for
77.4 percent of that of male workers in 1990, while the
corresponding proportion in the US stood at 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women enjoy special labor protection by law during
their menstruation, pregnancy, delivery and lactation. However,
in the US there is neither fully paid maternity leave nor
lactation leave with partial pay, nor employment protection during
pregnancy and delivery on a legal base.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 the poverty rate for women (14.9 percent) was more than
1.5 times that for men (9.7 percent) in the US, while in China
men's and women's poverty rates are almost the same. On the whole,
the state of equality between men and women in China is better
than in the US.

<P>
At the Eighth National People's Congress, which began in 1993,
the proportion of the ethnic minority deputies to the NPC stood at
14.7 percent, much higher than the proportion of eight percent of
the ethnic groups in the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, all the 55 ethnic minorities in China have their
own representatives in the National People's Congress. Among the
current senior officials at the provincial and ministerial levels
nationwide, some 10.5 percent are from ethnic minorities. All the
heads of the country's autonomous regions, prefectures and
counties are from the autonomous ethnic groups. Moreover, quite a
number of the civilians from ethnic minorities are holding or once
held the posts of vice-president of the country, vice-chairperson
of the NPC, vice-premier of the State Council or president of the
Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
In China, the Constitution explicitly rules that all the
nationalities enjoy the freedom of using and developing their own
languages. In addition, the Chinese government helped 10 ethnic
groups which used to have no written languages develop their own
written languages. The Chinese government has also given the
ethnic minorities energetic support and financial assistance to
develop culture and education by using their own languages. In
public activities the ethnic minority languages are put on a par
with the language of the Han nationality, the largest in
China. Citizens of various ethnic minorities enjoy the right to
use their own languages. And government officials at various
levels in areas inhabited by ethnic groups must use one or more
languages which are commonly used in their own respective
localities.

17. Racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The US has long been notorious for its racial discrimination.
Discrimination against ethnic groups remains the darkest abyss in
the US society. The black people, Hispanics and other ethnic
groups now account for 17 percent of the total
population. However, only a tiny number of them can squeeze into
the upper circles in the political, economic and social
spheres. In the US Congress there is no seat at all for many
ethnic groups. Though the number of black congressmen increased
from 25 to 39 in 1992, the ratio remains at 7.4 percent, much
lower that the ratio of black people in the American population.
</P>
<P>
According to a US government survey in 1995, two thirds of the
total US population or 57 percent of the employees are women or
come from ethnic groups. However, some 97 percent of the senior
managerial personnel of big corporations are white males. In sharp
contrast, of the 5.1 million convicts in jail, black and Hispanic
people account for two thirds. And of the 1.5 million people in
custody, colored people account for 70 percent. About one third of
the blacks, Hispanics and Indians live in poverty, triple the rate
for the white people.
</P>
<P>
The black people account for only 13 percent of the US
population, but the number of black people who are murdered is six
times the figure for white people. Moreover, some 54.2 percent of
the country's criminals, over 40 percent of the convicts sentenced
to death and 48 percent of the homeless are black people.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in 25 states and 50 major cities of the country,
two thirds of the black people and Hispanics live near poisonous
waste disposal places. And of the country's five largest rubbish
disposal places, three are located in residential areas inhabited
by ethnic groups. Almost all the largest poisonous waste disposal
places are located on the South Side, a major residential area for
black people in Chicago. Discrimination against ethnic groups has
also extended to language, with 22 states having passed laws
making English the only official language.

<HEADLINE> Helms-Burton Bill Shocks World, Says Robaina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina said today the Helms-Burton U.S. bill, that reinforces the
economic embargo imposed on the island country, "surprised the
world."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bill not only violates Cuban sovereignty, but also
pretends to bear on the rights of third countries, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Robaina told a press conference here today that the world
cannot be ruled by the United States and that the Cuban
transformation process will not be suspended, despite the effects
of the Helms-Burton bill, which came after Cuba last month shot
down two light aircraft piloted by Cuban exiles based in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has argued that the downing of the two aircraft is an act
in legitimate defense of its airspace and sovereignty and accused
the United States of failing to prevent the violations of its
airspace.
</P>

Havana has not changed its decision to defend its territory
with the means available if there were new violations of its
airspace, the minister said, adding that if Cuban exiles
threatened such violations it was up to the United States to stop
them.
</P>
<P>
Cuba expects to continue talks with the European Union (EU) and
the dialogue will not end too soon, added Robaina.

the two aircraft.

The average hourly net income of the American workers decreased
at an annual rate of 0.73 percent between 1974 and
1993. Calculated at the price level of 1987, the weekly salary of
the US worker in 1993 had dropped by 14.7 percent as compared with
that in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Between 1988 and 1993 the productivity of the American private
businesses rose by 5.9 percent, while the hourly income of the
workers dropped by four percent. The purchasing power of an
ordinary American family was 1,400 US dollars lower in 1993 than
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Referring to information published by the US government, the
Social and Political Research Institute of Fordham University of
the US concluded that the life quality and social health index of
the US was 41 in 1993 as against 77.5 in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Though the living standard of the Chinese people has been
comparatively low, it has been substantially improved over the
past 20 years. China's economy has grown at an average annual rate
of nine percent. Meanwhile, the per capita income of the Chinese
people, which doubled between 1977 and 1987, is continuously
rising at a high speed.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1994 the per capita actual income of the urban
families in China grew at a rate of 38.3 percent, at an annual
rate of 8.4 percent; the per capita actual income of the rural
residents increased by 18.2 percent, at an annual rate of 4.3
percent; and savings deposits of both urban and rural residents
soared by over 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
After citing China's tremendous achievements in improving the
people's living standards, Ernest Stern, a vice-president of the
World Bank, pointed out that such great progress made in such a
short period of time has been rarely made by any other social
grouping in human history.

14. The homeless.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, over 80 percent of the five million
poor families in the US can not afford to pay rent. The Clinton
administration officially admitted in February 1994 that there
were seven million homeless people in the US. The US Association
for the Homeless estimates that about two to three million people
in the US sleep in the open air every year, while in China the
figure is only five to 7.5 percent of that of the US.
</P>
<P>
15. Illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
According to a report entitled "US Adult Culture" issued by the
US Department of Education, semi-illiterates account for about
half of the US population. Among them, 42 million are
semi-illiterates at the lowest level, while another 52 million
semi-illiterates are only a little better
educated. Semi-illiterate refers to the ability to read but not
understand the meaning of common words.
</P>
<P>
The "Lianhe Zaobao" newspaper of Singapore in 1992 quoted US
statistics as saying that half of the American people are
illiterate.
</P>
<P>
China, on the other hand, through consistent anti-illiteracy
efforts, reduced the number of illiterates and semi-illiterates
(referring to those at or under 15 years of age who can not read
or read very little) to 15.88 percent of the total population in
1990 and further to 12.01 percent, or 145 million people, in 1995,
as against 80 percent in 1949, when the People's Republic was
founded.
</P>
<P>
16. The change in living standards.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the "Christian Science Monitor" in
1995, in the 22 years since 1973, the real income of 80 percent of
American families has declined or remained unchanged, and the real
living standards of ordinary people substantially dropped, with
many of them falling below the poverty line.

(9) Number of Prisoners
</P>
<P>
The United States has the largest prison population in the
world. According to a report released by the Department of
Justice, the number of federal and state prisoners exceeded one
million in 1994. When those held in other jails are added, the
total comes to around 1.5 million, the ratio of prisoners to total
population being 565 per 100,000. Both numbers rank first in the
world.
</P>
<P>
In China, the number of prisoners at the end of 1994 was 1.286
million, giving a ratio of 107 prisoners per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
When this is compared to the U.S., the U.S. ratio is more than
five times that of China.
</P>
<P>
(10)Recidivism Rate
</P>
<P>
The rate of recidivism in the United States has stayed at more
than 40 percent. According to one study, 50 to 70 percent of the
juvenile delinquents in the U.S. committed crimes again within 12
months after being released.
</P>
<P>
In China, 90 percent of the juvenile delinquents do not break
the law again after they are released. China has one of the lowest
rates of recidivism in the world, with a rate that stays between
six and eight percent.
</P>
<P>
(11) Right to privacy
</P>
<P>
The United States has the most serious problems of infringement
on citizens' privacy among the developed countries. According to a
report released by the International Labor Organization, every
year about 20 million American employees are monitored by
electronic devices, accounting for eight percent of the country's
total population.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 80 percent of the employees in insurance and
telecommunications companies, and in banks and airline ticket
offices have their telephone conversations monitored.
</P>
<P>
And the most serious violator of the right of privacy is the
government itself. According to statistics, the U.S. government
has 3.5 billion pieces of data on individuals.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the US government agreed that the National Security
Agency could equip every telephone or fax machine with a certain
chip that could supply information, under the pretext of
safeguarding national security.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the FBI decided to expand the scope of telephone
bugging to one percent of the country's total citizens,
eavesdropping on one out of every 100 telephone or data
transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
In China, such all-round routine invasion of citizens' rights
of privacy does not exist, except when judiciary departments must
take measures within the boundaries of the law.

7. Shooting Incidents.
</P>
<P>
Private handguns are strictly
controlled in every country in the world except the US, which has
listed in its constitution "the right to bear arms". The country
has 220 million private firearms, almost one gun per capita.
</P>
<P>
A statistical report shows that the US witnesses one million
criminal shooting incidents a year, more than 20,000 people are
shot, and more than 10,000 commit suicide with guns.
</P>
<P>
About 33 women are raped at gun points every day in the US, 40
children are killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the
US in 1994 said that random murders constitute a real danger for
all Americans.
</P>
<P>
China does not regard the right to own a gun as a guarantee of
human rights, and its society is not like that of the US, which is
racked with the fear of shooting.
</P>
<P>
8. Number of rapes.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Federal Foundation in 1993 said that a total of
1.5 million women had been raped over the previous five years, and
7.6 million women were victims of murder, robbery or other
assaults.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 the frequency of rape rose to one every six minutes,
and more than 70 out of every 100,000 women were raped.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 an average of 118 of 100,000 women aged from five to 59
were raped.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Department of Justice of
the US in 1995, 500,000 rape cases occur annually, almost one
every minute.
</P>
<P>
In its "1995 Human Development Report" the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) said that one out of six American women
stands the chance of being raped during her lifetime. The rate of
cases of criminal violence cases in the US is seven times that of
Western Europe, and about 18 times higher than in China.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Biden, chairman of the US Senate Judiciary Committee,
acknowledged that the number and frequency of rape cases in the US
rank first in the world.

5. Crime Rate.
</P>
<P>
According to information released by the Department of Justice
of the US, the number of people serving prison terms in the US at
the end of 1994 totalled 5.1 million, accounting for 2.7 percent
of the total adult population. Now the average annual number of
cases of crimes stands at 35 million in the US and in every
100,000 people, 5,483 people report cases of crimes to police
every year. The country's crime rate and the occurrence of
criminal cases have remained at about two percent and six percent,
respectively, for years.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the US, China's crime rate and the occurrence
of criminal cases is 0.06 percent and 0.2 percent,
respectively. The ratio is one to 33 and one to 30.
</P>
<P>
6. Violence and murder.
</P>
<P>
The US is the country with the most serious violent criminal
acts. On average, two million cases of criminal violence occur
annually, with six million victims, of whom 24,000 are murdered.
</P>
<P>
The number of murders in the US was a record 24,500 in 1993,
2.5 times the total number of murders in Canada, France, Germany,
Britain and Japan in the same year.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, 9.8 people per 100,000 people were murdered every
day. The proportion is five times that in China.

3. Turn-out for elections.
</P>
<P>
Participation by eligible voters in China's first general
election, held in 1953, was 85.88 percent. It rose to around 90
percent and stayed there for all subsequent elections of the
People's Congresses, and it was as high as 93.58 percent in the
national election at the end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The turn-out in all elections of the House of Representatives
of the United States since the beginning of this century has
hovered at somewhere between 30 and 60 percent. The presidential
election, which is cited as a major political event in the
country, had a turn-out that reached a peak of 80 percent in
1866. Since that time, however, the highest voter turn-out in this
century, has been only 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
4 Parliamentary democracy.
</P>
<P>
Congressional seats in the United States have come to be
monopolized by a tiny number of wealthy people. To win an election
in a congressional race, a candidate will spend an immense amount
of money for the campaign. Spending hundreds of thousands of
dollars or even a million dollars in an election is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-term election in November 1994, the 35 senators
elected spent an average of 3.7 million dollars each for the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in April 1994, at least 28 senators,
more than a quarter of the Senate, were millionaires. Millionaires
in the House of Representatives accounted for more than 11.5
percent, or at least 50 congressmen. The ratio of millionaires in
the U.S. Congress was at least 30 times that of millionaires in US
society as a whole, which is less than 0.5 percent. At least a
quarter of the members of the Congress elected in 1994, who were
Republicans, were millionaires.
</P>
<P>
An article in the Washington Post in 1994 said that the
Congress of the United States belongs to, is ruled by, and serves
the interests of the rich.
</P>
<P>
In China, elections of the deputies to the National People's
Congress and local congresses are free from monetary
restrictions. Whether a deputy wins or loses an election does not
depend on the amount of money he or she has but rather on the
contributions he or she has made to the state and to society,
on his or her relations with the people and on his or her exploits
in serving the people.
</P>
<P>
Election results have proven that elected deputies cover a wide
range of society, embracing people of all ethnic groups, social
strata, and occupations. Many outstanding workers, farmers, and
teachers have been elected as deputies to the People's
Congresses.

2.Universal suffrage.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States stipulated in its Constitution of
1787 that its citizens enjoy the right to vote, it imposed a
number of restrictions in the areas of race, sex, property,
educational background, age, and length of residence, and the
legal right to vote for black people, women, Indians, and about a
third of the white men was denied. The black people were given the
right to vote in 1870, women in 1920, and Indians in 1948, or 94
years, 144 years, and 172 years, respectively, after the founding
of the republic.
</P>
<P>
Further restrictions based on property ownership, a poll tax,
and educational background were finally done away with by the law
in 1856, 1964, and 1970 respectively.
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1971, nearly 200 years after the founding of
the republic, that the United States adopted the 26th amendment to
the Constitution stipulating that the right to vote for those aged
18 or older should not be discriminated against on the basis of
age.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China, soon after it was founded,
clearly set forth the notion of universal suffrage of Chinese
citizens in the "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference", a constitutional document.
</P>
<P>
China's first Electoral Law, promulgated in 1953, and its first
Constitution, promulgated in 1954, stated definitely that all
citizens who have reached the age of 18, regardless of ethnic
status, race, sex, occupation, class origin, religous belief,
educational background, property, and length of residence,
have the rights to vote and to stand for election, with the
exception of persons deprived of these rights by law.
</P>
<P>
Universal suffrage was implemented in China 22 years earlier
than it was in the United States, and 99.97 percent of Chinese
citizen above the age of 18 now enjoy the right to vote and to
stand for election - a rate that is higher than in the United
States.

<P>
Second, the US Constitution does not fully cover right to
equality. Neither the US Constitution in 1787 nor its amendment in
1789 in the Bill of Rights contains provisions concerning the
right to equality.
</P>
<P>
To date, the US Constitution has not contained provisions in
principle concerning equality between various ethnic groups,
equality between men and women and equality of citizens' rights.
</P>
<P>
Third, protection of human rights as provided for in the US
Constitution is very limited.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution merely lists a number of individual rights,
but it neither requests nor authorizes the US Congress or the
federal government to take steps to protect those rights.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional scholar Louis Henkin noted that there is a
great difference between Americans' constitutional rights and
human rights as they are recognized internationally.
</P>
<P>
He noted that assumptions in the US about human rights,
particularly in the area of equality, and economic and social
rights, fall below current international standards.
</P>
<P>
This is an inherent drawback of America's human rights
guarantee system, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, China's Constitution contains a comprehensive
system of provisions on citizens' basic human rights and the
protection of such rights.
</P>
<P>
Chapter Two of China's Constitution contains not only specific
stipulations on citizens' political rights, but also complete
provisions on economic, social, and cultural rights as well. It
not only explicitly states that all citizens are equal before the
law, but also specifies that all ethnic groups are equal, that men
and women are equal, and that all citizens enjoy equal rights in
all social aspects.
</P>
<P>
The chapter not only lists various rights of Chinese citizens,
but also specifies the responsibilities of the state, society,
collectives and individuals in advancing and protecting such
rights.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the US, the Constitutional rights of Chinese
citizens are much more extensive and specific, and the Chinese
government assumes much greater responsibility in advancing and
protecting human rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- An article entitled "A Comparison
of Human Rights in China with Those in the United States" was
published here today.
</P>
<P>
The article by Ren Yanshi said that a number of American
politicians have used the US as a "world human rights model" while
wantonly attacking China's record on human rights.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 Human Rights Report released by the US Department of
State once again spread rumours about, distorted and attacked
China's record on human rights, but did not say a single word
about serious human rights problems in the US.
</P>
<P>
"To understand correctly and assess the state of human rights
in China and the US fairly, it is useful to do a thorough
comparison of the state of human rights in the two countries," it
said.
</P>
<P>
China and the US are about the same size in geographical area,
but China's population is 4.6 times that of the US, while per
capita acreage of farmland in China is just one-tenth of that of
the US and per capita share of other resources is much lower than
it is in the US.
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country with a low income, whereas the US
is the No. 1 developed country in the world, the article pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Using methods used by the World Bank in 1994 to compute wealth,
we find that the per capita wealth of Chinese is less than 1.6
percent of that of Americans.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of natural resources, economic development, and other
conditions essential to advancing human rights, China lags far
behind the US," it noted.
</P>
<P>
However, when the difference of social systems in the two
countries, the different attitudes of the two governments on
protecting human rights, and the different efforts made as a
result are considered, the conditions of human rights in China can
be seen to be different from those in the US.
</P>
<P>
1. Constitutional Rights.
</P>
<P>
First, the human rights specified in the US Constitution, that
is, The constitutional rights of American citizens, are incomplete
and do not include economic, social and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
Human rights as specified by the Constitution's Bill of Rights
and other amendments do not go beyond the scope of civil and
political rights.
</P>
<P>
Various economic, social, and cultural rights announced in "The
World Human Rights Declaration" and "The International Convention
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights" are not recognized by the
US Constitution, except for the rights to join trade unions or
choose a job and a few other rights.
</P>
<P>
The US Constitution provides no guarantee for Americans' rights to
have their basic needs satisfied or their right to avoid starvation
or to be free from want.

<HEADLINE> US Not Qualified to Point the Finger at China on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A signed article published here
today notes that the United States should make a greater effort to
improve its own human rights situation, and is not qualified to
point the finger at China in this regard.
</P>
<P>
After comparing human rights situations in both China and the
US in 24 areas, the 10,000-character article by Ren Yanshi pointed
out that China has done much better than the US with regard to
equality of sharing and guaranteeing fundamental human rights and
freedom.
</P>
<P>
The 24 areas are: Constitutional rights, universal suffrage,
voter turn-out, parliamentary democracy, crime rate, violence and
murder, shooting incidents, number of rapes, number of prisoners,
recidivism rate, right to privacy, slavery system, gap between the
rich and poor, number of homeless, illiteracy rate, changes in
standard of living, racial discrimination, gender discrimination,
domestic violence, narcotics abuse, AIDS, human guinea pigs,
encroachment on human rights of other countries, attitude towards
international human rights documents.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that for the past several years, some
American politicians have been trying to confuse the public
worldwide by presenting the US as a world model for human rights,
and blaming China for its lapses.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 Human Rights Report by the US State Department had
much that was sheer fabrication and distortion, and attacked China
on its human rights situation, without ever mentioning a single
instance of serious human rights problems in the US itself, said
the article.
</P>
<P>
It noted that, full enjoyment of human rights is a lofty goal
which requires a great deal of effort from all the countries in
the world, and in view of present realities, there is no country
that can proffer its own human rights situation as a perfect
example.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that because of historical and economic
factors, China still has a long way to go to realize the goal of
total enjoyment of human rights.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, a simple fact is that China has done much
better than the US in regard to equally sharing and commonly
guaranteeing basic human rights and freedom among its people.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Will Safeguard Basic Human Rights -- Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that his country will continue to
safeguard its fundamental rights and that any groups or
individuals are not allowed to create violence to the extent of
affecting the majority.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his government would not allow any party to
incite the people, thus resulting in problems like riots that
might cause the people to suffer.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the United States government's move to continue
listing Malaysia among the countries which Washington alleges
violate basic human rights, Mahathir said: "We don't care what
others say about the way we take care of our own basic rights. For
us, safeguarding the interests of the majority is also
safeguarding the basic human rights in the country."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the U.S. should be asked to remove Malaysia from
the list, Mahathir said: "No need, we need not care about what
others say about us, the important thing is that we take care of
our own fundamental rights."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia was unlike the United States which
considered itself as a superpower that could easily punish others.
 But he added that Washington should look at itself and realize
that it was violating the fundamental rights of others.
</P>
<P>
"They (Americans) always violate the fundamental rights of
other countries. They go to other countries, catch people and take
them back, and punish others according to their own laws,"
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
"I myself fear that they may come to this country, catch me to
be taken there to be tried and put into prison," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said: "Sometimes, their police abuse the
blacks and hispanics. They don't care about justice in other
countries and act as if they alone are free from human rights
violations."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had previously tortured the black people who were
slaves, Mahathir said, adding that although they are a small group
in the country, they were the most to be imprisoned and the
poorest in their country.
</P>
<P>
"Is this justice for a citizen? This shows that there is no
justice for the people and in fact violates their fundamental
rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the United States was a country that did not care
for fundamental human rights because "fundamental rights include

DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi opposition leader
Sheikh Hasina Saturday said the resignation of Prime Minister
Khaleda Zia was a must for holding fresh elections under a
non-party neutral caretaker government.
</P>

Hasina, president of the largest opposition Awami (People's)
League (AL), demanded in a statement issued last night the

The AL chief has accepted the offer of President Rahman Biswas
for a dialogue to resolve the political crisis and is expected to
meet the president today.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hasina called on people to continue the ongoing
"non-cooperation" campaign until the resignation of the government
and cancellation of last month's general elections that were
boycotted by major opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high-ranking government official urged the
opposition to withdraw their agitation program "without causing
more sufferings to the people."
</P>
<P>
At least three people were killed and hundred of others injured
across Bangladesh Saturday, the first day of the opposition's
non-stop "non-cooperation" campaign that paralyzed the normal life

<HEADLINE> Nepal Committed to Ethnic Development: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
committed to the development of indigenous people in the country,
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said while inaugurating an
ethnic minority conference in eastern Nepal Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day international conference focuses on the
development of ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the Koch Rajbanshi community in east
Nepal's Jhapa district was not able to join the mainstream of
Nepal's national development due to lack of education and
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The government will implement appropriate programs for the
all-round development of ethnic communities in the country, said
Deuba.
</P>
<P>
All ethnic groups have their own traditions, which constitutes
the basis of Nepal's national culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for research work to prevent such original culture
from disappearing.
</P>
<P>
Deuba said communal riots are posing a major challenge to the
world peace today, and the way to avoid this is to develop mutual
respect among people of all communities.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the conference would help further
preserve the culture of the community and create a spirit of world
fraternity.

<HEADLINE> Troops Alert For Rebel Offensive In North Sri Lank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lankan government troops in
the north have been alerted to a possible large-scale assault by
Tamil rebels who want to recapture Jaffna city, the stronghold of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), according to reports
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The alert follows intelligence that some 7,000 LTTE rebels are
being mobilized to launch such an offensive, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
These rebels are reported to be undergoing training in rebel
jungle camps in the east of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
According to information revealed by police, there are two
large LTTE training camps in the jungles of the Batticaloa
district, said the reports, adding that one camp accommodates
5,000 trainees while the other has 2,000 rebel cadres under
training.
</P>
<P>
The trainees have been reportedly told that they should
prepare themselves physically and mentally to recapture Jaffna
city within the next weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government troops in November and December last year
recaptured most of the LTTE rebel controlled areas on Jaffna
peninsula including the city of Jaffna itself.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, which has been fighting against the government for a
separate Tamil state since 1983, has staged several devastating
bombing attacks in the country during the last three months, as
the government troops mounted military attacks on the LTTE bases
in the northern Jaffna peninsula, including Jaffna city.

<HEADLINE> FIFA: No Bigger Goals but New Advantage Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- World soccer's governing
body FIFA on Saturday ruled out any possibility of using bigger
goals but approved an important rule change that would make
matches smoother.
</P>
<P>
The International Football Association Board, the rule-making
body of FIFA which met here, ruled after brief discussion that
bigger goals would do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
FIFA Secretary General Sepp Blatter said the idea had attracted
much media attention, but never went beyond being a tentative
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Blatter added FIFA also refused to discuss changing the size of
the ball due to similiar reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, the board approved the advantage rule change, which
will allow referees to let play continue if a foul is committed by
the defending team but the offense still has the advantage.
</P>
<P>
If the advantage never materializes, the referee may stop play
and award a free kick.
</P>
<P>
Officials said FIFA had yet to decide the suitable maximum time
that a referee could allow play to continue before going back and

<HEADLINE> China Urged to Draw on Others' Experience in Industrialization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China should draw on both
experience and failures of other countries in the course of
industrialization, a member of the country's top advisory body
said.
</P>
<P>
Liao Chi-chiang, member of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference here in
session, said that the world economy is under transformation from
primitive agriculture to industrialization, and so is the Chinese
economy.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that "China should carefully learn lessons from
both successes and failures in maintaining agricultural
development in the process of economic transformation."
</P>
<P>
With the largest population in the world, the success or
failure in China's agricultural development is of far-reaching
importance not only for itself but for the whole world, noted
Liao, an entrepreneur from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The successful experience of Japan, the Republic of Korea and
some other countries, and Taiwan where such a transformation has
been completed or largely completed, can be drawn on, Liao said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the "orderly" move of rural population to the
industrial and service sectors in these countries and regions,
explaining that success in this respect has helped maintain
sustained growth in agriculture and boosted the process of
industrialization and urbanization.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Liao acknowledged, the neglect of a balanced
development of agriculture in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and some
other countries in their industrialization process led to
industrial and regional imbalances.
</P>
<P>
"China should draw lessons from their failures and attaches due
attention to a balanced development of agriculture and industry,"
Liao said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping once noted that if there erupt problems in
agriculture, the whole economy and society will be seriously
affected, Liao said.

ZHENGZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Another 1.1 million people in
central China's Henan Province have managed to move above the

In recent years, the province has not only provided relief
supplies, but also encouraged farmers to add forestry, animal
husbandry, and aquatic production to their growing of grain.
</P>
<P>
The province has also invested in infrastructure. Last year,
the central and provincial governments invested a total of 400
million yuan in improving transportation, telecommunications, and
irrigation projects.
</P>

Various places in the province have tried different means to
increase their incomes. Xinyang Prefecture has set up over 960
economic entities to develop tea, fruits, and fungus, animal
husbandry, silkworms, and aquatic breeding.
</P>
<P>
Huaibin County, a flood-stricken area, has paid greater

</P>
<P>
People of 31 poor counties are living in deserts, areas
suffering from water and soil erosion, low-lying saline-alkali
land and mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the region has regarded the improvement
of ecological conditions as an integral part of poverty relief.
So far, the region has afforested 30 million mu (about two million
ha).
</P>
<P>
In the Yinshan and Manhan mountains, the region has encouraged
people to plant trees or fruit trees in over 2,000 valleys, and,
as a result, it now reaps over 40 million yuan (about 2.7 million
US dollars) annually in economic returns.

Horqin and Muus deserts, where small tree farms, orchards,
fruit-processing firms, as well as glass and brick works have been
set up.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 counties have harnessed water and soil erosion on a
large scale. As a result, local grain production per capita has
increased by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
To deal with salinization, the region has set up two
experimental centers in the Hetao irrigation area and on the
Xiliao River, transforming large tracts of arid land into
high-yielding fields.

<HEADLINE> Ribeiro Takes Indoor Gold Again with Blistering Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Portugese Fernanda Ribeiro shew
she could be a strong competitor in the Atlanta Olympic Games by
winning the 3,000 meters at the European Indoor Athletics
Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
She clocked eight minutes 39.49 seconds, the third indoor best
of all time, to retain her title, 11 seconds ahead of
second-placed Swede Sara Wedlund.
</P>
<P>
But Wedlund's defeat was sweetened by the fact that her time of
8:50.32 improved the Swedish national record.
</P>
<P>
The other events on Saturday produced far less impressive
results, especially with poor results in the sprints.
</P>
<P>
German Marc Blume came from behind to win the men's 60 meters
in 6.62 seconds, the slowest winner's time since the event was
last staged in Sweden in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The top five finalists finished within five hundredths of a
second in the close-fought race, which featured a low-class field.
</P>
<P>
The other winners of the day were Astrid Kumbernuss (shot),
Dmitry Markov of Belarus (pole vault), Latvia's Igor Kazanov (60
meters hurdles), Ekaterini Thanou of Greece (women's 60 meters)
and Bulgaria's Iva Prandzheva (women's triple jump).
</P>
<P>
In the biggest upset Saturday, high jump champion Dalton Grant
of Britain only cleared 2.15 meters in qualifiers and failed to
make the final.
</P>
<P>
The championships end on Sunday with 14 finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Three Serbian opposition parties
-- the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), the Democratic Party (DS)
and the Civil Alliance (GSS) -- held a rally in central Belgrade
today.
</P>
<P>
At the rally held in Republic Square, which was attended by
tens of thousands of people, SPO leader Vuk Draskovic, GSS leader
Vesna Pesic and DS leader Zoran Djindjic all spoke critically
about the current political and economic situation and the
activities of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
They urged for a united opposition, stressing that the
opposition parties need to form a single election list at the next
elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
Pesic said the standard of living in the country was going down
and the rally was a voice of protest from dissatisfied citizens of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
She said that the utmost objective should be a strong Serbia
because strong Serbia alone could reintegrate into Europe.
</P>
<P>
Djindjic accused the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) of
having "occupied the country" and said that the first step toward
Serbia's unification should be the unification of opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic also criticized the government by saying that the
current situation in Serbia was worse than the situation five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The participants defined 10 common objectives of the united
opposition, which include a single opposition election list,
sinchronized activities against the government, Serbia's
reintegration into European organizations, cooperation in the
Balkans, speedier privatization, freedom of media, the rule of
law, fundamental political and economic reforms, professional and
ideology-free army and police, and national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Long Queues Back at Filling Stations in Lagos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The recurring fuel scarcity, which
abated in Lagos just two weeks ago, has returned with the long
queues of vehicles back at the filling stations.
</P>
<P>
The fresh shortage has reappeared since last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Because of the fuel scarcity, many commuters are seen
stranded at various locations while others trekking to their
destinations.
</P>
<P>
Commuters have battled for the few vehicles that operate on the
roads, although fares are hiked by up to 100 percent on most of
the routes.
</P>
<P>
A young lady said, "the problem is not just the high fare but
the problem of fighting to secure a place inside the vehicles, it
is a terrible experience."
</P>
<P>
She said she had waited at the bus stop for more than two
hours, trying to get a bus to her friend's place.
</P>
<P>
Just as motorists are queuing up for fuel, housewives and
school children are also queuing for kerosene which has become
scarce also in Lagos area.
</P>
<P>
The price for cooking gas, which has been scarce in this city,
has gone up with the 12.5 kg gas selling for between 2,500 and
3,000 Naira as against 250 Naira last month.
</P>
<P>
One US Dollar is now equal to 85 Naira at the autonomous
exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Although it is Saturday today at the weekend when office
workers don't come to work, the fuel situation has worsened.
Filling stations do not have fuel to supply, but, vehicles are
seen along double lines in most cases, queuing in anticipation
of supply.
</P>
<P>
The long queues at the fuel stations have crippled traffic
flow on many roads in the metropolis, with vehicles blocking
parts of the roads.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fuel shortage, the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation explained on March 6 that fuel distribution
would be disrupted for 36 hours because of the need to change the
loading points for delivery into Lagos area to avert what it
called "off-specification gasoline" being sold to the public.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Crime Cost Amounts to Public School Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The annual cost of crime and
punishment in Canada has reached over 11.5 billion U.S. dollars,
almost equivalent to what Canada spends on public schools.
</P>
<P>
The cost represents at least 2 percent of Canada's gross
domestic product, according to a report by today's Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
The largest single cost is 1.9 billion U.S. dollar in salaries
for the roughly 55,000 police officers in the country. Wages for
private security guards, who now outnumber police officers two to
one, add another 1.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
When operating and support costs for both public and private
security forces are added, including the 143 million U.S.dollars
that Canadians spend annually on security devices and alarm
systems, policing and security costs exceed 5.8 billion dollars,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
About three million crimes were reported or known to police in
1994. Over 60 percent of them is against property, involving
offenses such as theft, fraud and robbery. In 1993, victims'
losses were nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the total 11.5 billion dollar annual cost
of crime and punishment and losses is probably a significant
underestimation of the real cost, because the actual rate of crime
in Canada is much higher than that reported to police.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with most other countries, Canada is still a
country with a low rate of violent crime.

<HEADLINE> Libya to Take Legal Action Against French FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Libya will take legal action
against French Foreign Minister Herve De Charette for accusing
Libya of supporting terrorism, the Libyan news agency JANA quoted
a source at the General People's Congress (parliament) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the French foreign minister criticized Libya for its
support of the four Hamas suicide bomb attacks in Israel which
killed 58 innocent people.
</P>
<P>
The source said the racist remarks made by the French minister
will greatly harm France's interests in Libya.
</P>
<P>
The General People's Congress Secretariat would summon
representatives of both Libya's Chamber of Commerce and those of
the French firms operating in Libya to inform them officially that
such statements would harm the economic interests of France in
Libya, the source noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that French companies might be excluded from an
international tender for the execution of a giant gas project in
Libya, which is worth billions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The French government has to realize well that the stability
of its economic interests in Libya depends on its political
attitudes toward the people of Libya," the source warned.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Radio Calls for Resumption of Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Radio Damascus today called for
a resumption of the Middle East peace conference to salvage the
current peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a political commentary, the radio said that salvaging the
peace process requires the resumption of the peace conference held
in Madrid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, the peace process is now facing a
serious fix. The peace march, being exposed to shocks and
obstacles, is almost at the threshold of a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the radio recalled, the parties concerned, with the
help of the two peace process sponsors -- the U.S. and Russia --
agreed on the convocation of the Madrid peace conference. The
results of the talks, however, have not attained the cherished
target, namely, the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Madrid conference has not concluded its work,
but just suspended its sittings, giving room for bilateral talks on
all tracks of the peace negotiations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Radio Damascus asserted that the Madrid conference was the
final authority on the peace process. It is natural, therefore, for
the parties involved in bilateral talks to turn to the final
authority in case of unsurmountable obstacles and hurdles in the
way.
</P>
<P>
The radio commentary pointed out that Syria's call for the
re-convening of the Madrid conference is correct, objective and
sincere, as it expresses a candid adherence to the Madrid formula
and principles. This stance clearly demonstrates that Syria is
absolutely keen on pushing the peace process forward and on
removing the present snags.
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, Syrian cherishes the conviction that the
re-convening of the Madrid conference will spontaneously provide
the necessary dynamic force to reactivate the process at the
current stage of development, thereby reviving the hope for the
prospects of the long-desired just and comprehensive peace in the
region.
