CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today released 117
repentant terrorists, the official Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.

<P>
The terrorists have "pledged to renounce extremist ideology and
pursue the tolerant teachings of Islam," MENA said.

Islamic rule. Many terrorists were arrested and sentenced to
prison.

The government had also released some repentant terrorists
before.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Criticises European Parliament Resolution  on Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January25 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Foregn Ministry
spokesman today announced a resolution adopted by the European
parliament the other day on the hostage crisis in Russia's
Daghestan as "groundless," noting that it "cannot help causing
surprise and bitterness."
</P>
<P>
Grigory Karasin, head of the Information Department of the
ministry, called as "totally groundless" allegations in the
document that Russian authorities did not use all opportunities
for a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
he told a regular news briefing in the Foreign Ministry's press
center that the resoution "practically ignored the actual state of
affairs, in particular the fact that the developments in
(Daghestani city of) Kizlyar and (Daghestani village of)
Pervomaiskoye were the handiwork of Chechen terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Karasin described a call in the resolution to curtail relations
between the European Union (EU) and Russia as "unacceptable and
counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
It was not the first time the European parliament "demonstrated
ignorance or reluctance to recognize that Chechnya is a member of
the Russian Federation and the crisis situation there was caused by
the operation of illegal armed formations that have chosen a
criminal road to their objectives," the spokesman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We cherish our partnership and cooperation with the EU,"
Karasin said, noting: "However, we proceed from a premise
that cooperation is equally necessary for both sides."
</P>
<P>
If there is a desire to help Russian reforms in practice,
it is necessary to abandon political exhortations and to
display a balanced, cautious and goodwill approach, the
spokesman emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Lodges Protest Against Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government made
strong representations today to the British government over a
meeting between British permanent representative to the U.N. Sir
John Weston and the "representative" of the Turkish Cypriot regime.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides summoned Thursday
Britain's High Commissioner to Cyprus David Madden, and filed an
official protest over the British move.
</P>
<P>
Sir John is also the current President of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
A similar representation was made by Cyprus' permanent
representative to the U.N. Nicos Agathocleous directly to Sir
John in New York. Cyprus' High Commission in London will also
protest to the British Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
In Nicosia, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides
described the British move as an "unacceptable development" and
said the explanations given by Britain did not satisfy the Cyprus
government.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Madden, Foreign Minister Michaelides said
the Cyprus government considers those actions as not contributing
to efforts to solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, they encourage Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in his effort to secure recognition for his secessionist
entity, he added.
</P>
<P>
The self-declared "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" was
established in 1983, and is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides told reporters that he asked the British High
Commissioner to convey to London the positions of the Cyprus
government on the matter. At the same time, he gave instructions
to Cyprus' High Commissioner to London to make similar
representations as those made already by the island's permanent
representative to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He said that any country, including Britain, is allowed to
communicate with the Turkish Cypriots here, but the New York
meeting is a different issue because it could be misinterpreted by
the Turkish Cypriots as "an encouragement" to their efforts to
have their entity in the occupied areas recognized.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided in 1974 when Turkey militarily
intervened and took control of northern third of the island
following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Official: Palestinian Election Fair, Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
official today said that the January 20 elections were fair and
free, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Gabi Baramki, member of the Central Election Commission (CEC),
stressed that the claims and appeals submitted to the commission
will not affect the final results of the elections. Baramki
indicated that the commission have not received many complaints of
problems in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said the CEC will review and respond to every
claim.
</P>
<P>
In general, Barami said, the elections went on very well
as far as fairness and freedom were concerned.
</P>
<P>
"We require written documents including these objections which
the CEC views and responds to," he said while referring to fraud
accusations. "In case the claimer was convinced with the CEC's
response the issue is over. If the claimer was not convinced, he
or she could appeal to the Court of Appeals," he added.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the vote count took so long in some areas,
Baramki said: "The vote count for the ballot boxes were
conducted within the human resource capabilities of those who
supervised the polling process. In addition, due to having
remote villages and lack of communication in these villages, the
results arrived late."
</P>
<P>
"I affirm that the vote count was conducted in front of the
people and publicly. There is nothing to hide," he declared.
</P>
<P>
The CEC has not yet announced the final results of the
elections although five days have passed since the elections on
January 20.
</P>
<P>
Some candidates complained about fraud and irregularities in
the process of balloting and vote counting. At a press conference
here today, calls were issued for revoting in east Jerusalem and
Hebron without Israel' armed presence.

JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdul-Karim Kabariti today met with newly elected Palestinian
Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat in Gaza, signaling
improved relations between Jordan and the PA.
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit by a high-ranking Jordanian official
to the Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, who arrived in Gaza in a military helicopter,
carried a message of congratulations to Arafat on the successful
conclusion of the Palestinian elections which overwhelmingly
elected Arafat PA President.
</P>
<P>
Later, Arafat and Kabariti attended a ceremony formally
opening Jordan's representative office in Gaza, which has been
functioning for the past three months.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Kabariti told reporters that it was his honor
to congratulate Arafat on behalf of King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti also said that the opening of the representative
office will strengthen the relations between Jordan and the
Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and the Palestinian Authority were
strained following Jordan's peace treaty with Israel in
1994. Arafat criticized Jordan especially for what he described
as concessions to Israel on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ties have been significantly mended after Arafat was
invited to visit Jordan at the end of 1994.

CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A member of the newly-elected
Palestinian Council (PC) today called on the Palestinian Authority
to work seriously to upgrade infrastructure in the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Hakam Bala'awi told Egypt's Sawt Al Arab (Voice of Arabs) Radio

deterioration as a result of the Israeli occupation.

through negotiations and achieve a comprehensive development in
all fields on the Palestinian lands.

In the first Palestinian elections held last Saturday, PLO
chief Yasser Arafat was elected president of the Palestinian
Authority. An 88-member legislative council was also selected.

<HEADLINE> Radical Palestinian Faction Leader to Return to Autonomous Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A leader of a radical
Palestinian faction said today that he is ready to return to the
Palestinian autonomous areas in the near future, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Naif Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), was speaking to Israeli media from
the Syrian capital of Damascus where he now lives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dr. Muhammad Jadala from Jerusalem, a leading DFLP
activist who keeps regular contacts with Hawatmeh, told the radio
that Hawatmeh will be coming shortly along with 100 other DFLP
activists who are members of the Palestinian National Council
(PNC).
</P>
<P>
"I think (Israeli Prime Minister Shimon) Peres is serious in
his invitation. I think Hawatmeh has replied positively and is
coming back," said Jadala.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is up to Peres and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat to decide on the exact
date when Hawatmeh could come back.
</P>
<P>
The latest development followed a declaration by Peres that
all the PNC members can return to the Palestinian autonomous
areas without precondition to participate in a PNC session to
amend clauses in the Palestinian covenant which call for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
However, it remains unclear whether the DFLP leaders will
support moves to amend the clauses.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh founded the DFLP in 1969 when he split from the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), another
radical Palestinian faction, headed by George Habash.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli reports, since then, DFLP activists have
carried out some of the bloodiest attacks against Israeli
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Support for the DFLP in the Palestinian autonomy is reportedly
less than two percent.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, the organization suffered a serious setback
when moderates led by Yasser Abed-Rabbo broke away from the group
to form another organization, the FIDA party, which is close to
Fatah, the mainstream of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), and supports the Oslo peace agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP and the PFLP opposed the peace agreement between the
PLO and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Child Abuses On Rise In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Child abuses are going rampant
in Zimbabwe with the country's criminal courts handling a
"frightening number" of cases of incest and child rape.
</P>
<P>
Once considered taboo in the southern African nation of a
population of 10.5 million, incest and rape of minors are
becoming "so serious" that a "moral decay" has already taken form
in the country, according to the local news agency.
</P>
<P>
The local media are reporting a daily two cases of child rape
and psycho-analysts say there are some more going unreported.
</P>
<P>
Police authority said in the last two years, 1,099 rape cases
were reported in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, nearly half of
which were against young girls under the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri has already
suggested life jail sentences for child rapists.

<HEADLINE> UK,Ireland Rift Over Ulster Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A hot dispute appeared today
between Britain and Ireland over the notion that elections be held
in Ulster advocated by British Prime Minister John Major,
according to a BBC TV report this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Major raised this notion on Wednesday as an alternative to the
report compiled by the international commission in charge of arms
decommissioning process in Northern Ireland which suggests that
the twin-track approach to the installed peace process be carried
out simultaneously, namely, some arms decommissioning be
considered during all-party negotiations on the future of the
conflict-torn province.
</P>
<P>
Major called for an elected body in Ulster as a stepping stone
to all-party talks and at the same time he still insisted the
Irish Republican Army must start decommission its weapons before
its political wing Sinn Fein can be admitted to all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
He conceded that his idea would be regarded by some people as a
"distraction".
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said today that elections in
Northern Ireland were no more than an idea, but they were a bad
idea, having been rejected by the Catholic nationalist parties.
This idea was +divisive+, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that every party had a right not to be put in a
corner, a right not to be set an impossible political test.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreing Minister Dick Spring is also seeking urgent talks
with Britain's Ulster Secretary Patrick Mayhew to discuss the rift
between the two governments over the elections in the province.
</P>
<P>
He said his government's efforts to persuade Sinn Fein to back
the international commission's report had been impaired by the
assertive way Major had embraced Protestant unionist calls for an
elected body in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But Downing Street denied that there was a rift between the two
governments over this matter, claiming that Dublin had known the
substance of Major's idea before his address in parliament on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mayhew strongly defended Major's idea, saying that
the prime minister was not trying to impose a solution in Ulster
and he only appealed for new thinking.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Touches All-Time Low Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee breached the
key resistance barrier of 36 dollars and nose-dived to an all-time
low of 36.02/10 rupees against the U.S. dollar at the close of
interbank foreign exchange market in Mumbai (Bombay) today.
</P>
<P>
Rupee-dollar trade was very volatile and erratic. The
buyer-seller spread fairly wide due to the frenzied dollar buying
by corporates and importers resulting in the fall of the rupee's
value.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s timely intervention since the
past two months had managed to cool the market of the overactive
volatility and keep the rupee well within the 36-rupee per dollar
mark.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank's limited dollar selling today could not
fully contain the slide of the Indian currency due to surging
demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers believed that since the rupee has pierced through the
36- rupee per dollar psychological mark, the next testing barrier
would be 36.50 rupees in the near future as month-end demand for
the dollar still persists amidst acute shortage of local
suppliers.

Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first cabinet reshuffle since Chretien took office
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet is replaced by Human Resources
Minister Lloyd Axworthy and International Trade Minister Roy
MacLaren by Treasury Board President Arthur Eagleton.
</P>
<P>
Ouellet and MacLaren had both decided to retire at the end of
the current parliament. Ouellet has served in the parliament for
29 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chretien revealed that Ouellet will become chair of
the Canada Post Corporation and MacLaren a High Commissioner
(ambassador) to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Canadian Heritage Michel Dupuy, and Secretary of
State for Multiculturalism and the Status of Women, Sheila
Finestone, are also removed from their posts.
</P>

of central Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin has already left office and will
become Premier of Newfoundland.
</P>

becomes environment minister, and Intergovernmental Minister
Marcel Masse takes over the Treasury Board.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said with three Quebeckers leaving the cabinet,
Chretien will bring a number of new faces from Quebec into the
government, partly in a bid to strengthen his fight against Quebec
separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is clear: to renew the Canadian federation and
ensure the unity of our country," Chretien said when announcing
the changes.

<HEADLINE> US TRW Sales Surpass $10 Billion in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- TRW Inc., one of the biggest
automotive and space and defense companies in the United States,
achieved a 34 percent increase in earnings by selling more than
10.2 billion U.S. dollars of products in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the company's achievement, Joseph T. Gorman, TRW
chairman and chief executive officer, said today that 1995 sales
exceeded the 10 billion dollars mark for the first time in the
company's 95-year history. "Sales, earnings, and earnings per
share all reached record levels."
</P>
<P>
According to his report, total sales in 1995 grew 12 percent to
10.2 billion dollars from the previous year's 9.1 billion dollars.
Earnings increased 34 percent to a record high of 446.2 million
dollars and fully diluted earnings per share rose 32 percent to
6.62 dollars. Also operating profit increased 19 percent to 886.2
million dollars in the year.
</P>
<P>
The company focuses its business on space and defense including
ballistic missile system, communications system, space and missile
tracking system, fingerprint identification, and battle command
applique program.
</P>
<P>
The company's space and defense new contract awards totaled 3.8
billion dollars in 1995, with an additional 1.8 billion dollars in
options, resulting in a record backlog of 4.9 billion dollars.
Space and defense sales grew in the year by 10 percent to 3.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, its production of air bag modules increased 29
percent to 12.4 million units sold and that of power rack and
pinion steering gears increased 12 percent to more than 9 million
units. Automotive sales increased 14 percent to a record 6.5
billion dollars and operating profit increased 28 percent to 607.2
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The company has already established broad international
relations in business. But Chairman Gorman said, "To pursue
growth and maintain global leadership positions, TRW continues
its aggressive international expansion."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the expansion will include new plant opening
in India and Mexico; new joint ventures in India, South Korea and
Turkey; recent acquisitions in Italy and South Africa; and new
initiatives in Argentina, China, France and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Central Somali Town Beletwein On Fire Pending Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- More than eight residential
houses in the central Somali town of Beletwein were set on fire
on Thursday under the threat of an attack by the troops of the
country's self-claimed president Mohamed Farah Aideed.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the houses belonged to the residents of Habar
Gidir clan, who were believed to be supporters of Aideed.
</P>
<P>
Militiamen of the rival Howadle clan, under the United Somali
Congress Peace Movement (USCPM), marched in the streets of
Beletwein and set the houses ablaze, vowing to defend their
town from General Aideed.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened amid reports that the troops loyal to
Aideed had captured the Tieglow district which is only 90 KM
southwest of Beletwein.
</P>
<P>
"They used tractors to destroy the wall surrounding the house
before setting them on fire," said Abdullahi Mohamed Arrale, one
of the elders of Habar Gidir clan.
</P>
<P>
"Their purpose is to eradicate the Habar Gidirs from the
region," said Chief Arrale, another member of the clan.
</P>
<P>
A former police officer, Major Mohamed Saleh Omar, also lost
his residence merely for being a Habar Gidir member.
</P>
<P>
The campaign for the complete eradication of Habar Gidir
residents from the region is continuing.
</P>
<P>
Radio North Mogadishu, controlled by another self-styled
Somali president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, is reporting a large militia
maneuver in Beletwein in preparation for a possible attack by the
supporters of South Mogadishu's government led by General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
All major roads leading to Beletwein have been blocked by the
Hawadle militiamen with land mines, sand dunes, trees and scarp
metals of old vehicles, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, living conditions in the region are deteriorating
with the lack of food, water and medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
Residents are severely affected by diseases including
tuberculosis, malaria and measles which, during the last few
weeks, have claimed the lives of more than 20 children under
five.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Hawadle clan, Abdi Osman Aden,
announced today that his clan militiamen will fight against
General Aideed before he comes into their town.
</P>
<P>
"We'll teach him good lessons if he attempts again to capture
Beletwein," he said.
</P>
<P>
General Mohamed Farah Aideed captured Hiran region in July
1994, overpowering the opponents and disarming 169 U.N. Zimbabwe
troops.
</P>
<P>
Aideed lost his grip on the region early last year with the
defection of his main financier, Osman Hassan Ali, withdrawing
support from the region.

<HEADLINE> WHO Suggests Destruction of Stocks of Smallpox Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Board of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Wednesday recommended the destruction of
the last remaining stocks of smallpox (variola) virus, which are
being held in Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Executive Board at its 97th session
held here from January 15 to 24, and was expected to be submitted to
the 49th World Health Assembly scheduled for May for adoption.
</P>
<P>
It is suggested in a resolution that the remaining stocks of
variola virus, including all whitepox viruses, clinical specimens and
all other materials containing infectious variola virus and viral
genomic DNA "be destroyed on 30 June 1999, after a decision has been
taken by the World health Assembly".
</P>
<P>
A WHO press release issued Thursday said that the move followed
recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopoxvirus Infections,
which also proposed WHO preservation of 500,000 doses of smallpox
vaccine and the maintenance of the vaccine seed virus (vaccinia virus
strain Lister Elstree).
</P>
<P>
The release added that WHO decision allows a moratorium of five and
a half years from the deadline of December 31, 1993 suggested by the
Committee, "with a view to taking aciton to achieve a broader
consensus."
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO release, the world health body made the
decision in order to prevent the escape of variola virus from
laboratories, which "would be a serious risk as an increasing
proportion of the population lacks immunity to smallpox",-- the
first disease ever to be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
The last stocks of smallpox virus have been kept for purposes of
scientific research and diagnosis of suspected smallpox at the Centres
for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, and the
Russian State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology, Koltsovo,
Novosibirsk Region, Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Global eridication of smallpox was declared on May 8, 1980, nearly
three years after the last known natural case was reported in Somalia
in October 1977. The success, one of the world's greatest public
health achievements, cost about 313 million U.S. dollars over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Less than 30 years ago, the endemic affected between 10 and 15
million people annually in 31 countries, of which nearly 2 million
died and millions survivors left disfigured or blinded for life.

Even Stewart Lee Leung-nang, president of the Hong Kong
Football Association (HKFA), found it difficult to sort out an
answer.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the HKFA had set up a special group for selecting
players for a Hong Kong league selection team. "We shall contact
all the sides, First Division teams or others for this purpose,"
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the large amount of related work to be done after,
I don't think we have much time left now for the selection," said
Veronica Chan, vice-president of the HKFA.
</P>
<P>
The hard nut for the HKFA to crack is last week's defiant move
by a rebel group, which meant most of Hong Kong First Division
clubs would not provide players for a Carlsberg Cup Hong Kong
team.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group, named the Association of Hong Kong
Professional Football Clubs (AHKPFC), consists of nine out of the
10 senior clubs. In an ultimatum-type statement, the clubs
demanded reforms in the power structure HKFA and management of
Hong Kong's professional soccer.
</P>
<P>
They claimed Hong Kong's football had been run by a "group of
amateurs", which they blamed for the sharp decline of Hong Kong
standard of play.
</P>
<P>
The HKFA Wednesday announced the selection of a team which will
represent Hong Kong in the Asian Cup Group Two qualifying
tournament which starts next Tuesday. This was, as experts here
believed, a result of compromises from the conflicting sides.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the AHKPFC claimed yesterday they had never
threatened to boycott the Asian Cup meet.
</P>
<P>
But they have decided to go against the sport's local governing
body in its efforts to co-host the Lunar New Year meet.
</P>
<P>
Although Chan, the HKFA vice-president, said she would not set
a deadline for the senior clubs to come up for talks with the
HKFA, there is a deadline for the two parties to reach an
agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Derek Currie, a representative of the sponsors, the Carlsberg
Brewery Hong Kong Ltd., said things had to be clarified one and a
half weeks before the tournament opens at the latest. That means
sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
Currie hinted that the organizers may have to back up from the
original plan if things go even worse. If a Hong Kong league
selection team failed to be set up for the Carlsberg Cup meet,
seeking one more foreign team might be the only way out.
</P>
<P>
He declined to clarify which country, in that case, the
sponsors are interested. "Perhaps a south American or a European
team," he replied.
</P>
<P>
"But up to now, we feel confident that the HKFA can solve the
problems with the senior clubs and everyone will come up for the
sake of Hong Kong football," he claimed.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Amir Confident of Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Amir of Kuwait Sheikh Jaber
al-Ahmed Al-Sabah expressed his confidence in the future of
Kuwait but asserted that the Kuwaiti people should remain united
in the face of any threat, the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Amir, in an exclusive interview with the London-based
Arabic-language Weekly Al Hawadeth to be published Friday, said
his confidence was based on faith in its people and support by
Arab brothers and friends.
</P>
<P>
The interview was conducted by the editor-in-chief of the
Magazine, Melhem Karam, at Bayan Palace in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Jaber in the interview praised the heroic people of
Kuwait on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the war of
liberation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed gratitude for all those who backed Kuwait in its
ordeal and its quest to restore democracy, sovereignty and
national pride.
</P>
<P>
The Amir said he was proud of the democratic achievements in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He denied allegations that the government was backing certain
candidates in the parliamentary elections with political and
financial support.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that internal security of Kuwait was stable.
</P>
<P>
The Amir said the security authorities would double efforts to
locate and confiscate unlicensed arms as part of efforts to avert
an increase in crimes.
</P>
<P>
On the experience of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the
Amir expressed confidence that the future of the GCC remained
promising. "Passing differences would not block the path of
brothers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Amir confirmed that Kuwait discovered earlier this year a
large quantity of first-degree light oil. "It is the first time we
find such kind of oil in Kuwait," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Amir stressed Kuwait stood firm against terrorism "like
all peoples of the world who condemn terrorism" and insisted that
"there is no terrorism in Kuwait of any form."
</P>
<P>
Asked his views about circulating reports regarding federation
proposals and the division of Iraq, he said he was opposed to the
Balkanization of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the recent visit to Kuwait of each of the British and French
defense ministers, he said "the relationship of Kuwait with the
two western countries is good, and we are keen on maintaining and
promoting it in the best interest of all."
</P>
<P>
The Amir affirmed that Europe has a prominent role to play and
"we ought to maintain good ties with Europe and benefit from the
good aspects of such a role."
</P>
<P>
On the emergence of peace in the Middle East, the Amir called
for preparedness to live with it, particularly through the
establishment of a common Arab market.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the U.S. attitude toward peace in the Middle
East, the Amir pointed out that the U.S. interests and objectives
are best served by peace, and is thus exerting efforts for its
early establishment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Car Makers Expanding Asian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Three major auto makers in the
United States are pouring more investment into Asia in a bid to
tap the world's fastest-growing car market, according to a report
in the "Wall Street Journal" today.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. said it will participate in investing 53
million U.S. dollars in two plants in Thailand to make
automotive components, it said.
</P>
<P>
One plant, a 30 million U.S. dollar wholly owned facility, will
produce plastic, electronic and electrical components. A second 23
million U.S. dollar plant will be jointly funded with a company
from the Republic of Korea to produce climate-control components.
</P>
<P>
Combined annual sales from the two plants in Thailand are
expected to reach 100 million U.S. dollars when they reach full
capacity in the year 2000, the paper quoted a manager from Ford as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chrysler Corp. said it is looking for potential
plants in the Philippines, while General Motors Corp. is nearing a
decision on where it will locate a massive assembly plant in South
Asia, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler has already set up assembly plants in Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that in October, China chose GM over
Ford for a 1 billion U.S. dollar car-making venture.
</P>
<P>
And in 1995, GM's Delphi Automotive Systems parts-making
unit has signed 10 joint-venture agreements in the Asia-Pacific
region, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
GM has two "kit" plants in Taiwan and Indonesia, which build
vehicles for domestic sale, as well as one plant in Australia,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Its China plants -- as well as its future Southeast Asia
plants -- will be full-fledged assembly facilities.
</P>
<P>
"Our stated goal is to get 10 percent market share in
Asia-Pacific," said GM spokesman Michael Meyerand.

<HEADLINE> Russian Miners Insist on Meeting Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 800 miners representing
all coal-producing regions in Russia, who resumed their picketing
of the Russian government building in Moscow this morning,
insisted on a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The miners, who were dissatisfied with the government's
policies on financing the coal industry, threatened to continue
picketing the government building in Moscow on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If our demands are not met," said Vitaly Budko, chairman of
the National Committee of the Independent Coal Miners' Trade
Union, "we shall start an all-Russian strike of miners on February
1."
</P>
<P>
In an address to the picketing miners earlier today, Budko
noted that two documents had been handed over to Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, including a statement by the trade union and
a decision taken at a meeting of trade union representatives.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that since the government showed its
unwillingless to tackle problems of financing the coal industry,
the miners insisted on direct talks with President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
However, the trade union leader said they have not received any
reply from the president's office so far.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Yarov, head of a government
commission on paying arrears to miners, told reporters on
Wednesday that the general budget financing of the coal industry
has been increased up to 10,000 billion roubles (about 2.13
billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the commission now is to draft measures on
paying arrears to miners by consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I sympathize with the miners for their demands, I understand
them, and we shall do our best to pay their wages in time," he
stated.
</P>
<P>
The protest is reported to be proceeding in an orderly manner,
except for the miners thudding their helmets against the fence of
the government building.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official on Responsibility of Elected Palestinian Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Hakam Balawi, member of the
central council of the Palestine Liberation Organization and
member of the elected Palestinian Council, has disclosed that the
Council's responsibility in the coming stage was both immense and
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast today by the Egyptian "Sawt al Arab"
(Voice of the Arabs) radio, the Palestinian official said that
Palestinian national action in the coming stage is two-fold. In
the first place, it has to put an end to occupation through
negotiations with the Israeli government, and, secondly, to work
hard and with perseverance for comprehensive, overall development
of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Balawi indicated that the Palestinian economic infrastructure
was facing real deterioration caused by years of occupation. It is
thus incumbent upon the elected Palestinian self-rule Authority to
struggle hard for the termination of occupation "through
negotiations," and, at the same time, to provide the Palestinian
people from Rafah at one end to Jenin at the other with the vital
services and utilities.
</P>
<P>
On the coming Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, Balawi said
that peace was not the making of one party alone, but that of the
two parties which had signed agreements to that end.
</P>
<P>
Balawi said that the Palestinian side is firmly committed
to those agreements, pointing out that it is up to the Israelis to
be fully aware that such commitment was the "more effective and
important" factor in the achievement of just and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Down in !995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Existing home sales in the
United States fell 3.2 percent in December, the third straight
decline, the National Association of Realtors reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that existing home sales totaled 3.91 million
units at a seasonally adjusted rate, down from 4.04 million units
in November. It was the lowest since sales totaled 3.80 million
units last June.
</P>
<P>
The Realtors attributed the drop in existing home sales to the
partial government shutdown that began December 16.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had attributed the 3.2 percent drop in existing home
sales to consumer concerns over slow job and income growth.
</P>
<P>
For 1995, existing home sales totaled 3.812 million units, down
3.4 percent from 3.946 million units in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Today's report was the latest signs of a weakening economy. The
Commerce Department reported Wednesday that new home sales had
sunk to a seven-month low in November.

JAKARTA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Timber Panel
Association (APKINDO) has pledged to boost exports of the product
despite reports of raw material shortage.
</P>
<P>
APKINDO Chairman Asmaning Tjipto Wigjoprajitno made a
prediction at a recent workshop that exports of timber panel were
expected to rise by seven percent from 3.99 billion U.S. dollars
in 1995 to 4.1 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The local press has said that several plywood industries were
facing difficulties due to raw material shortage. Some firms were
reportedly on the brink of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has an estimated forest area of 143 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The export volume of timber panel is projected to be slightly
lower in the first quarter of this year as many workers take days
off during the month of Ramadan.

at all levels to work hard to improve the united front work of the

the leadership of the Party, done a lot of work and had made many
achievements in multi-party cooperation and in the political
consultation, in promoting socialist democracy, in dealing with
ethnic and religious issues, and in maintaining national unity and
social stability, said Jiang who is also Communist Party General
Secretary.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee
and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, said: "The major task in the current united front work
is to unite all forces possible and bring the role of every
positive factor into full play to realize goals set in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the long-term target for the year
2010."

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls on International Community to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today called on the international community to fight terrorism and
trans-national crime.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking Egypt's Police Day, Mubarak commended the
Egyptian security forces for their efforts to fight the "evil
powers of terrorism and treason."
</P>
<P>
He said that the people have discovered the truth about
terrorist groups that hide under the cloak of Islam.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed certainty that the wave of terrorism in
Egypt will be put to an end "thanks to the sacrifices of the
police and the assistance and awareness of the people."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic fundamentalist militants have launched a campaign
since 1992 to topple the secular government and replace it with
strict Islamic rule. They have often targeted policemen,
Christians and Western tourists in their armed attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people, most of them policemen and militants, have
been killed.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak today awarded medals to the families of 20 policemen
who lost their lives "in security operations against terrorists,"
the Middle East News Agency (MENA) said.
</P>
<P>
The government's determined crackdown on militants has largely
reduced their attacks. Recently there has been only sporadic
clashes between policemen and militants in a few southern
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's tourism industry, which had suffered a slump since
1992, has been picking up greatly because of the better security
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Police Day marks the anniversary of a confrontation between
Egyptian police and British occupation forces in the city of
Ismailia on January 23, 1952.

<HEADLINE> A Far-reaching Significant Event (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is imperative to adhere to the principle of "taking
ourselves as the mainstay" so as to ensure the smooth transfer of
power and stable transition of Hong Kong in accordance with the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has said, "we should rely on ourselves to
maintain the smooth transition of Hong Kong and we have never put
our hopes on others for the prosperity of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the British side put many obstacles in the way
of the Hong Kong issue, but establishment of the PWC has helped
the Chinese side take the initiative. In the Preparatory
Committee's work, we must shoulder the responsibility. Only then
can the initiative be maintained.
</P>
<P>
"Catering to the people of Hong Kong and relying on them" is
another important principle of the Chinese government in dealing
with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The PWC's work over the past two years has shown that
increasing communications with the people of Hong Kong and
soliciting opinions from all walks of life there have helped us
suit our policies more to Hong Kong's actual conditions and win
the support of people there.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the Preparatory Committee itself shows the
Chinese government's resolve to have "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
As Premier Li Peng pointed out during his meeting with leading
citizens of Hong Kong, the Preparatory Committee was arrived at
through lengthy deliberation and consideration given to many
factors.
</P>
<P>
Of the Preparatory Committee's 150 members, ninety-four are
from Hong Kong. This number is well-above the no fewer than fifty
percent limit set at the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The members from Hong Kong include the very best from all walks
of life and provide a wide range of representation. They will
provide a wide range of opinion and help form the SAR government
in the interest of most Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
But, relying on the committee's 150 members alone is
insufficient. During the final and key period of forming the Hong
Kong SAR, a greater number of Hong Kong people will have a chance
to participate in the transition work.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side also hopes to co-operate with the British
side. Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's
visit to London last October, and British Foreign Secretary
Rifkind's visit to Beijing this year were both fruitful in giving
impetus to Sino-British co-operation. Much consensus and
understanding were reached.
</P>
<P>
The British Hong Kong government expressed its willingness to
co-operate with the Preparatory Committee. It is hoped that the
British Hong Kong government will sincerely co-operate with the
committee as it is in the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
In the upcoming preparatory work for the Hong Kong SAR,
adherence to the "one country, two systems" policy and the Basic
Law alone will help ensure that Hong Kong has a brighter
future.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Urged to Move Against Fertilizer  Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A member of Indonesia's lower
house of parliament today urged the government to take stiff legal
steps against fertilizer exporters.
</P>
<P>
Bachtizr Chamzah, a member of the House of Representative'
Commission for Agricultural Affairs, told the press here that
several businessmen are exporting fertilizers while there is
reportedly a shortage of the commodity now in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the businessmen were exporting their products for
higher profits at the expense of farmers who have cried out for
fertilizers in the market.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer shortage has already impaired the rice
self-sufficiency program of the government.
</P>
<P>
Although government officials have repeatedly stated that the
country had sufficient fertilizers in stock, farmers were
complaining about the deficiency of fertilizer in the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
The government should take legal actions against those
fertilizer exporters who put their own interests before those of
the whole country, he said.

With the establishment of the Preparatory Committee, a series
of programs relating to the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region will be launched.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), the Preparatory Committee is an institution of
authority empowered by the NPC, whose main task is preparing for
the first government, legislative council, and judiciary of the
Hong Kong SAR in accordance with the Basic Law and relevant
decisions of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive is expected to be elected in the latter
half of this year, after which major officials of the SAR
government will be nominated by him and appointed by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Preparatory Committee will study the forty-six
suggestions put forth by the PWC, and make final decisions on
them, while preparing for the unofficial celebration ceremony when
Hong Kong is returned in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Although the transfer of power and preparatory work for the SAR
involve quite a lot of issues on politics, economy, the law,
culture, etc, the guidelines and policies of the Chinese
government are to be firmly observed.
</P>
<P>
"One country, two systems" is in no way a mere expedient, but a
fundamental way to deal with the Hong Kong question made by the
Chinese government, and a basic guideline for reunification.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the
stipulation of the Basic Law and the development of the PWC's
work, the "one country, two systems" policy has provided a solid
foundation.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee will shoulder its historic
responsibility and follow the guidelines and policies of "one
country, two systems" in practical work on Hong Kong's return.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Trade Hits Record High in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Total merchandise trade between
Japan and China in 1995 hit a record 57.85 billion U.S. dollars,
up 25.1 percent from the previous year, the Japan External Trade
Organization (JETRO) said today.
</P>
<P>
JETRO predicted that the bilateral trade will continue to
increase in 1996 to around 70 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade deficit with China, meanwhile, also hit a record
high of 13.99 billion dollars, topping the threshold of 10 billion
dollars for the first time, JETRO said.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume for 1995, calculated on the basis of the
Japanese Finance Ministry's customs-cleared trade data, marked a
record for the fifth consecutive year, the governmental
organization said.
</P>
<P>
The customs clearance basis means that freight and insurance
charges are included in imports from China. This tends to
overstate China's exports to Japan, compared with the more
commonly used method of balance-of-payments calculation.
</P>
<P>
JETRO said Japan's trade deficit with China was much higher
than with any other countries or regions. Its previous biggest
deficit of 8.9 billion dollars was also registered with China in
the year before, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said imports from China in 1995 rose 30.3 percent to 35.92
billion dollars, while exports to the country increased 17.4
percent to 21.93 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Syria Denies Involvement in Seized Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian embassy in ankara today
denied Turkey's accusation of trying to help rebel Kurds transfer
arms and ammunition, saying the claims were "unfair and out of
fabrication."
</P>
<P>
In a written statement faxed to Xinhua, the Syrian embassy
pointed out the six truckloads of arms and ammunition seized in
southeastern Turkey last week had nothing to do with syria.
</P>
<P>
"As described in the press, the trucks were of Turkish plates,
their drivers were Turks and the transportation company was
Turkish. The trucks came from Iran and were seized in Turkey on
their way to Lebanon. So what's the responsibility of syria here?"
the statement asked.
</P>
<P>
The embassy said the aim behind such a claim against Syria is
"to sabotage the cooperation and friendly relations between the
two neighboring states."
</P>
<P>
Syria's denial came one day after Turkish Interior Minister
Teoman Unusan told local journalists that he believed Syria was
behind the transfer of the seized arms and ammunition, apparently
for the separatist Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) based in Syria or
Syria-controlled part of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey's accusation seemed to fall short of supporting
conclusive evidence.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Ankara and Damascus have gone sour due to
the issue of water and PKK.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has for a long time accused Syria of "supporting
terrorism" by sheltering PKK guerrillas. But Syria has always
denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> Australia Makes Breakthrough in Children Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian researchers have
made a breakthrough in curing neuroblastoma, one of the most
deadly children cancers, doctors announced in Sydney today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers led by Murray Norris at the Children's Leukemia and
Cancer Research Center of the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney
said that a particular type of gene is responsible for drug
resistance of neuroblastoma, a kind of nerve cancer.
</P>
<P>
Norris said that when the levels of this Multi-Drug Resistance
Protein (MRP) produced by the gene were high in patients, the
cancer did not respond to conventional anti-cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are carrying out a larger-scale study to confirm
the role of the MRP gene in drug resistance of cancers. They will
develop a chemical compound that blocks the action of this gene in
resistance of conventional drugs.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Haber of the hospital told a press conference today
that two-thirds of children who get neuroblastoma in Australia
each year had the excess MRP gene and might be saved by the
gene-reversing drug.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough has "major direct implications for the
treatment of this childhood cancer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Neuroblastoma is one of the most common children cancers and
accounts for 15 percent of all childhood cancer deaths. While
conventional drugs are successful in treating other childhood
cancers, they often do not work on neuroblastoma.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Congressional Republicans said Wednesday that they would
abandon the national debt as a weapon against President Clinton if
he would support modest budget and tax cuts as a "down payment" on
a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
-- As the battle to gain control of the House in November
election begins, Democrats are showing surprising strength, even
though Republicans still have an advantage in obtaining money and
recruiting candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders
Wednesday agreed to put aside their broad differences over the
budget and work on a limited agenda of spending cuts and tax
credits to end their long standoff.
</P>
<P>
-- The Food and Drug Administration yesterday approved olestra,
a controversial product that tastes like fat but doesn't make
people fat, for use in snack foods.
</P>
<P>
-- The seven fired White House travel office employees accused
the Clinton administration on Wednesday of abusing its power when
it dismissed them nearly three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Mattel, the world's biggest toy maker, made an unsolicited
5.2-billion-dollar bid to take over Hasbro, the no.2 toy company.

anti-trust obstacles would be too great.

<P>
PARIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- France supports Russia's bid for
membership of the Council of Europe, French Foreign Minister Herve
de Charette said today.
</P>
<P>
He told France Inter radio, "Most European nations want Russian
membership to be approved by the European parliament. That is the
position of France."
</P>
<P>
The European parliament was scheduled to vote later today on
Russia's 1992 membership application, which was frozen last year
for seven months because of Moscow's military campaign in the
breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
To become a member of the 38-nation Council of Europe based in
Strasbourg, France, Russia will have to win a two-third majority
of vote in the European parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome is uncertain. ... But I believe it is preferable
to let Russia sit at the table so that we can talk among
ourselves," de Charette said.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Europe was established in 1949 by Britain,
France and Italy, and its main aim is to promote human rights,
democracy and common culture in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Some eastern European countries, including Poland, the Czech
Republic, Bulgaria and Romania are already members.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Drop in Hong Kong Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents claimed a
total of 261 lives in Hong Kong in 1995, when the number of fatal
and serious cases dropped to a 31-year low.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the figures of 1994, deadly traffic accidents
recorded a welcome decrease of 12.5 percent last year to 246
cases, while serious-injury accidents fell slightly by 1.2 percent
to 3,240 cases, according to Cheung Chi-shum, chief
superintendent of Hong Kong Police Traffic Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The overall traffic accidents scaled down 4.2 percent to around
14,800 cases.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on 1995's traffic accident and
casualty statistics in the territory, Cheung said that traffic
fatalities remained a subject of concern despite a 12.7-percent
fall from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Of all the victims, 61.3 percent or 160 were pedestrians, while
drivers, motorcyclists and passengers only accounted for the rest
38.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The chief officer urged people to take necessary steps to
minimize their exposure to risk by using pedestrian facilities,
such as underpasses, footbridges, zebra and controlled crossings,
whenever and wherever they are available.
</P>
<P>
Taxi malpractice has continued to arouse public attention,
said the chief superintendent. There were 2,956 public complaints
against taxi offenses in 1995, up slightly over 1994; and
prosecutions instituted against taxi drivers went up as well, to
more than 7,800.

Bacterial leaf blight is one of the major diseases that damage
rice production, reducing it by as much as 20 percent on
average. In some places, the damage can go as high as 40 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
China has up to 10 billion yuan in economic losses annually

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU Reconciled To Nigeria's Transition Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 25 (Xinhua) --The 15-member European Union
have accepted Nigeria's three-year transition-to-civil rule
program in a sudden change from its former demand that the
period be shortened.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the European Union (EU) ambassadors in
Nigeria, Umberto Plaja, made the overture in a memorandum
presented to the Nigerian federal government in Nigerian capital
Abuja on January 23.
</P>
<P>
The submission of the memorandum demonstrated the deep interest
the EU have in the affairs of Nigeria and conflict resolution in
Africa, said the EU envoy.
</P>
<P>
Plaja, the Italian ambassador to Nigeria, disclosed that the
EU had accepted Nigeria's three-year transition program announced
by the head of state General Sani Abacha last October.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the memorandum, details of which have not yet made
known, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi expressed optimism
that impediments on the way of meaningful dialogus between the EU
and Nigeria would soon be removed, to pave the way for better
understanding of the political situation in the west African
nation.
</P>
<P>
Plaji, who held a closed-door meeting with Ikimi earlier as
the representative of the EU, said that the EU member countries
were "keen to stay in touch" and observe the democratization in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
People also notice that the 15-nation EU are the second
largest market for the Nigerian crude oil after the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The new position taken by the EU is believed to be another
major gesture for the improvement of relations between EU and
Nigeria following the earlier returning to Nigeria of most EU
ambassadors recalled for home consultations.
</P>
<P>
The consultations came after Britain, which as a member of the
Commonwealth, spearheaded the move to suspend Nigeria from the
world body as a reaction to the hanging of nine Ogoni activists
on November 10, 1995, for murder in south Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The execution triggered off strong voices from the
Commonwealth and the EU for the reduction of Nigeria's transition
program from three years to two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU announced a string of sanctions against
Nigeria, including the banning of arm sales, the denial of visas,
sports boycott and the recalling of the EU military attaches and
envoys.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the comeback of the EU ambassadors to Nigeria,
Ikimi expressed the hope that it would create a useful
opportunity for dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi also repeated Nigeria's long held position that the
decision to impose sanctions on Nigeria was based on distorted
information.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the EU for a review of sanctions against
Nigeria, saying that dialogue was the "way out of the present
diplomatic row".

<HEADLINE> UK Non-EU Trade Deficit Reaches 7.5 Billion Pounds in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain recorded its biggest
ever trade deficit with countries outside the European Union (EU)
last year, as imports expanded 25 percent faster than exports
between 1994 and 1995, official figures showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Statistical Office (CSO), Britain's
overall non-EU trade gap soared by 2.4 billion pounds (3.6 billion
U.S. dollars) to 7.5 billion pounds (11.3 billion US dollars) last
year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest-ever deficit with North America, at more than 1.8
billion pounds (2.7 billion dollars), lay behind the weaker non-EU
trade performance.
</P>
<P>
Imports of intermediate goods such as microchips and electronic
components surged, and there were also unusually high imports of
silver in the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
The overall gap widened to 613 million pounds (900 million
dollars) in December from 436 million pounds (600 million dollars)
the previous month, reflecting a 3 percent rise in imports and
static exports.
</P>
<P>
However, taking the latest three months compared with the
previous three, a comparison thought to be a more accurate
reflection of trend, the deficit narrowed to 2.17 billion pounds
(3.26 billion dollars) from 2.55 billion pounds (3.83 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both exports and imports were up about 2.5 percent over the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The CSO, while acknowledging that trade data has been
particularly erratic in recent months, said that the overall trend
appears to be improving. For example, economists noted, December's
deficit was well below recent highs such as October's 1.1 billion
pounds (1.65 billion dollars).

SHANGHAI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- One of China's major
international co-operative research project, the Asia-Pacific
Space and Geodynamics (APSG) program, will start in May here.
</P>
<P>
The program involves the study of astronomy, geology, space
geodetic survey, and geophysics and will not only be of great
importance in the study of the earth's movement, but will also be
important for the study of the movement of some parts of the earth
for earthquake and volcano research and sea and continental
deposits.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region is densely populated, is rich in
natural resources, and has rapid economic development. At the same
time, the area is susceptible to natural disasters due to its
complex geological structure and abrupt geological movement. It is
hit frequently by volcanic eruptions, oceanic forces, and
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Observatory, the program has got
wide support from scientists in other countries. Australia, Japan,
ROK, Russia, Britain, Germany, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, and
other countries and regions have expressed their intention to
participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
The International Association for Geodetic Surveys has passed a
resolution to support the program, which is expected to begin in
May this year, when participating experts will convene the first
meeting on implementing the program.

SEOUL, January 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea planned to launch a
new law early this year to attract more foreign investment, Deputy
Prime Minister Rha Woong-bae said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the current Foreign Capital Inducement Law, which was
formulated in the early 1960s, should be adapted to the changing

minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the planned new law will allow foreign firms to invest
in almost all the fields in South Korea, but some strategic and
sensitive industries such as the information-telecommunications
and power generation sectors will remain off-limits to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
South Korean government has been trying to improve its foreign

<HEADLINE> Release of Suspects to Harm Cooperation: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Macao's release of two criminal
suspects wanted by public security organs in China's mainland will
harm the judicial cooperation between the mainland and Macao, a
senior Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Zong Guangyao, vice-director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao
Branch, said that the release of the two criminal suspects has
"matter-of-factly" made Macao a "port of refuge" for criminals.
</P>
<P>
"Legal organs in China's mainland have been in good cooperation
with their counterparts in Macao, but the release of the two by
the Macao court has harmed the cooperation," said Zong.
</P>
<P>
"It is not helpful to the joint crackdown on criminal
activities and to the social security and stability of Macao," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Yang Woliang, a Hong Kong passport holder, was suspected of
murdering his former girlfriend surnamed Zhang in Guangdong
province. China's public security organs asked Interpol for help
to arrest him. Yang was caught in Macao in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect, Li Zhenhua, who was charged with drug
trafficking, was also caught in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Zong said that China has been cooperative with the Portuguese
side in the repatriation of criminals, and has promised that no
death penalty or lifelong imprisonment will be meted out for the
two.
</P>
<P>
"The Macao court's final verdict of not handing over the two to
China's mainland is beyond understanding given the above
conditions," Zong stressed.
</P>
<P>
Under the Chinese law, China has judicial rights over the two
cases as their victims and places of crime were all within China's
territory.

<P>
"China's judicial organs reserve the right of prosecution," he
said.

Meanwhile, major local newspapers in Macao criticized the

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Any Arms Sale to Taiwan: Spokesman Ed: Repeat with Corrections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China is strongly against any
country selling weapons to Taiwan or cooperating with it to
produce weapons in any form, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chen Jian
said here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the statement at a press conference when asked to
comment on a report that Taiwan authorities have recently asked
the US to increase its arms sale to the island.
</P>
<P>
The move taken by Taiwan authorities to increase its military
spending and purchase new weapons is nothing but to create and
increase tensions across the Taiwan Straits, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Such actions will, undoubtedly, do nothing but impose new and
more serious obstacles to the reunification of the motherland, to
which "we are strongly opposed," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Chen went on to say that on one hand Taiwan authorities are
saying they would improve the relations between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits and, on the other hand, they have been going
all out to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", which
shows that the Taiwan authorities are keeping to the erroneous
position of attempting to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever means the Taiwan authorities take will not change the
fact that Taiwan is a part of China, nor can it shake our
determination to achieve the reunification of the motherland," the
spokesman said.

ROME, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Three women's World Cup Alpine
skiing races are rescheduled for Val d'Isere, next week, Michel

February 4. The program had to be rescheduled because of lack of
snow at the Swiss resort.

However, the busy World Cup schedule, planned at Sestriere for
Friday and Saturday, is now threatened by recent heavy snowfall.
</P>
<P>
Organisers are hoping to move a Friday's women's downhill to
Saturday, so is the men's downhill to Sunday. The final decision
will be announced later.

HONG KONG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A government survey shows
that most Hong Kong people disapprove of homosexuals and bisexuals
and would keep distance from them, according to local media
reports today.
</P>
<P>
The survey released on Wednesday showed a homosexual/bisexual
acceptable level of only 3.4 on a rating scale of 0 (totally
unacceptable) to 10 (totally acceptable).
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 69 percent of respondents said they
would not hire gay domestic helpers, 72 percent would not share a
flat with a homosexual or bisexual and 74 percent would not sublet
a room.
</P>
<P>
The survey found "acceptance" of homosexuals or bisexuals was
higher among younger people and single people.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Secretary Suen Ming-yeung said that the survey was
intended to give the public a snapshot of existing attitudes
toward homosexuals or bisexuals in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Another survey conducted by a university lecturer, which
coincided with the government survey, showed that homosexuality is
much more prevalent in Hong Kong than previously assumed.
</P>
<P>
The study conducted among 1,000 people in a random sample
concludes that 3.9 percent of them are lesbians, bisexuals or gay
men, compared with results of overseas research which put the gay
population at about two percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> Deaths of Rare Porpoises in HK Waters Alarm Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A sudden increase in deaths
of rare porpoises in the waters of Hong Kong has alarmed local
researchers, according to a report in today's "Eastern Express".
</P>
<P>
The report said that a surge in the number of finless porpoises
washed up dead has raised fears of a deadly virus devastating Hong
Kong's porpoise populations.
</P>
<P>
The endangered finless porpoises are washed up dead at the rate
of one every four days. So far this month six have been stranded,
compared with seven known dead for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said little is known about the jet-black meter-long
finless porpoise which inhabits the waters off Hong Kong. Unlike
the Chinese white dolphin, now the focus of research, the finless
porpoise has never been studied.
</P>
<P>
Local researchers did not rule out a deadly contagious virus,
the morbillivirus, which was blamed for mass dolphin deaths in the
Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Samples of brain tissue from finless porpoises will be tested
for morbillivirus, which attacks the immune system. Researchers
will also be examining other possible causes of death including
heavy metal poisoning, collision with vessels and entanglement in
fishing nets.

<HEADLINE> Value-Added Tax Increases Manila's Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
been able to increase its revenue collection from the value-added
tax (VAT).
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Finance (DOF), the collection of
the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) amounted to 25.316 billion
pesos (1.01 billion US dollars) as of end-October, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The figure exceeded by 4.066 billion pesos (160.24 million US
dollars) its target VAT collection of 21.250 billion pesos (850
million US dollars) for the period.
</P>
<P>
The BIR's strong performance has, thus, given the DOF hope that
the target fiscal surplus of 15.5 billion pesos (620 million US
dollars) for 1995 would still be attained provided the BIR
continues performing well.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo announced that
the preliminary fiscal surplus for the whole of 1995 was 12
billion pesos (480 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The BIR target collection for the whole of 1995 is 222.06
billion pesos (8.882 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> S. Koreans to Expand Trade with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Major South Korean business
groups plan to increase the volume of processing-on-commission
(POC) trade with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
industry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Business Group has decided to get 25 million
U.S. dollars worth of garments processed in the DPRK, a 25 percent
increase from that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Samsung will also push ahead with its plan to produce audio
speakers through its DPRK venture this year.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo Business Group plans to increase its POC volume by 10
percent to 20 million U.S. dollars and add jackets, pants and
other garments to the production lines.
</P>
<P>
LG Business Group has set its target at 10 million
U.S. dollars. It plans to begin a television and related
component POC venture by using idle production facilities in the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Kohap Business Group seeks to double its POC trade in garments
and textile products to 12 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
POC ventures in the DPRK have proven to be lucrative thanks to
the low wages and good workmanship there, an industry source said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korea-DPRK POC trade, which began in 1991, registered
26 million U.S. dollars last year, 56.9 percent up from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Items handled in the trade, which in the past consisted mainly
of clothes and footwear, expanded to include color TV sets and
loud speakers.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers to Be Arrested for Kwangju Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Three incumbent members of the
South Korean National Assembly, who were allegedly involved in the
Kwangju Massacre, will be arrested within this week, a prosecution
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The massacre took place on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju, capital of
South Cholla province, when some 150 people were killed and 2,000
others injured in the suppression of a pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
The three lawmakers are Hur Sam-soo, personnel director of the
Defense Security Command (DSC) at the time of the crackdown, Hur
Hwa-pyung, then chief secretary for Defense Security Commander
Chun Doo-hwan, and Chun Ho-yong, then Special Warfare Forces
Commander.
</P>
<P>
"Since the current parliamentary session is scheduled to close
on January 28, we plan to conclude legal actions against those
lawmakers who are suspected to have played a key role in the
suppression of the Kwangju uprising," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Former South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo,
who were arrested on November 16 and December 3 last year
respectively, were indicted on January 23 on charges of leading
the military crackdown on the Kwangju uprising.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six key aides of Chun, including former
anti-espionage chief of the DSC Lee Hak-bong and former Third Army
Commander Yoo Hak-seong, were also indicted on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh were also indicted on charges of accepting bribes
and masterminding the military mutiny on December 12, 1979.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the army strongman after the 1979
military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the
nation until February 1988.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by Roh, who gave way in February 1993 to Kim
Young-sam, the first civilian president in South Korea in more
than 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: APEC Free Zone to Boost Region's Incomes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a free-trade
zone stretching across the Asia-Pacific is expected to boost total
incomes of regional economies by 3.8 percent or 745 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by officials of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Forum, concrete gains from the region-wide
trade liberalization will amount to more than the combined size of
the Australian and South Korean economies.
</P>
<P>
"All APEC economies will benefit from trade liberalization and
facilitation, with developing economies generally benefiting the
most," a brief paper prepared by Australia said.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive liberalization in trade of goods alone would
jack up the region's aggregate income by 175 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Free flow of services is estimated to add another 128 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trade facilitation, to be achieved through
harmonized product standards and streamlined customs operations,
is expected to boost regional income by another 2.2 percent or 442
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The APEC free-trade zone, which includes developing economies
of Southeast Asia and Developed economies such as Japan and the
US., accounts for over half of the world's gross domestic product
and slightly less than half of world trade turnover.
</P>
<P>
Rapid export growth, and vigorous inflows of foreign direct
investments, have been cited for the strong growth experienced by
APEC economies in the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Exports to China Up to 8 Billion by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia expects that its
exports to China, a growing market for Australia, could reach 8
billion Australian dollars (5.92 billion US dollars) by the turn
of the century.
</P>
<P>
The projection was contained in a speech delivered by Trade
Minister Bob McMullan in Perth, capital of Western Australia,

<P>
"We sometimes fail to take into account that China's economy
and society is being reshaped at an astonishing pace," the
Australian Associated Press quoted the Minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"China is moving steadily up the technological ladder and our
exports profile will need to match that development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Australia's exports to China stood at 3 billion Australian
dollars (2.22 billion US dollars) at present.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the importance of exporting industrial raw
materials, Australia has also eyed on China's markets of

<P>
"Capturing an increasing share of China's market for
sophisticated manufactured products and services is one of our key
priorities in our bilateral strategy," McMullan said.

<P>
He also pointed out that there were opportunities in China for
other areas such as the agro-business, telecommunications,
building, materials, packaging technologies, environmental
technology, energy, automotive parts, roads and marine systems.

<HEADLINE> China in Apposition to Any Arm Sales to Taiwan: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China is strongly against any
country selling weapons to Taiwan or cooperating with it to
produce weapons in any form, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chen Jian
said here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the statement at a press conference when asked to
comment on a report that Taiwan authorities have recently asked
the US to increase its arm sales to the island.
</P>
<P>
The move taken by Taiwan authorities to increase its military
spending and purchase new weapons is nothing but to create and
increase tensions across the Taiwan straits, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Such actions will, undoubtedly, do nothing but impose new and
more serious obstacles to the reunification of the motherland, to
which "we are strongly opposed," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Chen went on to say that on one hand Taiwan authorities are
saying they would improve the relations between the two sides and,
on the other hand, they have been going all out to create "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", which shows that the Taiwan
authorities are keeping to the erroneous position of attempting to
split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever means the Taiwan authorities take will not change the
fact that Taiwan is a part of China, nor can it shake our
determination to achieve the reunification of the motherland," the
spokesman said.

GUANGZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province is stepping up the creation of some new channels to
supply video tapes for its citizens after the closure of laser
disc (LD) salons.
</P>
<P>
These channels will distribute authorized video products of
China-made feature films, according to Li Lanfang, deputy governor

</P>
<P>
The official said that there are 12 million migrants in the
coastal province, who are mainly job-seeking farmers from inland
provinces, and their recreational activities should be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong was once regarded as a paradise for copyright
violators, with more than 1,000 LD and compact disc (CD) salons in
this provincial capital, accounting one fifth of the total number
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Most of these salons had bad reputations for showing pirated
LDs or CDs, and many of the viewers were migrants working in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The province closed salons after the government issued a
circular at the end of last year banning the commercial showing of
LDs and CDs.

<HEADLINE> Publications for Children Flourishing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Cartoon characters are helping
a booming industry for books aimed at children in China. And the
flourishing industry is providing work for thousands of people
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The number of publishing houses producing publications for
children has grown to 29, employing 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Just a decade ago there were only two such publishing houses
employing 300 workers.
</P>
<P>
But latest figures show that more than 3,000 varieties of
publications -- a total of 130 million volumes of children's books
-- were produced in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A large number of children's publications with moral education
contents have been produced in recent years.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 million copies of one book, The "New Three
Characters Advices" have been published by the Guangdong Education
Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
Children's publications such as "Motherland in My Heart",
"Guard Our Motherland" and "One Hundred Thousand Why" have
frequently hit the popular reading lists in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The latest focus has been shifted to the cartoon publications.
President Jiang Zemin recently praised the Shanghai Animation Film
Studio for its efforts to produce a cartoon series based on the
deeds of famous young heroes in China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
"A group of cartoon reading materials with both national
characteristics and rich contents have been worked out since the
Chinese Cartoon project was launched several months ago," said Yu
Hong, director of the cartoon editing department of the Beijing
Children Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
There are 380 million children in China, accounting for
one-third of China's total population. In a recent letter to east
China's Zhejiang People's Fine Arts Publishing House, Premier Li
Peng encouraged book publishers, writers and other literary
workers to help the younger generation to study hard and prepare
to serve their country by creating more good literature for them.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Bring Home Wounded Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 25 (Xinhua) -- An Italian Airforce transport
plane took off from the international airport here early this
morning for Sarajevo to bring wounded Italian soldiers back for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
A blast rocked a NATO compound in Sarajevo last night, killing
three and injuring seven soldiers.
</P>
<P>
One of the killed and six of the injured are Italian
soldiers. The rest of the casualties are believed to be Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
As conditions are poor in the hospital near Sarajevo in which
the victims are being treated, Italy decided to bring the injured
Italian soldiers home for better treatment.
</P>
<P>
The blast was the first major incident involving Italian troops
on the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The compound, which is in the Zetra stadium complex, is used by
an Italian logistics battalion.

<P>
In the course of promoting socialist ethics, traffic policemen
across the country have taken on a new look while directing
traffic and performing their duties by making clear and standard
manual signs.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in late 1995 in Benxi, in northeast China's
Liaoning Province, showed that the public security bureau ranked
first in public confidence among the city's 24 law-enforcement
departments.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of cities in China have emerged in the
vanguard of China's drive to promote cultural and ideological
progress in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiagang, a city in east China's Jiangsu Province, has
risen from a small unknown town to a become modern and clean city
due to the local government's efforts to promote its cultural and
educational undertakings, while achieving rapid economic
development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The city has introduced a whole range of systems to make sure
that government officials are honest with their duties and that
citizens abide by laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, a coastal city in Liaoning Province, has built
facilities such as squares with musical fountains and pigeons, and

<P>
In Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, a campaign
is under way to promote the use of polite terms.
</P>
<P>
People in Shanghai, the largest city in China, have been
organized to discuss self-improvement. The fine virtues of aiding
the poor and the needy, respecting the elderly, loving the young
and daring to fight criminals are being carried forward.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin has emphasized that under no
circumstances should economic growth be achieved at the expense of
socialist culture and ideology.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Promoting Cultural Progress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Over the past few years China
has been promoting cultural and ideological progress by
publicizing the exemplary deeds of model figures among both
officials and the general public.
</P>
<P>
The two latest paragons are Kong Fansen and Li Runwu.
</P>
<P>
Kong served as secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Committee of Ngari Prefecture in Tibet, and Li was a deputy mayor
of Beijing. They both worked hard in the interests of the people
and died at their posts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a team of disabled persons has delivered some 100
reports to millions of people across the country on how they have
made unremitting efforts to improve themselves and performed deeds
difficult even for normal people, despite their blindness or other
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years China has stepped up cultural and
ideological progress.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, efforts have been intensified to crack down on
corruption and all kinds of other social vices. On the other hand,
tremendous efforts have been made to encourage the pursuit of
healthy practices in society and guide the development of
ideological trends in society.
</P>
<P>
According to scholars, cultural and ideological progress
currently focuses on carrying forward the enterprising national
spirit, patriotism and collectivism, while opposing money worship,
hedonism and extreme individualism.
</P>
<P>
In the sphere of culture, writers and artists are being
encouraged to create outstanding works and are advised not to
produce shoddy or vulgar ones.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also being made to promote professional and social
ethics among the general public.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a number of well-received films, TV series, operas
and books, as well as theoretical articles have been produced
since 1991, when China launched a program to make China's cultural
market prosperous.

<P>
BEIRUT, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior PLO official has
stressed the right of Lebanon to extend its sovereignty and
control to all its lands, including the Palestinian camps in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Abu Dhabi Wednesday with the Paris-based
Arabic-language daily AL-Hayat issued here today, Mahmoud Abbas
(Abu Mazen), member of the PLO Executive Committee, said "the
Palestinian fighters in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon should
hand over their weapons to the Lebanese Army" no matter they
return to the Palestinian self-ruled West Bank and Gaza strip or
stay in Lebanon as normal citizens."
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen went to Abu Dhabi Sunday night to attend a symposium.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "We respect Lebanon's sovereignty, especially
at a time when Lebanon is seeking a solution for the problem in
the south and is working for a pullout of the Israeli forces from
the south and Western Beqaa."
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazed stressed that all the Palestinians have a right to
return to their homeland according to the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 194 and obtain compensations.

WEIHAI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Weihai High-Tech Development
Zone in east China's Shandong Province has refused more than 10
projects that are likely to pollute its environment.
</P>
<P>
Among the investors refused by the zone was a large state-owned
enterprise from northeast China with more than 20,000 employees
that will promised one billion yuan of investment for the zone if
it were allowed to move in. Another refused investor was an
American business that planned to invest 7.6 million US dollars
for the production of a radioactive hi-tech product.
</P>
<P>
Strict control of pollutant projects has enabled the zone to
keep its first-class atmosphere to date, which has, in return,
attracted to it projects that require a high-quality environment.
</P>

Officials of the zone say that they have so far received 225
high-tech projects involving a total investment of 3.54 billion
yuan. They added that electronic information, biomedical
engineering, integrated mechanical and electronic products, new

<HEADLINE> Simpson Appears in TV Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- O.J. Simpson appeared
tonight in his first full TV interview since his acquittal on
double murder charges and blamed the news media for turning many
Americans against him.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, a former American football star, admitted that he
abused his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, but flatly denied that he
murdered his ex-wife and her friend Ronald Goldman in the one-hour
interview with the Black Entertainment Television, a cable network
reaching 44 million households across the country.
</P>
<P>
"I did not commit those murders and I don't know of anyone that
was involved." He said,"I think the media is the main reason why
America is feeling the way they're feeling," Simpson said. "They
were lied to."
</P>
<P>
Simpson, accused of killing Nicole and Goldman in 1994, was
acquitted last October after a nine-month trial that caught
worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
His acquittal shocked the majority of whites, though it was
hailed by many African Americans.
</P>
<P>
Asked about allegations that he abused his ex-wife, Simpson
said: "In 1989, we were involved in an argument that got
physical." But he added he went through the legal system. "I paid
my dues for whatever that crime was," he said.
</P>
<P>
News reports here described Simpson's interview as a "desperate
bid" to rehabilitate his public image and a "brazen attempt" to
promote sales of his mail-order video designed to tell his side of
the story and help pay his multi-million-dollar legal bills.
</P>
<P>
Under American law, Simpson is a free man and won't be charged
for the murders again. But now he is facing a civil lawsuit filed
by Nicole's and Goldman's families for the wrongful death of
Nicole and Goldman.
</P>
<P>
The civil suit carries no threat of jail, but could cost him
millions of dollars in damages if convicted.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Produce More Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) is to produce more natural gas to face growing home and
foreign demands.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report issued by the Abu Dhabi Marine Oil
Operation Company (ADMA-OPCO), a major gas project at the
offshore field of Umm Shaif off Abu Dhabi was finished in 1995 and
nearly doubled the production of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The ADMA-OPCO launched the project three years ago to boost gas
 output to around 1.045 billion cubic feet per day from nearly 450
million cubic feet per day.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin did not mention the cost of the gas venture, but
the company had invested nearly 700 million U.S. dollars annually
over the past few years, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
Another key gas project was carried out by the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company, ADNOC, and involved quadrupling gas output
at the onshore Bab oil field to 2 billion cubit feet per day.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has the world fourth biggest gas reserves after
Russia, Iran and Qatar, which are officially estimated at some 190
trillion cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Huber To Face Seles In Australian Open Women's Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- World number nine Anke Huber
of Germany set up a final clash against top ranked Monica Seles of
the United States after beating South Africa's Amanda Coetzer in
the semi-finals of the Australia Open in Melbourne on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Huber, who turned 22 last month, fought off the 24-year-old
Coetzer 4-6, 6-4, 6-2. Both of them were the first time to compete
in the semi-finals of the Grand Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
Seles won three consecutive Australian Open titles from 1991 to
1993. She beat Germany's Steffi Graf in the final at the 1993
event.
</P>
<P>
Graft missed this tournament because she is still recovering
from a surgery to remove a bone fraction from her foot.
</P>
<P>
Huber booked the semi-finals berth by eliminating world number
two Conchita Martinez of Spain in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
But she will have to give every bit of herself to grab the
title from Seles, who dwarfed strong challenge posed by fellow
American Chanda Rubin in a one-hour-57-minute, semi-final battle
early on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seles, also 22, has yet to lose a single match during all the
events she attended in Australia. She has only suffered one defeat
to Graf in the U.S. Open final last September since her comeback.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The federal reservce
system, the General Bank of the United States of America, is to
issue a new series of the US currency, the 100-dollar notes
with a new design in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The new notes are to replace the old ones gradually, the
local daily "the New Vision", reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U. S. would continue to honor existing currency at its
face value for as long as it remains in circulation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
These changes are reportedly part of the US government's
efforts to stay ahead of technological advances that facilitate
counterfeiting of currency.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the embassy of the US in Kampala would
be working with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning,
Ugandan financial institutions and the Ugandan police force to
ensure a smooth introduction of the new currency into the
Ugandan economy.

<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Preparatory Committee of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will announce
its establishment here tomorrow, signaling that the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland is entering its final stage.
</P>
<P>
The 150 members of the committee will set out to do preparation
work for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR on the basis of
the work done by the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, according to the
relevant provisions set out in the Basic Law for Hong Kong SAR and
the decisions made at the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Preparatory Committee was decided at
the third session of the Seventh NPC in April 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to the Decision of the National People's Congress on
the Method for the Formation of the First Government and the First
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
adopted at the session, "Within the year 1996 the National
People's Congress shall establish a preparatory committee of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which shall be
responsible for preparing the establishment of the region and
shall prescribe the specific method for forming the first
government and the first Legislative Council in accordance with
this decision. The Preparatory Committee shall be composed of
mainland members and of Hong Kong members who shall constitute not
less than 50 percent of its membership. Its chairman and members
shall be appointed by the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress."
</P>
<P>
At the fifth plenary session of the PWC held on June 24, last
year, a proposal on the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR
Preparatory Committee was passed.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the Preparatory Committee was to be
set up in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also noted that the Preparatory Committee will be
composed of 120 to 150 members, and over 50 percent of them will
be from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee will be based in Beijing, and working
bodies will also be set up in Beijing and Hong Kong, the proposal
said.
</P>
<P>
On December 28, 1995 the 17th session of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee approved the name list
of members of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee consists of 150 members, with Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen as its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The nine vice-chairmen are Wang Hanbin, Ann Tse-kai, Henry
Ying Tung Fok, Lu Ping, Zhou Nan, Wang Yingfan, Simon Li
Fook-Sean, Tung Chee-hwa and Leung Chun-ying.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping acts as secretary-general of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Among the 150 members, 56, about 37 percent of the total, are
from the interior, while 94, about 63 percent of the total, are
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The members from the interior are mainly officials from the
central and local departments connected with Hong Kong affairs, as
well as some experts and scholars.
</P>
<P>
The 94 members from Hong Kong are all permanent Hong Kong
residents from all walks of life, including business, culture,
academy, religion, labor and the civil service.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, most members of the former PWC and some of the
members of the former Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the
Hong Kong SAR are participating in the Preparatory Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Talks between the Croats and
Muslims in Bosnia on how to divide Mostar broke down today after
two rounds of negotiations failed to narrow their serious
divergences, the European Union (EU) said in Mostar today.
</P>
<P>
EU spokesman Dragan Gashich told a press conference that the
two sides agreed to submit the issue to the arbitration of the EU,
which would announce its final decision next week.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic conflict between the Muslims and Croats in Mostar,
which started in 1993, has been intensified because of the Dayton
peace accord signed in Paris last December.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims insisted on a total unification of the city, while
the Croats wanted to divide it into two parts to be separately
administrated ethnically.
</P>
<P>
The Croats plan to make Mostar the capital of the Bosnian Croat
entity.

HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cereal Producers's

</P>

Chief executive of the association Peter Wells said Wednesday

year, the area under wheat was reduced by 70 percent owing to
inadequate irrigation water supplies.

"We have never had enough wheat to export and worse still not
enough for the local market alone," he noted.

to protect water resources in China.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Australian government will provide 13

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Lower Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Congress of Trade
Unions (zctu) has urged the government to reduce taxes in this
year's budget to enable workers to have reasonable take-home
payment.
</P>
<P>
Zctu General Secretary Alec Chirwa said in northern Zambia on
Wednesday that Zambian workers are the most over taxed, adding
that when the new budget is presented to parliament on Friday,
there should be some relief to the workers.
</P>
<P>
The workers are anxious about the contents of this year's
budget and hope that their demands are met, he said.
</P>
<P>
The labor movement is fighting an unequal battle with the
government and other employers for the betterment of the workers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that in the current unfavorable economic
climate, it becomes extremely difficult for the labor movement to
register success that will match the aspiration of it members.
</P>
<P>
At present, Zambia effects the value added tax at a rate of 20
percent, income tax between 15 to 35 percent and the excise duty
at some 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> More than 13,000 Qualified as Lawyers in Latest Exam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 13,000 people in
China have passed the national examination on law practitioner
qualifications held in October last year, sources at the Ministry
of Justice said today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 117,000 people took the exam.
</P>
<P>
Shandong Province, with 12,000 examinees, topped the list. The
number of candidates from Beijing Municipality and the provinces
of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Sichuan, Henan and Hunan exceeded
5,000.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the ministry said the exam this time was more
difficult than previous ones, but the examinees got better marks.
The entry rate was 1.9 percent higher than for the previous exam.
</P>
<P>
Examination papers used to be marked separately by provincial
judicial departments. But this year the papers were marked in
only seven locations to ensure fairness.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the requirements of local judicial departments
and examinees, the ministry canceled bonus marks given to some
examinees, normally to those with good performance at work.
</P>
<P>
China began holding such exams in 1986. In 1993 the ministry
made a decision that the exam was to be held each year instead of
every two years, and in 1994 a national identical enrollment
standard was enacted.
</P>
<P>
Up to now about half a million people have taken part in the
exams, and more than 70,000 have qualified as lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Dismisses Qatari Press Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain has dismissed Qatar
News Agency's (QNA) report that it had accepted the jurisdiction of
the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in a territorial dispute
with Qatar over Hawar and other islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The official Bahrain's Gulf News Agency late Wednesday quoted
an official as saying that his government had only asked the ICJ
to extend the time granted to it and Qatar to submit written
arguments, so that a complete chance is given for mediation
efforts by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by Bahraini Foreign Ministry
Under-Secretary Ghazi al Qusaibi in the Hague Monday at a meeting
which was also attended by Qatari Minister of Justice Najeeb
al-Naeemi, GNA said.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain wants the final date for submission of written
arguments to be extended from February to November this year,
QNA reports.
</P>
<P>
The QNA's Monday report said "Bahrain has gone back on its
earlier position rejecting the ICJ's arbitration, proving the
validity of Qatar's position."
</P>
<P>
Qatar requested a court ruling in 1991 on the Hawar islands in
the Gulf and the demarcation of the archipelago boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Hawar is one of a cluster of potentially oil-rich islands and
reefs claimed by both Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The row over the Hawar islands goes back to the 1930s when
Britain, which then controlled both countries' foreign affairs,
decided they belonged to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has never recognized that decision and claims
sovereignty over the cluster of islands which lie just 1.5 to 5
kilometers off its own coast and 25 to 30 kilometers from Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Tension flared into a confrontation in 1986 when Qatar used
force to prevent Bahrain from building a military post on
Fasht-ad-dibal, another disputed island. It was cooled later with
Saudi Arabia's mediation.
</P>
<P>
Qatar also wants changes to the two countries' maritime
boundary and is contesting Bahrain's rights to the reefs of Dibal
and Jiradah, with their rich fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has countered with claim to the village of Fasht al
Zubara, currently in the north-west of Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has taken the case to the ICJ in the Hague which
accepted it for hearing it in February 1995, despite Bahrain's
refusal to accept its jurisdiction. The court is expected to
produce a verdict by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia began the mediation efforts in
December 1994. But diplomats in the Gulf said Qatar's acceptance
of any Saudi mediation now looks unlikely since the two countries
clashed in December of 1995 over the appointment of a saudi
Secretary General to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab
Emirates are members of the GCC.

<HEADLINE> TB Cases Soaring in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Cases of tuberculosis in Harare
continue to rise because of various factors including
overcrowding, malnutrition and the incidence of the hiv virus
which causes aids.
</P>
<P>
TB cases rose from 2,968 in 1994 to 3,457 last year, director
of health services in Harare Lovemore Mbengeranwa said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
the figures do not reflect the true picture since not all TB
cases are referred to the council's hospitals. Other patients go
to private hospitals and the main referral hospitals, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a host of factors, but worldwide the general trend is
that the increase is due to decreased immunity because of the hiv
virus," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the prevailing health scenario had been made
worse by the rise in the number of aids and TB cases throughout
the country.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- President Daniel arap Moi
leaves for Kampala today where he will discuss with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
on East African Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit President Moi will also attended the
10th anniversary celebrations of the Government of National
Resistance Movement (NRM) tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite meeting is set to clear the hurdles toward
regional co-operation, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are member states of the East
African Community (EAC) which collapsed in 1977 because of the
political difference among them.
</P>
<P>
As president of a landlocked country, Museveni expressed his
desire to revive the EAC shortly after he took power in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The three presidents of the Defunct EAC member states met in
Arusha in November 1993, seeking for new ways of co-operation.
</P>
<P>
President Moi's visit to Uganda today is a reciprocal tour to
the one paid by President Museveni to Kenya last week in which
the two presidents expressed their commitment to regional
co-operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Croats in Bosnia will
establish a Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia to replace their
to-be-dissolved republic.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, the presidency of the Croatian
Democratic Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina (HDZ) decided on Wednesday
to form the Croatian community as a political, economic and
cultural identity of the Bosnian Croats.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ presidency, after a seven-hour meeting in Mostar, also
decided to gradually transfer the functions of the executive
authority of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia to the
Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
The presidency demanded the Muslims transfer power to the
federation in areas under the Bosnian Army control, in line with
the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, both Croats and Muslims should hand
over power to the federation and the Croatian Republic of
Herzeg-Bosnia be dissolved by January 20. But the deadline has
not been respected at all.
</P>
<P>
The HDZ presidency also decided that Kresimir Zubak should
remain as president of the federation in the transitional period.

<HEADLINE> Handan Iron and Steel Complex Leads in Enlivening Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Handan Iron and Steel
Complex, in Hebei Province, has squeezed into the ranks of
China's 11 iron and steel giants over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The central government has issued a circular calling on state
enterprises to study and spread the company's experience in
focusing on the market economy and efficiency in line with its
actual conditions.
</P>
<P>
The complex, which was founded in 1958, faced the rise of
internal production costs and a sluggish market, just as other
enterprises did, in 1990. Altogether, 26 of its 28 products could
not find a market, and it suffered a rapid business downturn.
</P>
<P>
However, all the reports showed that it was profitable, and
employees still received bonuses as usual and did not feel any
market pressure.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the main cause for this, the complex found that its
business accounting, which was based on "planned prices", was far
from those of the market economy, and could not accurately reflect
the production costs or the enterprise's efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1991 the complex reformed its accounting system.
</P>
<P>
It first designated the scheduled production cost, and then
replaced the conventional way of accounting step by step from the
purchase of raw materials to different work procedures by using
the market prices for products and deducting the factors of
scheduled profits, thus reflecting the changes in market demand
and supply.
</P>
<P>
The complex has worked out indices for scheduled production and
profits based on the standard of advanced domestic enterprises and
the production record of the enterprise, and taken into account
the market prices for raw materials and finished products.
</P>
<P>
It has designated scheduled profits for different products
according to their actual conditions, and stopped producing items
of which the production cost can not be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has concluded contracts on reducing the costs of
scheduled products with its branch enterprises, workshops and even
employees, to link their responsibilities with their interests.
</P>
<P>
It cut the number of its administrative organizations from 503
in 1990 to 389 last year, and reduced the number of office staff
members from 14 percent of the complex's total employees to 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
The shift from the planned economy to the market economy and
from extensive operations to intensive operations has enabled the
complex to rise from 1.02 billion yuan in sales income in 1990 to
five billion yuan last year. During the period, its taxes
delivered to the state rose from 160 million yuan to 430 million
yuan and its profits from 50 million yuan to 700 million yuan. The
annual steel output of the complex increased from 1.1 million tons
in 1990 to 2.15 million tons last year. Meanwhile, Its gross
assets rose from 2.78 billion yuan to 7.64 billion yuan, and its
capital liability rate dropped from 62.5 percent to 38.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hospitals' Crisis Averted in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has given 100 million
Zimbabwe dollars (11 million US dollars) to hospitals to enable
them to pay their most pressing debts and have medicinal and food
provisions to avert a major health crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of finance and that of health held marathon
meetings at which the decision to release the sum was taken
urgently, the daily "the Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The money released should enable the ministry of health and
child welfare to settle its indebtedness to creditors for the
supply of drugs, medicinal and surgical supplies, provisions,
fuel, electricity and water as an interim measure," the daily
said.
</P>
<P>
Virtually all major government hospitals this week said they
were running out of food and drugs with some asking patients to
bring their own food and buy prescriptions from pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
The hospitals all said the on-and-off delivery of supplies due
to unpaid bills by the health ministry had forced them to take
these measures.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- He Yulan, a 41-year-old woman
with a disability has regained her self-confidence and wants to
open a flower store after she was trained in a special school in
China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to contribute to society what I have learned in the
Shanghai Charity Education and Training Center," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Charity Foundation and Shanghai's No.2 Polytechnic
University jointly set up the center in January of last year as
the first non-government charitable society in China.
</P>
<P>
The center provides training at low tuition or charges no
tuition at all for the disabled or the poor to help them continue
their education.
</P>
<P>
It now provides courses in accounting, computer science,
English, cooking, flower arrangement, and household appliance
repair work.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,100 students have gotten certificates from the school,
accounting for nearly 86 percent of the people trained here, and
one third of them have found jobs where they can apply their
skills.
</P>
<P>
Xu Benliang, one of the center's heads, says that they have
also set up various charitable education funds in conjunction with
local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Charitably-funded education is growing in Shanghai today and
people trained here have found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, the disabled still face many difficulties in seeking
jobs. "Apart from giving training courses, we have a plan to
organize the disabled with the same skill to open companies and
provide necessary capital and support," Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Olympic Medalists to Get Big Award </HEADLINE>

MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Olympic Committee
(ROC) promised that each gold medalist in this summer's Atlanta
Olympic Games will be awarded a total of 100,000 U.S. dollars,
according to reports in Moscow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
ROC President Vitaly Smirnov made the promise during a meeting
last week with team captains of each Olympic sport, after a
ceremony where he and Sports Minister Shamil Tarpishev handed out
official invitations to the 1996 Summer Games to the country's top
medal hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
Smirnov told the athletes the bonuses Olympic medalist could
get will much more than what was announced publicly. "The gold
medal in an individual event would be worth a cool 100,000
U.S. dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Smirnov said their medalists are sure to get the money taking
account into security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Some athletes publicly complained that disclosure of athletes'
salaries made them easy targets for criminals. Smirnov assured the
athletes that ROC has the ways to stop any threats.
</P>
<P>
Smirnov added strained financial resources is not the problem
since the sports budget has increased considerably, from seven
billion roubles in 1993 to more than 104 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"About 93 percent of that money goes to elite athletes," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rate Cut Unreasonable: Analyst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China is not in a proper
position to lower its current interest level, at least for six
months, according to an analyst.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the macro economic situation, there now exists
little possibility that China can cut its interest rates on bank
deposits in the short term, at least for half a year," the analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have argued that the interest rates should be
reduced, as the country's annual retail price inflation index has
dropped significantly in the past year, down from a record 21.7
percent in 1994 to 14.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the analyst said that the drop of the inflation rate
was largely due to "administrative measures and the backing of
subsidies".
</P>
<P>
He added, "Therefore, the foundation for further lowering
prices is not solid."
</P>
<P>
"Potential inflationary pressures must not be underestimated,
and there are many difficulties in bringing the inflation rate
down to 10 percent this year," the analyst noted.
</P>
<P>
Factors that may harm the anti-inflationary efforts include a
weak foundation for agriculture, excessive growth of fixed-assets
investment and expected grain price rises, according to him.
</P>
<P>
"We're still a fairly long way away from the target of keeping
inflationary price rises lower than economic growth during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that there is actually little room for China to
lower interest rates on deposits, currently at 10.98 percent for
one-year deposits, if the retail price index can not be cut to
below 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The analyst also said that a cut in interest rates may turn out
to be a drain on the source of savings deposits, on which much of
the China's economic growth has been reliant.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding urban and rural savings deposits had reached 2.97
trillion yuan (about 357.8 billion US dollars) by the end of
December last year, about 58 percent of the aggregate lending
volume of all financial institutions last year, according to
statistics released by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"People should get a return on their savings," the analyst
said, adding that it is appropriate for the financial authorities
to lower the interest rates when the annual retail price index is
down to eight or nine percent.
</P>
<P>
"The cutting of interest rates should be well timed, as the
relatively tight monetary policy planned for the next couple of
years means there will not be much relaxation in credit," he
said.

<P>
Simpson, accused of killing Nicole and Goldman in 1994, was
acquitted last October after a nine-month trial that caught
worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
His acquittal shocked the majority of whites, though it was
hailed by many African Americans.
</P>
<P>
"I think the media is the main reason why America is feeling
the way they're feeling," Simpson said. "... They were lied to."
</P>
<P>
He told his viewers: "I'm as innocent as anyone else out
there." The Black Entertainment Television cable network reaches
44 million households across the country.
</P>
<P>
Asked about allegations that he abused his ex-wife, Simpson
said: "In 1989, we were involved in an argument that got
physical." But he added he went through the legal system. "I paid
my dues for whatever that crime was," he said.
</P>
<P>
News reports here described Simpson's interview as a "desperate
bid" to rehabilitate his public image and a "brazen attempt" to
promote sales of his mail-order video designed to tell his side of
the story and help pay his multi-million-dollar legal bills.
</P>
<P>
But Simpson said he is not trying to rebuild his image and
defended the decision to sell his side of the story on videotape
as an effort to support his children.
</P>
<P>
He said he wants only three things: the chance to raise his
children, spend time with his family and play golf.
</P>
<P>
Under American law, Simpson is a free man and won't be charged
for the murders again. But now he is facing a civil lawsuit filed
by Nicole's and Goldman's families for the wrongful death of
Nicole and Goldman.
</P>
<P>
The civil suit carries no threat of jail, but could cost him
millions of U.S. dollars in damages if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Carpet Export Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's carpet exports
decreased by 50 percent during the first half of the 1995-96
fiscal year starting July 1, compared with the same period of
1994-95.
</P>
<P>
According to figures of the Federal Bureau of Statistics,
Pakistan exported carpets worth 1.7 billion rupees (50 million US
dollars) during July-December 1995 as against 3.4 billion rupees
(100 million dollars) in the corresponding period of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The export received a marked decline by 82 percent in terms of
value in December, 1995 alone as against the same month of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Carpet manufacturers and exporters said the child labor issue,
rising cost of production and growing competition in the world
market are the main reasons behind the sharp decline of carpet
exports.
</P>
<P>
Western countries, accusing Pakistan of using child labor in
the carpet industry, have rejected to import Pakistani carpets.
</P>
<P>
Carpet, surgical goods, leather products and sports products
are Pakistan's major export items after textile products which
account for 60 percent of the country's total exports.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports during the first half of the current fiscal
year from July to December had a poor performance with only 3.51
billion US dollars as against the proportionate target of 4.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total export target set by the government for 1995-96
amounts to 9.2 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Captain Kalusha Bwalya's
hat-trick brought Zambia to the quarter-finals of the African
Nations' Cup in Bloemfontein, South Africa, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bwalya scored two out of his three goals in the opening nine
minutes as Zambia crushed Sierra Leone 4-0 to atop group B.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, losing finalist two years ago, will take on Egypt,
which finished second in Group A following a 1-0 victory over
South Africa under the coach of former Netherlands captain Ruud
Krol.
</P>
<P>
Despite the defeat, the host still topped Group A on goal
difference. It will meet Algeria, which beat Burkina Faso 2-1 to
come second in Group B.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon, the darkhorse of the World Cup in 1990, failed to
enter the quarter-finals after a 3-3 draw with Angola in the other
group A match.
</P>
<P>
Veteran striker Francois Oman-Biyick opened the scoring to give
Cameroon a 1-0 lead, but Angola hit home three goals in a row to
make it 3-1 with 10 minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
The three-time World Cup final quarlifier Cameroon pulled two
goals back in the last eight minutes for a surprise draw.
</P>
<P>
Egypt ended South Africa's 15-game unbeaten streak with a
seventh-minute goal from captain Ahmed El Kass, his third in as
many matches. He is second in the tournament scorers' list, two
goals behind Bwalya.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will travel to Bloemfontein to face the Zambians, who
lost the 1994 final in Tunis to holder Nigeria, which has pulled

<HEADLINE> Seles Enters Finals At Australian Tennis Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Monica Seles of the
United States continued her winning streak, but met the toughest
challenge in the semifinals against compatriot Chanda Rubin at the
Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seles, world co-number one with Steffi Graf and winner of three
consecutive Australian Opens, beat Rubin 6-7, 6-1, 7-5 in one hour
and 57 minutes, the longest battle she ever had in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, 19, has proved to be a big fighter. Fresh from her
three-set, four-hour victory over world number three Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario of Spain in the quarter-finals, Rubin went on to
lead the top seed 7-6 in the first set.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin suddenly wavered in the second set. She gave up
three services and broke one of Seles' before losing the set at
6-1. The match was disrupted by a rain storm after Rubin held her
service to lead at 1-0 in the third set.
</P>
<P>
After talking with her coach during the break, Rubin was
another person when the match resumed 45 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
She led Seles 4-1 into the third match before Seles held her
services and pulled back at 4-5.
</P>
<P>
Rubin forced Seles one meter behind the baseline with her
powerful ground strokes for most part of the match, denying Seles
of the opportunity to hit the ball hard and early before the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
Rubin actively moved up to the net and used her big weapon --
forehand smashes -- to bombard the open side of Seles. She served
many aces and forced 31 errors on Seles during the match.
</P>
<P>
But she failed to hold on at the brink of victory. Seles broke
two consecutive services of Rubin and led 6-5 in the 12th game,
serving.
</P>
<P>
When Seles smashed her final winner in the court, Rubin covered
her face that was dripped with beads of sweat.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little bit sad...She (Selse) is too great," Rubin said
after the match.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to be aggressive, be the one to take charge and put
her on the defence. I think I did it well," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It was luck," Seles said in her typical modest language.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was all gone at 5-2 (in the third set) and
prepared to see goodbye (to the tournament)," she said.
</P>
<P>
Seles has maintained her record of winning every match in
Australia. She will play in the final against the winner of
another semi-final match between Amanda Coetzer of South African
and Anke Huber of Germany.

<HEADLINE> (Corrected) Olympic Organizers Update "Bulletproof" Budget </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Organizers of the Atlanta
Olympics said Wednesday they have commitments for 90 percent of
the 1.7 billion-U.S. dollar operating budget.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to fall short of our revenue forecast,"
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) chief operating
officer A.D. Frazier said. "I said before it was bulletproof and I
will stand by that."
</P>
<P>
They said they raised 582 million U.S. dollars in commitments
during 1995 and combined with 928 million dollars in previously
promised income, the money needed to finance the staging of the
Games would be in hand.
</P>
<P>
The final 10 percent of the budget, just under 200 million
dollars, will be obtained from event-time revenues such as future
ticket and souvenir sales as well as parking income.
</P>
<P>
Even if that money comes up short, a contingency fund and any
budget overruns could be used before any problem took place.
</P>

More than 10,000 competitors from 197 countries and region are
expected to participate in the Games.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Fertilizer Imports Up 226 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's chemical
fertilizer imports increased 226 percent to 803,948 tons during
the first half of the 1995-96 fiscal year starting July 1, as
against 246,549 tons in the same period of the previous year, said
figures released by the Federal Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Food and Agriculture today
attributed this sharp jump to the increase in agriculture produce
and the low production of local fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
"The production of major crops rose an average 7.6 percent
during last year, the increase in cotton, rice and oilseed
cultivation areas had particularly increased the consumption of
fertilizers during the last six months from July to December,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, intermittent loadshedding in natural gas supply to
fertilizer factories greatly affected the local fertilizer
production.
</P>
<P>
Besides the local production of more than 3.5 million tons of
chemical fertilizers annually, Pakistan also imports 1.5 to 2
million tons of major fertilizers to meet the domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge increase in fertilizer imports, there is still
a prevailing scarcity of urea in the markets and the farmers fear
this may lead to lower wheat yield, the local reports said.

<HEADLINE> 1,514 Candidates to Contest in Polls in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,514 candidates from
300 constituencies in Bangladesh are now in the field to contest
in the country's parliamentary polls on February 15, according to
local sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that 43 of them including Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia are re-elected unanimously, because of the absence of
the opposition parties from the race.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties have boycotted the poll
process and demanded for the resignation of the present cabinet to
pave the way for a neutral caretaker government to supervise a
free and fair election.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has rejected
the demand and expressed to go ahead with the polling process
without participation of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Khaleda Zia who is also the BNP chairperson
formally started the party's election campaign in the northeastern
district of Sylhet amid violent clashes between the opposition
parties activists and the police. At least 50 persons were
injured during the clashes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welfare Body Slams Rumors on China Orphanage Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. children's welfare body
has condemned "scandalous reports" in the Western media about the
so-called abuse of children in Chinese orphanages and saluted
Chinese welfare workers for their work in helping the children.
</P>
<P>
It is "preposterous and grossly unfair to conclude, on a flimsy
basis that the Chinese government has a policy of starving or
abusing abandoned children," Heino Erichsen, executive director of
Los Ninos (The Children's) International Adoption Center in Texas,
said in a statement available here today.
</P>
<P>
The director noted that the Western reports were wholy based on
the "disputable claims of one person involved with one orphanage."
</P>
<P>
Western media began playing up rumors of abuse two weeks ago
after a former employee of a Shanghai orphanage, Zhang Shuyun,
left China and claimed that children there were physically abused
and starved to death.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we are outraged (by the reports)," Erichsen said.
"In our view, this is irresponsible reporting at best and, at
worst, the defamation of China as a nation."
</P>
<P>
"It is preposterous to contend that the Chinese government
would even tolerate such grotesque behavior, much less make it
official policy," the director added.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than criticize, we want to applaud and support China's
efforts in helping their children. We join with the vast majority
of Americans and thinking people everywhere to challenge these
scandalous reports and to show our strong support and appreciation
of what is being done there," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The director said "We believe the public needs to see their
tears and feel their pain, as we have, over the loss of a single
child."
</P>
<P>
Erichsen noted that "We personally know people at the highest
level in the China Welfare system, down to those who direct and
work in orphanages.
</P>
<P>
"Because of our close and cooperative association with you we
can speak from a base of experience and truth. ... and so we
resent a small group of misdirected extremists reporting on
matters of which they have no personal knowledge."
</P>
<P>
"We want to apologize to you, our friends in China, for having
to receive this undeserved abuse by a handful of persons in our
country intent on their own questionable mission. We want you to
know that this does not represent the thinking of others and we
must apologize for them. We believe their cause would be better
served by pointing out abuses in our own country," the director
said.
</P>
<P>
Erichsen also said the welfare body is actively contacting news
agencies throughout the U.S. to "counteract and correct what we
believe is a maligning and grossly unfair report and to speak in
support of your program for the care of children."

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Government Calls on Kidnappers to Make Contact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican government
today called again on the kidnappers of two European women to make
contact with a mediator as the case enters its fourth week.
</P>
<P>
Police combing the area where the women were abducted have been
withdrawn to make it easier for the kidnappers to contact the
mediator, a parish priest who works in the area in northern Costa
Rica.
</P>
<P>
Nicola Fleutchaus, a 24-year-old German, and Susana Sigfried, a
50-year-old Swiss, were abducted by armed men on January 1 from a
hotel where a group of European tourists were celebrating the new
year in a mountainous area bordering Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Four days later, the kidnappers demanded a ransom of 1 million
U.S. dollars and 1 million colons (nearly 5,000 dollars). They
also demanded that the government increase workers' wages and end
price hikes in public services.
</P>
<P>
However, Costa Rican authorities believe that the abduction was
motivated solely by extortion.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers are reportly Nicaraguan armed groups, formerly
known as "Contras", who operated in the area over the past decade
during their guerilla war against the Sandinista regime in Managua.
</P>
<P>
If so, the kidnappers would be well trained in military tactics
and familiar with the terrain, making the search for them much
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Police have not found any trace of the group from which nothing
more has been heard in the past three weeks. The silence is
causing growing concern over the the fate of the two kidnapped
women.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican's tourism industry, particularly in the north, has
been affected by the kidnapping.

<HEADLINE> US Budget Stalemate Blocks Money for Oil Delivery to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States lacks
money to pay for the next delivery of heavy fuel oil to the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) because of the budget
stalemate between the U.S. administration and Congress, the State
Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
The United States has requested 22 million dollars from
Congress to finance the delivery of the fuel oil to the DPRK as
part of an agreement reached by the U.S. and DPRK in 1994,
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the foreign operations appropriations has not
come forward to the President," Burns said. "This is an
unfortunate example of how the current budget debate and the
breakdown of the budget talks is affecting U.S. national security
interests."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States would supply the fuel oil to
the DPRK even if Congress does not come up with the money, Burns
said "the United States has responsibility for this part of the
bargain."
</P>
<P>
"What we are hoping for is quick congressional action to make
this bill available to the president," he said. "The North Korean
nuclear program is frozen. And so it's very much in our interest
to get this done."
</P>
<P>
Burns also said U.S., Japanese and South Korean officials would
hold a trilateral meeting in Honolulu tonight to coordinate
policies toward the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of these talks is to talk about North Korea, talk
about the operations of KEDO (the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization), talk about the fact that KEDO does need
financial support, not only from the United States but from
others," the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
The officials would also discuss the food crisis in the DPRK
and be prepared to provide additional assistance to help the DPRK
survive the food shortage, Burns added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord, Japanese Vice
Foreign Minister Shunji Yanai and South Korean Assistant Foreign
Minister Ban Ki Mun are to attend the meeting in Honolulu.

WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) --The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today launched its first South African bond
issue of 250 million rand, which were swapped into a
fixed U.S. dollar rate at advantageous terms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Euromarkets, the IDB concluded a 10,000-million
Spanish peseta bond issue on January 22, for the equivalent of
some 80 million U.S. dollars, and a 300-million Deutsche mark
public bond issue, for the equivalent of 203 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The South African rand issue, swapped into about 68 million
U.S. dollars, was priced at 101.15 percent with a 13 percent
annual coupon, maturing on February 28, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The peseta five-year-bonds, maturing on February 20, 2001, have an
annual coupon of 8.625 percent and were priced a 101.28 percent,
yielding 8.71 percent a year to investors.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche mark five-year bonds, which also mature on February
20, 2001, have an annual coupon of 4.625 percent and were priced at
100.735 percent, yielding 4.83 percent a year to investors.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds of the three issues will be incorporated into the
IDB's ordinary capital and will be used to help finance the
economic and social development of the IDB's Latin American and
Caribbean member nations.

<HEADLINE> Oil Revenues Projected to Exceed Target in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
expected that its revenues from the oil sector will exceed its
target of 9.8 trillion rupiah (4.3 billion US dollars) for the
current fiscal year, ending in March.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is based on the fact that Indonesia's crude oil
prices would likely reach an average of 19 US dollars a barrel
until the end of the current fiscal year, far above the
government's budget price of 16.5 US dollars, according to the
president of the state-owned oil firm Pertamina, Faisal Abda'Oe at
a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia currently enjoys relatively high oil prices due to
the winter in oil importing countries and the breakdown of two
power plants in Japan, the main importer of Indonesia's crude.
</P>
<P>
However, there is concern about a possible drop in crude oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
World oil prices were slightly lower earlier this week after
Iraq accepted an invitation from the United Nations to resume
discussion on a UN oil-for-food plan.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) would take
action if Iraqi oil entered the market and caused world prices to
fall.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster Continues to Haunt Ukrainians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainians are still suffering
the effects of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster,
with soaring incidences of cancer and other diseases, a senior
Ukrainian health care official said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 4.5 million Ukrainians still living in the
nuclear-polluted area around the Chernobyl, only 24.2 percent can
be called "healthy," Viktor Ponomarenko, deputy minister of the
Ukrainian Health Ministry, told an international forum opened here
today to review the disaster.
</P>
<P>
After the world's worst nuclear accident on April 26, 1986,
about 140,000 Ukrainian residents were forced to abandon their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Among the displaced and their descendants, Ponomarenko said,
there has been a considerable increase in recent years in the
number of patients having digestive, blood and nerve related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The number of teenagers getting thyroid cancer in the country,
has risen to 542 between 1986 and 1996 from 59 over the previous
five years.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear radiation also caused a fall in the birth rate and a
rise in the number of malformed new-born babies, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the last decade, about 20,000 children have been found
with congenital diseases in their digestive, blood, immune and
endocrine systems.

<HEADLINE> French Government Approves Social Security Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Two reform bills to rescue the
debt-ridden social security system were approved by the French
government today, triggering union calls for more protests,
reports said here.
</P>
<P>
The bills will raise taxes and establish a payment fund to curb
the sky-rocketing social security deficit. Reuter news agency
quoted the key CGT trade union as saying it was calling protests
next month.
</P>
<P>
Under the payment fund bill, 25 billion French francs (5
billion U.S. dollars) will be collected annually from February 1,
1996 to January 31, 2009.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be levied on all incomes except subsidies for the
elderly, the disabled and the impoverished.
</P>
<P>
The other bill, which is aimed at balancing the social security
deficit, calls for higher taxes and no more increases in family
welfare.
</P>
<P>
France's welfare deficit rose to an estimated 230 billion
francs (46 billion dollars) by the end of this year and may top
250 billion francs (50 billion dollars) by 1997.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe earlier said that without
reform of the ailing social security system, disruption to
payments from the social security fund will happen soon.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the two bills are key components of the
government's plan to slash the fiscal budget deficit and to meet
the single currency criteria of 3 percent deficit-to-GDP.
</P>
<P>
But Le Monde newspaper said some concrete contents of the plan
have been shelved after last year's 24-day crippling public sector
strikes.
</P>
<P>
The CGT trade union said it was urging a week of protests to
call for Juppe to withdraw his reforms, but stopped short of
calling for a repeat of last year's strike.
</P>
<P>
The Force Ouvriere union, a CGT partner in the stoppages last
year, also said its leadership would meet today to discuss future
protests.
</P>
<P>
The social unrest late last year, the worst since the 1968
student-worker uprising, paralyzed the country's transport system
in response to Juppe's reform plan calling for higher taxes, later
retirement for public employees and health cost controls.

<HEADLINE> hke012517 --Sri Lankan Government to Discuss Devolution With Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government will
discuss its devolution package with opposition parties,
particularly the main opposition United National Party, official
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The architect of the devolution package, Constitutional Affairs
Minister G. L. Pieris, has contacted opposition Leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe and arranged for talks in a few days.
</P>
<P>
According to Pieris, the issue was a national one and should be
settled in that spirit.
</P>
<P>
The devolution package which seeks to set up a union of regions
with a great deal of autonomy is the government's political
solution to the 13-year ethnic conflict between the government and
the Tamil minority.
</P>
<P>
The package which needs a two-third majority in Parliament has
come under severe criticism from several quarters.
</P>
<P>
The extremist Sinhalese, supported by the powerful Buddhist
clergy, see it as a move to end the country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Tamils, other than the rebels, who welcomed the original
proposals, are now unhappy as there is no guarantee of a merger of
the North and East which they have been agitating for.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are now before the Parliamentary Select Committee
which must reach consensus before its presentation in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government is now engaged in canvassing support for the
proposals throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> UNIDO: Developing Nations Lead World's Industrial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The world will see the biggest
shift in economic strength for over a century over the next 20
years as fast-growing developing countries become major economic
powers, a United Nations report says.
</P>
<P>
Industrial growth in developing countries has been running
ahead of developed countries since early 1990s, the head of the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) said
today.
</P>
<P>
"In the next 25 years some of today's developing countries such
as China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand, Brazil and
Mexico will rank among the 15 largest economies in the world,"
said UNIDO Director General Mauricio de Maria y Campos in its
annual report.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries' gross national product (GNP) grew by an
estimated 3.7 percent and industrial output by 5.4 percent in
1995, well above the world's average 2.9 percent GNP growth and
3.2 percent industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
East and Southeast Asia lead the way as their high technology
products are rapidly picking up an increasing share of the global
market. China and India are also growing quickly, and Brazil and
Colombia are undergoing economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
However, more than 100 developing countries, mostly in Africa,
are still suffering from severe poverty, the director general
said, and the gap between these and other developing countries is
widening.
</P>
<P>
A third of the total population of developing nations now live
below the poverty line, with an annual wage of 350 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important for developing and developed countries
to keep growing through "technical progress and the upgrading of
technical and managerial skills."

NEW YORK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The China Chamber of Commerce,
a non-profitable organization made up of 75 Chinese companies
in the eastern United States, was officially launched
here today.
</P>
<P>
Shen Beizhang, chairman of the chamber and president of the
Shanghai International Holding Corp.(America), said that the
Chamber will help provide members with business information
and with a better understanding of U.S. laws and regulation.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that American Chambers of Commerce in Beijing
and Shanghai were established in late 1980s. "Although we
are almost one decade behind, I think it will never be too late
if we speed up to reach our goal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Making a special trip to New York to attend the opening
ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu said
that the founding of the Chamber in the U.S. reflected the ever

community to maintain and further develop China-U.S. economic and
trade relations," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan to Pursue Defensive Military Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan will pursue a
defensive military policy and never be the first to use force,
Defense Minister Alibek Kasymov said today.
</P>
<P>
The policy also highlights non-interference in other countries'
internal affairs, Kasymov told Kazakh Telegraph Agency in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said that political measures will take
precedence over military ones and Kazakhstan will not enter into
any military bloc or want to see such blocs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
He added that the cooperation between his country and China in
demilitarizing their common borders is a manifestation of such
policy.
</P>
<P>
On military reform, Kasymov said that extending a soldier's
service from one and a half years to two years and maintaining
compulsory service system are two essential steps to enhance the
army's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
But the reform's priority is to re-equip the army with modern
technologies and establish new services, said Kasymov.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 1996 defense budget of 16.8 billion tenges
(about 270 million U.S. dollars) is appropriate but it is more
important to have the funds available to the army in time.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh army was established in 1992 on the basis of the
former Soviet troops stationed in the country, and is moving from
the stage of reorganization to the one of modernization.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The American auto giant, Ford
Motors, plans to spend 53 million US dollars on two new component
manufacturing plants in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The new plants, part of Ford's drive into Southeast Asia, will
supply a pickup truck assembly line to be established in Thailand
by Auto Alliance (Thailand) Co., a joint venture between Ford and
Mazda.
</P>
<P>
Of Ford's two new plants, one will produce plastic, electronic
and electrical components, while the other will make climate
control components for vehicle air-conditioners, Bangkok Post
today quoted George Lutz, managing director of Ford's automotive
components division for the Asia-Pacific region, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Production from the two component plants is estimated to be
worth 80 million US dollars annually by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the two plants is scheduled to start by the end
of this year in Mab Ta Phud, Rayong, on the eastern seaboard,
about 180 kilometers southeast of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Ford sold slightly over 5,000 vehicles in Thailand last year.
</P>
<P>
The auto company recently announced that it would merge its
regional activities in the Asia-Pacific region, South America and
Africa to streamline its global production, so as to control

<HEADLINE> Germany Agrees Program to Halve Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- An ambitious program to cut
Germany's unemployment by half and boost economic growth by the
end of this century was announced here today after a summit
between the government, industry and union leaders.
</P>
<P>
The three sides agreed to prune back the welfare state and
social security taxes, loosen rigid employment regulations and
improve incentives for new businesses to help cut unemployment
which is poised to reach 4 million, some 10 per cent of the
workforce, to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
The program marked the end of three months of debate triggered
by the radical offer of engineering union IG Metall to moderate
wage demands in return for the creation of thousands of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
It calls on all parties to work together to turn the aims of
the plan into reality.
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes the importance of the private sector and
medium-sized and small businesses saying investment and
development conditions will be improved to create employment and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The federal government is to offer better tax policies for new
companies and to cut the state-owned share of the nation's economy
in a bid to attract more private investment and to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
The program also plans to cut public spending to below 40 per
cent of gross domestic product by 2000 and to raise the
pensionable age.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said the talks sent "a good signal." Further
rounds of talks on wages have been planned for next month.

<HEADLINE> Body-Building Popular Among Urbanites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Li Jiayuan, 38, does 10
minutes of exercise at home every evening on her body-building
equipment, no matter how tired she is after a day's work.
</P>
<P>
"Because of this, I feel energetic and confident in my work the
next day," Li, who is manager of the public relations department
of a three-star hotel in the capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province, explained.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, she spent 500 yuan (about 60 US dollars) on the
exercise equipment to help shape up her stomach.
</P>
<P>
Li is one of thousands of local people who are spending their
savings on body-building equipment to keep fit and maintain good
health -- now that refrigerators, color tvs, and washing machines
have become common household items.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 3,000 sets of this kind of equipment was sold
by the city's two major department stores, five times more than
during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the machines, which cost from 500 to 2,000
yuan (about 60 to 240 US dollars), which is cheaper than a color
tv set, were bought by ordinary people, a survey has shown.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite natural for body-building equipment to become
popular among ordinary people, who have begun to pay more
attention to their health," said Gu Yingchun, deputy president of
the Zhejiang Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Gu attributes the sales boom to a national health care program
last year, which prompted ordinary Chinese to exercise to improve
their health.
</P>
<P>
"With body-building equipment at home, I no longer have to set
aside time to go to the gymnasium, and I'm fairly busy with my
work," a restaurant manager who has just brought one of the
machines home, says.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the equipment is bought by parents for their
children, or by a family member as a birthday gift for parents,
according to the manager of the busy Jiefanglu Department
Store. Some even give body-building equipment to newly-weds as a
gift, he said.

<HEADLINE> Orphans in Tianjin Well Cared for (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Every Friday afternoon Li
Ruiyuan, an eight-year-old orphan girl living at the Tianjin
Children's Welfare Institute, dresses herself neatly and waits
anxiously for her "mother" to take her back "home."
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years Li has always spent her weekends this
way.
</P>
<P>
Her foster mother, Ping Xiuwen, is a shop assistant at the
Tianjin Binjiang Department Store. Her own eight-year-old daughter
attends primary school.
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I love Ruiyuan as much as we do our own child,"
Ping said, stroking Li's hair lovingly.
</P>
<P>
Li is one of the 33 orphans in Tianjin who have found new homes
during the city's "Give an Orphan a Home" campaign.
</P>
<P>
The orphans in this largest industrial city in north China can
now spend weekends and holidays in their foster parents' homes,
said Yan Jiying, director of the institute.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Binjiang Department Store has undertaken to rear
two orphans, paying part of their education and living costs.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jiazhen, deputy manager of the store, said, "Welfare
institutes in China are not forgotten corners of society, and we
are not the only ones who care for the orphans."
</P>
<P>
He said, "As an advisor to the institute, I have seen many
organizations and individuals donate money and materials or
provide services to it. As a result, conditions in the institute
have improved greatly."
</P>
<P>
Foreigners living in Tianjin are also doing all they can to
help the orphans in the institute, he said.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee for Chinese Orphans, an
organization founded by the wives of foreign executives of
foreign-funded enterprises in Tianjin, have been helping the
orphanage since its establishment in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Most members of the committee come to the institute almost
every day, helping the orphans take showers, washing their clothes
and feeding them. They also hold charity bazaars and collect
donations for the institute.
</P>
<P>
Sharon Gastright is on the committee. Her husband is a senior
executive of a company funded by a US company in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"The welfare institute receives help and care from all sectors
of society," she said. "The workers here are doing their best
to help the orphans and disabled children. Conditions here have
improved markedly. For example, the children now can take showers
every day."

<P>
MADRID, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Olympiakos of Greece came from
behind to score a crucial 77-76 victory in overtime against
Spain's Unicaja Malaga in their European clubs' basketball
championship group A match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The result leaves Unicaja, which has 15 points, with little
chance of qualifying for the next round. Olympiakos, with 18
points, move into provisional first place with CSKA Moscow which
plays on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A bad-tempered game ended with the Greeks rushing to the
dressing room and the Spanish players surrounding the referee's
desk after they felt the game had been cut short by five seconds.
</P>
<P>
Earlier police had to intervene when a cameraman was hit by a
member of the Olympiakos staff as he tried to film the Greek
players during a time-out huddle.
</P>
<P>
Unicaja took control of the game from the start and went in at
the break with a 32-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
But Olympiakos came back and nearly won the game on the stroke
of full time with the score tied at 67-67.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Army Backs President in Current Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a meeting of the defense minister and other top-ranking
commanders, Bedoya said that in accordance with the Constitution,
the army had the obligation to back the institution of the
president during the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on the RCN radio station about whether the
army backs the institution rather than the individual, Bedoya
said: "We are backing the institution and the institution of the
president because that is stipulated in the Constitution and we
understand that no matter what the situation, it must be resolved
legally and constitutionally."
</P>
<P>
He said that in Colombia, there could not be a power vacuum and
that was why the armed forces backed political institutions.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that a rule of law exists in Colombia
with constitutional rules that work and should continue to work,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bedoya declined to express a personal opinion about the
political crisis stemming from explosive accusations made by
former Defense Minister Fernando Botero against Colombian
President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
Botero alleged Monday that Samper knowingly accepted money from
the Cali drug cartel to finance his 1994 election campaign. Samper
has called the allegations "monstrous" and rejected calls for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
The military chief said that, according to the Constitution,
the armed forces must not be involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
He added that the meeting held in the Defense Ministry was in
no way related to the political crisis as it was scheduled a few
days ago.

SOFIA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's former world and Olympic
champion Artur Dmitriev, together with his new partner Oksana
Kazakova, became a new pair champion here Wednesday at the
European Figure Skating Championships.
</P>
<P>
Dmitriev won his first of two European title in 1991 in Sofia
with Natasha Mishkutienok. Now he returned to Sofia with Kazakova
and wins again.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Mandy Woetzel and Ingo Steuer of Germany,

The third place went to the French pair of Sarah Abitol and
Stephane Bernadis.

Viacheslav Zagorodniuk of Ukraine edged defending champion Ilya
Kulik of Russia in a tension-filled men's short program.

one of the top skaters to complete all of his planned required
elements, including a triple axel-triple toe loop combination, to
"Sailor's Dance" in the traditional striped shirt of the Russian
navy.
</P>

That earned him eight first place votes of the nine judges with
marks between 5.6 and 5.8 on a scale up to 6.0.

Third went to Steven Cousins of Britain while other favorites
faltered and fell in the portion of the competition worth

<P>
SANTIAGO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chile began its first round of
trade negotiations with Canada here today, aimed at boosting
mutual investment and trade as well as preparing for Chile's entry
to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
During the three-day negotiations, the teams from both
countries will discuss market access, investment, services and
mechanisms for dispute settlement.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Chile's negotiator Juan Gabriel Valdes
said, "an agreement with Canada is very important for our eventual
accession to NAFTA. We are very optimistic about the possibilities
before us, although no deadline will be mentioned."
</P>
<P>
Canadian representative Keith Christie pointed out that Chile
is a top-flight trade partner for Canada in the field of goods,
services as well as investments.
</P>
<P>
Canada, which is Chile's principal foreign investor in mining
industry, had a trade of 550 million U.S. dollars in 1994. Chile
exported 235.7 million dollars of goods to that country and
imported 314.4 million dollars of products from there.
</P>
<P>
NAFTA has three members: the United States, Canada and
Mexico. The Chilean government has been complaining about
postponing the negotiations to 1977 for its entry to NAFTA due to
the obstacles placed by the U.S. Congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday stressed the importance of fighting crime during a visit
to Louisville, Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke with police officers and community leaders at a
west Louisville precinct near the site of a weekend drive-by
shooting in which a 16-year-old boy, Dwayne Simiril, was killed.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to get back to a point in our country where crime
is the exception rather than the rule," the Associated Press
quoted Clinton as saying. "We don't want police forces to be
occupying armies in our cities. We can't be in a position any more
where the fastest growing job category in the United States is
prison guards."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's trip to Louisville came less than 24 hours after he
delivered a State of the Union address that challenged Republican
positions on welfare reform, tax cuts, minimum wage, health
insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, environmental cleanup, crime
fighting and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
In that speech, Clinton announced a campaign to fight street
gangs and a "one-strike-you're-out" proposal designed to evict
drug dealers who live in public housing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the police officers that economic uplift is an
ultimate benefit of the community policing program, which was part
of the crime bill that Clinton advocated and Congress approved two
years ago.

WARSAW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Poland is to reform its fuel
industry in March as part of its bid to join the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
The government will open up the oil market, deregulate oil

The new limited company, which will include companies and

</P>
<P>
The moves came in response to EU pressure on Poland to open up
its oil market.
</P>
<P>
But the trade minister said that although Poland will open its
oil market to Western oil companies next year, Warsaw wants the
EU to let it extend protection of its petrochemical industry until

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Latin American and
Caribbean countries should intensify their efforts and adopt
concrete measures to fight desertification, an official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Rajeb Boulharouf of the secretariat of the International
Convention for the Fight Against Desertification, signed in Paris
in 1974, was speaking at the opening ceremony of the first
regional conference on desertification in Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
He said that the aim of the conference, held in Argentine
capital, was to work out short, medium- and long-term strategies
to fight desertification in the region.
</P>
<P>
Patricio Millan, a representative of the World Bank, said that
the Bank's new strategy on desertification depended on the active
participation of the countries affected by the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the World Bank had invested 3 billion U.S. dollars
over the past five years on reclaiming arid lands and will
allocate 2 billion dollars more within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
In Argentina, the World Bank had spent nearly 16 million dollars
in 1995 on afforestation in Patagonia in south of the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. report, a quarter of the earth's surface is
suffering from desertification, degradation and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, a fifth of all arable lands are becoming
desert, the report said.

<P>
YANGON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Yasuda Fire and Marine
Insurance Co. has opened an office in Myanmar, the official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar said today.
</P>
<P>
It is the second Japanese insurance company to open an office
here after Mitsui did so earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Yasuda, one of the largest general insurance companies in
Japan, opened its office in Myanmar 38 years ago but closed it in
1964 when private insurance companies were nationalized under the
former Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the Yasuda office here Wednesday,
Myanmar Minister for Finance and Revenue Brigadier General Win Tin
said that the government has not enacted law that permits the
setting up of private insurance companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier official reports, Myanmar has drafted a
law to liberalize the insurance market.

<HEADLINE> Thai Fishermen Jailed for Killing 2 Myanmar Seamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A local court has convicted
three Thai men of murdering two Myanmar seamen in the Andaman Sea
last August and sentenced them to 25 years in jail, a report
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The verdict made by the court of Ranong province on Wednesday
said the three Thais had beaten two Myanmar seamen with steel
bars, tied their hands and legs, and thrown them into the sea.
</P>
<P>
The crime could lead to life imprisonment but the court reduced
the punishment to 25 years because of their confession.
</P>
<P>
The Ranong court acquitted two other suspects who were present
at the scene but did not participate in the murders, which
occurred aboard a fishing boat owned by a Thai-Myanmar joint
venture on August 6 last year.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened after the Myanmar authorities boarded the
boat and took away 10 Myanmar nationals for investigation
following complaints about the boat's violation of a fishing
agreement between Thailand and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar fishermen informed their authorities that the boat had
distributed fish onto other Thai vessels before docking to a
Myanmar port to deliver half the amount of fish caught to Myanmar
under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the authorities left the boat, Thai fishermen began
assaulting the other Myanmar seamen left on board and killed them,
which triggered Myanmar's banning Thai boats from fishing in its
waters later to demand action on the murders.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar officials witnessing the verdict were satisfied with
the result of the prosecution. But Thai officials said that the
Myanmar government might continue to seek compensations for the
victims.

<HEADLINE> Panama: Canal to Remain Efficient After Hand-over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal will
continue to operate with efficiency after Panama takes over its
administration from the United States in 1999, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Ambassador to the United States., Ricardo Arias, made the
statement after the first meeting of the board of directors of the
U.S.-Panama joint Canal Commission, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat's remarks are apparently designed to ease concerns
in some Latin American countries over the transition and an
increase of fees after the hand-over.
</P>
<P>
The Canal is extremely important to some Latin American
nations, such as Peru and Ecuador, because a large percentage of
their products are shipped through the waterway.
</P>
<P>
Arias made a six-day tour to Brazil, Ecuador and Peru along
with Chairman of the Canal Commission, Joe Reeder, to reassure
them of an efficient operation after the hand-over.
</P>
<P>
Reeder said the United States also attaches enormous importance
to the efficient operation of the Canal after the hand-over.
</P>
<P>
Under a treaty reached between the two countries in 1977, the
United States will turn over the administration to Panama on
December 31, 1999, together with eight military bases along the
banks of the Canal.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Italy is still the biggest
producer of gold and silver jewelry in the world, according to
statistics released at a gold and silver jewelry expo held in the
northern Italian city of Vicenza.
</P>
<P>
The data show that in the first nine months of 1995, Italy
exported 5.39 trillion lira (some 3.37 billion U.S. dollars) worth
of gold and silver jewelry, a 12.3 percent increase over the
previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
The gold and silver jewelry produced in Italy account for 55
percent of the total amount of the same products made in Europe
and America and 18 percent in the world. Three-fourths of them
are for export.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy has met stiff competitions in recent years from
Asian countries such as Thailand, India and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Italy's gold and silver jewelry exports to the United States,
its biggest jewelry market, dropped by 10.4 percent from 1.51
trillion lira (about 940 million dollars) in the first nine months
of 1994 to 1.35 trillion lira (about 842 million dollars) in the

<HEADLINE> Orphans in Tianjin Well Cared for (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tianjin Children's Welfare Institute is home to 210
orphans, only six of whom do not have any disabilities, Director
of the institute Yan Jiying said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the children were deserted by their parents because
they are either mentally retarded or have disabilities, she said,
adding that her institute is raising more boys than girls.
</P>
<P>
The local government earmarks 1.5 million yuan a year for the
institute to pay for the orphans' food, education and medical
care, as well as the workers' salaries, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty children in the institute are of school age now, she
said. Eighteen of them are in schools for normal children, some
are in schools for blind children and the rest, all of whom are
mentally retarded, are given special education and rehabilitation
training by the institute's 13 teachers.
</P>
<P>
The orphans' medical costs are a heavy burden for the
institute, "but we still manage to treat them properly," Yan
said. The institute has paid for operations for five children
suffering from congenital heart disease. Each operation cost the
institute at least 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of the institute's expenses comes from private
donations from Chinese and foreigners, Yan said. The German
government has contributed 80,000 Deutschemarks to the institute.
</P>
<P>
"Our institute is open to the general public and accepts
supervision by people from all walks of life," she said. More than
10,000 foreigners have visited it over the past few years. The
Columbia Broadcasting System of the United States has reported on
how orphans live there.
</P>
<P>
The institute keeps in touch with some 200 foreigners from 30
countries. Most of these people served as volunteers for the
institute during their stay in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"I come here almost every day," Gastright said. "I think workers
here have done their best to improve the orphans' living
conditions. You should not judge the institute according to
standards in developed countries."
</P>
<P>
In recent years a number of orphans from the institute have
found jobs, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lingyun, who graduated from the French Department of the
Tianjin Foreign Languages Institute, works with a government office
seeking investment in the Tianjin Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
Li Mengjiao, who lost a leg in an earthquake that flattened
nearby Tangshan City in 1976, now works in a Motorola-run factory
in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Seven workers at the institute were orphans who grew up there,
Yan said.

</P>

Bardhyl Pallo, head of the General Department of Radio and

He said all imported films will be censured before appearing on
television.

<P>
Since the early 1990s, western films involving violence and sex
have flooded into the country and been frequently screened by some

Wednesday for killing another fan last year.
</P>
<P>
Simone Barbaglia, a supporter of leading club AC Milan, stabbed
a Genoa club fan Vincenzo Spagnolo, 24, to death in front of
Genoa's soccer stadium on January 29, 1995, before a match against

<P>
The murder shocked Italy and all national sport was suspended

early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy has strenuously denied the charges, calling them a dirty
provocation by supporters of former President Lech Walesa.
</P>
<P>
"I am resigning because I am innocent. I do not want to be
accused of trying to hide anything by sheltering behind high
office in the Republic," he said on national television.
</P>
<P>
Under Poland's interim constitution, Oleksy's resignation has
to be accepted by the president, who then has 14 days to appoint a
replacement.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister will have to nominate a cabinet and
submit it to a vote of confidence in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy, 49, had been prime minister only since March 1995.
Before the scandal broke, he was riding high on Poland's economic
successes and enjoyed a positive reputation abroad as an
articulate proponent of market reforms and privatisation.
</P>
<P>
Last month, former Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski told
parliament he had evidence that Oleksy, a former parliament
speaker, had passed classified documents and other information to
a KGB agent in Warsaw from the early 1980s until being elected
prime minister last March.
</P>
<P>
In his TV address, Oleksy demanded all such documents related
to his case be made public, "so that Poles can learn themselves
what the truth is."

<HEADLINE> Pesticides Pose Danger to Reproductivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found more
evidence that widely used pesticides may be linked with the
decline of reproductivity of Western males.
</P>
<P>
Reports to be released in an international conference at
Macquarie University of Australia today showed that these
pesticides had caused severe reproductive problems in fish, frogs,
alligators, birds, turtles, and even people, local newspapers
reported.
</P>
<P>
Recent British and American studies revealed that many of the
most commonly used pesticides could cause life-long changes in
sex-hormone production in animals exposed to them while in embryo.
</P>
<P>
The potentially "gender-bending" pesticides include 2,4,5-T,
dieldrin, DDT, endosulfan and 2,4-D, as well as industrial
compounds used as plasticisers, surfactants and at least one food
additive.
</P>
<P>
Professor Louis Gillette and his research team in the
University of Florida in the United States found that alligators
in Lake Apopka in Florida had suffered severe reproductive
problems since a minor spill of a pesticide, dicophol, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Gillete's team found that female alligators in the lake had
elevated oestrogen levels, while most males produced lower levels
of male sex hormones and developed physical abnormalities in their
reproductive organs.
</P>
<P>
Professor John Sumpter of Brunel University in Britain also
found that some chemical-polluted stretches of British rivers
featured only female fish.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese-American team has studied the disastrous
consequences of the use of synthetic oestrogen diethylstilbestrol
(DES) from the mid-1940s to 1971.
</P>
<P>
About five million American women had taken the drug prescribed
by their doctors. Some were pregnant when they took the drug. Many
of their children were found to be sterile or developed cancers in
their reproductive organs later in their life.
</P>
<P>
Experiments in rats showed that the organs most affected by the
chemicals are the ovary, Fallopian tube, uterus, cervix, vagina
and breasts of females, and the testis, prostate and seminal
vesicles in males.
</P>
<P>
The new foundings provide more evidence that the decline of
sperm counts in Western men and rising testicular and breast
cancer rates may be linked with the use of pesticides.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Confidence among New Zealand
business circles has risen for a second consecutive quarter in the
 quarter to December 1995 following a decline since late 1994.
</P>
<P>
The rise suggests that a turning point has occurred and growth
will increase this year, the NZ Institute of Economic Research
says.
</P>
<P>
Its latest survey of businesses indicates the general business
situation in NZ will improve over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
All sectors show output growth, despite increases in stock of
finished goods, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
The service sector continues to lead the way with strong growth
in the volume of services provided.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers' export growth has increased after easing in
previous quarters, reflecting changes in the value of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"In particular the rates against the Australian and US dollars
has been more conducive to export growth," the survey says.
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers and retailers have continued to increase their
overseas orders, reflecting the general appreciation of the
currency.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Recommends $150 Million for Bosnian Emergency  Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
announced the recommendation of 150 million U.S. dollars in
emergency reconstruction aid for war-torn Bosnia and Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation followed an intensive, on-site assessment by
a World Bank team of Bosnia's urgent needs and represents the
first phase of a much needed effort by the international community
to help the country rebuild itself.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank Board of Directors called for the creation of a
150 million dollar Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
first donor conference held in Brussels on December 20-21, 1995,
pledged to support vital reconstruction projects in the fields of
transportation, power, gas, water, and waste management as well as
mine-clearing.
</P>
<P>
The Brussels meeting drew 510 million dollars in initial
pledges. The World Bank hopes for 4.6 billion dollars in
commitment at a second donor conference planned in early Spring.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the damage done to Bosnia in the war is roughly
estimated at some 25 billion dollars.

ATHENS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 170 Albanian prisoners at
the larisa correctional facility in central Greece staged an
uprising this evening, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance began when inmates refused to return to their
cells after a recreational period. Several of the prisoners were
seen carrying homemade ropes and sheets, leading prison
authorities to believe the uprising was planned.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the foreign inmates burned mattresses,
broke windows and vandalized facilities.
</P>
<P>
Riot police units and firefighters called to the scene were
greeted with rocks by the rioting prisoners. Tear gas lobbed into
the facility failed to stifle the inmates' rampage.
The reasons behind the riot are unknown yet.

unionist foes to seriously study the proposals of a U.S.-led
international commission for breaking the deadlocks over the
Northern Irish peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I encourage all the parties to use the report of the
international body to advance the peace process," Clinton said in
a statement issued by the White House during a trip to the eastern
U.S. state of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the parties involved in the Ulster peace
process "deserve serious and open-minded consideration".
</P>
<P>
The report released by the commission led by former U.S. Senate
Majority Leader george Mitchell recommented that both IRA and
Protestant unionists renounce violence and disarm in stages once
all-party talks on lasting peace have embarked on its way.
</P>
<P>
The IRA hailed the proposals as a vindication of its demand for
unconditional all-party talks aimed at a comprehensive settlement
of the long-standing Northern Irish problem.
</P>
<P>
But the commission's initiative was believed to be a major and
tough challenge to the British government which has been demanding
that IRA guerrillas first disarm before entering into the
political talks of all parties in the region.

<HEADLINE> 7,000 Economic Crimes Reported in Moscow in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 7,000 economic crimes were
committed in Moscow in 1995, 10 times more than that in the rest
of Russia, an interior department officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Soldatov, head of the Moscow Interior Department, told a
news briefing that the absolute majority of crimes were reported
in the private sector, mainly in joint-stock companies.
</P>
<P>
According to him, one of the worst and serious types of
economic crimes is bribery, and police can solve not more than one
percent of such cases.
</P>
<P>
law enforcement officials have arrested about 300 people
suspected of taking bribes, including government employees,
Soldatov told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the investigation of the case of Deputy City
Council Chairwoman Svetlana Zhuravlyova, who is charged with a
misappropriation of several million U.S. dollars, has almost been
completed. Two high-ranking officials of the Russian Health
Ministry have been put in custody, he added.
</P>
<P>
Soldatov noted that the lack of effective laws hinders police's
efforts to fight economic crimes. Under the present regulations,
only a government official can be tried for bribery, while those
engaged in private business are not subject to prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Saprykin, deputy head of the Interior Ministry's
department fighting organized crime, told reporters: "In 1995,
police registered 5,000 cases of bribery, 14,204 cases of office
abuse and 35,460 cases of misappropriation of property."
</P>
<P>
Police and the military prosecutor's office have exposed facts
of corruption in the Defense Ministry, he said, adding that in
Moscow, the city court has sentenced several officials from the
State Committee for Defense Industry and the State Property
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Fatah Official: It Is Premature to Amend Palestinian Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEBRON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Fatah official
reiterated here today that the request made by Israel for the
deletion of certain articles from the PLO's National Charter is
premature.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Abbas Zaki (Sherif Ali
Mashaal), member of the Revolutional Council of the Fatah
Movement, said that the charter was ratified by the Palestine
National Council (PNC) which comprises representatives of all
Palestinians in the occupied territories and the diaspora.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, the elected Palestinian legislative council has
no right to take up this matter because it is an organ within the
self-rule framework and its duration restricted to the transition
period.
</P>
<P>
The charter has governed the Palestine Liberation
Organization's policy since 1968.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine National Council is the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile. Even though the West Bank and Gaza elected an
88-member national assembly at the weekend, the council will
continue to represent the Palestinian diaspora.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, who is also member of the Fatah Movement central
committee and Secretary of the Uprising Supreme Committee, added
that should Israel pull out of Jerusalem, the PNC might convene in
its natural venue and could then discuss all issues on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the charter can be discussed only after the
issue of Jerusalem and the right of return are settled, he
indicated.
</P>
<P>
The right of return refers to hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians who fled or were evicted in the 1948 and 1967 wars.
Most of them live in poor refugee camps in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that there could be no peace and stability in the
region unless the refugees come back.
</P>
<P>
He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-June 4, 1967
borders, and a complete termination of Israeli military presence.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming phase of the peace process, the Palestinian
official said that the ball was now in the Israeli court.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel entertains a sincere desire for establishing peace,
the next phase will be easy. But, should the strong Israel wishes
to maintain its occupation and rule forever within a framework of
self-rule, the process will be extremely complex."

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's external debt service
payments for the first nine months of 1995 gulped a total of
1.247 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents 17.5 percent of the total foreign
exchange inflow to the economy during the period under review,
said an official document of the Central Bank of Nigeria
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative foreign exchange receipts from January to
September of last year amounted to 7.117 billion dollars, showing
an increase of 61.1 percent over the level recorded in the
corresponding period of 1994.
</P>

The apex bank attributes this appreciable development mainly
to the public sector inflow, especially oil receipts.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's external debt is currently put at 32 billion
dollars.
