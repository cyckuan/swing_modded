<HEADLINE> More UK Voters Back Labor Leader after His Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A special Gallup Survey shows
British Labor's lead over the Tories widened from 24.5 percentage
points to 33 after Labor leader Tony Blair's conference speech on
October 1st.
</P>
<P>
The Survey, conducted by the Daily Telegraph, also shows the
proportion thinking the Labor leader would make the best Prime
Minister has risen from 38 percent to 47.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Blair's speech, the Financial Time writes: "In the
two years since he last addressed a Blackpool conference, he has
junked many of the party's traditions, launched a powerful assault
on the political center ground, and created a commanding, perhaps
unassailable lead in the polls."
</P>
<P>
Observers here say the fillip given to Labor by Blair's speech
may prove temporary. Those voters swayed by it are likely to have
been among the most volatile.
</P>
<P>
Even so they believe Gallup's findings are a tribute to Blair's
voter-attracting abilities and they will add to the pressure on
Tories to close ranks at their conference in Bournemouth, South
England next week.
</P>
<P>
The poll findings were a further boost to the Labor leadership
at the end of what is widely regarded as the most successful and
united Labor Party conference for decades.

<P>
DUBLIN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state or government from
15 European Union (EU) member states started a special summit in
Dublin, capital of Ireland, this afternoon to exchange views on
the EU Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) and other major issues
of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The informal gathering, proposed by French President Jacques
Chriac during the EU Florence Summit in June, is expected to focus
on the major difficulties facing the nearly stagnant IGC and to
explore ways of revitalizing the European integration process.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
will brief his EU partners on priorities of the Irish EU
presidency, followed by informal exchanges of views on the IGC.

At the European Council session, Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring is due to deliver a formal report on the progress of the
IGC made since it was formally launched last March.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the participants will also discuss EU's
relations with Russia, the enlargement of the 15-nation block and

<HEADLINE> EU Delegation Likely to Visit Jerusalem This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
planning a controversial trip to Jerusalem this month in an effort
to push forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A fact-finding "troika" made up of ministers from Ireland,
Italy and the Netherlands were likely to pay a visit to the Orient
House offices of the Palestinians in Jerusalem over the next ten
days, EU officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation, which will be headed by Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring, is expected to hold talks with Palestinian
leaders at the Orient House, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has repeatedly voiced its strong
opposition to any such visit to Orient House, saying it views the
visit as a signal of support for Palestinian claims to the
disputed city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government leaders also ruled out the possibility of
meeting the EU delegation if they go to the Orient House,
according to previous press reports.
</P>
<P>
"It's not inconceivable that the troika would go to Orient
House and not hold talks with the Israelis. We'll just have to
see," one EU official said today.
</P>
<P>
"But the middle of the month, October 15 to 18, is the sort of
date we are looking for. There is some urgency," he added.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from 15 EU member states, attending the one-day
special summit in Dublin, are expected to discuss the issue and
set a firm date for the visit when they have a working dinner at
the end of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French and Italian governments are urging their
EU partners to reaffirm EU's desire to play a positive role in the
Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM on Northern Ireland Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
has expressed the hope that the Irish and British governments
would make great efforts to keep the Northern Ireland peace
process firmly on track and moving forward.
</P>
<P>
Bruton is due to hold talks with his British counterpart John
Major later today during the one-day special European Union (EU)
summit in Dublin to exchange views on the all-party talks on the
future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Irish National Radio today,
Bruton said, "we believe that it is very important to recognize
that we have now a mechanism whereby all the parties can sit
down to negotiate."
</P>
<P>
"Never before in history has there been all-party inclusive
talks mechanism available as there has been since the 10th of
June," Bruton said.
</P>
<P>
"So the British Prime Minister and I, in our talks today and in
our discussions during the coming weeks, will be doing everything
we can to ensure the peace process move forward in a purposeful
way," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of decommissioning weapons of the Irish Republican
Army (IRA), Bruton said that the Irish government has got to "work
with all other parties concerned to find a solution to this
dilemma so that we can get on substantive discussions."
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which has been fighting against British rule in
Northern Ireland, ended a 17-month ceasefire in February by
staging bombing attacks upon the London Docklands and a major
shopping center in Manchester city.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said that Bruton and Major were very much
likely to announce fresh appeals for a new IRA ceasefire agreement
at their talks today.

<HEADLINE> Qualification for Candidates of Chief Executive of HK SAR (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A method for selecting the Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region adopted
by the fifth Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee here
today have clearly stipulated the qualifications of candidates for
Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the requirements for candidates of
Chief Executive are:
</P>
<P>
-- They must be Chinese citizens of not less than 40 years of
age;
</P>
<P>
-- They should be permanent Hong Kong residents, who have
ordinarily lived in Hong Kong for 20 years in succession, and do
not have any right of abode in any foreign country;
</P>
<P>
-- They should support the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR and
pledge loyalty to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
not to hold any foreign passports.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that permanent Hong Kong residents
have rights of election and of being elected. Why should
candidates of Chief Executive be not less than 40 years of age?
</P>
<P>
Professor Xiao Weiyun, a well-known Chinese law expert, and
member of the Preparatory Committee, said this is because the
position of the Chief Executive is very important. He or she will
have very heavy tasks which needs a rich working experience and
capability.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive will shoulder 13 tasks, of leading the
government of the Hong Kong SAR and signing bills passed by the
Legislative Council, and promulgating laws and being responsible
for the implementation of the Basic Law and other laws which, in
accordance with the Basic Law, apply in the Hong Kong SAR and so
on.
</P>
<P>
A younger person could perhaps could not fulfil such tasks.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that during the discussion by a political system
panel of the committee for drafting the Basic Law, three age
levels were raised, 35, 40 and 45 years of age.
</P>
<P>
The panel held that 45 years of age for the Chief Executive was
too old. Since the head of state in China should be not less than
45 years of age, the age of the Chief Executive should not be same
as the Chinese President.
</P>
<P>
The 35 years of age for the Chief Executive is a little too
young. The majority of people on the panel held that a person of
not less than 40 years of age was comparatively suitable for Chief
Executive because he or she would have adequate work experience.

<HEADLINE> Qualifications for Candidates of Chief Executive of HK SAR (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As to the issue that the Chief Executive should have lived in
Hong Kong for not less than 20 years in succession, Xiao said this
stipulation was drawn up to do away with any worry among Hong Kong
residents that somebody from the mainland, who had lived in Hong
Kong for a short period of time, could become the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
Why should the Chief Executive have no right of abode in
foreign country? This issue was totally created by Britain which
unilaterally made a decision in 1989 to grant 50,000 Hong Kong
households, including 225,000 people, the right of abode in
Britain to change their nationalities.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Chinese and British sides reached an agreement in
December, 1984 on the Hong Kong residents' nationalities, and they
also exchanged memorandums.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum of the British side all persons who
on June 30, 1997 are, by virtue of a connection with Hong Kong,
British Dependent Territories Citizens (BDTCs) under the law in
force in the United Kingdom, will cease to be BDTCs with effect
from July 1, 1997, but will be eligible to retain an appropriate
status which, without conferring the right of abode in the United
kingdom, will entitle them to continue to use passports issued by
the UK.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of the Chinese Foreign Ministry stipulates that
under the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China, all
Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, whether they are holders of the
"British Dependent Territories Citizens' Passport" or not, are
Chinese nationals.
</P>
<P>
However, the British side unilaterally granted some Hong Kong
residents the right of abode in Britain, thus sabotaging the
agreement that the two sides reached. Therefore, the panel added
this provision to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Supporting the Basic Law means that the Chief Executive should
not only abide by the Basic Law, but also exert himself or herself
to safeguard and implement the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Attacks Government Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
today launched a major offensive on the Panjshir Valley, 150
kilometers north of Kabul, to attack the ousted government troops
led by Ahmad Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that both sides used heavy weapons
in the fighting which is still continuing at the mouth of the
valley.
</P>
<P>
No information about the casualties on both sides is available
so far.
</P>
<P>
Panjshir is the hometown of Masood who had a nickname of "lion
of Panjshir" during the period of anti-Soviet occupation from 1979
to 1989.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban captured Kabul on September 27 while Masood's
forces retreated northward to the Panjshir Valley, dynamiting and
mining the only road leading into the valley.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban did not give Masood a chance for
regrouping his army.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Taliban has captured some hills and high areas
overlooking Gulbahar, which guards access to the valley.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we clear the enemy from the distant ridge line, we
can advance," a Taliban commander said at the frontline.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that the Taliban had advanced into the
valley but was ambushed by Masood's men and retreated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Masood's soldiers dug in heavily inside the valley,
preparing for a final showdown with the Taliban.

<P>
Hao added the second for August First in the ninth minute on
a pass from teammate Lan Yijun on the left wing.
</P>
<P>
But only one minute later, Swede Patrik Svensson headed home
Wanda's first goal.
</P>
<P>
The two sides then ran to and fro just for several abortive
attempts in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Then came a one-sided second half.
</P>
<P>
Wanda dominated the game after the break, leaving no chance for
the August First. The equaliser came in the 62nd minute when Su
Wei netted on a pass from Wang Tao.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, defending champion Shanghai Shenhua
beat visiting Guangzhou Songri 2-0; Tianjin Samsung ousted
Guangdong Hongyuan 1-0; Jinan Taishan played to a 1-1 draw with
Shenzhen; Guangzhou Apollo drew with Yanbian Hyundai 1-1;
Sichuan Quanxing upset Beijing Guo'an 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, who topped the standings with an unmatched 43
points, would win the trophy two rounds to go in the
22-round home-and-away tournament if it prevailed over
Taishan next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Songri and Shenzhen, who finished last one-two with only 10 and
12 points respectively, are still on the verge of relegation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China has issued a new
regulation standardizing household remodeling, according to
sources with the China National Council of Light Industry.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid economic growth in China and improved living
standard, domestic remodeling work has become a new industry for
consumer goods, one with huge market potential, sources with the
council said.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 businesses around the country are involved in
the business, employing some two million people, and doing as much
as 60 billion yuan (7.2 billion US dollars) in business annually.
</P>
<P>
But, because of a lack of controls, there are many problems in
the industry, the sources say, so the regulation stipulates that
all those engaged in domestic remodeling work must be licensed,
and must have a certain amount of training.
</P>
<P>
The council is working on a pilot project in Shandong, Henan,
and Hebei provinces, and the results will be applied in other
parts of the country beginning next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan has invested almost 30
million US dollars in an across-strait scientific industrial
garden in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the use of the investment for the development
of hi-tech computers for children was signed during project talks
earlier in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The talks attracted 200 investors from 12 countries and regions,
with 81 cooperation projects available. Finally the talks led to
four agreements involving investments of up to 53 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The building of the Shenyang Across-Straits Scientific
Industrial Garden was approved by the State Council in 1995, as
one of the first group of industrial gardens to invite Taiwan
investment.
</P>
<P>
The garden, which will span five square kilometers, is
scheduled in two phases.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is targeted to be finished in
the year 2000, with yearly sales expected to reach five billion
yuan (about 602 million US dollars), with projected profits of one
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the whole garden in the year 2005, it
will make an annual sales return of up to 20 billion yuan (about
2.4 billion US dollars) and earn profits of six billion yuan each
year.

<HEADLINE> China Using Aerial-seeding to Improve Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Afforestation by aerial-seeding
has helped China remarkably increase forest coverage over the past
40 years.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory letter sent today to an on-going meeting
commemorating the 40th anniversary of China's first use of
aerial-seeding, Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun encouraged the
use of aerial-seeding to meet the goals of the national
afforestration plan for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Xu Youfang, forestry minister, said at the meeting that the
total areas afforested through the use of aircraft in 931 counties
and cities have accounted for one-fourth of the country's
afforestration since 1949 when New China was born.
</P>
<P>
China first tested aerial-seeding in 1956, and did its first
successful seeding three years later in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the country now has 27 aerial-seeded
forests, covering areas of about 10 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
China has been successful in desert control through
aerial-seeding as well, something that has caused a senior UN
official to comment that Chinese aerial-seeding experts should be
invited to control the deserts in Africa, said Xu.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says It Arrests Turkish Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities announced
here today that it has arrested an agent of the Turkish
Intelligence Agency in Orumiyeh, western Iran.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA quoted an official from the
Iranian Information Ministry said the agent was arrested before he
was to carry out his mission.
</P>
<P>
However, IRNA did not reveal the name and identity of the
Turkish agent.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish diplomat in Tehran told Xinhua that the embassy did
not know anything about the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Iran made two similar charges against Turkey in April. However,
Turkey denied both of them. The two countries also expelled
diplomats from each other side then.
</P>
<P>
The information official said "the spy, guided by certain
Turkish political currents, which also have influence on the
Intelligence Agencies of Turkey, had brought into Iran a
significant amount of brochures and pamphlets of Turkey's
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)."
</P>
<P>
The official added that the spy had confessed that he was to
stay in Orumiyeh as a tourist and take pictures of a number of
places to send them to Turkey and describe the places as the PKK
positions in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The idea was to launch a new wave of propaganda campaign
against Iran, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Collects Funds for Road Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is considering to raise
prices of oil products, in an effort to collect funds for the
rehabilitation of its poor roads, the "Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said a plan for the establishement of a road
renovation fund has been endorsed by the federal Ministry of
Works and Housing (FMW&AMP;H) and is to be approved by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
The planned fund will draw the bulk of its resource from oil
products sales, with the rest coming from road tolls and general
tax incomes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria boasted one of the best road networks in Africa during
its oil prosperity in 1970s. However, poor maintenance in the
past years have left most of its roads in a miserable condition.
</P>
<P>
Today's Guardian also carries a separate photo report on the
Benin-Shagamu expressway, one of the busiest and once the best
highways in the country, showing long queues of cars stranded in
muddy pits and weary passengers waiting on road side.
</P>
<P>
An estimate by the World Bank (WB) says that poor roads is
costing Nigeria nearly 153 billion Naira (about 1.92 billion
U.S.Dollars) a year in vehicle damages and other losses, or 5.5
percent of its Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
It is the WB who advocated the set up of the road fund as part
of Nigeria's Road Recovery Program (RRP), which is estimated to
cost 1,800 billion Naira, or about 20 billion U.S.Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's calculation, a six Naira hike per
litre will be sufficient for the maitenance of roads, and 15
Naira for the implementation of RRP.

<HEADLINE> Five Declare Intention to Run for HK Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- With the fifth plenary session
of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR held in Beijing
over the weekend, the candidacy for the SAR chief executive has
become a much-talked topic in Hong Kong. So far five prominent
figures have declared their intention to run for the post.
</P>
<P>
A document on the method for selecting the first chief
executive of the Hong Kong SAR was adopted at the session in
Beijing yesterday, which clearly stipulates the qualifications of
candidates for chief executive.
</P>
<P>
In May, Lo Tak-shing, 61, member of the Preparatory Committee
of the Hong Kong SAR, told local media that he had the intention
to run for the post. According to local press reports, Lo said
recently that he will make the decision at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
In early September, 67-year-old Chief Justice Ti Liang Yang
made public his intention to compete for chief executive, and he
resigned from the post of chief justice on September 6.
</P>
<P>
On September 19, Vice-Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of
the Hong Kong SAR Tung Chee-hwa, 58, announced that he was
"actively considering and preparing" to run for the post.
</P>
<P>
Former High Court judge Arthur Garcia, 72, expressed his wish
to run for chief executive on September 25. He said that his
friends encouraged him to compete for the post and he himself was
also interested in the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Hospital Authority chairman Woo Kwong-ching, 51, made
an announcement on September 30, saying that he will try to be
nominated as a candidate for the post. On the second day he
published his preliminary political plan for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life in Hong Kong held that it is a
good thing for several or more candidates to run for the post,
more candidates mean a wider choice for the Selection Committee
for the first government of the Hong Kong SAR.

hands a couple of times during colonial rules of France and Italy,
two former major colonial powers in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian security
official today denied that the Palestinians had agreed to
establish security areas near the Israeli army's positions in the
Gaza Strip, which the Palestinian police would prevent
demonstrators from entering.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Razaq Majaydeh, head of the Palestinian Civil Police in
the Gaza Strip, told Palestinian Radio that the reports saying
that the buffer zones would separate forces at friction areas were
Israeli "fabrications."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israeli media reported that Israeli and
Palestinian police commanders toured possible friction sites in
the Gaza Strip during the weekend, and marked off 300-meter areas
as the suffer zones.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the move, ordered by Israeli army's Southern
Command Shlomo Yanai, was meant to keep rioters physically away
from Israeli troops, who have braced themselves for another round
of violent protests should new negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
Last month, during violent clashes in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which included exchanges of fires between the Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian police, more than 70 people were killed
and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the confrontations, Israel and the
Palestinians agreed to hold a new round of continuous
negotiations, starting this evening at the Erez checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip, to solve their differences.

<HEADLINE> Growth In Inner Mongolia's Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 6 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia's
generating capacity was 5.85 million kw in 1995, 50 percent more
than the 1990 figure, a local official said in an interview with
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), the region
spent 1.23 billion yuan on construction in the sector, 5.2 times
that of the Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-1990), the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Cong Peimo, an official with the Inner Mongolia Electric Power
Administration, said that over the past five years, five
200,000-kw and four 100,000-kw generating units have been put into
operation in the region, with a total installed generating
capacity of 1.87 million kw.
</P>
<P>
The wind-power industry has been expanded to a total generating
capacity of more than 9,000 kw, the official said, and the region
has also expanded power transmission lines in the past few
years. By the end of 1995, it had built 8,128 kilometers of
transmission lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, it has generated a total of 118.5
billion kwh of electricity, with an annual increase of 13.4
percent, 12.5 billion kwh of which were used by the North China
power grid, he said. The power industry has earned the region two
billion yuan in the past five years.

<HEADLINE> PLA General Calls for Improved Armed Forces Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- General Zhang Zhen,
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, says that
the people's militia in northwest China should make greater
contributions to the region's security, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came during a recent inspection of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, and Qinghai and Gansu Provinces in the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
China has a principle of combining the efforts of a standing
army and strong reserve forces in national defense, the senior
army officer said, while noting that although China has political
and economic stability, social progress and unity among ethic
groups, people should also be vigilant in peace time. In doing so,
he added, the overall strength of the national defense will be
improved.
</P>
<P>
The most important principle that the military and reserves
should stick to during development of a market economy is that the
party commands the armed forces, he stressed. Leading and
commanding power should always be in the hands of the Communist
Party of China and the armed forces should submit to the CPC
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces should reflect their civilian and military
connection, combine production with military activities, and help
ordinary people overcome difficulties. They should be the shock
troops in eliminating poverty, in construction projects, and in
disaster relief, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> China protests US charging Textile Quotas (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reporter: The official of the U.S. Trade Representative Office
said that they've heard this (lack-of-evidence charge) every time
they take an enforcement action and he said the United States has
followed the terms of bilateral textile agreement. What is your
comment?
</P>
<P>
Li: The U.S. side has been cutting off China's quota for the
third consecutive year since 1994, with the reduction being 1.43
million dozens in 1994, 1.83 million dozens in 1995 and 190,000
dozens in 1996. However, the U.S. side failed to provide clear
evidence to underpin its claim that the products were from China
in most of the cases it listed for quota reduction. This of
course met China's opposition.
</P>
<P>
For example: In 1994, the U.S. side accused Chinese businesses
of shipping cultural T shirt components to the Dominican Republic,
and then illegally transshipping them to the US after processing,
and thus reducing China's quota by 1.43 million dozens. At that
time, the so-called evidence the U.S. side offered for most of the
cases were that some employees in Dominican factories claimed the
T shirt components were from China. The Chinese side lodged
strong opposition, and especially after China presented the
results of investigations which showed the Dominican factories
actually belonged to a third country and most of the components
came from that country, the U.S. side made correction to its
quota-back decision, and compensated half of the quota that had
already been cut off.
</P>
<P>
Reporter: Will the Chinese side make further reactions to the
U.S. quota reduction this year?
</P>
<P>
Li: The Chinese position has already been made clear by the
spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation. We hope the U.S. side will revoke its decision, in
the spirit of developing Sino-U.S. trade ties. Trade friction
does nobody any good, but harms the interests of both sides. As
long as the U.S. side has the sincerity to settle disputes, we are
willing to once again hold consultations, in light of the spirit
of the bilateral agreement, and work for a satisfactory
conclusion. Yet if it insists on continuing trade friction, the
Chinese side has no other option but be obliged to reciprocate to
the very end.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Braian Hudson Production
will shoot a 100-minute film in Tanzania's Mainland and Zanzibar
from December this year, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The film will be made by Anglo-Tanzanian partnership and be
completed late in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the producer of the film, Braian Hudson, who was
in the country recently for final arrangements, the movie would
show life of a young orphanned Maasai boy who was taken to
America from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"This Maasai boy is currently a talented film star in
Hollywook. We are expecting him early next month," a project
co-ordinator of the film, Abdallah Jabir, said.
</P>
<P>
Hudson explained, the film is called Maasai because the Maasai
have a unique life style unchanged for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
While in the country, Hudson visited potential film locations
in Tanzania. enditem

<HEADLINE> Powerful Explosion Rocks Bordeaux Mayor's Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A powerful explosion seriously
damaged Bordeaux mayor's office Saturday night. No fatalities were
reported.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion so far and
police refuse to speculate at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The bomb pulled down the windows of the mayor's office up to
the third floor and destroyed all the French windows facing the
saloons of the reception hall, where Prime Minister Alain Juppe
had just met with local officials on Saturday morning and where a
Franco-British summit was scheduled to take place on November 7-8.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which took place at 11:41 p.m. (2141 GMT)
Saturday, a few hours after Juppe quit the city, was preceded by a
smoke rising from the ground exterior to the 18th century
building, according to a witness.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the bomb could be made from either plastic
explosive or dynamite, instead of a gas canister frequently used
by Basque terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Juppe returned to the southwestern city from Paris this morning
to inspect the damage and expressed his indignation over the
attack.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he was not "the kind of man who let
himself be intimidated."
</P>
<P>
He will meet Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre and Justice
Minister Jacques Toubon to discuss possible measures.
</P>
<P>
On September 7, an explosive engine made of a gas canister went
off in the suburb of Bordeaux and on June 27, a similar bomb
exploded at a government building in the city.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu on Talks with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said today that the Israeli army's
redeployment in Hebron and general security arrangement are the
two main issues on the agenda of the new negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Likud party in Tel Aviv,
Netanyahu said Israel plans to maintain the Jewish presence in
Hebron and preserve the holy sites in the disputed West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
The premier said no target date had been set for the
conclusion of the talks, which is due to start this evening at
the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the talks will end only once all security
issues, created by the recent violent clashes between Israel and
the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, are resolved.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Netanyahu, Foreign Minister David Levy and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also held consultations with
the Israeli steering committee to finalize the country's position
on this evening's negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the Erez talks, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and U.S. Middle East special coordinator Dennis Ross
arrived in Israel this morning, in an effort to help Israel and
the Palestinians to resolve their problems.
</P>
<P>
Ross will participate in the opening session of the
negotiations, which is due to start at 8:00 p.m. local time
(1800GMT) at the Israeli side of the Erez checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Christopher is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu
this afternoon, and then travel to the Gaza Strip to hold talks
with Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. secretary of state is not going to
participate in the Erez negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians, and plans to leave Israel Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, U.S. President Bill Clinton has
said that he expected "positive results" from the Erez talks.
</P>
<P>
In a message delivered to Arafat in Gaza today by Edward
Abington, U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem, Clinton praised the
Palestinian leader for his effort for the peace process, adding
the U.S. will do all it can to advance the process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told reporters this morning that the Palestinian will
raise the Hebron redeployment, the Hasmonean Tunnel, the passage
route between the West Bank and Gaza Strip and other issues at
the Erez talks.
</P>
<P>
As one of the results of the emergency summit in Washington
last week, Israel and the Palestinians agreed to hold continuous
talks, starting today, to solve their differences in
implementing the Oslo accord between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The summit was called by Clinton, in an attempt to resuscitate
the peace process following armed confrontation between Israel
and the Palestinians, which was triggered off by the opening of
the Hasmonean Tunnel near the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in
Jerusalem's Old City last month.
</P>
<P>
more than 70 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded
During the confrontation, the most serious in many years, which
included exchanges of fires between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the Washington summit, Clinton said
while the crisis has not be resolved and the parties remained
far apart, the Washington summit had succeeded in returning them
to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his hope that the two sides would continue
their negotiations and implement the Oslo accords, so as to move
forward the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Newspaper Rejects No-Fly Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 6 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi newspaper today
called on countries of the world, especially the United Nations
Security Council member states, to turn into a U.N. resolution
their rejection of imposing no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra, mouthpiece of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party, said, "Iraq, as it stresses its conclusive rejection of
the no-fly zones, does exercise a sovereign right that can be
disputed by none. Added to this is the fact that the no-fly zones
are contrary to the U.N. Charter and there is no mention of it
in any of the U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the United States, the paper pointed out, "Some
big powers have expressed their apprehensions about the
emergence of the phenomenon of exceeding international
legitimacy exercised by the United States."
</P>
<P>
"Many countries of the world and a number of political
analysts have considered the no-fly zones a violation of
international law by Washington, a threat to the security and
stability of the world, and weakening of the U.N. role ... which
is something unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of
nations of the world," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq's rejection of the no-fly zones will last until
transgression of Iraqi territory and airspace comes to an end,
and until the U.S. refrains from its aggressive and provocative
actions that violate the sovereignty of a founding member of the
U.N.," Al-Thawra concluded.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq were imposed by
the U.S., Britain and France after the 1991 Gulf War and the
areas are policed by the U.S.-led allied aircraft.

GUIYANG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Underdeveloped parts of southwest
China's Guizhou Province have succeeded in increasing forest
coverage from 8.5 to 16.4 percent, and have doubled grain output
with funds provided by the World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
The WFP has given 19.47 million US dollars in free economic aid
to help Guizhou change low-yield farmland, control soil erosion,
and develop multi-purpose agriculture since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Half of Zhijin and Nayong counties' eroded fields have been
improved thanks to afforestation on 40 hectares of land, and
annual per capita income of local farmers has increased two-fold.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive agricultural development project in Tongren
Prefecture started in May this year to improve 1,300 hectares of
eroded land and to help raise the living standard of 250,000
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
Li accused the US side of not holding full consultations with
China before announcing to "charge" textile quotas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has conducted serious and responsible
investigations of nine cases, which were submitted by the US side
on October, 1995. And with help of customs of the third side,
China also made investigations into involved businessmen, both in
and out of the Chinese mainland, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that in most of the cases, the US's charges
were untenable, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and the US held the first consultation in Beijing on
March 25-27, 1996, in which the two sides checked every
case. China provided all results of investigations to the US side,
and requested it to provide further evidence.
</P>
<P>
In the consultations the two sides agreed to make further
investigations respectively, and to provide evidence to each
other, since the US's original material lacked convincing evidence
to prove that the goods were originated in China.
</P>
<P>
On April 7, the US side only provided the time when goods in
Case 7B were imported into the US, and said they were contacting
Hong Kong Customs to get evidence concerning Case 3A.
</P>
<P>
The US side said they would inform China as soon as they had
results.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, China provided the US side with the results of
further investigation carried out after March, and asked it to
provide more evidence for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
But up to now, the US side has not provided any new evidence,
and has not replied to China's requests, and on September 6, they
unilaterally announced the charge, Li said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JPHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African Defence
Forces (SANDF) has been working with offices from other African
armies to prepare for peacekeeping operations, a local newspaper
"The Sunday Independent" reported.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF recently completed a seminar, a practical planning
course, which was attended by officers from Southern African
Developent Community (SADC) countries and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Military officers attached to the Inter-State Defence and
Security Committee of SADC,which was formed earlier this year,
were also joined the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation comes at a time of closer security ties
between countries in Southern Africa, with the establish- ment of
an SADC security organ.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which was partly funded by the Norwegian
government,is the prelude to a practical peacekeeping wargame
which will involved infantry, artillery and armour from South
African army.
</P>
<P>
Military officers from other African countries will be
involved in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
United Nations officials and experts have been involved in the
seminar,helping the SANDF prepare for peacekeeping, although
official government policy is not yet ready for a major
commitment to African peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. secretary of state Warren Christopher will visit Africa
next week to drum up support for an American and
European-financed African-peacekeeping force,the news paper said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will try to sell a U.S. plan to organize, train,
equip and help deploy an all-African force of 10,000 troops,

<P>
Among the nine cases, the US side provided evidence for part of
the quantity of only four, of alleged connections between Chinese
enterprises and the transshipped goods.
</P>
<P>
For the remaining cases, the American side only provided case
introductions, US customs' records, shipping bills and receipts
from US importers or from entry transshippers from a third country
or a region, as well as their allegations that the goods had come
from China.
</P>
<P>
The American side failed to provide any clear evidence in
accordance with the agreement to prove that the goods were
originally made in China. This can be clearly seen in the
following examples:
</P>
<P>
In Case No.1, the Americans alleged that 19,440 dozens of men's
knitwear transshiped by an Italian company were of Chinese orgin.
</P>
<P>
Their only evidence is a piece of an illegible bill of lading,
showing that the goods were shipped to the US from Hong Kong via
Italy. The Italian businessmen wrote on the bill that the goods
were made in China by a factory called "Venture of Shanghai".
</P>
<P>
Investigations by the Chinese side shows that there is no such
enterprise with the name "Venture of Shanghai" in China.
</P>
<P>
The bill of lading showed that the goods declared to the
Italian customs for transit to the US on December 10, 1990, but
the batch of goods charged by the American side arrived on
December 28, 1990, and May 10 and 23, 1991 respectively.

It will be chaired by ASEAN Director-General Abdul Majid Khan
from Malaysia and will be looking at various projects, programs,
financing and budgeting, ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh said
today at the end of the dialogue session.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is ASEAN's 11th dialogue partner and the only multilateral
regional organization having that status, besides the European
Union (EU) which is an inter-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
From an initial allocation of two million US dollars in 1977,
ASEAN today has received more than 30 million US dollars from UNDP
in technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Ajit said the UNDP is in a unique position to continue to
assist ASEAN as it has no hidden agenda and seeks only to assist
ASEAN in reaching higher levels of development and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Some of the programs assisted by UNDP have really helped ASEAN
to strengthen regional cooperation and integration, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the dialogue, both sides discussed their next cycle of
programs under the ASEAN Sub-regional Program for the Fifth Cycle,
goals and priority areas, Ajit said.

<P>
In Case No. 2, the Americans accused two businessmen outside
the Chinese mainland of transshipping 520 dozens of men's wool
suits to the US.
</P>
<P>
The sole evidence presented by the American side was the
statement of the two businessmen that their goods were made by a
Xiong Wei Garment Factory and Guangzhou Zengcheng Yixin Garment
Factory, based in Foshan and Guangzhou cities in China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, however, the Chinese side could find
no Xiong Wei Garment Factory in Foshan, and the Yixin Garment
Factory never produced any men's wool suits, nor ever had any
business relations with the two businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Investigation by the customs of the third party also ended
without obtaining any evidence that could prove the goods were
originated in China.
</P>
<P>
Case No. 7, in which the US alleged that a US importer
transhipped 2120 dozens of women's knitwear to the US via
Mongolia, was based on the statement of a Mongolian company that
the items were made somewhere in China without any evidence.
</P>
<P>
The obvious lack of evidence and clues made it impossible for
the Chinese side to probe the case.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side presented the investigation results of all the
cases to the US side on April 26.

<P>
Reporter: The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that "the results of China's
investigations proved that some of the cases were plotted by
importers and traders of a third country or region, China's
enterprises were innocent in the whole deal." Please tell me more
about it.
</P>
<P>
Li: The Sino-US bilateral agreement made it clear that when
dealing with illegal trans-shipments, both sides should define the
responsibilities of the importer and the exporter. But the
US side imposed reductions on China's quota without defining
responsibilities as required by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
For example, in case No. 8, the US charged that two Chinese
enterprises in Guangxi and Guangdong trans-shipped 5,248
dozens of women's cotton trousers to the US through businessmen
outside the Chinese mainland, with "made in Mongolia" labels, and
forged Mongolian certificates of origin.
</P>
<P>
But according to China's investigations, when the trousers were
exported, the contracts stipulated "the goods should not be
shipped to countries which have bilateral textile agreements with
China." In addition, upon exportation, most of the goods had the
labels "Made in China", and some of them were neutrally packed,
but without "made in Mongolia" labels.
</P>
<P>
Prior to exportation, all the goods had been inspected by the
State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export
Commodities, all the packages, markings, and labels accorded with
MOFTEC's regulation on the prohibition of illegal textile
transshipment.
</P>
<P>
It was lawbreaking businessmen outside the Chinese mainland
that attached "made in Mongolia" labels on them, and forged
Mongolian certificates of origin, and trans-shipped them to US.
Chinese enterprises can not be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
The investigations of the authorities concerned also showed
that three companies, listed as exporters outside the Chinese
mainland in US importers' declaration to the US customs, were
freight transport companies which were not engaged in textile
trading. This also cast doubt on the authenticity of the proof
provided by US importers.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the trans-shipment of the goods was thoroughly a
conspiracy by the US importers and lawbreaking businessmen outside
the Chinese mainland, while Chinese enterprises were innocent.
</P>
<P>
This was not the only case in point. The US side was reluctant
to pinpoint responsibilities, refrained from punishing the
lawbreakers, but was quick to penalize the law-abiders and charge
China's quota. All these were in violation of the agreement.

<HEADLINE> China lodges Protest Against US Charging Textiles Quotas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of the answers to Xinhua given by Mr. Li Dongsheng, director of
the Trade Administration Department of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, in response to press reports about
US charging China's textiles quotas.
</P>
<P>
Reporter: The Chinese and overseas media have widely reported
the US Trade Representative Office's decision to charge China's
textiles quotas. Chinese export enterprises have shown great
concern about this. Could you tell me about this new development?
</P>
<P>
Li: The US Trade Representative's Office unilaterally announced
the decision on September 6 to charge China's textiles quota for
1996, 195,001 dozens and 134,029 kilograms in 13 categories, and
triple charge five of the categories, without conducting full
consultations with the Chinese side and without providing clear
evidence in accordance with the Sino-US Textiles Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The charging action taken by the US government has seriously
violated the Sino-US textiles agreement, and has aroused strong
protests from the Chinese government and Chinese export
enterprises. This move has also met opposition from American
businessmen who are engaged in US-China trade, according to
American press reports. Some Americans criticized the charging
move as "political maneuvering in a presidential election year."
</P>
<P>
Reporter: According to American press reports, a US Trade
Representative official said that the American side made the
decision of charging quotas based on evidence gleaned by US
customs, and the Chinese government has not yet provided evidence
to refute the evidence provided by the American side.
</P>
<P>
The American side insists that their charging is consistent
with the bilateral agreement on textiles between the two
countries. What is your comment about this?
</P>
<P>
Li: The remarks made by the US Trade Representative official
are not true. We have full reason to show that the American
charging this time has violated the bilateral agreement on
textiles between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sino-US Textiles Agreement, in handling cases of
illegal transhipment, the parties should endeavor to clarify the
circumstances of any such instances of circumvention or alleged
circumvention, including the respective roles of the exporters or
importers involved. The agreement also stipulates that only in
case where clear evidence regarding circumvention, including the
country or place of true origin and the circumstances of the case,
has been provided, can the United States have the right to charge
the Chinese quota. With regard to triple charging, the agreement
has also made it a rule that the American side must provide clear
evidence, such as an export declaration from the People's Republic
of China, bills of landing, invoices, contracts or other relevant
information, and the American charging action can only be taken
after consultation with the Chinese side. But the American side
neither fully consulted with the Chinese side, nor provided clear
evidence about the charging. This action is absolutely
inconsistent with the bilateral agreement between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Bans Blind Import of Health Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, Otober 6 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of Nigeria
has banned the indiscriminate importation of health equipment in
a bid to ensure that only safe healthcare equipment is bought
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to the ''Sunday Times'' newspaper today, the Hhead
of State, General Sani Abacha, has approved the move which is
also geared toward encouraging local production of needed
facilities and promoting maintenance service.
</P>
<P>
A standardization committee has already been set up in the
Health Ministry to ensure that obsolete equipment is not
imported into the country.
</P>
<P>
''We are sanitising the industry. There is a policy banning the
importation of these second-hand facilities,'' said Health
Minister Ihechukwu Madubuike, quoted by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Currently a nationwide examination of all health equipment is
underway in Nigeria and the Health Ninistry is emphasizing
maintenance services to help cut cost, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
''Whoever wants to sell equipment to the healthcare sector in
the country must guarantee maintenance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
As some foreign companies sold equipment without any provision
for maintenance, many facilities in most of teaching hospitals in
Nigeria have become non-functional shortly after installation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Opposition Party Agrees to Be Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's opposition Party
Melayu Semangat 46 (known as S46) today voted unanimously to
dissolve the party at an extraordinary general assembly here to
pave the way for its 400,000 members to join the United Malays
National Organization (UMNO) en bloc.
</P>
<P>
About 500 S46 delegates voted here in favor of a resolution to
dissolve the party, which was tabled by its Deputy President Rais
Yatim.
</P>
<P>
S46 is the first political party in the Malaysian history to be
dissolved voluntarily through the process of law.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in his speech at the meeting, S46 President Tengku
Razaleigh Hamzah asked party members to accept the reality that
the UMNO is now supported by the majority of Malays and the
people.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, S46 members need to join UMNO in order to work
with other Malays in the interest of their religion, race and the
country, he said in his speech which carried the theme of "Towards
True Malay Unity."
</P>
<P>
S46 was a UMNO splinter party formed in 1988 with the objective
of reviving the original UMNO after the latter was de-registered
that year. In the same year, a new UMNO party was registered under
the leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, which drew most
of the membership of the old UMNO.
</P>
<P>
The S46 president said that after two general elections, the
issue of reviving the original UMNO is no longer a key political
issue in the country.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Privatise Key Economic Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will privaties its key
economic sectors such as oil, telecommunications and energy in
the next few years, its Finance and Economic Development Minister
Chief Anthony Ani has announced.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the announcement in Washington at the
opening of the Board of Governors Meeting of the World Bank (WB)
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The move is believed to be a response to the WB and IMF's
decision to reudce Nigeria's debt by 67 percent if its current
economic reform continues for the next two years, and another 80
percent if the reform lasts for three more years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nigeria announced the removal of a 21 percent
interest rate ceiling. The minister explained that all these are
part of a program to revamp Nigeria's ailing economy and put it
on the path of growth.
</P>
<P>
In the oil sector, the lifeline of the country's economy, the
minister said foreign investors will be invited to form a
partnership with the Nigerian government to manage the nation's
refineries for a period of two years, after which the government
will sell its shares to private individuals in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here indicates that Nigeria has already
started contacts with Exxon, Mobil and Shell oil corporations for
the privatising of its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister claimed that Nigeria's move has attracted
tremendous positive reactions from international businesses and
were greatly welcomed by the WB and IMF. enditem

<HEADLINE> South Korea Not to Import Extra Rice Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea, predicting bumper
rice harvests this year, will not need to import foreign rice more
than required under the World Trade Organization's minimum market
access (MMA) provisions next year, Agriculture and Forestry
Minister Kang Wun-tae said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kang said that a preliminary survey showed this year's rice
harvests will reach 5.07 million tons, an amount representing an
increase of 377,000 tons over last year.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the unprecedented rice harvests, there will be
absolutely no rice imports next year in addition to those required
under the MMA clause," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's rice stock will reach 432,000 tons at the end of
1997 compared with the estimated stock of 400,000 tons at the end
of this month, Kang said.
</P>
<P>
The expected stock, though being less than the 792,000 tons
recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the
United Nations, will cause no problem in meeting the country's
demand, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The 76,300 tons of rice South Korea is set to import next year
under the MMA requirement will be purchased in a fair and
transparent international bidding, Kang said, adding that imported
rice will be used for industrial purpose or government consumption
so that it will have no impact on farmers' rice price.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Open Appeal Trial of Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The appeal trial of former South
Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, as well as their
followers, will open at the Seoul High Court on Monday, court
officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
On August 26, the Seoul District Court sentenced respectively
Chun to death and Roh to 22 and a half years of imprisonment on
charges of mutiny, treason and bribery.
</P>
<P>
The court also fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and Roh 355
million dollars, which represented the amount of the bribes they
allegedly accumulated while in office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sentences ranging from four to 10 years were given
to 13 former South Korean officers who helped the two
ex-presidents in their quest for power.
</P>
<P>
Both Chun and Roh, as well as their followers, appealed their
cases to the Seoul High Court on August 30 as they refused to
accept the verdicts made by the Seoul District Court.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges stemmed from the roles played by
the two former presidents, their cronies in the military coup on
December 12, 1979 and the suppression of the civil uprising in
Kwangju, capital of the country's South Cholla Province, on May
18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and passed the presidency
to his friend Roh in February 1988, who stepped down in February
1993.
</P>
<P>
According to South Korean law, an appeal trial has to be
completed within four months after the sentence is handed down by
the lower court and the final decision by the Supreme Court has to
be made within four months of the completion of the appeal trial.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Spokesman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Senior Janata Dal leader
Jaipal Reddy on Saturday resigned as spokesman of both the United
Front government and his party, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his resignation at a press conference, the veteran
Janata Dal leader, who is believed to be close to former prime
minister V.P. Singh, said that it was his "personal decision."
</P>
<P>
Although Reddy parried all questions about why he resigned, it
is understood that he has been feeling neglected by the leadership
of the ruling United Front.
</P>
<P>
One reason cited by the local press reports is Prime Minister
H.D. Deve Gowda's indifference toward him.
</P>
<P>
Although Reddy's name figured for the post of deputy chairman
of the Planning Commission of the government and other key
positions, nothing came in hand.
</P>
<P>
Reddy said he will remain in the Janata Dal and indicated that
he wanted to be a "columnist" in newspapers and magazines.

<HEADLINE> New System to Prevent Car Thefts Created in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli high-tech company
has created a system which can effectively prevent thieves from
stealing vehicles from any designated area.
</P>
<P>
The device, named as Centurion vehicle-recognition system, is
one of the latest new products developed by Zamir Recognition
System Ltd. which specializes in developing electro-optic systems
for civilian and military markets.
</P>
<P>
This could be a good news for the shopping centers and other
large enterprises which hope to provide safe parking for
customers and employees in order to increase business.
</P>
<P>
The Centurion system is assembled with imported cameras,
lenses and housings and Zamir's own special software. When a car
enters a parking area, a camera "reads" the license plate, records
the port of entry, screens any undesirables lurking in the shadows
and protects the car from being stolen.
</P>
<P>
The infrared lighting and video camera work in any weather and
at any time of day; they register not only the license plates but
also the face of the driver. It can recognize any alphanumeric
plate and even dirty or somewhat damaged ones. It does so for any
multi-passenger vehicle, from a car to a bus or truck.
</P>
<P>
When the driver wants to leave the area, the security official
in charge looks at a computer screen and compares the face of the
incoming driver with the license number and he particulars of
the vehicle with that of the driver who wants to exit. If these
do not match, the gate does not open and the authorities may be
alerted. This prevents someone from entering a lot with an old
car and trying to "trade it in" for a newer model.
</P>
<P>
What if the family members of the car driver want to
use the car in some cases? Don't worry. The driver can
provide the photos of his family members or others authorized
to drive the car to the company, which will store them in
the computer memory so that all of them can take the
vehicle out.
</P>
<P>
At present, the comparison of the drivers' photos is done by a
guard watching a computer; in the future, the job can also be
done by the computer which will automatically compare the photos,
thus reducing the need for manpower even further.
</P>
<P>
Early applications in several places have proven to be
successful and effective. To boost its fight against widespread
car thefts by the Palestinians, Israeli police have purchased the
system to be installed at the checkpoints between Israel and the
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Zamir is also applying to a tender for securing vehicles
in Barcelona's international airport. The company also expected
that the business would expand quickly in five years.

<HEADLINE> China Protests US Charging Textiles Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade official
said here today that the US recent decision to charge China's
textiles quotas is unreasonable and should be revoked.
</P>
<P>
Li Dongsheng, director of the Trade Administration Department
of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(Moftec), made the statement here today when commenting on the US
Trade Representative Office's decision to charge China's textiles
quotas.
</P>
<P>
The US Trade Representative Office unilaterally announced the
decision September 6 to charge China's textiles quotas for 1996,
195,001 dozens and 134,029 kilograms in 13 categories, and triple
charge five of the categories.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the decision has been made without conducting full
consultations with the Chinese side and without providing clear
evidence, as stipulated in the Sino-US Textiles Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The charging action taken by the US government has seriously
violated the Sino-US textiles agreement, and has aroused strong
protests from the Chinese government and Chinese export
enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
This move has also met opposition from American businessmen who
are engaged in US-China trade, according to American press
reports, Li said, adding that some Americans criticized the
charging move as "political maneuvering in a presidential election
year."
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has every reason to say that the American
charging has violated the agreement on textiles between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side has been cutting China's textiles quotas for
three consecutive years since 1994, with the reduction being 1.43
million dozens in 1994, 1.83 million dozens in 1995 and 190,001
dozens in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, Li said, the U.S. side failed to provide clear
evidence to underpin its claim that the products were from China
in most of the cases it listed for quotas reduction. This of
course has met China's opposition.
</P>
<P>
Li continued that China's position was made very clear by the
Moftec spokesman not long ago. China hopes the U.S. side will
revoke its decision, in the spirit of developing Sino-U.S. trade
ties, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that trade friction does nobody any good, but harms the
interests of both sides. As long as the U.S. side has the
sincerity to settle disputes, China is willing to once again hold
consultations, in light of the spirit of the bilateral textiles
agreement, and work for a satisfactory settlement.
</P>
<P>
However, Li said, if the US insists on continuing trade
friction, the Chinese side has no other option but be obliged to
reciprocate to the very end.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Airline to Promote Business Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Royal Jordanian (RJ), Jordan's
national carrier, has concluded an agreement with a
Bahrain-based agency to serve as its primary advertizing agent.
</P>
<P>
RJ's Vice-President for Commercial Affairs Majdi Sabri signed
the contract here Saturday with Fares Abu Hamad from the
advertising agency, Afkar Promo Seven.
</P>
<P>
Majdi Sabri said in a statement which is available here today
that the agency will undertake all of the airline's promotional
work including that of foreign travel agents.
</P>
<P>
"RJ is about to enter a new stage of development and this
agreement is part of the endeavor (in terms of) the airline's
new marketing objectives," Sabri said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides must concur on the type
and forms of advertising and promotional programs, he added,
noting that the airline has spent 1 million U.S. dollars on
advertising and promotional services.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that political developments in the Middle East
have negatively affected the tourist industry, referring to the
events in Lebanon, the political power shifts in Israel and the
stalled Mideast peace process in general.
</P>
<P>
"We (have) received cancellations by tourist groups from
Europe who had originally intended to come to Jordan two months
ago and cancellations of fall reservations from the United
States," said Sabri.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was a 50 percent drop in reservations as
compared with the same period last year and that reservations
for 13,000 tourists on regular flights and 13,000 tourists on
chartered flights were canceled between May and November.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his hope that tourists groups will soon be arriving
in the kingdom, noting that the present period represents the
height of the tourist season.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major was urged on Saturday to
revive the Tories' electoral prospects by sacking Kenneth Clarke
as his chancellor, so he can deliver big tax cuts in next month's
budget and adopt a tougher stance on Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The Irish Republic Army is at "crucial point" in its
strategy and may call an Army Convention to discuss a new
ceasefire, even as fears of further bomb attacks in Britain
continue, said security sources in Belfast on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- A group of Tory parliament members, including Peter
Temple-Morris, is privately discussing how to co-operate with Tony
Blair in the event of a Labor victory and the capture of the
Conservative Party by a right-wing Eurosceptic leader.
</P>
<P>
Independent On Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- On the eve of the Conservative Party conference, Prime
Minister John Major told a press conference that he would "not
hesitate to say 'no' to ideas" that he believed "are wrong for
Europe as a whole, or wrong for the interests of the UK."
</P>
<P>
The Express On Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major boycotted a banquet at the
European Union summit in Dublin on Saturday night and flew back to

<HEADLINE> Grapefruit Juice Good for Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite of the claim that
grapefruit juice might cause death in certain medical cases, an
Israeli professor found out it helps increase anti-rejection
functions of transplant recipients.
</P>
<P>
The British medical journal The Lancet recently published an
article suspecting grapefruit juice of causing death in rare
cases when taken with certain drugs for hypertension, allergies
and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Michael David, head of the Dermatology
Department of Rabin Medical Center, wrote in the latest edition of
Skin Update that the grapefruit juice has been proven to have a
welcome advantage: it increases the concentration of cyclosporine
in the blood of patients who must take this very expensive
anti-rejection drug.
</P>
<P>
The effects of the grapefruit juice were tested on 14 healthy
volunteers who took cyclosporine. A control group took the pills
with orange juice or water instead of the grapefruit juice.
</P>
<P>
A day later, the cyclosporine concentration in their blood was
tested: those drinking the grapefruit juice had significantly
higher levels of the drug than the control group.
</P>
<P>
Cyclosporine is the most commonly used drug to prevent
rejection in organ-transplant recipients, but in recent years,
its use has also been prescribed for patients with
psoriasis. Since it is very expensive, the possibility of
increasing drug concentrations by taking the pills with
grapefruit is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Lancet article that juice contains
flavonoids that suppress cytochrome 450 which metabolizes
calcium-channel blockers, and are also responsible for the
metabolism of cyclosporine, Professor David said the juice
apparently does not increase cyclosporine concentration when the
drug is taken in its micro-emulsion (neo-oral) form.

<HEADLINE> 15 PKK Rebels Killed in Eastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- At least fifteen rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) were killed in the
military operation staged by the Turkish security forces in
eastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the security forces Saturday encircled
Maltepe village in Divrigi town in Sivas province where the PKK
militants have stayed and bombarded the area with armored
military helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia quoted military officials as saying that the
security forces are continuously staging the military operation
against the PKK rebels in this region with the support of F-16
fighters and Cobra helicopters and the death toll of the PKK
elements would be increased.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Sabah Daily reported today that four
soldiers of the Turkish security forces also died and 17 others
were wounded in the military operation against the PKK militants
who were encircled in the Maltepe village.
</P>
<P>
More than 21,000 people including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops have been killed in armed clashes since August
1984 when the PKK started a separatist war for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.

KATHMANDU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba has stressed women's role in the social and economic
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day seminar here Saturday on Nepal's
commitment to international declarations on women's development,
Deuba said the development of the country at large is not possible
without the participation of women.
</P>
<P>
Nepali women were deprived of opportunities to take part on a

Women should not be deprived of the rights enjoyed by men, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the conclusions of the seminar will be
included in the government's future development policy and the
programs of the forthcoming Ninth Five-Year Plan, which is
scheduled to begin next year, to enhance women's involvement in
the country's development.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the Nepal Family Planning
Association, was being attended by lawmakers, legal experts,

<HEADLINE> Kids Protest Air Pollution in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 Iranian children
staged a demonstration today in a protest against air pollution
in the country's capital Tehran, one of the most polluted
capitals in the world.
</P>
<P>
The kids, mostly aged between five and six, called on the
public and the government to eliminate the air pollution by
reducing the number of automobiles and increase the public
transportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Carrying placards reading "Voice Kids' View" and "Don't Stop
Us," the kids came from different areas and gathered in front of
a police department in central Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Putting masks on their mouths, the kids appealed to the Tehran
government for clean air instead of poisonous pollutants.
</P>
<P>
A police officer told Xinhua that this is the second of its
kind. Kids launched a similar demonstration the same time last
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the air pollution is a big problem affecting
health of the people, especially kids. But the police and the
government have not done anything yet to alleviate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that Tehran is facing serious air
pollution with two tons of lead entering the air every day. About
80 percent of the air pollution was caused by cars in the city.
</P>
<P>
There are some 3 million cars in the city, which has a
population of about 10 million. The percentage of polluted gas
in the air of the Iranian capital is some six times as much as
the permitted figure.
</P>
<P>
Specialists specified that 65 percent of the pollution in
Tehran is caused by vehicular exhaust, 24 percent is generated
by industries and service centers and 11 percent is attributed
to home water heaters.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the poisonous gas released by automobiles in
the city will cause various diseases related with liver, kidney,
brain, bones and muscles.
</P>
<P>
Long time ago experts have warned the citizens of the serious
air pollution and urged the Iranian government to take serious
measures to reduce air pollution in the city.

<HEADLINE> France to Strengthen Economic Ties with Saudis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 6 (Xinhua) -- French senior electricity
official Gilles Menage held meetings Saturday with a number of
Saudi officials in the Saudi city of Dhahran during which they
tackled ways of boosting economic and industrial cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Saudi Press Agency, the honorary president of the
state-run France Electricity Company held talks with Saudi
electricity chief of the Eastern Region Suleiman Al-Qadhi as well
as head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the region
Hamad Al-Zamil and head of the Saudi state-owned Arab Oil Company
(Aramco) Abdullah Juna on the first day of his week-long visit to
Saudi Arabia which would also take him to Riyadh, Jeddah and other
major cities in the oil-rich kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The agency said during his stay in Saudi Arabia, Menage would
also held talks with officials in charge of petrochemicals and
electricity sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he is expected to prepare for the prospective visit
of the French Industry Minister to Saudi Arabia in January to sign
an economic and industrial cooperation protocol between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The state-run news agency described Menage's visit to Saudi
Arabia as "significant" which would foster ties between both
countries in the economic, trade and investment fields.
</P>
<P>
The French electricity company had taken part in the
construction of power stations in the Saudi holy cities of Mecca
and Medina in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and France are linked by political, economic and
military relations.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac visited Saudi Arabia last July
when he met with Saudi King Fahd and a number of senior Saudi
officials.
</P>
<P>
France is also planning to set up around 20 new investment
projects in Saudi Arabia in cooperation with Saudi partners.
</P>
<P>
France is considered one of Saudi Arabia's major trading
partners and their two-way trade amounted to more than 4 billion
U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
There are 60 French companies in the kingdom while
investments in 40 joint ventures have reached over 1 billion
dollars.

American fellow and world No. 2 Michael Chang in the final of the
Singapore Open here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Much to the evident disappointment of the spectators,
top-seeded Chang failed to show his usual agility and found no way
to cope with Stark's fierce serves, timed at up to 210 kilometers
per hour, and well-placed shots.
</P>
<P>
Stark wrapped up the match in 72 minutes with two straight aces
from 30-30.
</P>
<P>
Stark broke Chang in the ninth game of the first set as Chang
double-faulted at 0-40. He then served out the set.
</P>
<P>
Stark, who is ranked 101st in the world, broke Chang's serve
again in the third game of the second set.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that the 25-year-old Stark had beaten
Chang, 24, in seven encounters. Chang had been seeking his 11th
title in Asia.

DHAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court A.T M. Afzal has turned down an application to block
the country's newly elected president Shahabuddin Ahmed from
taking oath of office Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Moves to Prevent Rebels Wrecking India Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 6 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lankan government has
moved to prevent the Tamil rebels from souring India-Sri Lanka
relations over the problem of refugees in the north of the
country, defense sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the government had taken up the issue of
refugees fleeing from the north to Indian shores, with the Tamil
Nadu authorities and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports said that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) was trying to turn the refugee crisis into an
international issue and even pumping money into operations to
smuggle refugees across the Palk Straits, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government has learnt through diplomatic channels that a
total of 2,520 refugees arrived in South India in August. There is
strong evidence most of them were forced to go to India by the
LTTE who even paid the boat charges.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that while Indian authorities had agreed to
look after the refugees already there, they had stressed that
steps should be taken to stem the influx.
</P>
<P>
In a preventive move, naval surveillance has been stepped up by
both countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Opposition to Table No-Confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition Labor
party is to table a no-confidence motion Monday against the
government over the recent Israeli-Palestinian bloody clashes.
</P>
<P>
Labor faction chairman Ra'anan Cohen was quoted as saying
today that he would file the motion in view of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's "failed and dangerous policy."
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (Parliament) is to reconvene Monday after the
week-long Jewish holiday of Succot. Netanyahu is expected to
deliver his political address at the opening session of the
Knesset on the current crisis between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Commenting over the recent Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed that
killed 75 people, including 15 Israeli soldiers, Cohen said that
"the tragic loss of life could have been prevented with the
correct forethought."
</P>
<P>
Cohen is currently holding intensive talks with all
opposition faction heads to mobilize the largest possible
turnout for a no-confidence vote, which could only be held next
week.
</P>
<P>
The Labor's move is expected to win support from the MKs
(Members of Knesset) of Arab parties and the leftist Meretz
party. However, analysts said it was unlikely such a
no-confidence could be passed as the Likud ruling coalition
commands a majority of 66 votes in the 120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cohen has also submitted a bill which would allow
the Knesset to topple the prime minister in a no-confidence
motion without holding general elections.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu hid his intentions from the security forces and
thus caused our soldiers to be taken by surprise and prevented
them from taking precautions for their defense," he was quoted
by the English daily The Jerusalem Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu is gambling with our future and safety with
irresponsible decisions," he charged.
</P>
<P>
On September 28 after the four-day bloodshed which created
the worst crisis since Israel and the Palestinians made peace in
1993, Cohen immediately called for presenting the no-confidence
motion.
</P>
<P>
"In his 100 days in office, Netanyahu has succeeded in
bringing Israel back to the era before the peace that (former
Likud premier) Menachem Begin signed with Egypt, and is leading
Israel to a renewed war situation with a united Arab world
against us, and Israel's isolation in the international arena,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed, the Labor and leftist
 peace organizations have staged several mass rallies in Tel
Aviv and Jerusalem to demand that the government push forward
the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, thousands of peace supporters gathered in
Jerusalem to demand the government's quick progress in the
negotiations with the Palestinians which are to start today.
</P>
<P>
In response, Likud faction and coalition chairman Michael
Eitan accused the Labor of supporting the Arab incitement
against the government "at a time when Palestinian terror is
spilling the blood of soldiers and civilians."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Eitan urged all parties to honor agreements
reached before the elections on the principles of public
discourse.
</P>
<P>
Likud's Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon vowed not to allow the
Knesset plenum to be exploited for propaganda purposes, and
called on all MKs to show restraint during the prime minister's
address.
</P>
<P>
Today, Netanyahu is to make a speech to the Likud faction to
report on the latest developments on Israeli-Palestinian
relations as the two sides are preparing the high-stake talks
late today to defuse the current crisis and to prevent further
bloodshed.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Open will offer
wildcards to Asian tennis players as part of a new initiative to
help develop the sport in the region, according to Tennis
Australia President Geoff Pollard.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Melbourne at the official launch of the 1997
Australian Open, Pollard said the move was a testimony to the
rising popularity of the sport in the region and the recent
emergence of a crop of Asian stars.
</P>
<P>
This initiative was tipped as a significant gesture in the
campaign to help develop the exciting rapid expansion of the sport
in the region and strengthen the player and spectator base there,
said Pollard.
</P>
<P>
Pollard said wildcards would be offered to two players, one
male and one female, who do not have sufficient ranking to
automatically qualify for the draw and are from a nation not
already represented in the draw.
</P>
<P>
Tournament director Paul McNamee said the next year's edition,
which will be staged at Flinders Park from January 13-26, was
expected to be the biggest in the 92-year history of the event,
with increased prize money and the cream of the world's playing
ranks.
</P>
<P>
All of the top 20 men and top 20 women are planning to be here,
with the exception of Stefan Edberg and Kimiko Date, who have
announced retirement plans, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, for the first time, is leasing land-use rights on 16,000
hectares of grain and cotton acreage to foreign investors, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The regional government canceled the four-decade-plus ban on
leasing State-owned farmland to foreign investors, intending to
introduce foreign agro-technology, machinery and management
know-how to the region and boost per-unit yield.
</P>
<P>
The 200,000 ha. of farmland which use-right was leased to 150
Chinese companies five years ago, are becoming the region's major
grain, fruit and vegetable producing centres, thus becoming an
example inspiring foreign investors to take part in the
development of Xinjiang's agriculture, Hu Guoxuan,
deputy-director of the region's planning commission said.
</P>
<P>
So far, companies from Israel, Canada, the United States and
Hong Kong, have expressed strong interest in the leasing.
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of the total land to be leased to foreign investors
is already cultivated cereals-production farmland, the rest should
be arable land which has not yet been cultivated for farming.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that 66,600 ha. of wasteland in the region await
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
He noted, land-use rights can run as long as 30 or even 50
years, but domestic and foreign investors who buy the rights must
concentrate their business on agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Some of the country's 2,120 State-run farms have also begun
setting up joint ventures with foreign businesses for development
of agricultural resources, said Zeng Yuzhuang, director of the
Ministry of Agriculture's state farm administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine today welcomed a UN
resolution on lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia and promised to
participate actively in the process of economic recovery and
reconstruction in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the UN
October 1 resolution came at a time when the Dayton peace accord
was being implemented and after the Bosnians held their first
post-war elections on September 14, which indicated the situation
in the former Yugoslav region is turning for the better.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine had suffered heavy economic losses since it responded
to the United Nations' call to impose sanctions on the rump
Yugoslavia more than four years ago because of the Bosnian war,
said the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions against Yugoslavia were suspended by the UN Security
Council last November following the U.S.-initiated Balkan peace
accord which was signed in the U.S. Dayton Air Force Base, ending
the three-and-half-year war in Bosnia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal government
has indicated that a bankruptcy breakthrough will soon take place
in the capital's state-owned industries, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts will focus on merger and bankruptcy, the newspaper
quoted government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government will possibly remove its policy and
financial support given to hundreds of loss-making companies, 29
of which have already recorded 100 percent asset-liability ratios,
said a government official.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the municipal government show that at least
28 of the city's industrial enterprises have suffered operational
losses for at least two years, and another 29 have seen production
costs outstrip retail prices of their products.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has set up a one billion yuan (about
120.4 million US dollars) reserve fund earmarked for writing off
the possible tie-up of assets of unprofitable companies that would
be forced to go bankrupt in the coming months in the city, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Remedies for Reducing Debt of Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China has prescribed several
remedies for unraveling the debt chain affecting state-owned
enterprises after three years of pilot operations, China Daily
said today.
</P>
<P>
Pilot reforms tried in more than 50 cities and 100 major
enterprises have targeted improving the firms' capital structure
and initiating the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Excessive debt of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the pillar of
the national economy, not only hampers their development but also
damages their reputation in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it obstructs the commercialization of state
banks, blocking rational circulation of the capital, the
English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In the experiment to reduce state enterprises' debts, the
government has adopted several solutions simultaneously, such as:
</P>
<P>
-- Return to enterprises a proportion of their taxes handed to
the government as the state's capital input, and transform the
firms' fiscal debts, loans in arrears and depreciations into the
country's capital input;
</P>
<P>
-- Stop payment of interest by SOEs following assets appraisal;
</P>
<P>
-- Enterprises that have reduced their asset-liability ratio to
a reasonable figure are allowed to retain their incomes or
after-tax profits for expansion of business;
</P>
<P>
-- Adopt a share-issuing system in some SOEs and sell part of
the shares;
</P>
<P>
-- Speed depreciation;
</P>
<P>
-- Help firms muster funds on the stock market by allocating
some quotas of A and B shares.
</P>
<P>
State figures indicated that one-third of the country's 14,000
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are operating at a
loss, with heavy debt one of the major causes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 the actual asset-liability ratio of the
state's total of 148,000 enterprises hit an appalling 85 percent,
according to state figures.
</P>
<P>
The government encourages firms with poor performance to be
merged or declare bankruptcy in order to stem the further
snowballing of debts. Intensified social insurance reform will
also help enterprises cast off burdens and concentrate on
production.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the pilot cities witnessed an
increase of 6.65 billion yuan (about 790 million US dollars) in
captial funds, reducing asset-liability ratio by 2.5 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Chart Pattana Not to Cooperate With New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Former prime minister Chatichai
Choonhavan's Chart Pattana Party would under no circumstances form
a coalition government with Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's New Aspiration
Party, according to a Chart Pattana deputy leader.
</P>
<P>
If Chart Pattana (National Development) Party had a chance of
forming a coalition, it absolutely would not include New
Aspiration, said Prachuab Chaiyasarn, deputy leader of Chart
Pattana, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said there were too many differences between the policies of
the two parties. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, if New Aspiration has the opportunity to form a
government, Chart Pattana will not take part in the formation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prachuab said Chart Pattana would cooperate with
Chuan Leekpai's Democrat Party during the election, and that the
two parties would back each other's leaders to become prime
minister if either of them wins the largest number of seats in the
November 17 general election.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, caretaker prime minister Banharn Silpa-archa, who is
leader of the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party, admitted that he had
no chance of returning to the premiership and said his successor
would be one of the three leading candidates whose names start
with the letter 'C', referring to Chuan, Chavalit and Chatichai.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Welcomed by Guangdong's Drug Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
will continue encouraging sizable overseas investment to replace
local outdated, small pharmaceutical factories, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
New overseas-funded projects in the pharmaceutical industry
must involve investment of at least 30 million yuan (about 3.6
million US dollars) and introduce first-class products that meet
domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
Officials in this sector are expecting to deal with a glut of
common medicines produced by mushrooming domestic pharmaceutical
enterprises through market competition from home and abroad, the
Beijing-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In a move that is likely to encourage overseas investors, the
economically booming province will eliminate specific stipulations
on export quotas for products that are needed in China.
</P>
<P>
Policy-makers disclosed that apart from offering income-tax
exemption for two years and deduction for three years, other
favorable tax policies will also be enjoyed by investors.
</P>
<P>
Though the average rate of return in the provincial
pharmaceutical industry in around 10 percent, the rate in the
recently-invested enterprises, including many overseas-funded
ones, has reached between 20 and 30 percent, another sign to
assure investors.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded projects in the pharmaceutical industry in the
province now number at least 150 with total investment of 443
million US dollars. Actually used foreign capital topped 226
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most current investors in the sector are from the United
States, Europe and Japan and produce their own medicines and
chemical reagents with technology and capital inflow.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Army to Guard Energy Installations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan authorities decided
Friday that army and police forces will guard energy plants and
substations from sabotage during the October 20 elections,
according to local reports today.
</P>
<P>
The buildings of the Supreme Electoral Council, the
ballot-receiving boards, and other sites and installations related
to the elections will also be guarded by military and police
forces, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
These measures were adopted after the "Centroamerica"
hydroelectric energy plant workers of the Nicaraguan Electricity
Enterprise (Enel) went on strike.
</P>
<P>
Several sections of the Nicaraguan capital have been in the
dark for three days due to the strike. The striking workers
demanded a 75 percent salary raise.
</P>
<P>
Enel executive president Emilio Rappaccioli had asked the
government to send troops and police to guard all electric energy
installations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Rappaccioli said the striking workers have sequestered the
vehicles that provide emergency service in several sites of the
country, which has affected the measuring, billing, and collecting
services.
</P>
<P>
The Enel executive warned that these threaten a national
blackout, damage to the energy plants and interconnection to the
rest of the Central American region. He added that the strike has
caused a loss of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government cannot raise the salaries of the workers,
Rappaccioli said, arguing that the Enel workers are better paid
than those of the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Electricity workers union leaders said they will continue the
strike of more than 85 percent of the Enel employees at a national
level until their salaries are increased.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference Calls for Global Ban on Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
conference ended here today, with calls for the earliest possible
conclusion of a pact on worldwide ban of anti-personnel (AP) mines.
</P>
<P>
The "Ottawa Declaration" endorsed by 50 countries represented
at the meeting says that humanitarian and social-economic costs
caused by AP mines require urgent international action to ban and
eliminate this type of weapon.
</P>
<P>
"Until such a ban is achieved, states must work to encourage
universal adherence to the prohibitions or restrictions on AP
mines," the paper notes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will strive for a resolution at the 51st
Session of the United Nations General Assembly, calling upon
member states to ban the use and transfer of AP mines at the
earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
"The Ottawa Declaration is a strong and clear call for urgent
action toward a global ban," said Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy at the closing session of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy expressed the hope that a global ban treaty would be
signed no later than the end of 1997, adding "Canada is prepared
to convene a meeting in December 1997 to sign such a treaty."
</P>
<P>
The meeting also approved the "Agenda for Action," which lists
a number of global, regional and national activities designed to
advance a global ban.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 70 governments, non-governmental
organizations and multilateral agencies took part in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Belgium is expected to host a follow-up to the Ottawa
conference in June 1997.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Claim Over 1,900 Lives in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 6,202 road
accidents occurred in the first nine months of the year in
Romania, killing 1,940 people and severely injuring 5,117 others.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest report released by the government's
traffic-managing office, the number of road accidents was reduced
by 116, compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that during this year's summer vacation
season, from June 16 to August 31, 78 students died of various
road accidents, and 347 students were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Carelessness on the pedestrian's part when crossing streets,
and speeding and illegal overtaking on the driver's part, were
cited as main causes for many of the accidents.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as shown on a television report, a recent on-site
check by traffic police found only a small number of drivers
passed the random alcohol test over a weekend.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Dhaka Using Economic Diplomacy to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
been engaged in a flurry of economic diplomacy, the pith of its
foreign policy designed to attract more foreign investors and lift
the south Asian country out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Awami League (AL) government took office
on June 23, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared that, "The
essence of foreign policy will be economic diplomacy geared to the
transformation of Bangladesh" as the 21st century is approaching.
</P>
<P>
Hasina's recent visit to Beijing and Hong Kong, where she
visited China's special economic zone in Hainan and invited
foreign investors and entrepreneurs to join Bangladesh's efforts
to achieve economic self-reliance, was a significant move in its
economic diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers have been sent to various countries to
promote trade and economic ties and cooperation and Bangladesh's
diplomatic missions abroad have also been ordered to get
preoccupied with the job of boosting foreign investment in the
country and securing international markets for Bangladeshi
products.
</P>
<P>
While economic diplomacy is being increasingly used in the
post-Cold War era as a lever to maximize economic benefits,
Bangladesh, one of the world's least developed countries, such
diplomacy is of special significance, analysts here said.
Obviously, the Hasina government is keenly aware of the potential
role of diplomacy in the fulfillment of the country's
socio-economic tasks.
</P>
<P>
With an area of only about 140,000 sq. km. and a population of
over 120 million, Bangladesh has long suffered from poverty and
backwardness.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the challenge facing Bangladesh is to formulate a viable
developmental strategy capable of materializing the economic
opportunities and thus, pulling the country out of poverty trap,"
State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abu Hasan Chowdhury said while
explaining the economic diplomacy. Every effort will be made to
boost exports, explore employment opportunities for Bangladeshi
nationals abroad and make Bangladesh specially attractive to
foreign investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The AL government, which took power after being in the
political wilderness for 21 years, is also eager to seek economic
growth to safeguard its hard-won rule of the country, as the
mainstream opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is
waiting for chances to drive the AL government out of office,
reliable sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The AL won the last general elections on June 12 as political
chaos during the BNP's five-year rule had caused huge economic
losses and many people hoped for a change of government.
</P>
<P>
Bearing that in mind, the Hasina government sees as its
foremost task learning from the outside world, especially from
neighboring countries in East Asia like China.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's economic diplomacy is aimed at economic
development mainly through attracting foreign and private
investment and promoting exports.
</P>
<P>
For the purpose, the government has reactivated and reinforced
the Investment Board, and a bill allowing the private sector to
set up export processing zones has been passed. The "lock-in"
system in the capital market has also been abolished and a
five-percent quota in the initial public offerings is encouraging
the non-resident Bangladeshis to participate in the local stock
market.
</P>
<P>
"We are pledge-bound to remove all bottlenecks in flourishing a
competitive economy" and are "working hard to create a stable
political and social environment for investment," Hasina told
foreign investors while inaugurating the annual Bangladesh apparel
and textile exposition on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While the economic diplomacy is gaining increasing prominence
in attaining the country's broader economic goals, it is not the
decisive factor to economic development, the analysts noted. The
key to alleviating poverty and improving the country's negative
image abroad lies in concrete action rather than rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
As the country has long been suffering from the
government-opposition conflict, political stability is vital for
economic and social development, they stressed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Finance Minister on Funding to Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- "If Chechnya's political status
becomes clear in five years, Russia's financing will begin in five
years," Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister also told ITAR-Tass News Agency here that sending
money to the separatist region will be possible only after
Chechnya's political status becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
"As Russian finance minister, I only allocate funds to the
Russian federation members," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin in a recent speech also took this
stand. However, the agreement signed by Chechnya's separatist
leaders and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin did not
mention Chechnya's political status, but financing to Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Business Leaders Express Concern Over Trade Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Top business leaders of the
Asia-Pacific region are increasingly concerned about the negative
impact on business caused by trade sanctions, the head of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Business Advisory Council
(ABAC) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing sentiment among members of ABAC that
unilateral sanctions by one APEC economy against another for
nontrade-related issues is counterproductive to business," ABAC
Chairman Roberto Romulo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, Romulo did not say whether a policy recommendation
report, to be submitted to APEC leaders on October 24, would help
stop the use of trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
ABAC sources said during their meeting in Manila in June, the
U.S. delegation raised a proposal against trade sanctions in a
report, which was widely supported.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. delegation wanted to withdraw the call against
trade sanctions from the report at the Honolulu meeting because
the United States saw it as a sensitive political issue.
</P>
<P>
An ABAC source explained that Robert Denham, Chief Executive
Officer of Solomon Brothers and head of the U.S. delegation, was
told by U.S. State Department officials to go slow on the trade
sanctions issue.
</P>
<P>
Romulo also said that ABAC would push for the speed-up of APEC
liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 18 APEC members could move on an "18 minus x"
approach whereby anyone ready to go faster on liberalization can
take the lead, instead of waiting for a consensus.
</P>
<P>
"What we're basically saying is we can't wait for consensus,
because the snow may melt in every glacier by that point in time,"
Romulo said.
</P>
<P>
He added that businessmen would not necessarily wait until the
timetable of 2010 for developed economies or that of 2020 for
developing economies before actual liberalization can be
implemented.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia's Newly-Elected Presidency Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's newly-elected
presidency was inaugurated here Saturday in the absence of Serb
deputies.
</P>
<P>
The international high envoy Carl Bildt said that the Serbs
refused to attend the ceremony at the national theater in Sarajevo
"due to security concerns."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Pale said that the Serbs were showing their
dissatisfaction with the joint declaration signed in Paris by
Bosnian Muslim president Alija Izetbegovic and Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Bosnian Muslim President Izetbegovic,
President of the Croatian-Muslim Federation Kresimir Zubak and 31
Muslim and Croatian deputies signed a declaration, promising to
safeguard the Bosnian constitution and protect the interest and
equality of the three ethnics.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic said that the Bosnian people could not forget the
"evils" of the war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on the three ethnics to do away with
hatred and try their best to recover economy, promote social
relief and foster education.
</P>
<P>
Zubak called on all the Bosnian people to rebuild mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
The new presidency was dominated by the Muslim Democratic
Action Party, the Croatian Democratic Action Party and the Serb
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, Yugoslav Deputy Prime
Minister Nikola Sainovic and U.S. envoy John Kornblum were invited
to attend the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum said that the United States was very unhappy about the
Serbs' absence, warning that the Bosnian coalition government
would not get international aid if the Serbs continue their
boycott.

<HEADLINE> Russian Official on Army Reform, Chechnya Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia needs a new military
doctrine, said Yuri Baturin, secretary of the newly-created
Defense Council here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Baturin told reporters that Russia adopted basic guidelines of
its military doctrine long time ago. Since the world situation
has undergone dramatic changes, relevant changes should be made in
the Russian military doctrine.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Council is a high-level consultative body set up in
July to supervise reform of the armed forces in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Baturin believed that the tasks of the armed forces should be
reconsidered in accordance with the country's real economic
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
On Chechnya, Baturin praised Alexander Lebed, secretary of the
Security Council, who is the Kremlin's peace negotiator in
Chechnya, saying that Lebed's main achievement in mediating was
"ending direct military operations there."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "I cannot say that fighting in
Chechnya has stopped. Actually, fighting still continues there in
other covert forms. People are still dying."
</P>
<P>
Baturin held that the Khasavyurt peace deal signed by the
Russian federation and Chechen separatists does not have full
legal status, adding that this document, to a great extent, is a
political one.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of the Defense Council revealed that the Russian
president and prime minister have suggested that efforts should
start immediately to settle the status of Chechnya, although the
issue has been postponed for five years in the peace deal.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Pledge to Stick to IGC Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the 15 European
Union countries pledged here today that they will conclude the EU
Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) on time to keep the European
integration process well on course.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the one-day EU special
summit this evening, European Council President and Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton said that the meeting was "a success" and "we
have achieved all the set goals."
</P>
<P>
All the participants have agreed that the IGC was "on course"
and a new draft treaty should be submitted to the formal EU summit
in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
The IGC, which is aimed at revising the Maastricht Treaty, was
formally launched at the Turin special EU summit last March and no
significant progress has been made so far. Many EU member states
fear that the nearly stagnant IGC would be a stumbling block to
the European integration process.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the bloc also agreed that the IGC on the future
of Europe should meet its deadline in June of next year when the
Netherlands holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Although the promise of ending the important conference on time
has been given, analysts say that the IGC would probably fail to
achieve its targets of reviewing the Maastricht treaty.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a strong supporter of the
European integration, has openly admitted for the first time that
if the current IGC on reforming the Maastricht Treaty makes little
progress, there would have to be another conference at a later
date.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the EU leaders reached agreement on placing
"great emphasis" upon the urgent need of fighting against
drug-trafficking and international organized crimes in particular
within the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
They also called for closer cooperation among the EU states to
crack down upon these crimes as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East situation, the EU leaders voiced "great
concern" over the dangers threatening the Middle East peace
process and promised to "do all in their power" to promote peace
negotiations in a constructive way.
</P>
<P>
The participants also agreed to send Irish Foreign Minister
Dick Spring to the Middle East as soon as possible to for
mediation.
</P>
<P>
Spring would hold talks with both the Israelis and
Palestinians, calling on both sides to accelerate the peace
process and avoid confrontation.

<HEADLINE> First HIV Baby in Indonesia Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian has reported the
country's first baby born with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
which causes AIDS, a government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The baby was one of the 11 people added to the government's
list of people with HIV, which now stands at 449.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Manaf, head of the Ministry of Health's Directorate of
Direct Communicable Disease Control, said, "It's likely that the
baby contracted the virus from its mother."
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that up to
January this year there were 5.5 million HIV-positive children in
the world and 2.3 million of them had developed AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, there are 108 people who have been registered as
having full-blown AIDS and 66 of them have died. There are 341
people who are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that if AIDS is not properly controlled, up to
2.5 million people in Indonesia could be infected by the year
2000, which means an estimated 1,500 people contract the killer
disease everyday.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Agriculture Develops Through Loans, Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian agriculture has developed
in recent years through projects of land exploitation and the
creation of agricultural development zones with the help of
international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government has created several zones of agricultural
development assisted by soft loans from financial institutions to
promote agro-industrial exports. Political and economic stability
and the defeat of terrorists have also helped in promoting
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
An agency called National Development Institute has been set up
to take charge of developing agricultural zones in the country
with long-term, low-interest soft loans granted by these
organizations. The institute also convokes international bidding
to exploit rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Peru has a vast territory but the lack of basic agricultural
infrastructure permits just a small part of the population to
cultivate the land. With most of its arable land remains untiled,
Peru has to import a large quantity of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Financed by international institutions, the government has
started several projects to promote the country's agriculture, the
most well-known of which is the Chavimochic agricultural
development project, near Trujillo, 550 kilometers north of Lima.
</P>
<P>
The project was financed by the World Bank. It has 270
kilometers of irrigation canals, which carry the Rio Santa water
to irrigate 140,000 hectares of arable land and also supply
drinking water to the city of Trujillo and neighboring districts.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the infrastructure of the zone, the
government has built hydroelectric power plants to guarantee
energy supply and upgraded airport installations, maritime ports
and international communications as well.
</P>
<P>
Factories such as quick-freezing plants and packaging have been
built. Agricultural development works built by the National
Development Institute have the purpose of attracting foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The authorities expect investors to buy the land, cultivate
vegetables and fruits and export their agro-industrial products to
recover their investments.
</P>
<P>
The exports of traditional agricultural produce such as rice,
potatoes, cotton, corn, fruits and others, have increased.
</P>
<P>
Peru is seeking new soft loans to implement more projects of
land exploitation in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Inspired Pierre van Hooijdonk
came off the bench to score two goals in three minutes, pacing his
Dutch squad for a 3-1 win over Wales in one of seven World Cup
group qualifying matches on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Another European soccer power Italy defeated Moldova 3-1 away
thanks to second-half goals by Pierluigi Casiraghi and Fabrizio
Ravanelli.
</P>
<P>
Van Hooijdonk came on as a substitute late in the second half
when the Dutch nationals were struggling with a 0-1 deficit. He
hit the equalizer in the 72nd minute and made it 2-1 three minutes
later on a header. Teammate Roland de Boer sealed the game with a
final goal netted in the 79th minute.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands scored three points to move to a second-place
tie with Belgium, three points adrift of Wales, who leads Group
seven from two wins over San Marino.
</P>
<P>
In Moldova, Ravanelli gave Italy a 1-0 lead in the 8th minute
before Moldova's Alexandru Curteanu scored the equalizer three
minutes later on an Italian defensive lapse.
</P>
<P>
Casiraghi slammed home the winner in the 68th and Ravanelli got
his second three minutes later. Italy has three points and sat
atop Group two together with England, which won earlier at Moldova
3-0.
</P>
<P>
In Group nine, Ukraine upset Portugal 2-1 in Kiev to claim the
top spot in the group with two victories from as many games.
</P>
<P>
In Group 4, Scotland's 2-0 win at Latvia pulled the Scots into
second place with four points behind group leaders Sweden at six.
</P>
<P>
Also in Group 4, Estonia wrote history when they beat Belarus
1-0. The victory was only the second ever in World Cup play for
Estonia, which won its first match in 1937 against Finland.
</P>
<P>
In Group 8, Lithuania jumped up a notch when they beat Iceland
2-0, moving into the second place with three points from two
games.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Leader: Indonesia Well-placed to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia, which has the largest
Muslim population in the world, is in a good position to help
bring about a reconciliation among the conflicting parties in
Afghanistan, a Muslim leader said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lukman Harun, chairman of the Indonesian Committee for World
Muslim Solidarity, said, "Many countries believe Indonesia will be
able to make a big contribution to any search for a peaceful
settlement of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Those countries' belief was neither out of place nor
exaggerated considering Indonesia's proven ability to bring the
formerly warring parties in Cambodia to the negotiating table,
Antara news agency today quoted the Muslim leader as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesian Muslims were indeed hoping it will be
possible to work for a reconciliation among the warring parties in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to Harun, the conflict in Afghanistan was rooted in a
power struggle following the former Soviet pull-out from that
country.
</P>
<P>
The struggle to expel the former Soviet presence was waged by
many Mujahiden groups which were later reorganized into only six.
</P>
<P>
The six groups clashed with each other to jockey for national
leadership positions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Harun said the Taliban militia were too rigid in implementing
Islamic rule after they occupied Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
last month. This was noticeable in a Taliban ban on women working
and a ruling ordering public buses to stop at the time of prayers
(sholat). In fact Islam allowed travelers to do their prayers at
other times, he added.

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Soars to 31 Million Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Volume breakdown indicated that
air travel soared 13 percent to 31.12 million passengers in the
first seven months of this year in China, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Passenger transport by all transportation facilities totalled
2.87 billion in the period, down 0.3 percent compared with that of
the corresponding period of 1995, a report by the State
Statistical Information and Consultancy Service Centre showed.
</P>
<P>
Passengers traveling by air registered the fastest growth of
all transport means in the first seven months of 1996 thanks to
sustained growth of household income, according to the latest
government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Rail passengers totalled 526 million, down 14.6 percent, while
2.23 billion travelled by bus, up 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 78 million people travelled by boat, down 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Passenger turnover in the period reported a 4.9 percent decline
in the first seven months to 354.29 billion person-kilometres.
</P>
<P>
Total freight volume stood at 1.56 billion tons in the
seven-month period, up 0.1 percent from that of the same period of
last year, the report indicated.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ramos Says No to Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has rejected a proposal by the country's mayors to amend the
constitution which would pave the way for lifting term limits for
all elective officials, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"My position still holds. there is no change," Ramos said in an
interview when asked about a resolution submitted by 1,543 mayors
of the League of municipalities of the Philippines to the
presidential palace last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution sought an amendment to the constitution to
remove the three-year, three-term limit on all national and local
elective officials and extend their tenure to five years.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos admitted that he was helpless in stopping local
officials from expressing their own opinions on vital issues, like
amending the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has repeatedly said that he himself will stand down when
his term ends on June 30, 1998 and will not seek a second term of
office.

<HEADLINE> Tomba to Compete in World Cup on Part-Time Basis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Skiing genius Alberto Tomba said on
Saturday he will compete in the coming World Cup season and hope
to reap a title at the World Alpine Championships next year.
</P>
<P>
However, Tomba said his participation will only be part-time in
the 36-race World Cup competition due to sore knees and his age.
</P>
<P>
Tomba, 29, three-time Olympic champion and former overall World
Cup champion, won two gold medals at the 1996 World Championships
in Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
On his part-time basis, Tomba who early announced to retire in
April, said he will skip the opening World Cup race in Austria on
October 27 and possibly the events at Park City and Breckenridge
in the United States early in November.
</P>
<P>
So far, Tomba has collected a record of 48 World Cup victories
including 11 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the Italian competed solely in slaloms and giant
slaloms, never ventured in downhill and ran only a few super-Gs in
his 10-year career.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Arabs Not to Stand by If Renewed Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa warned here today that the Arabs would not stand by if the
renewed Palestinian-Israeli peace talks fail to achieve tangible
results.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are scheduled to resume their
negotiations at the Erez crossing between the Gaza Strip and
Israel Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we (the Arabs) will stay quiet if these
negotiations are only a waste of time," he told reporters
following a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Moussa did not say specifically what the reaction would be.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was necessary for the Israelis to change their
hard-line policy at the talks, adding that otherwise the situation
would be very grave.
</P>
<P>
"If not, then it will be a very serious situation because the
tune we heard" from the United States was hopeful, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross will attend the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"If the negotiations end in failure, then the whole process
would have failed, starting from the Washington summit to what
followed," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the those negotiations were crucial because it
would determine whether the two-day Washington summit, which ended
Wednesday, was a failure or not.
</P>
<P>
The summit was attended by Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, Jordan's King Hussein and U.S. President Bill
Clinton. Mubarak refused to attend the summit despite an
invitation.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting between Mubarak and Arafat, who left here
afterwards winding up a short visit to Egypt, mainly dealt with
preparations for the Palestinian-Israeli talks starting Sunday and
the outcome of the Washington summit, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The talks in Erez checkpoint will focus on discussion of a
long-delayed redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron, the last
West Bank town still under Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Not to Attend GCC Summit in Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bahraini government
reaffirmed today that it would not attend the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) summit due to be held in the Qatari capital of Doha
in December.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini Information Minister Mohammed al-Muttawa told
reporters in Manama, Bahraini capital, that Bahrain would refrain
from attending the Doha summit, but it would not boycott the GCC
work.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why his country would abstain from attending the
Doha summit, he said that this was due to the fact that the GCC
states have failed to make a decisive move to contain the
Bahraini-Qatari dispute with friendly means.
</P>
<P>
The six-member GCC consists of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,

A territorial dispute exists between Bahrain and Qatar. Both
countries claim sovereignty over Dibal and a string of tiny
islands.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain have handed their defenses on the border
dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
"The attempt to link our attending the Doha summit with
withdrawing the case from the International Court of Justice is a
distortion of facts, because we don't exercise such a type of
pressure, but demand that the GCC role should be reactivated and
that our regional problems should be kept within the GCC house,"
the Bahraini information minister said.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed by Rebel Attacks in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 civilians were
killed by Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel
forces who launched simultaneous attacks on three villages in the
eastern Kenema District on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman in Kenema said today that some 20
civilians, including six children aged between 10 and 12, were
also seriously wounded. However, the rebel attacks were later
repulsed by government troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
The villages, identified as Saahun, Ngelehun and Njasawabu,
were all set on fire by the rebels, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the frequency of attacks and counter attacks do not
jeopardize the ceasefire, the spokesman said: "We don't think so.
We are only defending ourselves and the unharmed civilian
population."
</P>
<P>
Political observers say the delay in the signing of a peace
agreement between the government and the RUF rebels has put on
hold viable western economic assistance and investments as many
donor countries are hesitant to assist until peace is restored.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government sources disclosed that results have been
achieved by President Tejan Kabbah's recent visit to Tehran as
the Iranian government has agreed to provide a total of 100
million U.S. Dollars in investments and economic aid.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Give Peace A New Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
 (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said today that the Palestinians
are giving "a new chance" for the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks one day before the scheduled
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on the implementation of the
Oslo accords, particularly Israel's troops redeployment in the
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader returned to Gaza today after his visit
to Morocco, Tunis, Italy, France and Egypt. The visit came
following the two-day Washington summit, which was called by
U.S. President Bill Clinton to resuscitate the peace process in
the wake of last week's violent clashes between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Arafat held a series of talks with
leaders of those countries on the current situation in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip in an effort to win support from
European and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Gaza Strip, Arafat told reporters that
now there is "an Arab position, and a European position," which
demand the implementation of the Oslo accords between Israel and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"What we ask is (that the Israeli government) to implement
the agreement which has been signed and agreed upon," said
the PNA president, "nothing more than that."
</P>
<P>
Arafat also expressed his good wishes for a success of
the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, which is
scheduled to start Sunday at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday following the conclusion the
Washington summit, Clinton announced that he was dispatching
U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross to manage the
talks at the Erez checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few results of the summit, Israel and the
Palestinians agreed to hold round-the-clock negotiations, starting
Sunday, on Israel's redeployment from the disputed Hebron and
other related security matters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said while the crisis was not resolved and the
parties remained wide apart, the Washington summit had succeeded
in returning them to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is also due to
arrive to Israel to attend the talks at the Erez checkpoint, in an
attempt to help Israel and the Palestinians to solve their
disputes and move the peace process forward.

<HEADLINE> Benefit of UK's EU Membership Is Marginal: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain could leave the European
Union (EU) without any adverse economic effects if a future
government found the political terms for continued membership
unacceptable, a leading free-market think-tank argued Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country would probably draw a slight economic gain if it
pulled out of the union, said a new study published by the
Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA).
</P>
<P>
The study, Better Off Out? The Benefits or Costs of EU
Membership, concluded that the gain or loss of withdrawal would
probably be less than one percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The study did not recommend pulling out of the EU, but
concluded: "If the EU develops along lines that the UK finds
unacceptable on fundamental political grounds, fear of adverse
economic consequences should not deter a British government from
seeking to change the relationship of the UK with the EU or, in
the last resort, from leaving."
</P>
<P>
Dr Brian Hindley, one of the authors of the paper, said that
British trade with Europe accounts for only a small proportion of
total economic activity and that most of it would probably survive
withdrawal, particularly if Britain managed to negotiate a
favorable alternative relationship of the kind achieved by
Norway.
</P>
<P>
The conclusions are likely to be seized on by the Eurosceptic
wing of the Conservative Party, which will press the Prime
Minister to take a tougher anti-European line at the party
conference next week.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the argument was rejected by the European
Movement, a cross-party pro-European political group, which argued
that the report had underestimated the importance of membership
for UK companies and Britain's attractiveness for foreign direct
investors.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Probes Massacre in W. Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- West Africa's peacekeeping force,
known as the ECOMOG, today started an investigation into the
reported massacre of civilians in Sinje, a village 70 kms
northwest of Liberia's capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, the massacre,
conducted by unknown faction fighters last Saturday, killed at
least 17 civilians, wounded many and deprived the homes of about
1,000. Many victims were women, children and elderly people.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Field Commander, Nigeria's Major-General Victor Malu,
was quoted as saying that his 10,000-strong forces would take
"appropriate actions" against the faction responsible for the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
The village has been the scene of factional fighting between
the Krahn and Mandingo wings of the United Liberation Movement
(ULIMO).
</P>
<P>
"I wonder why the tragedy happened at this moment of the peace
process," said Malu.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's peace process has seemed to be on a right track
after the installation of a new interim cabinet and the signing
of a revised peace accord last August in Abuja, capital of the
West African power Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) has
condemned the massacre as an act which "constitutes a most
serious violation of human rights, and a violation of the
ceasefire which cannot go unpunished."
</P>
<P>
Before ECOMOG's probe began, the UNOMIL had sent an team to
the Sinje village to gather preliminary information on the
massacre, one of a series of latest incidents that has hampered
efforts to finally end the seven-year-old civil war in the West
African country.

</P>
<P>
Soylemez said that Turkey has to lower inflation, realize
structural reform, reduce budget deficits and stabilize fiscal
policies.

"For this reason, the government should reach an accord on
a program to be implemented and this program should receive
support from international financial institutions," the state
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Official on Arbitration Agreement with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yemen-Eritrea Arbitration
Agreement recently signed in Paris was an initial step toward
settling the territorial dispute between the two countries
peacefully, a senior Yemeni official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Yemeni negotiation team Hussein el-Hebeishi told
reporters on his return here that the arbitration agreement as
well as the Declaration of Principles signed with Eritrea in May
would be submitted to Yemen's House of Representatives
(Parliament) for approval.
</P>
<P>
Hebeishi said that Yemen would prepare a defense to be
submitted to an international arbitration court early next year.
</P>
<P>
Yemen has expressed welcome for the signing of the arbitration
agreement between Yemen and Eritrea for resolving the
conflict over the disputed Greater Hanish Island, and its
appreciation for the French mediation efforts in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulated the establishment of an arbitration
court in conformity with international law. The two countries have
pledged to respect the court's verdict and to refrain from any
action or military operation by one country against the other
until the ruling is made.
</P>
<P>
The court is to be composed of five judges, with each country
appointing two, and the fifth, the chairman, will be chosen by
virtue of an understanding between the four judges.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea signed the Declaration of Principles in
France in May to settle a clash last December over three Red Sea
islands -- Greater Hanish, Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have credited France to help broker the
agreement through shuttle diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands are about 160 kilometers north of Bab
el-Mandeb at the southern entrance to the Red Sea.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia's Joint Institutions Meet Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's presidency and house
of representatives held their joint inaugural session on Saturday,
despite the boycott of the Serbian representatives.
</P>
<P>
The joint session was attended by Alija Izetbegovic, chairman
and Muslim member of the presidency, Kresimir Zubak, Croat member
as well as 31 Muslim and Croat members of the 42-member house of
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The participants signed a "solemn declaration" which committed
them to upholding the constitution of Bosnia and protecting the
interests and equality of all three ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Present at the the ceremony were also ambassadors based in
Sarajevo as well as senior officials from the United States,
Yugoslavia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural session was delayed for three hours because of
the uncertainty over whether Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of
the presidency and 11 Serb representatives would show up.
</P>
<P>
According to Carl Bildt, the international community's High
Representative to Bosnia who arranged the ceremony, the Serb side
rejected the venue, which was at the downtown National Theater for
what they called "security reasons".
</P>
<P>
But there are more than the security concerns and "they are
playing games", Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Bosnian Serbs, who control almost half of the
Bosnian territory and fought for independence, have been fuming at
the signing of a joint statement in Paris on Bosnian-Yugoslav
relations by Izetbegovic who the Serbian side claimed did not
consult it in advance, according to reports from Pale, the
headquarters of the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
U.S. assistant secretary of state John Kornblum, who attended
the ceremony on behalf of his government, said that "we are
extremely unhappy and displeased" by the absence of Serb members of
the Bosnian joint institutions.
</P>
<P>
He refused to spell clearly what pressure to put on the Serbian
side, but pointed out that the joint institutions will be where
the international economic aid come to and the Serbian side would
be felt by the consequence of its boycott.

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt will present a list of 30 projects to the
upcoming Middle East and North African Economic Summit to be held
in Cairo next month in a bid to attract foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry Soliman Reda said Friday that his country
anticipates a foreign capital inflow of eight billion Egyptian
pounds (about 2.35 billion U.S. dollars) to create 10,000 job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The projects include local-foreign joint ventures in the fields
of fertilizers, cement, chemicals, steel, aluminum and
electronics, local daily Al Gomhuria reported today.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Central Bank of Egypt has forbidden banks to
speculate in foreign exchanges, deputy Governor of the Central
Bank Mohammed el Barbary announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ban followed a declared loss of over 150 million
U.S. dollars by three banks speculating in foreign currency in
this country.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank would not permit the bankruptcy of any bank
in Egypt and that this was the present strategy of the government,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Hundreds of prisoners will be employed in Israel
for picking origins and grape fruits in place of Palestinian
agricultural workers who are unable to enter Israel because of the
border closure, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Citrus Marketing Board has also made urgent appeal to the
Ministry of Defense to bring in soldiers serving in

AMMAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today
expressed his hope that Sunday's Israeli-Palestinian negotiations
will bear tangible results, Jordan Television reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Crown Prince Hassan, the
Regent, king Hussein said he hoped the negotiations will find a
solution to the Palestinian-Israeli crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the phone conversation, Hassan called Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and the two leaders exchanged views and stressed the
need to obtain tangible results in the upcoming talks between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Regent told reporters after the telephone talks that
Jordan's special role in guarding the Moslem shrines in the Holy
City of Jerusalem was manifested by the king's attending last
week's Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit grouped the king, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Hassan pointed out that the Washington summit was aimed at
containing the bloody clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli
security forces rather than seeking an immediate solution to the
crisis.

He reiterated Jordan's support to the Palestinians and their
rights to regain sovereignty over their national soil.

<HEADLINE> French Watchdog Raps State Enterprises for Wasting Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- France's state financial watchdog,
the Cour des Comptes, has rapped the state enterprises of National
Railway Company of France (SNCF) and Electricity of France (EDF)
of wasting money and poor management in building a bullet train
railway line and a major nuclear center.
</P>
<P>
The Cour des Comptes said in an annual report submitted Monday
to President Jacques Chirac and the two chambers of parliament
that the actual passenger numbers for a new bulletin train line,
TGV-Nord, will only be a third of what the SNCF promised when
asking the state to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Le Monde said that the annual report of
Cour des Comptes has always provided "a illumination on the
malfunction of the state, the local community and public
enterprises," with "that of 1996 confirming this tradition."
</P>
<P>
The report, submitted by Pierre Joxe, president of Cour des
Comptes, said that the interior traffic in 1994 was lower than
half of what the SNCF predicted, and that the SNCF has tripled
its estimations of the traffic across the English Channel in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It accused SNCF of basing its estimations on "old data of four
years ago, while it could have used recent statistics available,"
in order to obtain the rate of return to justify its investment in
such a project.
</P>
<P>
The Cour des Comptes called on the government to re-examine a
1992 project to build a TGV line in northern France which was made
with the same method, while exposing "numerous violations of
market rule" by the state company, including ignoring the
obligation of making advertisements, bad management in biddings of
competitive investment, and little transparency in decision
makings.
</P>
<P>
The Cour des Comptes also accused the EDF of turning what it
first promised to be a national energy providing center into an
experimental laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Given the failures and incidents in the functioning of the
nuclear super-generator Superphenix of the past 10 years in
Creys-Malville, department of Isere in central France, the Cour
des Comptes is questioning its "disputable choice" of a German
partner in the project and "gaps in its management."
</P>
<P>
The report said that from 1984 to 1996, this nuclear energy
center has worked for only 30 months, while the rest of the time
was taken by incidents, stoppage and recovery.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that the cost for the center is around 60 billion
francs(12 billion U.S. dollars) up to the year 2000, while that
for its dismantling will be about 15 percent of the cost of its
construction.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says FBI Memo Shows Government Anti-Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Criticized for his drug
policies, U.S. President Bill Clinton revealed Saturday that a
secret FBI memorandum says the government's anti-drug strategy
"had never been properly organized."
</P>
<P>
But Clinton argued that the problems predate his
administration, and said his new drug czar has improved government
efforts -- partly in response to the memo.
</P>
<P>
"I believe what we're doing now will get us better results than
we've had before," he was quoted by the Associated Press as
telling reporters on a break from debate preparation in
Chautauqua, New York.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the first presidential debate, Clinton's remarks
offered Republican challenger Bob Dole more debate-night fodder.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for Bill Clinton to move beyond denial and admit to
the (drug) problem," Dole spokeswoman Christine Martin said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
In the memo, FBI director Louis Freeh complained to Clinton
about the lack of "any true leadership" in fighting the influx of
heroin and cocaine, according to a report in Newsweek magazine in
August. Freeh hand-delivered the memo to Clinton himself some 18
months ago, according to Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
Dole and congressional Republicans, believing the memo is
highly critical of Clinton, have demanded its release. The White
House maintains the memo contains the type of classified and
private advice that historically is kept private by presidents.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the memo accused the administration of showing no
leadership in the drug war, Clinton said, "No... It was a memo by
Mr. Louis Freeh to me arguing that the... federal government had
never been properly organized in terms of who had jurisdiction to
do what in the drug war."

He said Freeh "argued for a reallocation of authority -- and I
thought he argued quite persuasively that we needed a way to
coordinate this."
</P>
<P>
That is why he appointed retired General Barry McCaffrey as
drug czar in January and gave the office increased power to
coordinate the government's tentacled drug efforts, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said various agencies working on the drug problem have
inherent conflicts, "but it is important to have them all
coordinating and working together instead of at cross purposes,
which is something people have complained about from the inside of
this, literally going... back to the Johnson administration."

SARAJEVO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's presidency and house
of representatives held their joint inaugural session on Saturday,
despite the boycott of the Serbian representatives.
</P>
<P>
The joint session was attended by Alija Izetbegovic, chairman
and Muslim member of the presidency, jresimir Zubak, Croat member
as well as 31 Muslims and Croats of the 42-member house of
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The participants signed a "solemn declaration" which committed
them to upholding the constitution of Bosnia and protecting the
interests and equality of all three ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Present at the the ceremony were also ambassadors based in
Sarajevo as well as Croatia Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Mate Granic, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola
Sainovic and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, Izetebegovic said that the evil
of war should not be forgotten, but "we must not be the prisoners"
of it.
</P>
<P>
He called for competition in good nature among Bosnia's three
peoples to see who is doing better and faster to reconstruct the
country and eradicate hatred and uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
Zubak called for mutual trust among the three ethnic groups,
saying that their differences should not be any more reason for
war, but for knowing one another better.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural session was delayed for three hours because of
the uncertainty over whether Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of
the presidency and 11 Serb representatives would show up.
</P>
<P>
According to Carl Bildt, the international community's High
Representative to Bosnia who arranged the ceremony, the Serb side
rejected the venue, which was at the downtown National Theater for
what they called "security reasons".
</P>
<P>
But there are more than the security concerns and "they are
playing games", Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the first meeting on Monday of the presidency members
and the Paris meeting on Thursday between Izetebegovic and Serbian
leader Slobodan Milosevic, Bildt summed up this week's peace
process as "two pluses and one big minus".
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Bosnian Serbs, who control almost half of the
Bosnian territory and fought for independence, have been fuming at
the signing of a joint statement in Paris on Bosnian-Yugoslav
relations by Izetbegovic who the Serbs claimed did not consult
them in advance, according to reports from Pale, the headquarters
of the Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
U.S. assistant secretary of state Kornblum, who attended the
ceremony on behalf of his government, said that "we are extremely
unhappy and displeased" by the absence of Serb members of the
Bosnian joint institutions.
</P>
<P>
He refused to spell clearly what pressure to put on the Serbian
side, but pointed out that the joint institutions will be where
the international economic aid come to and the Serbian side would
be felt by the consequence of its boycott.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls for EU Admission of Poland by 2,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today called on the European Union (EU) to admit Poland by 2000 as
a formal member at the informal summit held in Dublin today,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chirac also hailed that the EU summit today has
allowed for the first time the discussion on the contents of reform
of EU institutions, the priorities of each nations, as well as the
the conclusion of the calendar for the Inter-governmental
Conference to discuss EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"This is important because the delay would have non-negligible
consequences," especially on EU enlargement, said Chirac at a
press conference, while announcing "numerous convergence on EU
institutional reforms" among its members.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that EU needs an accord "on a reinforcement and
greater visibility of its common foreign and security policy,"
which he described as "the weakness of Europe," and "a common
will to improve sensibly the functioning of the third pillar --
security and justice" among EU members.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of building a "European social
model" through the signing of a European social protocol, because
the tradition of public service is very important for France.
</P>
<P>
Britain has expressed reserve for the proposal to include a
social protocol into the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also asked EU to consider draw a treaty on the status of
overseas provinces and territories of EU countries.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Says EU Expects No Miracle from </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, October 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said today at the European Union (EU) informal summit in Dublin
that although EU expects no miracle from its joining the talks
between Israel and Palestinians, its participation is better than
nothing.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said today at the EU summit
that Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring will go to Erez, the check
point on the border between Israel and Palestinian territory of
Gaza, next week to join the non-stop negotiations between Israel
and Palestinian authorities.
</P>
<P>
"If one does nothing, it will be even worse," local media
quoted Chirac as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Friday
evening, said that since EU is the biggest, if not exclusive,
financial contributor to the reconstruction of Palestinian
territories and the equipment of the Palestinian authorities, it
should send an envoy to the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I don 't believe that security can be imposed by force. The
security which is wanted by all the Israelis depends on the
situation of peace, and the peace from the resumption from a
process of negotiations,"he said.
</P>
<P>
On the proposal made today by the Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi on the sending of a permanent EU envoy to the Middle East
peace talks, Chirac said that the idea has been "envisaged" but
not decided.
</P>
<P>
He again called on Israel to make concrete gestures and take
actions in the direction of peace instead simply talking about
peace.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Europe would not take side with any part of the
Middle East conflict and will not interfere into their internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chirac stressed that no one can question the fact that Europe
has a good will for the Middle East and is a major financial
contributor to the reconstruction of the Palestinian territories.
