Mahathir urges Malaysians to spend more
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
exhorted Malaysians on Friday not to stash their money at home but
rather to go out and spend it.
	   ``We need consumers to spend their money to revive the
economy,'' Mahathir said at a consumer conference.
	   Reversing an earlier policy of austerity to combat its worst
recession in decades, Mahathir is promoting spending in the hope
that higher consumption will make the economy healthy.
	   ``If, however, people want to save, they should put their money
in banks, where it could not only earn interest, but also be lent
out for business purposes,'' he said.
	   The government in recent weeks has revived many expensive
infrastructure projects, mothballed at the onset of the Asian
currency crisis last year, so that companies reeling from the
recession could benefit. Banks have also been pressured to lend,
despite many of them being crushed by non-performing loans.
	   Malaysia's economy is expected to contract by nearly 5 percent
this year. The government says the worst is over and the economy
will start growing in 1999.

Shanghai bans matchmaking with foreigners for profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Shanghai has banned matchmaking between
Chinese and foreigners for profit, saying matchmakers focused only
on money had caused couples ``mental distress,'' state media said
Friday.
	   The city legislature passed the ban Thursday as part of new
rules to regulate the registration and counseling of marriages
between Chinese and foreigners, the official Xinhua News Agency
said.
	   Included are marriages to Chinese from Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Macau. Violators can be fined and have their profits confiscated.
	   Some 3,000 Shanghainese marry foreigners or Chinese from outside
the mainland ever year, Xinhua said.
	   ``Certain matchmaking agencies from both at home and abroad have
concentrated solely on earning extravagant profits and ... caused
clients to suffer mental distress and financial losses,'' Xinhua
said.
	   Under the rules, which take effect Dec. 1, Shanghainese who want
to marry or divorce a foreign spouse will have to register with the
city, which is to approve or reject the request within 30 days.

Bad weather seen pushing Philippine rice production down 20 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine rice production is
expected to fall 20 percent this year because of bad weather,
including a drought, typhoons and heavy rains, the agriculture
department said Friday.
	   Acting Agriculture Secretary William Dar said production of
palay, or unhusked rice, is expected to total only 8.99 million
tons in 1998, down from 11.27 million tons in 1997.
	   Production during the first half of the year was about 1 million
tons lower than a year earlier because of a prolonged drought
attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon, Dar said in a report
to President Joseph Estrada.
	   He said heavy damage to crops from recent typhoons and predicted
heavy rains during the remainder of the year are also expected to
also reduce production.
	   Dar said the Philippines imported 1.9 million tons of rice
through the end of October, and an additional 350,000 tons is
expected to begin arriving in December to help make up for the
shortfall. Estrada has also authorized the importation of up to an
additional 300,000 tons of rice, if needed.
	   The agriculture department said corn production is expected to
total 3.9 million tons in 1998, 8.7 percent less than last year,
mainly because of a reduction in area harvested.

Moderate earthquake rocks central Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A moderate earthquake rocked the
central Philippines before dawn Friday, but authorities reported no
damage or injuries.
	   The earthquake, with an initial magnitude of 5.4, hit at 2:05
a.m. (1805 GMT Thursday) and was centered off the northern coast of
central Samar island, about 440 kilometers (275 miles) southeast of
Manila, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
said.
	   Seismologist Daphnie Agonia said the quake, caused by the
movement of the Philippine Trench under the San Bernardino Strait,
was not strong enough to generate tsunami waves.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is planning a tour of
the Gulf states to lobby for international condemnation of Iraq's
decision to stop cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors, the
Foreign Office said Friday.
	   Cook, Defense Secretary George Robertson and a junior Foreign
Office minister Derek Fatchett are expected to make the visits in
the next two weeks. A Foreign Office spokeswoman, speaking with
customary anonymity, said additional details were not yet
available.
	   British newspapers reported Friday that Cook would also use the
tour to urge a crackdown on any attempts by Iraq to evade the U.N.
oil embargo imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Guardian
quoted Cook as saying that he would be working with Iraq's
neighbors to ''cut the money that keeps this appalling regime in
office.''
	    &UR; U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen was in the Gulf this week
seeking support for possible air strikes against Iraq.
	   On Saturday, Iraq banned U.N. weapons inspection teams from

lift economic sanctions.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ With gunfire still echoing in the
distant Himalayas, India and Pakistan hope their latest round of
talks will end a battle on the Siachen Glacier that has killed 13
soldiers in 10 days.
	   Defense officials from both countries expected little progress
Friday on the longer term goals for the glacier: to disengage
forces, to withdraw from the frigid ice sheet and ultimately to
decide who owns it.
	   As if in preparation for the talks, artillery and machine-gun
fire has intensified in the last month. India has accused Pakistani
troops of trying to seize territory on at least seven occasions.
	   While not on the agenda, the two countries' rival claims to
Kashmir are likely to overshadow the talks between the two defense
secretaries. The Siachen Glacier forms the northern sector of
Kashmir, and foreign secretary level discussions last month on
Kashmir ended inconclusively.
	   Six days of scheduled talks began Thursday with a discussion on
using the water of the Jhelum River which slices through Kashmir.
India's Water Resources Secretary S. Hasan said the two sides but
made no headway but would meet again.
	   Other issues on the agenda include a proposal to start a rail
and bus service between New Delhi and the Pakistani border city of
Lahore, a possible deal for Pakistan to sell electricity to India,
and on ways to fight terrorism and drug-trafficking.
	   India hopes progress on lesser issues of trade and cooperation
can improve the atmosphere and ease the way toward a breakthrough
on Kashmir. But Pakistan says no progress can be made without a
Kashmir resolution.
	   India says 12 Pakistani soliders and one Indian officer have
been killed in seven attempts by Pakistani units to move into
Indian-held territory on the 76-kilometer-long (47 miles) Siachen
Glacier.
	   The glacier, 600 miles (965 kilometers) north of New Delhi, is
20,000 feet (6000 meters) above sea level and is known as the
world's highest battlefield. More soldiers die from high-altitude
sickness and exposure than from enemy fire.
	   The dispute has been discussed on eight previous occasions, and
negotiators were near an agreement in 1989 to disentangle forces
and retreat to less inclement locations.
	   But a deal could not be sealed without a broader agreement on
Kashmir, which has bedeviled relations between the two neighbors
for the 50 years since they became independent from Britain.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, each
claiming the whole of the troubled province.
	   The Kashmir conflict assumed greater international importance in
May when India and Pakistan conducted underground atomic tests and
declared themselves nuclear powers.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee met his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif in July and agreed to resume peace
negotiations suspended in 1997. But when the talks began last
month, they yielded little more than pledges to meet again in
February.

Polluted department stores warned to clean up or shut down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Five of Bangkok's leading department
stores have been found to be dangerously polluted by car fumes and
other gases and ordered to clean up or face closure.
	   The Nation newspaper reported Friday that the five were
discovered following a municipal inspection last month to have
amounts of carbon dioxide above maximum allowed levels.
	   They include the World Trade Center, a massive shopping bloc in
downtown Bangkok popular with tourists. A prevalent problem
appeared to be poor ventilation in car parks due to low ceilings
and inadequate fans.
	   Mahin Tanbunperm, an adviser to Bangkok's governor, was cited by
The Nation as saying that the stores were told to improve their
ventilation systems within 30 days. If the pollution problems
remain unsolved, they will be temporarily closed.

FIFA delegates say South Korea is free to build fewer stadiums
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ World soccer officials were drawn
Friday into a debate on South Korea's economic problems and gave
their support to a government money-saving idea.
	   FIFA delegates said that South Korea does not need 10 planned
stadiums in as many cities to play co-host to the 2002 World Cup
soccer finals with Japan _ the first in Asia.
	   A prolonged economic crisis has cast doubt on South Korea's
ability to build the stadiums and the Seoul government wants to
reduce the number to six or seven. But it is having a hard time
persuading the cities, none of which wants to give up host rights.
	   ``If South Korea says, `we don't need 10 but we need only six,'
FIFA will accept that because we don't need so many stadiums in
order to organize the matches,'' Peter Velappan, a FIFA
coordinator, said in response to a question at a news conference.
	   In fact, four stadiums would be sufficient for the 32 World Cup
finals matches planned in Korea, said Velappan, one of the five
delegates from soccer's world governing body, who arrived here
Monday to inspect South Korean preparations.
	   Park Seh-jik, head of the Korean Organizing Committee,
reiterated that his country can meet its original goal of building
10 stadiums at a cost of dlrs 1 billion. Thirty percent of the
money would come from the central government and 70 percent from
the provincial governments where the cities are located.
	   South Korea is lagging far behind, with construction just
beginning in only five of the chosen cities. Most of the 10 World
Cup stadiums in Japan, where the other 32 matches will be held, are
either completed or under construction.
	   The delegates, however, ruled out any possibility of relocating
some of the South Korean games to Japan.
	   ``It's very premature to even think about that. There is no
reason to believe that South Korea's commitment will not be met,''
said delegate Alan Rothenberg.
	   During their five-day visit that ended Friday, the FIFA
delegation, led by Vice President Antonio Matarrese, visited the
sites in Seoul, Pusan and several other cities where South Korea
plans to build stadiums.
	   Matarrese said he was satisfied with South Korean preparations
but recommended that the country improve transportation and
accommodations in the host cities.
	   FIFA plans to give final approval to host cites in South Korea
and Japan by May of next year after another delegation comes to
review progress in March.

Report: Dengue fever cases rising fast in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Cases of dengue fever are increasing rapidly in
tropical Singapore, where the number this year already exceeds the
total for 1997, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Although none have died from the mosquito-borne virus this year,
the disease has afflicted 4,628 people so far, about 400 more than
last year, said The Straits Times.
	   The environment ministry predicts the number of cases in 1998 to
rise to 5,000 as the monsoon season begins soon in Singapore,
providing mosquitoes with more breeding locations, according to the
report.
	   The year-end rainy season is expected to be especially wet in
1998 because of the La Nina weather phenomenon, a corollary to the
El Nino cycle.
	   Despite government-coordinated spraying campaigns, media blitzes
to educate the public, and increased fines for those who allow
mosquitoes to breed on their property, the potentially fatal
disease continues to be a problem.

Japan's Cabinet approves plans to launch spy satellites by 2002
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prompted by North Korea's recent launching of a
rocket over Japan, the Cabinet approved a plan Friday to put four
spy satellites into orbit by 2002.
	   The multi-purpose satellites will be used for ``information
gathering needed for crisis management,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary
Hiromu Nonaka told reporters after the decision.
	   North Korea fired a rocket over Japan into the Pacific on Aug.
31, showing Pyongyang could strike anywhere in Japan and making
many Japanese nervous about their country's defense capabilities.
	   Japan, which had no missile-defection system of its own, only
found out about the rocket from the U.S. military. North Korea
claims the launch sent a satellite into orbit, but Japan has
questioned that.
	   The satellite project approved Friday will be carried out by
adhering to a 1969 Parliamentary resolution that limits satellites
to nonmilitary purposes, Nonaka said.
	   Under the plan, Japan will launch the satellites on its own over
the next few years, said an official of the Prime Minister's
Office.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it had
not been decide whether the satellites will be 100 percent
domestically manufactured.
	   Ruling Liberal Democratic Party legislators have said Japan
should develop a joint satellite project with the United States to
monitor missiles.
	   The official said other details, including the amount of
development costs, will be worked out later through a special
committee to be set up in the Prime Minister's Office. The
satellite project reportedly will cost 200 billion yen (dlrs 1.69
billion).
	   Fukushiro Nukaga, director-general of the Defense Agency, told a
news conference that the project's approval was ``significant'' for
national defense.
	   Other government officials say the satellites will also be used
to monitor marine accidents, the entry of illegal immigrants into
Japan, and natural disasters.

Ancient volcanic eruptions discovered in the Antarctica
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A huge volcanic eruption rocked
Antarctica about 25 million years ago, spewing ash as far as 40
miles (70 kilometers) into the atmosphere, according to scientific
data released Friday.
	   Scientists from New Zealand, Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy
and the United States discovered debris from the eruption encased
in the rock taken from the seabed off the ice continent's coast.
	   Samples from drill cores taken from 360 feet (110 meters) below
the seabed off Cape Roberts show that layers of volcanic debris
from the blast were blown into the air, then settled on the sea
floor. The cores indicate there were up to four of the huge blasts.
	   The cape, 85 miles (140 kilometers) from New Zealand's Scott
Base and the U.S. McMurdo Station on McMurdo Sound, is the site of
a six-nation project drilling seabed deposits as part of a study of
past climatic change.
	   Tim Higham, New Zealand's Antarctica spokesman, said on Friday
that the rock cores are the first evidence of large volcanic
eruptions in the area around 25 million years ago.
	   ``The discovery of these volcanic layers demonstrates a far more
spectacular history of volcanic activity than was previously
suspected in the Ross Sea region,'' Higham said.
	   The thickness and coarseness of the main layer indicated a
``large volume eruption that generated an ash cloud reaching 30 to
40 miles into the stratosphere.''
	   It suggested an eruption ``as dramatic as that of Krakatoa (in
Indonesia) in 1883,'' which was heard _ and spread dust _ around
the world.
	   While the exact site of the eruptions was unknown, scientists
believe it was within 60 miles (100 kilometers) of the drilling
site. The Mount Erebus active volcano is only a few miles from
Scott Base.
	   ``The eruptions recorded in this core probably had a significant
impact, not only on Antarctica environment, but also on the global
environment of the time,'' Higham said.
	   Scientists believe rock cores from 1,500 feet (500 meters) below
the sea bed could unlock the history of the Antarctic's climate and
offer clues to global warming.
	   They also believe that studying earlier Antarctic warm spells
may help them predict what global warming may do to the world's ice
and sea levels.
	   The New Zealand dollars 9 million (U.S. dlrs 5 million) joint
venture drilling program is expected to reach as far back as 40 to
60 million years this summer, in the second hole drilled by the
project.
	   Last year's hole yielded material going back 22 million years,
including 32 different shellfish fossils and 15 previously unknown
species of algae, which scientists said indicate the Ross Sea off
Antarctica was several degrees warmer 1.2 million to 1.8 million
years ago.
	   Fifty scientists from 28 institutions around the world are
analyzing and describing the seabed core as it is recovered by the
drilling team.

Philippine defense chief warns against Chinese encroachments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines is protesting recent
actions by China in a disputed reef because they could lead to
further Chinese encroachments on Philippine territory, Defense
Secretary Orlando Mercado said Friday.
	   On Thursday, the Department of Foreign Affairs summoned the
Chinese ambassador to protest the presence of Chinese ships, some
of them armed, off Mischief Reef, which is claimed by both
countries.
	   The Chinese started renovating platforms on the reef last week
in violation of a ``code of conduct'' which requires both sides to
refrain from provocative actions, Mercado said.
	   ``What we see as the emerging strategy of China is `talk and
take,''' Mercado said in a radio interview. ``There is a code of
conduct, the Chinese president even came here ... but they are
doing something else. That is what is worrisome.''
	   The reef is part of the Spratlys, a chain of islands and atolls
claimed in part or in whole by China, the Philippines, Brunei,
Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.
	   Mercado said the Chinese ships were first spotted by air force
planes Oct. 28.
	   He showed photographs of the Chinese ships off the reef, located
215 miles (345 kilometers) from the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   ``If they are allowed to stay there, what will follow next? If
we measure the 200-mile exclusive economic zone from Mischief Reef,
even Metro Manila would be included in the EEZ of China,'' he
added. ``If we do not protest, they would later be in Palawan.''
	   The Chinese Embassy said in a statement that it is China's
sovereign right to reinforce the structures because they had been
damaged by natural forces and were endangering the lives of Chinese
staff based on the reef.
	   It said the reinforcements were being made to the original
facility ``and it serves completely the purpose of peaceful use.''
	   Mercado, however, said that under the agreement, the Chinese
should have just abandoned the structures.
	   The Philippines protested in 1995, when China built concrete
platforms on Mischief Reef, one of several areas in the Spratlys
claimed by both Manila and Beijing.
	   China said the platforms were shelters for fishermen, but the
Manila government said they could be used militarily.
	   China's behavior caused suspicion among countries in the region
that it might be trying to gradually seize the Spratlys, which are
believed to lie atop vast deposits of oil, minerals and natural
gas.
	   Mercado said that since the Spratlys straddle vital sea lanes
and trade routes, any dispute would affect world trade.
	   ``Let us abide by the code of conduct, let us not change it,''
he said. ``Let the sleeping dogs lie. Do not disturb them ... if we
want peace.''

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Holland routed Australia 4-1 in its last
league match of the 20th Champions Trophy men's field hockey
tournament Friday.
	   The Australian defeat gives Pakistan a chance to qualify for
Sunday's final against Holland. To qualify Pakistan has to beat
Germany by at least one goal in its last league match to be played
later Friday.
	   Holland has clinched the lead in points with 12 points and is
now the favorite to become the tournament champions. Australia
finished with eight points. Australia would qualify for the final
only if Pakistan loses to Germany or the game ends a draw.
	   Australia needed at least a draw against Holland to guarantee it
a place in the final.
	   Holland went into the match without their star striker Teun de
Nooijer, who returned home Thursday because of a death in the
family.
	   Remco van Wijk shot Holland ahead with a 27th minute brilliant
field effort, while two minutes from half-time, Bram Lomans scored
off a penalty corner.
	   Lomans struck again off a 39th minute short corner before Marten
Eikelboom sealed the fate of the match with a superb field goal in
the 51st minute.
	   Trailing 4-0, Australia's Adam Commens scored his team's loan
goal with a fast reverse flick from the top of the circle to defeat
goalkeeper Guus Vogels.
	   Result: Holland 4 (Remco van Wijk 27th min), Bram Lomans (33rd
min, 39th min), Marten Eikleboom (51st min); Australia 1 (Adam
Commens (61st min)
	   Australia: Adam Commens, Jason Duff, Troy Elder, James Elmer,
Lachlan Dreher, Ben Taylor, Jay Stacy (captain), Daniel Sproule,

Bruins stop Leafs; Penguins down Senators
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Dmitri Khristich scored his 200th career goal and
Sergei Samsonov added a goal and two assists as the Boston Bruins
beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-1 Thursday night.
	   The Bruins won for only the second time in their last eight
games. They had scored a total of three goals in their previous
three games.
	   Boston goalie Byron Dafoe lost his shutout at 3:45 of the third
period when Derek King scored from the right slot on a power play.
Dafoe finished with 34 saves.
 &UR; Penguins 4, Senators 2
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Jan Hrdina scored the tiebreaking goal with
4:06 left in the third period as the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the
Ottawa Senators.
	   Martin Straka, Jaromir Jagr and Robert Lang also scored for the
Penguins, who fell behind 2-0 in the first period before scoring
four straight goals.
	   It was the 100th career victory for Penguins coach Kevin
Constantine.
	   Chris Phillips and Vaclav Prospal scored for the Senators, who
lost for only the second time in 68 games when leading after two
periods.
 &UR; Hurricanes 6, Islanders 3
	   In Uniondale, New York, the Carolina Hurricanes scored six
straight goals, including two by Jeff O'Neill, to overcome a
three-goal deficit and beat the New York Islanders.
	   O'Neill, Martin Gelinas and Kent Manderville scored in a 3:20
span of the third period to help goalie Trevor Kidd get his first
win this season. Kidd made 16 saves in his fourth start of the
year.
	   Curtis Leschyshyn and Paul Ranheim also scored for the
Hurricanes.
	   The Islanders took a 3-0 lead in the first period on goals by
Eric Brewer, Mike Watt and Kenny Jonsson before the Hurricanes
rallied.
 &UR; Kings 2, Blues 2 &QC; 
	   In Inglewood, California, Pavol Demitra and Al MacInnis scored
power-play goals less than two minutes apart against the NHL's most
successful penalty-killing unit as the St. Louis Blues rallied to
tie the Los Angeles Kings.
	   Luc Robitaille and Glen Murray scored for the Kings, setting up
each other's goals less than 5 1/2 minutes apart in the first
period.
	   The Blues, whose 7-0-1 record against the Kings last season
included a four-game sweep in the first round of the playoffs, fell
behind 2-0 in the first 11 1/2 minutes on Robitaille's fifth goal
and Murray's third.
	   Coming off consecutive shutout losses at home for the first time
since their inaugural season of 1967-68, the Kings ended their
drought at 132 minutes and 28 seconds when Robitaille's wraparound
glanced off the blade of goaltender Jamie McLennan's stick and over
his right shoulder.

Sir Paul McCartney says he may not be able to perform live again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Paul McCartney fears grief over his wife's
death may prevent him from performing live ever again, a British
tabloid reported Friday.
	   ''I might not be able to get up on stage again,'' the former
Beatle told The Sun, Britain's biggest-selling tabloid. ''I don't
know whether I can go up there and sing, thinking about Linda.
	   Linda McCartney died in April at the McCartney family's Arizona
ranch after suffering from breast cancer. She was 56.
	   The Beatle said he had been invited by Chrissie Hynde of the
Pretenders to participate in a string of concerts next year
highlighting Mrs. McCartney's crusade for animal rights. But The
Sun quotes McCartney as saying he will ''play it by ear. If I can
manage it, then I will. But I've said that if I can't do it, she'll
just have to forgive me.''
	   McCartney also said he always carries Mrs. McCartney's wedding
ring in his pocket, and has ''cried more this year than I have in
my whole life,'' The Sun said.

Frightened supporters of Malaysian dissident campaign outside the
</HEADLINE>
country
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A close aide to Anwar Ibrahim decided
it was time to leave Malaysia when he saw his jailed leader on
television with a black eye, allegedly from a police beating.
	   Now, Mohamed Ezam Mohamed Nor, a longtime campaigner for
Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister, is in neighboring
Indonesia to drum up regional support for his pro-democracy cause.
	   He said he was shocked to see Anwar show up with bruises at his
Oct. 5 arraignment in Kuala Lumpur on sex and corruption charges.
The onetime heir-apparent to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who
fell out with his mentor partly over how to handle an economic
crisis, claimed police beat him after his Sept. 20 arrest.
	   ``I left because I thought I had to work outside the country,''
31-year-old Mohamad Ezam said Friday in a telephone interview in
Jakarta. ``I didn't think I could trust the system anymore. I would
have been immobilized if I had stayed inside.''
	   In recent weeks, Malaysian police have rounded up pro-Anwar
demonstrators in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. Now, the political
activities of Mohamad Ezam and several other Anwar lieutenants who
left home for fear of arrest could draw other Southeast Asian
countries further into Malaysia's political drama.
	   Malaysian police have not commented on whether arrest warrants
are out for the dissidents, whose networking outside Malaysia is
loosely organized.
	   Anwar can count on the sympathy of Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie and President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines, who
consider him a friend.
	   Last month, both men met Anwar's daughter, Nurul Izzah, in what
the government of Mahathir viewed as interference in its internal
affairs.
	   Members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a
regional trade group, have traditionally refrained from commenting
on each other's domestic affairs.
	   Mohamad Ezam, former political secretary to Anwar, was on hand
for the meeting between Habibie and the Malaysian dissident's
daughter. He has also pressed his case against Mahathir at think
tanks and non-governmental organizations around the Indonesian
capital.
	   Habibie, who is implementing democratic reforms in the wake of
the May ouster of President Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian
rule, is worried about the plight of Anwar.
	   ``He gave his ears to us. Of course, he's very much concerned
about what happened to his friend,'' said Mohamad Ezam, ex-head of
the Institute for Policy Research, a Malaysian think tank run by
Anwar.
	   The Indonesian government has made no move to halt his political
activities.
	   Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, another Anwar aide and former
official in Malaysia's ruling United Malays National Organization
party, is trying to publicize Anwar's plight in Thailand. Malaysian
dissident Abdul Rahim Ghouse, a businessman, is doing the same in
the Philippines.
	   Mohamad Ezam said he and his colleagues don't believe it is safe
for them to return to Malaysia now and plan to campaign to sway
international opinion against Mahathir.
	   ``We plan to expand,'' he said. ``We will go with our work
outside the region.''

Dollar climbs in Tokyo, Japanese stocks close lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stocks, mid-afternoon bond and
currency prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Friday on
speculation that interest rates in the United States may not
continue to fall. Japanese stock prices fell for a second
consecutive day.
	   The dollar bought 118.28 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.64
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and slightly above its late New
York level of 117.67 yen.
	   The greenback moved higher against the yen after U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that he is ``already
seeing significant signs of some reversals'' in the bond-market
movement that prompted the Fed to cut rates in September and
October.
	   Though many Wall Street analysts expect another modest rate cut
following the Fed's policy committee meeting on Nov. 17,
Greenspan's remarks and recent economic data showing continued
strong demand for labor sparked speculation lower rates may not be
imminent.
	   The dollar also got a boost vis-a-vis European currencies after
Britain's central bank on Thursday cut its official dealing rate by
a greater-than-expected half a percentage point to 6.75 percent.
	   That hurt the British pound because lower rates reduce demand
for a country's currency by making interest-bearing securities less
attractive to foreign investors.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices declined for a second
day as investors cashed in on a rally earlier in the week. Before
staging a retreat on Thursday, the main stock index soared 963.30
points, or 7.1 percent, over the course of the previous two days.
	   On Friday, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average declined
219.40 points, or 1.53 percent, to close at 14,121.97. It had shed
186.44 points, or 1.28 percent, on Thursday.
	   ``The market is correcting itself after its 900 point rally
earlier this week,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the
stock division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The bout of profit-taking was triggered by worry an economic
stimulus package due out later this month will be insufficient to
put Japan back on track for recovery, traders said.
	   ``It looks like the package may lack substance,'' said Kunihiro
Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities
Co. ``There are still expectations, but they are weakening.''
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 15.10 points, or 1.37
percent, to 1,089.47. The TOPIX closed down 2.79 points, or 0.25
percent, on Thursday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.840 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.860 percent,
driving its price up to 108.53 yen from 108.34 yen.

Rat poison suicide causes scare at hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A man who died after swallowing 100
tablets of rat poison caused the evacuation of a hospital ward when
his body started emitting a deadly gas, authorities said Friday.
	   The unnamed 44-year-old man took aluminum phosphide tablets,
which when dissolved emit a fumigant used by farmers to rid grain
silos of rodents and weevils.
	   The man was taken by ambulance to Liverpool Hospital in Sydney's
western suburbs after police found him lying unconscious on a
roadside embankment Thursday afternoon, a police spokesman said.
	   The man died less than an hour later in the emergency ward of
the hospital, they said, on condition of anonymity.
	   His body began emitting a pungent odor soon afterwards, and
about 20 people in the center became nauseous.
	   The fire brigade closed the casualty ward and switched off the
hospital's air-conditioning so the gas would not spread.
	   Poison unit member Robert Wormleaton said the tablets were
creating phosphine gas inside the man's body that was oozing out
through the pores of his skin.
	   The gas, when inhaled, could be fatal to humans at only three
parts per million of air, he said.
	   Wearing breathing equipment, officers sealed the man's body in a
hazardous chemicals suit and packed it into a bright-orange toxic
waste drum, he said.
	   Fire brigade supervisor Brian Peter said firefighters wearing
hazardous chemical suits then loaded the drum onto a truck which
was driven to the morgue.
	   Liverpool Hospital general manager Colin MacArthur said eight
hospital staff members and some ambulance and police officers were
monitored for effects of the gas. All were given a clean bill of
health.
	   A Health Department spokeswoman said that as the tablets
dissolved in the man's stomach fluids, gas would have caused
respiratory failure, damage to the lungs and the central nervous
system, and body tissues to dissolve.

Israeli cabinet meets, may not vote on Wye accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet convened Friday to continue
its debate on last month's agreement with the Palestinians, but the
Israelis may raise another demand of the Palestinians before
voting.
	   Previewing the next crisis in a series since the Wye River
accord was signed at the White House October 26, Israeli leaders
insisted that the Palestinians state clearly that their
parliament-in-exile will cancel portions of their covenant calling
for destruction of the Jewish state.
	   The Palestinians say the parliament, called the Palestine
National Council (PNC), fulfilled the Israeli demand in 1996, when
a special PNC session in Gaza voted to cancel clauses that
contradict peace accords with Israel.
	   During Thursday's 13-hour-long Cabinet debate, several ministers
demanded clarifications before the Cabinet votes, according to a
statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's office. It said all the
ministers agreed that the issue must be cleared up.
	   Israel says the Wye River accord cannot be implemented until its
Cabinet and parliament ratify it.
	   The Wye River accord states that two lesser bodies are to
reaffirm the PNC decision of 1996, and members of the PNC and other
bodies are to meet in Gaza to hear an address by President Clinton
and ``reaffirm their support for the peace process.''
	   A letter from the United States government to Israel states that
this process ``will make clear, once and for all,'' that the
clauses of the covenant that call for Israel's destruction are
nullified.
	   The Israeli statement said ``All the members of the PNC must
meet and ratify'' a letter by Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, declaring the clauses null and void.
	   Palestinian officials state flatly that there will be no such
vote by the PNC.
	   The Israeli Cabinet debate was due to end Friday with a vote.
The report of another possible delay may reflect growing opposition
within the Cabinet to the accord.
	   Netanyahu delayed the Cabinet session for a week, demanding
clarifications from the Palestinians about the arrest of 30
Palestinians suspected of killing Israelis. The Palestinians say
they did not give any assurances. Netanyahu convened the session
Thursday, saying he had received clarifications from the United
States.
	   Besides the issues of the terror suspects and the covenant,
Israeli Cabinet ministers are concerned about the security aspects
of Israel's promised handover of another 13.1 percent of the West
Bank to Palestinian civilian control.
	   Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, a leading critic of the
withdrawal until he helped negotiate the accord at Wye Plantation,
told Israel Radio that he talked to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright last night. He did not give details.
	   Trying to reassure Israeli settlers in the West Bank, Sharon
declared that not a single Israeli settlement would be isolated
inside Palestinian-controlled territory by the Palestinians, since
Israel will control access roads to all the settlements.
	   Leaders of the settlement movement say that the withdrawal will
leave 18 settlements less than one kilometer (half a mile) from
territory under Palestinian control. They warned that this would
give armed Palestinian extremists easy access to carry out terror
attacks in the settlements.
	   Israeli officials pledged that security would be stepped up in
the 18 settlements.
	   Netanyahu set up a ministerial committee to meet with the
settlers to make changes in the withdrawal map. The settlers
agreed, but emphasized that this does not mean they will back the
agreement.
	   During the negotiations, settlers blocked West Bank
intersections and demonstrated in Jerusalem against the emerging
accord.

Chileans split over what should be next for Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London
caused a deep split among Chileans, and now an equally profound
division is emerging on what to do when the former dictator returns
home.
	   Some insist _ as they long have _ that he should be tried in
Chile for human rights violations that occurred during his long
regime. Others speak of forgiveness and the need for
reconciliation.
	   One idea appears less controversial: Even some staunch Pinochet
supporters say that whatever the outcome of his legal situation in
London, he should retire from politics.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a warrant from
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who wants to extradite him on
accusations of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   The London High Court recognized Pinochet's immunity from
prosecution as a former chief of state, but an appeal on that
ruling has yet to be decided by the House of Lords.
	   During Thursday's proceedings in London, attorney Ian Brownlie
told the House of Lords that the Spanish warrant was ``a hopeful
opening in the wall of impunity'' that has surrounded the
82-year-old general. Brownlie represents the two sisters of William
Beausire, a British stockbroker who vanished in 1975; and Sheila
Cassidy, a British doctor tortured in 1976.
	   The hearing was adjourned until Monday, when Pinochet's lawyers
were to begin arguing his case.
	   The Chilean government, admitting ``deep political differences''
with Pinochet, continues to seek his release ``as a matter of
principle'' _ claiming he has diplomatic immunity and that foreign
courts have no right to deal with events that occurred in Chile.
	   Other Chileans appear uneasy at seeing foreign tribunals
attempting to seek justice, something they say was never
accomplished here.
	   ``The world is telling us that we have an uncompleted task when
it comes to human rights,'' said socialist leader Ricardo Lagos.
	   The civilian government that came after Pinochet in 1990
determined that 2,095 people were killed for political reasons
during his 17-year dictatorship, and 1,102 remain unaccounted for
after being arrested by his security services. Thousands were
arrested and tortured, and tens of thousands forced into exile.
	   President Eduardo Frei, addressing a gathering of businessmen
late Tuesday, said ``Chile has a wounded soul'' over the human
rights issue and vowed ``to try to heal that wound with patience,
generosity.''
	   ``But it won't be an easy task,'' Frei admitted.
	   Viviana Diaz, vice president of an association of dissidents'
relatives who disappeared after being arrested by Pinochet's secret
police, vowed to continue efforts to have Pinochet tried.
	   ``We will continue our fight for truth and justice,'' she said.
	   A ``commission of personalities,'' to be headed by Santiago's
Catholic Bishop Francisco Errazuriz is being formed to gather
information on the missing dissidents.
	   But a report Thursday in the government newspaper La Nacion
anticipated difficulty for that plan because many of the dead were
cremated immediately after their killings.
	   A panel of legal experts from pro-government parties is studying
the possibilities of a Pinochet trial.
	   That move wouldn't be easy because Pinochet has immunity as a
senator-for-life _ a post he created. He also is protected by an
amnesty law he issued while in power that covers the 1973-78
period, when the most serious abuses occurred.
	   Meanwhile, many politicians say Pinochet should retire from
politics upon his return.
	   ``He remains as a divisive figure for Chileans _ as he was 10
years ago,'' Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said.
	   Interior Minister Raul Troncoso added: ``He would do his country
a big favor by retiring.''
	   And for the first time, even some rightists who support Pinochet
are joining calls for him to retire, or at least take a lower
profile.
	   Several senators tried to make it easier for Pinochet to retire,
proposing a constitutional amendment to allow members of congress
to resign _ legally prohibited now.

Australia, New Zealand expect tough APEC debate on free trade

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Citing Japanese resistance to further
reductions in trade barriers in some industries, Australia and New
Zealand are predicting a tough round of talks at the forhcoming
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting.
	   Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer said Friday the free trade
debate at the APEC meetings in Kuala Lumpur would be
``challenging'' and ``cantankerous.''
	   Senior New Zealand officials said bargaining to reach agreement
on key trade liberalization issues would ``go to the wire.''
	   Leaders from 20 Pacific rim countries and Hong Kong, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton, will attend the APEC forum meetings in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Nov. 17-18.
	   Firm advocates of free trade, the Australian nations will urge
APEC leaders not to retreat from the forum's broad goals.
	   APEC is aiming for free trade among its developed members by
2010 and full free trade by 2020.
	   Forum members have also agreed to fast track progress toward
free trade in chemicals, energy, fishing, forestry products, gems
and jewelry, medical equipment and instruments, and establishing
mutual recognition arrangements in telecommunications and toys.
	   The Australian government has said that while some adjustments
to APEC's free trade targets may be needed because of the Asian
financial crisis, the region still has much to gain from continued
trade liberalization.
	   Japan has balked at speeding up the reduction of its trade
barriers in the fisheries and forestry industries, the sectors it
sees as most vulnerable to foreign competition.
	   In top-level meetings Thursday, Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura told Australia that Japan was unwilling to make
concessions in those industries. Komura sent the same message at
meetings in New Zealand on Friday.
	   Some other Asian countries have also expressed doubts about the
free trade pact, which would lift trade barriers and lower tariffs
for some Australian dollars 1.5 trillion (U.S. dlrs 945,000
million) worth of goods and services in APEC countries.
	   Before the onset of the Asian economic crisis, APEC meetings
were marked by the development of a broad consensus and cooperation
among participating governments.
	   Australia indicated Friday the happy days may be over.
	   ``It's going to be a challenging, cantankerous meeting of APEC,
I would predict,'' Fischer said Friday. ``But I don't give up
easily, nor do my supporters.''
	   At a news conference, a senior New Zealand foreign ministry
official said Japan posed the most serious threat to agreement on
free trade. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   A spokesman for Komura, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said criticism of Japan's trade policies was unfair.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join at the Kuala Lumpur summit.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ LPGA rookie star Se Ri Pak received
South Korea's second highest sports medal from President Kim
Dae-jung on Friday.
	   Pak, 21, was one of three South Korean athletes receiving the
Order of Sport Merit Maengho, or Brave Tiger, in a ceremony Monday.
But she was forced to skip the event because of the flu.
	   ``I am proud of Korean daughters,'' said Kim after pinning the
medal on Pak in a brief ceremony at the presidential Blue House.
	   The president asked Pak about her health, and she responded: ``I
am O.K. now.''
	   Pak had been hospitalized for four days for treatment for flu
and exhaustion and did not take part in this week's Japan Classic.
	   She returned to her parents' home in the Seoul suburbs
Wednesday. She has since rested and done what she has wanted to do
the most _ ``shopping and gossiping with friends.''
	   Pak had been besieged by the media and driven to exhaustion with
an unending round of promotional events for her corporate sponsor
Samsung since she returned to South Korea on Oct. 27.
	   Pak rose to fame after winning four LPGA tournaments, including
the U.S. Women's Open and the LPGA Championship, in the best LPGA
rookie year since Nancy Lopez' debut in 1978.
	   She leaves for the United States on Saturday for the Tour
Championship, the last LPGA event of the year.
	   Los Angeles Dodger pitcher Chan Ho Park and golfer Pearl Sinn
received the medal Monday.

Taiwan to donate dlrs 2.6 million in Mitch aid to allies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's government will donate dlrs 2.6
million in hurricane relief to four Central American countries with
which it has diplomatic ties, the Foreign Ministry announced
Friday.
	   Honduras and Nicaragua, where at least 10,000 are believed to
have died in floods and landslides caused by Hurricane Mitch, will
receive dlrs 800,000 each in emergency aid, the ministry said.
	   El Salvador, which reported 239 dead, and Guatemala, where 194
were reported killed, will receive dlrs 500,000 each in aid, it
said. Private groups in Taiwan are also preparing shipments of food
and medicine, the ministry said.
	   Those four countries are among a dwindling number of nations
that recognize Taiwan, claimed by China as a breakaway province
without right to international recognition.
	   The sides have feuded over diplomatic recognition since they
split amid civil war in 1949, and China's unrelenting efforts to
isolate Taiwan have won away four of its former allies so far this
year _ leaving just 26 countries that now recognize it.
	   China refuses full diplomatic ties with countries that recognize
Taiwan.
	   ``In the spirit of aiding our fellow men and in order to express
our concern for the suffering of our allies in Central America, we
provide this aid,'' the ministry said in a statement.
	   Hundreds of thousands in Central America have been left homeless
by Mitch, which destroyed scores of communities before moving
northwest off the Honduran coast last week. It crossed southern
Florida on Thursday, damaging mobile homes and buildings and
injuring at least seven people before dying out over the Atlantic.

Remains of U.S. servicemen returned from North Korea

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of border handover, Jones comment &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) _ Skeletal remains believed to be those of
nine U.S. servicemen killed during the Korean War were returned
from North Korea on Friday.
	   American and other U.N. officers saluted as the aluminum caskets
changed hands in this border village inside the demilitarized zone
that separates the two Koreas.
	   Friday's transfer marked the largest number of remains to be
recovered from any single search operation.
	   The remains were unearthed by a joint U.S.-North Korean team
operating along the Chongchon River, about 160 kilometers (100
miles) north of the North Koran capital Pyongyang, during the past
three weeks.
	   Several of the remains were believed to come from the 25th
Regiment of the all African-American 24th Infantry Division, said
Robert L. Jones, deputy assistant secretary of defense for
prisoners of war and missing personnel affairs.
	   ``They overcame great hardship and prejudice and faced the
horrors of combat. The guns of war have fallen silent today, and
they are returning home,'' Jones said.
	   North Korea began repatriating American remains in 1990. In
1996, it began allowing U.S. forensic experts to search for remains
in its territory, assisted by North Korean officials.
	   The joint operations have led to the recovery of what are
believed to be the remains of 27 soldiers. One has been identified
so far. Work on several others is progressing.
	   The effort is part of an attempt to discover the fate of the
8,100 servicemen still missing from the Korean War. Besides those
missing, more than 50,000 American soldiers were killed in the
conflict, which lasted from 1950-53.
	   All told, about 240 sets of remains have been repatriated by
North Korea, but fewer than a dozen have been positively
identified.
	   The recovery of remains of American war dead is a key U.S.
demand for improving relations with North Korea.
	   No peace treaty was ever signed to end the war, and the Korean
Peninsula remains one of the most heavily armed areas in the world.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Friday on
speculation that interest rates in the United States may not
continue to fall. Japanese stock prices fell for a second
consecutive day.
	   The dollar bought 118.28 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.64
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and slightly above its late New
York level of 117.67 yen.
	   The greenback moved higher against the yen after U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that he is ``already
seeing significant signs of some reversals'' in the bond-market
movement that prompted the Fed to cut rates in September and
October.
	   Though many Wall Street analysts expect another modest rate cut
following the Fed's policy committee meeting on Nov. 17,
Greenspan's remarks and recent economic data showing continued
strong demand for labor sparked speculation lower rates may not be
imminent.
	   The dollar also got a boost vis-a-vis European currencies after
Britain's central bank on Thursday cut its official dealing rate by
a greater-than-expected half a percentage point to 6.75 percent.
	   That hurt the British pound because lower rates reduce demand
for a country's currency by making interest-bearing securities less
attractive to foreign investors.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices declined for a second
day as investors cashed in on a rally earlier in the week. Before
staging a retreat on Thursday, the main stock index soared 963.30
points, or 7.1 percent, over the course of the previous two days.
	   On Friday, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average declined
219.40 points, or 1.53 percent, to close at 14,121.97. It had shed
186.44 points, or 1.28 percent, on Thursday.
	   ``The market is correcting itself after its 900 point rally
earlier this week,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the
stock division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The bout of profit-taking was triggered by worry an economic
stimulus package due out later this month will be insufficient to
put Japan back on track for recovery, traders said.
	   ``It looks like the package may lack substance,'' said Kunihiro
Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities
Co. ``There are still expectations, but they are weakening.''
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 15.10 points, or 1.37
percent, to 1,089.47. The TOPIX closed down 2.79 points, or 0.25
percent, on Thursday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.840 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.860 percent,
driving its price up to 108.53 yen from 108.34 yen.

Report: Authorities detain six dissident to thwart political party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in the southwest Chinese city of Chongqing
have detained six dissidents to thwart activists' efforts to set up
an opposition political party, a human rights group said.
	   Five of the six were detained late last month and there has
since been no word that they have been released, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The sixth, veteran dissident Deng Huanwu, was taken from his
home Monday as he was preparing to protest to police about the
detentions of the other five activists, the Hong Kong-based group
said.
	   His whereabouts are now unknown, it said. The group said Deng
has already spent 19 years in jail as a ``rightist'' _ a label
applied to people who were regarded as opposing Communist policies
during political movements in the 1950s and 60s.
	   The Information Center said police were seeking to prevent
Chongqing dissidents from forming a branch of the China Democracy
Party.
	   Since June, dissidents in 11 provinces and major cities have set
up branches of the illegal party, and more are preparing to do so,
it said.
	   Authorities have refused dissidents' repeated attempts to
legally register the party and have detained many of the group's
supporters, mostly for short periods.
	   The Information Center identified the other five dissidents held
in Chongqing as Lei Yuanhai, Tan Zhiguo, Yan Jiaxin, He Bing, and
Xu Wanping. Xu was detained Oct. 29 having just been released after
15 days in detention.

President of Comoros Islands dead of heart attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MORONI, Comoros (AP) _ The president of the three-island nation
of Comoros has died at age 62, the country's religious leader
announced Friday.
	   President Mohamed Taki Abdulkarim died during the night, said
the religious leader, Saed Mohamed Toihir, on state radio.
	   He provided no further details, but French radio said the
president had suffered a heart attack.
	   The three-island Federal Republic of the Comoros is in the
Indian Ocean north of Madagascar.
	   Abdulkarim was the fourth president of the Comoros islands since
their independence from France in July 1975.
	   In August of last year, the island of Anjouan declared
independence and asked to be reunited with France. But Paris
rebuffed the request, saying the Comoros islands should stick
together.
	   A month later the government sent in troops to Anjouan in an
abortive attempt to stop the rebellion.
	   The defeat of the government troops emboldened the secessionists
who voted to secede, but the move was rejected by all nations but
Libya.
	   Moheli, the smallest of the three islands, joined the move for
secession but did not vote on it.
	   Comoros depends on the export of cloves and vanilla for its
foreign exchange earnings. The annual per capita income is less
than dlrs 200 a year.

Fighting between villagers leaves 19 dead in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of people were sheltering in
police and military stations Friday after a fight between villagers
that left 19 people dead.
	   The violence erupted Thursday on the island of Sumba when up to
2,000 residents from two neighboring districts attacked each other
with daggers, spears and other traditional weapons.
	   The fight broke out after rumors circulated in both the Loli and
Wewewa Timur districts that villagers had been murdered by
intruders from the other area. Some houses were burned and looted.
	   There have been no arrests, said Lt. Col. S.M. Simatupang, chief
of the local police in the town of Waikabubak, 1,440 kilometers
(900 miles) southeast of the capital, Jakarta.
	   ``The situation is relatively peaceful,'' Simatupang said
Friday. Many shops in the area were closed.
	   The Kompas newspaper reported Friday that in a separate
incident, at least three people were killed in fighting between
villagers in Lampung province in southern Sumatra island. The
killings occurred on Wednesday.

Indonesian army slams East Timor terrorist attack threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military Friday said it
was ready to act against a threat made by an East Timor rebel group
to launch terrorist attacks.
	   ``We will not tolerate any activity that threatens economic or
military installations in East Timor or elsewhere in Indonesia,''
said military spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif.
	   In the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, on Thursday, an East Timorese
group opposed to Indonesian rule in the disputed territory said it
was ready to resort to terrorism if Jakarta does not let six East
Timorese asylum-seekers leave the country.
	   Azancot de Menezes, the exiled Lisbon representative of the
Timor Socialist Party, said his group was ready to coordinate the
attacks with pro-independence guerrillas based inside East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of
Portugal's colonial administration.
	   The pro-independence Timor Socialist Party wants Indonesia to
permit the departure of six East Timorese holed up in the Austrian
Embassy in Jakarta.
	   The party's secretary-general, Avelino da Silva, his wife and
two daughters aged 4 and 6, and two other East Timorese clambered
over the embassy compound's walls 14 months ago.
	   Indonesia's military have accused Da Silva and his wife of being
members of a bomb-making gang, known as the Black Brigade.
	   The group allegedly planned to blow up civilian targets in their
fight for East Timor's independence.
	   The Indonesian government has refused to let them leave the
country and insists they should be prosecuted.

Times art critic embarrassed by `inattentiveness' in borrowing
</HEADLINE>
lead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Time magazine art critic Robert
Hughes denied he plagiarized but apologized on Friday to an
Australian writer for using part of her work in his review.
	   Australian-born Hughes' review of the art exhibition, ``New
Worlds From Old, 19th Century Australian and American Landscape
Painting,'' appeared in the Nov. 2 edition of Time magazine.
	   The review's first three sentences echo the first paragraph of a
review of the same show by Boston-based art writer and fellow
Australian Patricia Macdonald, in the July-September issue of
Australian Art Collector magazine.
	   Hughes said Friday that he was mildly embarrassed and that he
had apologized to Macdonald.
	   He told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio from the United
States that he had read many articles about the exhibition and that
Macdonald's lead was ``vivid ... (and) clearly stuck in my mind.''
	   ``I think Ms. Macdonald understands that it was not done as it
were either with malice or forethought or with the piece sitting on
the desk in front of me when I was writing mine,'' Hughes said.
	   ``I guess you can put it down to a kind of hyperactive memory,''
he said.

exploded &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Friday morning in
Jerusalem's crowded Mahane Yehuda market, and police said there
were dead and injured.
	   The car, a red Fiat, blew up at the entrance of the outdoor
market, which was packed with weekend shoppers. The car was on
fire, with black smoke covering the area.
	   Police tried to keep crowds away, fearing there might be a
second explosion.
	   The blast went off shortly before 10 a.m. (0800 gmt) at the
entrance to the outdoor market near Jerusalem's central bus
station.
	   Israel's Cabinet, which was meeting at the time of the blast to
debate the peace agreement with the Palestinians, dispersed after
hearing news of the explosion.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Friday morning in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed with weekend shoppers,
killing at least two people and wounding seven.
	   The attack was blamed on Palestinian militants.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the explosion would disrupt
the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.
	   The Israeli Cabinet which was meeting at the time to debate and
ratify the accord dispersed when it received news of the blast.
	   The rigged car, a red Fiat, blew up at the entrance of the
outdoor market. Minutes after the blast, the car was still on on
fire, with black smoke covering the area.
	   Police tried to keep crowds away, fearing there might be a
second explosion.
	   The blast went off at about 9:45 a.m. (0745 gmt) at the entrance
to Mahane Yehuda, an outdoor market near Jerusalem's central bus
station.
	   Witnesses said the car came to a halt near the market, and that
smoke was coming out of the vehicle. Some people approached the
vehicle, while others yelled at them to move back when the blast
went off.

Philippine police seize dlrs 1 million worth of heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine officials have seized 40
million pesos (dlrs 1 million) worth of heroin in a parcel
addressed to a Nigerian man who is under arrest on drug-trafficking
charges, police said Friday.
	   The heroin, weighing 550 grams (about 1.2 pounds), was
intercepted Thursday at the Manila international airport post
office, said Reynor Gonzales, police Narcotics Group chief.
	   The drugs were hidden inside the hollow blades of 12 specially
designed butchers' knives mailed from Karachi, Pakistan, to Andrew
Ibeh Madumeril from Nigeria, Gonzales said.
	   Madumeril was arrested with Peter Nwobodo, another Nigerian,
after they were linked to a package of cocaine from Brazil that was
intercepted last week.
	   The two men face drug-trafficking charges, which carry the death
penalty in the Philippines.
	   Police said Madumeril and Nwobodo were part of a group of West
Africans smuggling drugs to Europe and the United States, using the
Philippines as a transshipment point.
	   Police earlier intercepted two other parcels of heroin and
cocaine from Thailand and Brazil believed to be linked to the same
group.

Tribes people planning movement for implemntation of peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HASAN SAEED &QC;

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Frustrated at delays, a tribal leader
says he will launch a new public campaign to force the government
to comply with the 11-month-old peace accord that ended two decades
of tribal insurgency.
	   The tribes are demanding that Bangladesh troops evacuate their
region bordering India and Burma and that the tribespeople regain
the right to control the ownership of property in the hilly and
forested area.
	   The government, under pressure from the opposition which accuses
it of selling out national rights, says some troops must remain to
control the borders, and that other commitments were being
gradually carried out.
	   ``There is no alternative to agitation to secure the
implementation of peace accord,'' Manobindra Narayan Larma, who
signed the Dec. 2 accord, told a news conference at the frontier
town of Khangrachari on Thursday.
	   He said that last four rounds of talks that ended Monday on how
to implement the agreement were meaningless.
	   Larma did not specify what action he intended to take, but he
will summon his advisers next week to chalk out a strategy, a
tribal official said Friday.
	   A government official told The Associated Press the authorities
wanted to meet their obligations to the hill tribes, but it could
not be done overnight.
	   Tribal leaders have been critical of the government for
including three Muslim settlers in the council set up to run the
affairs of the three hill districts. The tribes, which are mostly
Buddhist, went to war in the 1970s to stop the intrusion of Muslims
from the overcrowded lowlands into their traditional territory.
	   Larma has rejected the government's offer that he head the
council until an election can be held. No date has been fixed.

Japanese stocks close lower, dollar higher in Tokyo

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell Friday on profit-taking
triggered by concerns over the government's efforts to bolster the
weak economy. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average declined 219.40
points, or 1.53 percent, to close at 14,121.97. It had shed 186.44
points, or 1.28 percent, on Thursday.
	   Share prices declined for a second day as investors cashed in on
a rally earlier in the week. Before staging the retreat on
Thursday, the main stock index had soared 963.30 points, or 7.1
percent, over the course of the previous two days.
	   ``The market is correcting itself after its 900 point rally
earlier this week,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the
stock division at Chuo Securities Co.
	   The bout of profit-taking was prompted by growing worries that a
government economic stimulus package due out later this month will
be insufficient to put Japan back on track for recovery, traders
said.
	   ``It looks like the package may lack substance,'' said Kunihiro
Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities
Co. ``There are still expectations, but they are weakening.''
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 15.10 points, or 1.37
percent, to 1,089.47. The TOPIX closed down 2.79 points, or 0.25
percent, on Thursday.
	   Declining shares exceeded advancers 763 to 363, with 167 issues
closing unchanged. About 339 million shares changed hands on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 569 million
issues the previous day.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 118.00 yen in
late afternoon trading, up 0.36 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also above its late New York level of 117.67 yen.
	   During the day, it rose as high as 118.45 yen and dipped as low
as 117.83 yen.
	   The greenback moved higher against the yen after U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that he is ``already
seeing significant signs of some reversals'' in the bond-market
movement that prompted the Fed to cut rates in September and
October.
	   Many Wall Street analysts expect another modest rate cut
following the Fed's policy committee meeting on Nov. 17. But
Greenspan's remarks and recent economic data showing continued
strong demand for labor has discouraged speculation for lower
rates.
	   The dollar also got a boost vis-a-vis European currencies after
Britain's central bank on Thursday cut its official dealing rate by
a greater-than-expected half a percentage point to 6.75 percent.
	   That hurt the British pound because lower rates reduce demand
for a country's currency by making interest-bearing securities less
attractive to foreign investors.
	   In addition, signs of stability in developing markets also
buoyed the U.S. currency, traders said.
	   ``The dollar had been sold off on concerns centered on problems
in emerging markets, Asia and Russia. Now we're starting to see
some buying back of dollars (as those concerns subside),'' said
Akihiko Ena, manager of the treasury department at Nippon Trust
Bank.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.835 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.860 percent,
driving its price up to 108.58 yen from 108.34 yen.

Prosecution hands over key police report in Anwar trial

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defense attorneys for Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister on Friday obtained a key police report
that said the sexual allegations against him were ``deliberately
created.''
	   Prosecutors agreed to hand over the 1997 police document during
the fifth day of the sensational corruption and sexual misconduct
trial of Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacked Anwar as his deputy and
finance minister Sept. 2, saying he was morally unfit to lead, then
had him expelled from the ruling party.
	   Anwar is standing trial on 10 counts of corruption and sexual
misconduct. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated
because Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to his 17-year
rule.
	   The police report involves allegations by the sister of Anwar's
private secretary, Ummi Hafilda Ali, who said her brother's wife
had sex with Anwar. Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, also
said Anwar sodomized him 15 times.
	   ``The allegations do not contain any evidence of proof and the
sequence of events appears to be something deliberately created,''
Mohamed Said Awang, the country's intelligence chief, read from the
1997 report he had handed Mahathir.
	   ``There are indications that there exists a certain group of
people that may have their own agenda, playing a role behind the
scene to urge Ummi and Azizan to smear Anwar,'' Mohamed read from
his report, at the request of the defense.
	   Mohamed, the prosecution's first witness, testified that an
ex-police officer, posing as a working officer, and another man
coerced Ummi and Azizan to slander Anwar.
	   Earlier, Mohamed testified that Anwar forced police to cover up
his alleged sexual misconduct by demanding that intelligence
officers get retractions from Ummi and Azizan.
	   ``Since the report says that the allegations were false and
baseless, it's perfectly legitimate for Anwar to ask for the
retractions,'' said Christopher Fernando, one of Anwar's lawyers.
	   Defense efforts to get another police report were stymied by
Mohamed, who back-pedaled from his earlier testimony.
	   Mohamed said Thursday he may have submitted another report to
the prime minister indicating one of his top aides may have
conspired with other Cabinet ministers to oust Anwar.
	   But on Friday, Mohamed said: ``I don't think there was such a
report. That is what I'm saying now.''
	   Mohamed also testified Thursday that he ``may or may not'' lie
if asked to by his superiors.
	   Anwar has insisted that the document exists and defense
attorneys say they may demand that Mahathir hand it over.
	   The judge adjourned the trial until Monday.
	   The case attracted international attention after Anwar showed up
at his arraignment with a black eye and bruises, claiming police
beat him after his arrest.
	   Dozens of diplomats, international human rights and jurist
groups are sitting in on the trial that is expected to last well
into next year.
	   Since Anwar's arrest Sept. 20, thousands of Malaysians have
participated in street protests demanding his release and
Mahathir's resignation.

Hong Kong's top video rental company lands in receivership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The economic troubles in Hong Kong claimed a
highly visible casualty Friday, as the territory's top video rental
chain closed its doors after being placed in receivership.
	   The accounting firm Ernst and Young said they would try to find
someone to purchase KPS Retail Stores Ltd. and put it back into
business.
	   ``This would safeguard employment and maximize the value of the
assets,'' said Wilf Timso, a partner at Ernst and Young, which took
control of the failed chain.
	   The firm planned to meet later Friday with many of the 430
people who work at KPS's 38 stores.
	   Dennis Smith, a director of CV Consumer Services Ltd., which
owns KPS, said in a statement that the company's bankers called in
Ernst and Young to act as receivers on Thursday night.
	   Smith said sales and cash video rentals didn't grow over the
summer as anticipated amid an economic slump that ``has severely
cripped many retail businesses.''
	   Smith also said that ``explosive growth in availability of
pirated video products, especially low-cost VCDs (video-compact
disks)'' has cost legitimate retailers more than one billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 128 million) in lost revenues over the past
year.
	   Timso said his firm was not able to offer any immediate comment
on the extent of the financial troubles at KPS because they had
received only ``preliminary information'' from the chain's
management.
	   But he said interested buyers might find KPS an ``attractive
opportunity'' and noted that the chain has a client base of 230,000
people who are registered to rent videos from its stores.
	   KPS had tried but failed to bring in outside investors to keep
the company afloat.
	   Hong Kong has come under international pressure, especially from
the United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. Washington has placed Hong Kong on a watch list of
suspected copyright violators.
	   Despite frequent raids, stores selling pirated compact discs or
CD-ROMs still thrive in Hong Kong. Copies of local or Hollywood
movies are widely available for under 40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5) _ sometimes before they're released in local cinemas.
	   Customs officers announced Friday they had arrested 11 people
and seized 270,000 pirated compact discs worth more than 13 million
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.6 million) in a raid on Thursday.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Friday morning in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed with weekend shoppers,
killing at least three people and wounding six.
	   The attack was blamed on Palestinian militants trying to
sabotage the land-for-peace agreement with Israel. It was not
immediately clear whether the blast would disrupt the accord.
	   The Israeli Cabinet which was meeting at the time to debate and
ratify the accord dispersed when it received news of the blast. The
ministers were to resume their meeting later in the day to discuss
what steps to take in response to the attack.
	   The rigged car, a red Fiat, blew up at about 9:45 a.m. (0745
gmt) at the entrance of the Mahane Yehuda market, just meters away
from the site of a suicide bombing in July 1997.
	   ``Flames came out of the exhaust and people started running
away,'' said Haim Cohen, a shopper. ``I saw some people who were
injured and the driver was killed. His body is lying there on the
street.''
	   Another witness, Yaakov Shlomo, said he heard two explosions,
and that after the first blast, most shoppers fled the area.
``Afterwards, there was a big explosion. When the big explosion
went off, there were already not that many people in the area. It
was a miracle from heaven,'' Shlomo said.
	   Minutes after the blast, the car was still on fire, with black
smoke covering the area. The smell of burned rubber covered the
area.
	   Police tried to keep crowds away, fearing there might be a
second explosion.

Teen-age girls sentenced for murder of taxi driver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) - Two teenage girls have been sentenced
to stiff prison terms for the premeditated murder of a taxi driver,
state-run television reported Friday.
	   The two handcuffed 15-year-olds, Diana Brasko and Andrea Bozzai,
listened impassively as the judge sentenced both to seven years and
six months in prison Thursday.
	   District arttorney Peter Bogar appealed for a tougher sentence,
stressing the premeditated nature of the crime and that the two
girls showed no mercy as they kicked their victim in the head and
upper body and left him in the sub-freezing cold.
	   In November last year, the two lured a 29-year-old taxi driver,
Janos Gaspar, to the outskirts of the city with the promise of sex
and then killed him, intending to steal and sell his cab.
	   Diana Brasko told the court she wanted to use some of the money
for plastic surgery as she was unhappy with the shape of her nose.
	   They took along a plastic soft-drink bottle filled with water
and once they lured him out of the car they knocked him out with
the bottle and proceeded to kick Gaspar to death.
	   Shortly before dawn, a police patrol noticed the taxi being
driven erratically. They pulled the vehicle over and noticed blood
stains on one of the girls' clothes.
	   On June 4, Bozzai and Brasko were formally charged with
premeditated murder committed with extreme cruelty _ a case
unprecedented in Hungary.
	   Child psychologists found the girls fit to stand trial.
	   In their closing remarks, both girls told Judge Andras Vaskuti
they regretted their crime.
	   Brasko's lawyer also appealed the sentence because of the girl's
age and that it was a case of manslaughter, rather than deliberate
murder. Bozzai's lawyer said he was considering an appeal.

Hong Kong and Singapore top list of world's freest economies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hong Kong and Singapore are the world's two
freest economies, according to a report from an international panel
of economists and researchers cited in a Friday newspaper.
	   The report, co-published by independent institutes from 54
countries, ranked Hong Kong as the most open of 119 major
economies, followed by Singapore, New Zealand, the United States
and Britain, said The Straits Times.
	   The Economic Freedom of the World 1998/1999 interim report was
based on seven main criteria: size of government, economic
structure and use of markets, monetary policy and price stability,
freedom to use alternative currencies, legal structure and security
of private ownership, freedom to trade with foreigners and freedom
of exchange in capital markets.
	   Organizations that contributed to the study include the
U.S.-based Cato Institute, The Fraser Institute in Canada and
Australia's Institute of Public Affairs.
	   Despite the Hong Kong government's recent intervention in its
stock market, the special administrative region continued to top
the list, which was last issued in 1990.
	   Singapore's scored highest for its legal framework and lack of
restrictions on the use of foreign currencies, placing it in the
second overall spot, said the Friday news report.
	   Other regional countries in the rankings were Japan at 14th,
Thailand at 24th, the Philippines at 31st, Taiwan at 39th, Malaysia
at 39th, South Korea at 44th and Indonesia at 47th.
	   The Cato Institute said the interim study showed that ``as
(economic) freedom declined, so did the average per capita gross
domestic product and the average growth rate,'' according to the
newspaper.
	   The freest economies enjoyed an average per capita GDP of dlrs
18,142 and average annual growth of 1.8 percent, while the most
controlled economies averaged just dlrs 1,538 per capita GDP and
were contracting 2.1 percent annually.

`The Information ... ' to UPDATE with authorities rejecting
dissidents appeal.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in the southwest Chinese city of Chongqing
have detained six dissidents to thwart activists' efforts to set up
an opposition political party, a human rights group said Friday.
	   Five of the six were detained late last month and there has
since been no word that they have been released, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The sixth, veteran dissident Deng Huanwu, was taken from his
home Monday as he was preparing to protest to police about the
detentions of the other five activists, the Hong Kong-based group
said.
	   His whereabouts are now unknown, it said. It added that Deng has
already spent 19 years in jail as a ``rightist'' _ a label applied
to people who were regarded as opposing Communist policies during
political movements in the 1950s and 60s.
	   The Information Center said police were seeking to prevent
Chongqing dissidents from forming a branch of the China Democracy
Party. Since June, dissidents in 11 provinces and major cities have
set up branches of the illegal party, and more are preparing to do
so, it said.
	   Authorities have refused dissidents' repeated attempts to
legally register the party and have detained many of the group's
supporters, mostly for short periods of time.
	   The Information Center identified the other five dissidents held
in Chongqing as Lei Yuanhai, Tan Zhiguo, Yan Jiaxin, He Bing and Xu
Wanping. Xu was detained Oct. 29 having just been released after 15
days in detention.
	   Meanwhile, authorities in central Hubei province rejected a
request Thursday by dissident Qin Yongmin and others to legally
register a group they have set up to monitor China's human rights
situation, the Information Center said.
	   Authorities said that to register, the group first needed to be
vouched for by an official organization, the Information Center
said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of students rallied at the
University of Indonesia and about 300 others marched on the
Parliament Friday, demanding that the powerful military get out of
politics and that the ex-president be sent to trial.
	   Both groups said plans to retain military appointees in the
nation's otherwise elected Parliament contradict a government
pledge to deliver sweeping democratic reforms.
	   The protesters also said former President Suharto should be
arrested for ``political and economic crimes'' and human rights
abuses.
	   ``Suharto has to be dragged into court and tried,'' said Fitra
Arsil, a protest organizer.
	   Suharto stepped down last May following a wave of protests and
deadly riots amid the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Since resigning, he has flatly denied allegations of widespread
corruption. Opposition groups have criticized a government inquiry
into his business dealings that has so far failed to unearth any
evidence against him.
	   Friday's protests came four days before Indonesia's highest
legislative body is scheduled to debate new political laws ahead of
elections planned for next May or June.
	   About 300 Islamic students marched down a busy road toward
Parliament but were stopped by security personnel about 200 meters
(yards) from the legislature.
	   The protesters waved anti-government banners. Dozens of women in
the group wore Islamic head scarves.
	   Massive student protests are expected to be held when the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly meets next week,
starting Tuesday.
	   A major issue before the assembly will be the future of the
military in Indonesia's Parliament. At present the military
directly appoints 75 representatives in the 500-member legislature.
	   Under proposed reform legislation this is expected to be cut to
55 seats, but pro-democracy groups want all military appointees out
of Parliament.
	   ``It's impossible to defend a situation where appointees of the
armed forces sit in Parliament. It contradicts the constitution,''
a student statement said Friday.
	   Last week, 8,000 students demonstrated outside the Jakarta's
national Parliament building, where the assembly is to be held.
	   The government of Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie,
says about 30,000 troops, police and other security personnel will
be deployed across the capital, Jakarta, to protect the assembly.
	   Habibie wants the assembly to endorse what he says will be major
democratic reforms to a political system that had been tightly
controlled by the authoritarian Suharto for three decades.
	   However, critics doubt that the assembly, dominated by former
supporters of Suharto, will deliver true democratic change.

Tajik govt. forces track down rebel warlord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajik government and former
opposition groups joined forces Friday to combat a maverick warlord
who threatened to blow up a dam and flood huge territories in
Central Asia.
	   The government forces and their new allies have flushed the
rebels out of the northern city of Khodzhand, but were still facing
pockets of residence in northern Tajikistan, officials said.
	   The rebel leader, former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, has
demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov frees all political
prisoners and bring his supporters to the government. Rakhmonov
firmly ruled out any talks with the rebels, saying the government
will destroy or capture them all.
	   According to the government's estimates, more than 100 people
have died in the fighting that has raged since Wednesday when the
rebels raided Khdozhand, the city 200 kilometers (125 miles) north
of the capital, Dushanbe.
	   The government started gaining the upper hand Thursday, but
Khudoberdyev said his guerrillas had mined the dam on the
Kairakkhum channel as a ``deterrence measure.''
	   ``It will flood vast territories of Central Asia,'' Khudoberdyev
warned in a statement received by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The dam he threatened to destroy holds a reservoir so large it
is referred to locally as a ``sea.'' The government dismissed the
threat, saying its forces were protecting the dam.
	   The fighting this week has been one of the most serious
outbursts of violence since a peace accord was signed last year,
ending five years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central
Asian nation.
	   During the war, the secular government battled a mostly Muslim
opposition. But the main opposition groups are now participating in
the government and the armed forces, and were taking part this week
in the operation against the renegade ex-colonel.
	   Speaking on national television Friday, the country's
Constitution Day, Rakhmonov said the old opposition has agreed to
help the government crush the new rebellion.
	   ``No one will be able to thwart the peace process,'' Rakhmonov
said in a television address.
	   He claimed that the government had taken full control of
Khodzhand and also freed its airport from the rebel hands that
allows to quickly bring reinforcements to the region. Meanwhile,
military helicopters buzzed over the Tajik capital, heading north
toward the battle zone.

Iraq criticizes U.S. threat of military action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An influential Iraqi newspaper on Friday
accused the Clinton administration of knowing ``nothing but the
language of threats'' and said the country was united to defend
itself against military action.
	   The editorial in Al-Thawra, which is published by President
Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party, came after the U.N. Security
Council voted unanimously to demand that Iraq resume cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The vote had been expected, but came too late Thursday to be
reported by Iraqi newspapers.
	   Although the council said Iraq's decision last weekend to halt
cooperation with the U.N. inspectors was a ``flagrant violation''
of U.N. resolutions, it was divided on whether it authorizes
military force.
	   U.S. President Clinton has said that ``no options are off the
table,'' suggesting the United States had not ruled out military
action to try to force Iraq to cooperate.
	   Iraq announced last Saturday that it would no longer work with
the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the destruction of
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles.
	   Al-Thawra said in a front-page editorial Friday: ``If the
American administration didn't like the decision and knows nothing
but the language of threats ... people who believe in their
national stance have the right not to respond to this kind of
language by backing down but with strength.''
	   ``We are fully ready for any fight and any sacrifice,'' it
added.
	   The newspaper noted that the government has said it will resume
military training on light weapons for an estimated one million
volunteers, but gave no other clue on how the country might defend
itself against an American assault.
	   Iraq's decision exempted U.N. nuclear monitors who work with the
Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   IAEA teams have been going into the field daily since Sunday,
but did not go out on Friday, the Muslim sabbath.
	   Iraq's vow of non-cooperation came after the United Nations
pledged a ``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions but failed to guarantee, as Iraq had demanded, that the
review would lead to a lifting of punishing trade sanctions.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   On Thursday, Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, said of
the Security Council's latest resolution that ``Iraq's response is
that it will not deal positively with the members of the (Security)
Council unless there is a clear stand that the sanctions on Iraq
will be lifted.''

President of Comoros Islands dead of heart attack

 &UR; Eds: RETRANSMITTING to Europe. ADDS details on interim leader,
background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MORONI, Comoros (AP) _ The president of the three-island nation
of Comoros has died at age 62, the country's religious leader
announced Friday.
	   President Mohamed Taki Abdulkarim died during the night, the
religious leader, Saed Mohamed Toihir, said on state radio.
	   He provided no further details, but French radio said the
president had suffered a heart attack.
	   The three-island Federal Republic of the Comoros is in the
Indian Ocean north of Madagascar.
	   Abdulkarim was the fourth president of the Comoros islands since
their independence from France in July 1975.
	   In August of last year, the island of Anjouan declared
independence and asked to be reunited France. But Paris rebuffed
the request, saying the Comoros islands should stick together.
	   A month later the government sent in troops to Anjouan in an
abortive attempt to stop the rebellion.
	   The defeat of the government troops emboldened the secessionists
who voted to secede, but the move was rejected by all nations but
Libya.
	   Moheli, the smallest of the three islands, joined the move for
secession but did not vote on it.
	   Comoros depends on the export of cloves and vanilla for its
foreign exchange earnings. The annual per capita income is less
than dlrs 200 a year.
	   Elections were expected to be held in three months. Meanwhile,
the president of the High Council, Tadjidine Ben Said Massonde,
will be the interim president.
	   Although the capital, Moroni, was calm on Friday, the army was
mobilized to keep order.

Islamic party recruits thousands amid mounting discontent

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Under a green-and-white striped
umbrella tucked between stalls selling fried snacks outside a
mosque Friday, Azman Mohamad did brisk business.
	   Azman is selling politics _ the hottest commodity in Malaysia.
Since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired his popular deputy two
months ago, discontent has been rising.
	   And that makes things far easier for Azman, a member of the
Titiwangsa neighborhood committee of PAS, who is recruiting members
for the nation's Islamic opposition party, Parti Islam SeMalaysia.
	   ``Just before and soon after the prayers, in about one hour, we
have recruited more than 150 people,'' said Azman, as he handled
the line of people paying five ringgit (dlrs 1.3) to enroll in the
party.
	   It was the first time, he said, that PAS had brought its
recruitment drive into the heart of Kuala Lumpur.
	   Last week, in a village called Kampong Pandan, on the outskirts
of the city, the party signed up 400 new members, he said.
	   ``Last month we signed up 7,779 new members,'' said Subky Latif,
the national spokesman for the party.
	   Since Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20, tens of thousands of
Malaysians have demonstrated in Kuala Lumpur and other towns
demanding Mahathir's resignation.
	   Sensing the mood, PAS quickly banded together with other
opposition groups to form the Malaysian People's Justice Movement,
a coalition that has regularly organized meetings to demand an end
to Mahathir's 17-year leadership.
	   Anwar faces 10 counts of corruption and illegal sex. He denies
the charges, saying they were trumped up to eliminate the challenge
he posed to Mahathir.
	   The PAS, which was formed in 1951, before Malaysia became
independent, has never been able to match the popularity and
strength of the ruling United Malays National Organization party.
	   The ruling party commands the loyalty of the majority Malay
Muslim community.
	   ``But I think now they (the people) realize that our party is a
reliable one. After years of so patiently explaining,'' Subky said
in an interview.
	   Many of the new members are from UMNO, the ruling party that has
won every general election since the country won independence from
Britain in 1957. The party claims a membership of 2.4 million.
	   PAS, which professes orthodox Islamic systems of law and
governance, has remained on the fringes of mainstream politics. In
1991, it gained control of the mostly-Malay northern state of
Kelantan and says it has 600,000 members.
	   And now, for the first time, it has a national voice.
	   Last month, PAS president, Fadzil Mohamad Nor said 500 UMNO
members had joined his party. An UMNO official confirmed the
defections.
	   ``I think it is time to change the Malaysian leader,'' said
Mahadi Bin Ahmad, 24, as he filled the four-page membership form to
join PAS at the kiosk outside the Kampong Baru mosque.
	   Mahadi, a clerk at a law firm, said he was giving up his
two-year UMNO membership.
	   ``I want to change the government,'' said Mahadi.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's massive public works spending package might
not be enough to spur domestic demand and power the sagging economy
out of recession, the government said Friday.
	   The Economic Planning Agency's monthly report said the economy
was still floundering in its worst downturn since World War II,
with the outlook darkened by unstable currency markets and
slowdowns overseas.
	   Despite the planned stimulus, which is likely to be worth more
than 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion), private capital spending is
still sagging because of concerns about the long-term prospects for
the economy, the EPA said.
	   One bright spot for the Japanese economy _ exports _ is also
endangered by the recent surge of the yen and signs of slowing
economic growth overseas, said Takashi Omori, director of the
Economic Planning Agency's domestic economic affairs section.
	   Flagging overseas demand is particularly worrisome because Japan
suffers from stagnant domestic demand, as consumers cut back
spending and corporations reduce investment.
	   The government announced Thursday that household spending dipped
1.5 percent in September from a year earlier, stretching the
longest-ever streak of such declines to the 11th month.
	    &UR; _____
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The economic troubles in Hong Kong claimed a
highly visible casualty Friday, as the territory's top video rental
chain closed its doors after being placed in receivership.
	   The accounting firm Ernst and Young said they would try to find
someone to purchase KPS Retail Stores Ltd. and put it back into
business.
	   ``This would safeguard employment and maximize the value of the
assets,'' said Wilf Timso, a partner at Ernst and Young, which took
control of the failed chain.
	   The firm planned to meet later Friday with many of the 430
people who work at KPS's 38 stores.
	   Dennis Smith, a director of CV Consumer Services Ltd., which
owns KPS, said in a statement that the company's bankers called in
Ernst and Young to act as receivers on Thursday night.
	   Smith said sales and cash video rentals didn't grow over the
summer as anticipated amid an economic slump that ``has severely
cripped many retail businesses.''
	   Smith also said that ``explosive growth in availability of
pirated video products, especially low-cost VCDs (video-compact
disks)'' has cost legitimate retailers more than one billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 128 million) in lost revenues over the past
year.
	    &UR; _____
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways
is forming an international consortium to bid for a stake in
troubled Philippine Airlines, according to reports out Friday.
	   Cathay Pacific would own 40 percent of the airline _ the maximum
allowed to foreigners under Philippine law _ while the Philippine
subsidiary of the American Insurance Group and another unnamed
Philippine company would buy 10 percent between them, the Hong Kong
Standard reported.
	   An airline analyst's report mentioned the same potential
partners but gave different sizes for their contemplated stakes.
	   Singapore-based DBS Securities Ltd. estimated Friday that Cathay
would pay about 1 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 128 million)
for up to 30 percent of PAL, with AIG and the third partner taking
a combined 20 percent.
	   Neither Cathay Pacific nor AIG would comment.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion in debt, and suffered a pilots' strike in
June.
	   The carrier stopped flying on Sept. 23 but resumed operations
last month. The closure came after a union representing ground
personnel turned down a management-proposed recovery plan that
included a 10-year suspension of its collective bargaining
agreement in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hong Kong and Singapore are the world's two
freest economies, according to a report from an international panel
of economists and researchers cited in a Friday newspaper.
	   The report, co-published by independent institutes from 54
countries, ranked Hong Kong as the most open of 119 major
economies, followed by Singapore, New Zealand, the United States
and Britain, said The Straits Times.
	   The Economic Freedom of the World 1998/1999 interim report was
based on seven main criteria: size of government, economic
structure and use of markets, monetary policy and price stability,
freedom to use alternative currencies, legal structure and security
of private ownership, freedom to trade with foreigners and freedom
of exchange in capital markets.
	   Organizations that contributed to the study include the
U.S.-based Cato Institute, The Fraser Institute in Canada and
Australia's Institute of Public Affairs.
	   Despite the Hong Kong government's recent intervention in its
stock market, the special administrative region continued to top
the list, which was last issued in 1990.
	   Singapore's scored highest for its legal framework and lack of
restrictions on the use of foreign currencies, placing it in the
second overall spot, said the Friday news report.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Dusit Thani PCL, a major
domestic hotel-chain owner, plans to sell a stake in its subsidiary
hotel operator, Royal Princess Co. Ltd., to an Australian business
group.
	   Chanut Piyaoui, the Dusit Thani chairwoman, was quoted by The
Nation newspaper as saying her company plans to sell the stake for
at least 1 billion baht (dlrs 28 million).
	   Chanut did not name the Australian group or say how much stake
Dusit Thani will sell. She said the buyer is conducting due
diligence in the company and is expected to make a decision in the
next 10 days.
	   The sale is part of Dusit Thani's restructuring of its hotel
group. Dusit Thani has said it wants to focus on managing its more
luxurious hotels and sell out its lower-tier hotels.
	   Dusit Thani manages a five-star hotel with the same name in
central Bangkok and other resort hotels outside the capital. Royal
Princess manages a lower-tier hotel in Bangkok and others outside
the capital.

Russia, Ukraine to sign 1999 gas deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian delegation left for Moscow to
sign a final agreement with Russia's gas giant Gazprom on gas
supplies to Ukraine in 1999, a news report said Friday.
	   Ihor Bakai, chairman of Ukraine's oil and gas monopoly Naftogaz
Ukrainy, led the delegation to Moscow and was expected to sign the
agreement Friday, the independent Ukrainian News service said.
	   The sides signed a preliminary agreement on 1999 gas supplies
earlier this week in Moscow, under which Ukraine is to receive 40
billion cubic meters (1.4 trillion cubic feet) of gas as payment
for transit of Russian gas through its territory to Western Europe.
	   No details of the final agreement were available.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest consumer of gas, needs about
80 billion cubic meters (2.8 trillion cubic feet) of gas annually,
of which only 18 billion cubic meters (630 billion cubic feet) is
domestically produced and the rest is imported, mostly from Russia.
	   Friday's talks in Moscow were also expected to focus on payment
of Ukraine's gas debt to Russia, which has been a source of tension
between the two countries for years.
	   The debt, currently estimated by Ukrainian officials at dlrs 340
million, could further rise to dlrs 660 million by the end of the
year if Ukraine fails to pay for an extra 4 billion cubic meters
(140 billion cubic feet) of gas it is buying from Russia for the
last quarter of 1998.
	   Ukraine's cash-strapped government is interested in paying off
most of the debt in commodities, including grain, while the Russian
is also demanding cash payment.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car rigged with explosives blew up Friday
morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed with Israelis
shopping for the Jewish Sabbath, killing two people and wounding
14.
	   The attack was blamed on Palestinian militants trying to
sabotage the land-for-peace agreement with Israel. Israeli police
said they were checking reports that the Islamic militant group
Hamas had claimed responsibility.
	   The Israeli Cabinet was meeting at the time about a mile away
from the scene of the blast. The ministers who were gathered to
approve the Wye accord broke off their session when they received
word of the explosion. The fate of the agreement was uncertain.
	   The rigged car, a red Fiat, blew up at about 9:45 a.m. (0745
gmt) at the entrance of the Mahane Yehuda market, just meters away
from the site of a suicide bombing in July 1997.
	   Witnesses heard a series of small explosions.
	   Yair Cohen, 43, said he was buying cookies when he saw a car
driving slowly, with smoke coming out of the hood and exhaust
pipes. ``People started to shout `car on fire.' After a while, we
heard a blast, and something hit me in the stomach,'' said Cohen
who was treated for minor injuries at Hadassah Hospital.
	   The car was a mass of twisted metal sitting in the middle of the
main intersection outside the market. Flames shot 100 feet in the
air. A charred corpse, covered by a blanket, lay several meters
away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.
	   Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool
of blood below the head. Rescue workers found things to cover it
with, sodden pieces of cardboard box, plastic shopping bags.
	   ``There was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an
Israeli border policeman who was patrolling the market and was
lightly injured.
	   One heavy-set woman, apparently in shock, climbed into an
ambulance, weeping. Three paramedics talked to her, persuading her
that she did not need medical treatment, and after a few moments
she climbed out of the vehicle again.
	   Soldiers and police wearing plastic gloves held back the crowds.
``It's dangerous _ stay back!'' they shouted.
	   Just a block away from the blast, shoppers went about their
business. One young woman shopper said: ``We can't stop with what
we are doing when this happens.''
	   Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian peace negotiator, said the
Palestinian Authority condemned the attack. ``This is a crime and
whoever commits this, hurts the interests of the Palestinian
people.''
	   Asfour said he hoped Israel's government would not seize the
bombing as a pretext for walking away from the Wye agreement under
which the Palestinians are to win control of an additional 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   The Israeli prime minister's office said the Cabinet would
reconvene later Friday to decide on what steps to take, but ``there
is no intention to continue discussions on Wye today.''

Corruption probe brings charges against police in Greece
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEREK GATOPOULOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Late one night last summer, a public
prosecutor seized police documents without requesting government
permission.
	   In a country where for years the police had been considered
untouchable, the July action by prosecutor Giorgos Gerakis rippled
through the ranks and appears to reach higher with each new
development.
	   Gerakis was looking for evidence that police were involved in
nightclub protection rackets and the lucrative trade of selling
residence permits to illegal aliens, including prostitutes and
wanted foreign criminals.
	   Coming from the usually insular and conservative judiciary,
Gerakis' investigation was a sign that police complacency and the
state's inability to control a rapidly changing society could no
longer be tolerated.
	   Earlier this week, the first indictments brought charges of
corruption and abuse of power against 16 people, including a former
chief of the Greek police and a senior aide to former Public Order
Minister Giorgos Romaios.
	   Public outcry over police scandals also cost Romaios his job a
week ago, when he was one of two ministers fired.
	   In addition, Gerakis' unprecedented actions have colored the
transformation that Greece itself has undergone in the past decade,
from a secluded European Union country of 10.2 million to one
facing unfamiliar and wide ranging societal stresses.
	   A country that once provided hundreds of thousands of emigrants
to the world now hosts more than 500,000 illegal immigrants.
	   Pouring into Greece following the collapse of communism in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, the immigrants fed criminal
and prostitution rackets.
	   With the government now trying to register and legalize illegal
immigrants, there have been reports that the process has in turn
given rise to more corruption, with bribery networks springing up
to facilitate the paperwork.
	   ``Corruption goes all the way through the police force, from the
very top to the very bottom,'' said Makis Triandafilopoulos, the
mild mannered host of a corruption-busting television program
called Yellow Press.
	   Triandafilopoulos' investigation and public airing of alleged
police corruption helped provide Gerakis with some of the
ammunition he needed to investigate the rumored criminal networks.
	   By the time Gerakis' investigation led to the first indictments,
the police were already reeling from a string of foul-ups and
botched operations.
	   They included a hostage drama that resulted in the deaths of a
fugitive and the woman he held captive and the shooting of a
Yugoslav high school student mistaken for a purse snatcher.
	   Triandafilopoulos said he thinks this week's charges against the
police are only the beginning.
	   Burgeoning prostitution outfits are thought to be among the
biggest rackets involving illegal immigrants in Greece.
	   Prostitution is legal, but highly regulated. Prostitutes must
register with police, have regularly updated health certificates
and pay taxes.
	   Triandafilopoulos argues that some of the alleged rackets begin
abroad and end in many of the illegal brothels operating in Greece.
	   ``We believe the operation starts with the (Greek) consulates in
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union who issued the visas,''
he said. ``This was continued by the Public Order Ministry, which
received these people and furnished them with residence papers.''

Two major Japanese announce strategic alliance, affiliate bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest restructuring of Japan's ailing
banking industry, two of the nation's biggest banks announced on
Friday that they will form a strategic alliance in a key business
area.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd., both among the top
10 banks in Japan, confirmed reports first published last week that
they will merge their trust banking operations into a jointly owned
venture.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Fuji Trust &AMP; Banking Co., to be set up by April
1 next year to operate alongside its two parents banks,
	   The link between Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank will also
provide a lifeline to a troubled Fuji affiliate, Yasuda Trust and
Banking Co., by providing an infusion of funds to the cash-strapped
lender.
	   The new venture _ unusual in that it links major banks from
industrial groups with few traditional ties _ will specialize in
asset management, a business field recently deregulated under
Japan's ``Big Bang'' program of opening financial markets to
greater competition.
	   Japan's financial sector has been hurt by a mountain of bad
loans and a prolonged slump in the overall economy.
	   Last week, Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. said it would close its
overseas banking operations and Sakura Bank Ltd., another core
company of the Mitsui group, announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs, or
20 percent of its work force, within three years.
	   On Friday, a major Japanese daily reported Sanwa Bank Ltd. will
slash the number of its domestic branch offices by 20 percent and
stop carrying out business transactions with foreign companies as
it halves the number of overseas branches.
	   Sanwa's restructuring coincides with plans to ask for a share of
public funds earmarked for strengthening the banking system in
recently passed legislation, the Mainichi newspaper said.
	   Under the terms of the tie-up deal announced Friday, struggling
Yasuda Trust will withdraw from overseas and sell its
asset-management business to the new venture by next October in
return for 140 billion yen (dlrs 1.19 billion) in capital to
write-off its non-performing loans.
	   The move to bailout Yasuda comes as a precursor to a possible
full-scale merger with Fuji Bank, said Fuji Bank head Yoshiro
Yamamoto.
	   For now, the two affiliated banks will link their on-line and
private banking businesses and integrate some administrative
functions, he said.
	   The move could ease concern about the financial health of
Japan's Fuyo industrial group, which is headed by Fuji Bank and
includes Yasuda Trust, Nissan Motor Co. and trading house Marubeni
Corp.

	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower for a
second straight session on profit-taking Friday.

	   Brokers said investors continued to take profits following the
index's sharp gains in the past week.

trading at South China Brokerage Ltd.
	   Among losers, Hutchison Whampoa fell 2.00 Hong Kong dollars to
53.00, Hang Seng Bank fell 1.75 Hong Kong dollars to 65.00, Swire

Philippine stocks rise on Wall Street gains; index up 2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose Friday on
follow-through buying set off by Wall Street's overnight gains,
despite a 1.2 percent drop in the value of the peso against the
dollar, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 35.77 points,
or 2 percent, to 1,797.37, extending Thursday's 47.51-point gain.
	   Dealers said portfolio investment in the stock market continued
to buoy prices, with the impact of the weaker peso being largely
ignored.
	   The stock market's strength surprised some participants, who had
expected a technical correction following hefty gains of recent
sessions.
	   Edwin Siao, trader for institutional sales at Abacus Securities
Corp., said strong investment inflows, particularly from domestic
participants, rather than fundamental factors, were driving the
market higher.
	   Siao said the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 132.33-point surge
Thursday was behind the continued buying of numerous oversold
Philippine stocks.
	   Once again, property and gaming concern Belle Corp. was the most
actively traded stock, closing 6 centavos, or 2.5 percent, higher
at 2.44 pesos on speculation that its Jai-Alai game franchise may
soon be approved.
	   Jai-Alai, a ball game, is a lucrative gaming activity, and is
expected to bolster the group's earnings once it becomes
operational.
	   The resilience displayed by the market is expected to continue
Monday, traders said.
	   ``There's still some upside potential left in the market, but we
are also preparing for a correction, Siao said.
	   Although the peso's decline failed to damp interest in Manila
shares, a stronger peso would probably have spurred more robust
gains, traders said.
	   The peso weakened in moderate trading as some banks took profits
on previous dollar purchases and others bought pesos to cover their
weekly reserve requirements, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 40.047 pesos for the day, up 1.2 percent
from Thursday's average of 39.585 pesos.
	   Traders said the peso's weakness was a mere correction, as most
banks were already long on dollars after accumulating the currency
following the peso's sharp gains.
	   The peso rose to a five-month high against the dollar earlier in
the week on strong inflows to the stock market and remittances from
Filipinos working overseas.
	   Traders said the yen's sharp fall against the dollar also
weighed on sentiment for the peso.

Singapore's previous high growth rate a thing of the past
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The quick pace of growth Singapore enjoyed
prior to the Asian crisis will not return, even after the regional
slowdown subsides, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
said Friday.
	   ``We cannot expect the same headlong growth we have enjoyed over
the last decades,'' said Lee at the launch of a book on the
management of Singapore's economy.
	   He added that Singapore's ``transition to slower growth is
taking place now, much sooner than we expected, even though we have
not yet really matured or become a developed economy.''
	   In his contribution to the compilation of essays, ``Singapore:
Re-Engineering Success,'' Lee wrote that while the country has
prospered from 8 percent annual growth for many years, a 5 percent
yearly expansion over the next three decades is now more realistic.
	   He conceded that the continuing regional turmoil is ``a timely
reminder of how abruptly an apparently favorable outlook can change
for the worse.''
	   The government has reacted to the crisis with measured fiscal
and monetary responses, while liberalizing its important financial
sector in an attempt to position itself for renewed regional
growth.
	   Lee warned in his essay that Singapore's ``size and
vulnerability makes the consequences of inadequate or incompetent
government far graver for us than for other countries.''
	   In his speech, Lee also stressed the need for far-sighted
economic management amid short-term solutions to the slowdown, such
as cost-cutting.
	   ``We cannot navigate the next 30 years on auto-pilot,'' Lee said
in the essay. ``In a rapidly changing world, we either adapt or

	   MORONI, Comoros (AP) _ The president of the Indian Ocean nation
of Comoros, which has been undergoing turbulence since one of its
islands declared independence last year, has died at the age of 62,
the country's religious leader announced Friday.
	   Mohamed Taki Abdulkarim died overnight, the religious leader,
Saed Mohamed Toihir, said on state radio. He provided no further
details, but French radio said the president had suffered a heart
attack.
	   Abdulkarim was the fourth president of the Comoros islands since
their independence from France in July 1975.
	   Elections were to be held within three months. Meanwhile, the
president of the High Council, Tadjidine Ben Said Massonde, will be
the interim president.
	   Although the capital, Moroni, was calm on Friday, the army was
mobilized to keep order.
	   The three-island Federal Republic of the Comoros is in the
Indian Ocean north of Madagascar. It has been undergoing a bitter
secessionist conflict since August of last year, when the island of
Anjouan declared independence and asked to be reunited with France.
	   Paris rebuffed the request, saying the Comoros islands should
stick together. A month later the government sent in troops to
Anjouan in an abortive attempt to stop the rebellion.
	   The defeat of the government troops emboldened the
secessionists, but the move was rejected by all nations but Libya.
	   Moheli, the smallest of the three islands, joined the move for
secession but did not vote on it.
	   An international conference last December failed to resolve the
conflict, and in February, Mozambique's president was asked to help
mediate.
	   Anjouan was also reported calm on Friday.
	   Comoros depends on the export of cloves and vanilla for its
foreign exchange earnings. The annual per capita income is less
than dlrs 200 a year.
	   Abdulkarim was elected president in 1996, replacing President
Said Mohamed Djohar.
	   An engineer, he entered politics in 1967 as a deputy in the
national assembly. When the Comoros gained independence in 1975, he
was accused of plotting to topple the first president, Ali Soilih.
He was imprisoned until a 1978 coup, when he became the assembly's
president under President Ahmed Abdallah.

Investigators question man in Kremlin car bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The man who blew up his car just outside the
Kremlin gates was being questioned by security officials Friday at
a Moscow hospital, authorities said.
	   Ivan Orlov, 65, suffered only ``scratches'' on Wednesday evening
when he drove his car across Red Square, and then jumped out and
detonated a bomb just outside Spassky Gate, said Alexander
Shcherbak, the chief physician at Sklifasovsky Hospital.
	   Three security guards were injured, all more seriously than
Orlov, the doctor told the ITAR-Tass news agency. The most
seriously injured man, a young soldier, remained in intensive care
but his life was no longer in danger, the doctor said.
	   Orlov was ``the healthiest of the four men,'' the doctor added.
``We have nothing against his being removed from the hospital.''
	   Orlov was being questioned by security officials on Friday, the
doctor said.
	   A psychiatrist examined him at a hospital and issued a
preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said, citing the Federal Security Service, which carries out the
investigation.
	   Orlov worked for the magazine Russian Pravda, which carried
anti-Semitic and nationalist articles. The magazine's editor,
Alexander Aratov, said that Orlov ``hated President Boris Yeltsin
because Yeltsin's policy had driven him to despair.''
	   Yeltsin's office is inside the Kremlin walls, but the president
has been been in the Black Sea resort of Sochi for the past week
recovering from an illness.

Inter Milan's Simoni desperate for derby victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Luigi Simoni might finally be running out of second
chances.
	   The Internazionale of Milan coach, recipient of several
ultimatums during his rocky one-plus seasons at the helm,
desperately needs to halt a three-game losing streak in Serie A
action Sunday night when the club faces cross-city rival AC Milan.
	   Touted at the start of the season as a title contender, Inter
has struggled with inconsistent defense and injuries to star
strikers Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio. After consecutive losses to
Lazio of Rome, league leader Juventus of Turin and mediocre Bari,
Inter has a 3-1-3 record, good only for eighth place in the 18-team
standings.
	   One of the biggest criticisms aimed at Simoni is that he is too
defense-minded, yet only two clubs have allowed more goals than the
12 Inter has given up.
	   That could be a problem against Milan, which is enjoying a
rebound from back-to-back poor seasons. Milan is tied for third
place with a 4-1-2 record, led by the goalscoring of Germany's
Oliver Bierhoff (five goals) and Brazil's Leonardo (four), who had
been sidelined with injury but is expected to start Sunday.
	   The Milan-Inter showdown, before what is expected to be a
sellout crowd of about 85,000 at hallowed San Siro Stadium,
highlights an otherwise drab eighth round schedule. Juventus _
which leads the league with 16 points, one ahead of Fiorentina _
travels to Udinese, while Fiorentina hosts Venezia. Other games
have AS Roma at Bologna; AC Parma at Bari; Lazio of Rome hosting
Empoli; Piacenza at Calgiari; Vicenza at Perugia, and Sampdoria of
Genoa hosting Salernitana.
	   Simoni could use a breakthrough game from Ronaldo. The Brazilian
star is still working his way back from a long layoff with
tendinitis in both knees. He came off the bench last weekend and
nearly led Inter past Bari, but it was too little too late in the
3-2 defeat.
	   ``I am happy about what he has done so far,'' the coach said of
his star. ``He needs to improve little by little, and I am sure
that slowly he will come back as he was before.''
	   While Nicola Ventola (already a career-high five goals), Chile's
Ivan Zamorano and Andrea Pirlo have been scoring enough in
Ronaldo's absence, the backline has been rather dismal. Simoni has
even tried swtiching Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone back to
sweeper in order to shore up the defense.
	   Portugal's Paolo Sousa, who had returned from injury to provide
some stability at midfield, will miss Sunday's game through
suspension.
	   Milan's game revolves around Bierhoff, in the midst of another
solid season. After last year's breakthrough (league-best 27 goals
for small-time Udinese), the German has adapted well to playing
under the spotlight. His physical style could give Inter fits,
unless muscular Nigerian defender Taribo West is given a man-to-man
assignment.

Cohen ends Arab tour with no public support for strikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ended
his tour of Arab nations Friday with little sign of support for
military strikes on Iraq after it ended all links with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Cohen left for Turkey after talks with Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan that began later Thursday and ended in the early hours of
Friday.
	   Cohen did not speak with reporters but Hassan's comments
indicated that Jordan was not keen on a military strike.
	   It ``is imperative to find a way out of the current crisis and
to find the appropriate conditions to resume cooperation between
the United Nations and Iraq,'' Hassan said.
	   He then added: ``It is important to avert in the region another
confrontation and to settle the crisis diplomatically.''
	   Similar public statements have been made by officials in some of
the other countries Cohen visited _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
	   However, in a statement Thursday, Cohen's spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said the meetings were ``successful'' and that the secretary
``is confident that the United States will have the support it
needs to take appropriate action to uphold the United Nations
Security Council resolutions.''
	   Meanwhile, the government of Saddam Hussein remained defiant,
even after a resolution of condemnation by the Security Council
Thursday. Iraq demands a timetable for the lifting of U.N. economic
sanctions before cooperation can resume.
	   During a standoff between Iraq and the U.N. in February, Kuwait
was the only Arab state that opened its air bases to U.S. and
British warplanes.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   Iraq's worsening plights under the sanctions has earned it
widespread sympathy in the region. But the sanctions cannot be
lifted until the weapons inspectors certify Iraq is rid of all
weapons of mass destruction.

Bomb blast scene: fury and frantic searches for loved ones

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Blood and soot-blackened water ran in rivulets
from the charred wreckage. A burly policeman bent to cover a
bloodied corpse with whatever was at hand _ a sodden piece of
cardboard, a plastic shopping bag.
	   Two people were killed and at least 21 injured when an
explosives-rigged car blew up Friday at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda
market, only meters (yards) from the site of a suicide bombing 16
months ago.
	   At police barricades set up along Jerusalem's busiest
thoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, some
frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded market
only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   ``Please, please, is there a girl with red hair who is hurt?'' an
older, heavyset woman said tearfully, trying to push her way past
police. A young female soldier patted her arm consolingly.
	   Some of the onlookers gave vent to fury over the new peace
agreement, which was being debated by Israel's Cabinet even as the
blast occurred.
	   ``Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat!'' a small crowd of
demonstrators shouted. Police tried to grab one of them, but he
escaped into the crowd.
	   The explosives-rigged car was a mass of twisted metal, with only
the steering column left intact. Next to the wreckage lay a
completely charred body with stumps of arms and legs _ apparently
that of the bomber.
	   Witnesses said they heard a series of explosions rather than a
single powerful blast, suggesting the attack had somehow gone awry.
Although shop windows closest to the car were shattered, market
stalls only a few more feet away were completely intact, with heaps
of bananas and onions still neatly stacked.
	   Eyewitness Yaakov Shlomo said initial, smaller blasts scared most
onlookers away.
	   ``When the big explosion went, there were already not that many
people nearby,'' he said. ``That was a miracle from heaven.''
	   Shlomo Meir, a black-clad Orthodox Jew, was standing nearby when
he heard a blast and saw fire when he turned. ``It was terrible,''
he said, red-eyed. ``I thought, `Again!'''
	   Only a block away, some stalls were still open and some shoppers
were buying produce. One woman, with almost maniacal determination,
sorted through a pile of oranges.
	   ``We can't stop what we're doing when this happens,'' she said
grimly.
	   By the police barricades, wearing bright-orange vests, stood a
group of Orthodox Jewish volunteers who search the scene of
accidents and attacks for body parts, in keeping with their
religious belief that bodies must be buried intact.
	   One young volunteer squinted down the street as his group waited
to be let allowed to begin its grisly task. ``It's hard, this work,
but it's very important to us,'' he said.

Police seize major drug stash en route to Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUNKIRK, France (AP) _ Customs officers seized a huge stash of
drugs _ including 400,000 tablets of ecstasy _ in a truck en route
to Britain from Germany, police said Friday.
	   Police found the drugs on Oct. 28 in a British-licensed truck
during routine checks on a highway on the outskirts of this
northern port town.
	   Of the 400,000 ecstasy tablets, the vast majority were said to
be of a new brand 100 times stronger than usual, with effects
similar to LSD.
	   The truck also was carrying 201 kilograms (442 pounds) of
cannabis resin, 220 kilograms (484 pounds) of hashish and 92
kilograms (202 pounds) of amphetamine sulphate.
	   The driver, identified only as a 59-year-old Briton, was
arrested and is in custody in Dunkirk. He denied any knowledge of
the drugs.
	   Police said he had been previously arrested in southern France
in 1990 for drug trafficking.
	   It wasn't clear why police waited until Friday to announce the
seizure.

FIFA delegates say South Korea is free to build fewer stadiums

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ World soccer officials are behind a
South Korean proposal to reduce the initially planned 10 stadiums
in that nation for the 2002 World Cup to six or seven.
	   A prolonged economic crisis in South Korea has made building all
the proposed stadiums difficult. South Korea and Japan are co-hosts
of the 2002 World Cup soccer finals _ the first in Asia.
	   Peter Velappan, coordinator for FIFA, soccer's world governing
body, said Friday that even four stadiums would be sufficient for
the 32 matches in Korea.
	   ``If South Korea says, `We don't need 10 but we need only six,'
FIFA will accept that because we don't need so many stadiums in
order to organize the matches,'' said Velappan, who arrived here
Monday to inspect South Korean preparations.
	   The problem is that none of the cities want to give up stadium
plans.
	   Park Seh-jik, head of the Korean Organizing Committee,
reiterated that his country can still meet its original goal of
building 10 stadiums at a cost of dlrs 1 billion.
	   Thirty percent of the money would come from the central
government and 70 percent from the provincial governments where the
cities are located.
	   South Korea is lagging far behind in stadium construction, with
building just just beginning in five of the chosen 10 cities.
	   Most of the 10 World Cup stadiums in Japan, where the other 32
matches will be held, are either completed or under construction.
	   FIFA delegates, however, ruled out any possibility of relocating
some of the South Korean games to Japan.
	   ``It's very premature to even think about that. There is no
reason to believe that South Korea's commitment will not be met,''
said delegate Alan Rothenberg.
	   During their five-day visit ending Friday, the FIFA delegation,
led by Vice President Antonio Matarrese, visited stadium sites in
Seoul, Pusan and several other cities.
	   Matarrese said he was satisfied with South Korean preparations
but recommended that the country improve transportation and
accommodations.
	   Also Friday, President Kim Dae-jung and soccer officials held a
groundbreaking ceremony for the dlrs 170 million main stadium in
Seoul, where the opening and semifinal matches will be played.
	   FIFA plans to give final approval to host cites in South Korea
and Japan by May of next year after another delegation comes to
review progress in March.

Chinese finance minister to visit London for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng will
lead a delegation to London for talks Tuesday with his British
counterpart, a government official said Friday.
	   A spokesman in the Ministry of Finance's information department
said the talks follow through on a joint declaration the two sides
signed in early October, during a visit by Prime Minister Tony
Blair, calling for frequent dialogue on economic and financial
issues.
	   The talks Tuesday will be the first of these meetings. The
Chinese Finance Ministry spokesman did not provide additional
details.
	   Both sides are trying to remove barriers to stronger trade ties.
China wants more U.S. and European investment to offset slumping
capital inflows from Asia.
	   Britain and other industrial countries are pushing China to
lower import tariffs and other investment restrictions.
	   With distrust over Hong Kong in the past, Britain has become
China's No. 1 investor and second-largest trading partner among
European Union nations.
	   Trade between the two countries for the first seven months of
the year totaled dlrs 3.48 billion, an increase of more than 18
percent from the same period in 1997, according to Chinese
officials.

Reports: U.S. insurer may join Cathay Pacific in Philippine
</HEADLINE>
Airlines deal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways
is forming an international consortium to bid for a stake in
troubled Philippine Airlines, Hong Kong media reports said Friday.
	   Cathay Pacific would own 40 percent of the airline _ the maximum
allowed to foreigners under Philippine law _ while the the
Philippine subsidiary of the American Insurance Group and another
unnamed Philippine company would buy 10 percent between them, the
Hong Kong Standard reported.
	   An airline analyst's report mentioned the same potential
partners but gave different sizes for their contemplated stakes.
	   Singapore-based DBS Securities Ltd. estimated Friday that Cathay
would pay about 1 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 128 million)
for up to 30 percent of PAL, with AIG and the third partner taking
a combined 20 percent.
	   Neither Cathay Pacific nor AIG would comment.
	   ``We might not see a deal until December,'' said DBS airline
analyst Peter Milliken, noting that AIG has been investing heavily
in infrastructure in Asia and that PAL would fit into that
strategy.
	   Peter Sutch, chairman of Cathay Pacific had said Thursday it
would be ``quite a long time'' before any purchase can be
concluded, citing conflict over ownership and management of PAL.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to make payments on
U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion in debt, and suffered a pilots' strike in
June.
	   The carrier stopped flying on Sept. 23 but resumed operations
last month.
	   The closure came after a union representing ground personnel
turned down a management-proposed recovery plan that included a
10-year suspension of its collective bargaining agreement in
exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Two weeks after the shutdown, workers agreed to the plan.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada has repeatedly said Cathay's
interest is a sign of foreign confidence in the nation's economy,
which has been badly affected by Asia's financial crisis.

Thai beauty queen slams Rotary Club over sexual crudeness
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DON PATHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai beauty queen has publicly
denounced a local Rotary Club where she was invited to give a
speech and instead was taunted by members telling her to strip.
	   Tan-Tanya Suesuntisook, Miss Thailand World in 1997, took an
unusual step in a society where conflicts are often disarmed by a
tolerant smile. She sent a letter of protest to the
English-language newspaper, The Nation.
	   Tan-Tanya said that she was pleased to have been invited to
speak for a for the charity drive but was ``shocked and dismayed at
the rude, crude and grossly crass treatment with which I was
confronted.''
	   ``One of your most repugnant members yelled out for me to
`undress' as well as other surly remarks,'' she wrote.
	   A business associate said on condition of anonymity that the
incident took place about a month ago and that Tan-Tanya, who grew
up in the United States, had been outraged.
	   She was on a meditation retreat in the northern city of Chiang
Mai on Friday and not immediately available for comment.
	   Officials of the Rotary South Club, which has a large number of
foreign businessmen as members, held a regular meeting Friday but
said the matter was not discussed.
	   A club spokesman said on condition of anonymity that a letter of
apology had been sent but would not elaborate.
	   Tan-Tanya's letter said the incident was ``devastatingly
degrading'' and it was unthinkable a group composed of community
leaders professing good works should treat an invited female guest
in such a manner.
	   ``There is growing anger and intolerance for the ugly farang
syndrome,'' Tan-Tanya said, using the Thai word for white
foreigners.
	   Rotary clubs worldwide are composed of business and community
leaders who promote service and international understanding. The
organization is involved in a drive to eradicate polio.

Local daily upbraids Thai minister for supporting Anwar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Thai minister's support of
dissident Anwar Ibrahim could destabilize a regional economic group
in Southeast Asia, a Thai newspaper said in an editorial Friday.
	   Utusan Malaysia, the leading Malay-language newspaper, scolded
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan for flogging his own political
agenda by criticizing Malaysia's treatment of the ousted deputy
prime minister.
	   Anwar was put on trial this week on charges of abuse of power
and illicit sex. Critics say he is being victimized after losing a
power struggle with his one-time mentor, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Surin was quoted as saying in Wednesday editions of The Nation,
a Thai daily, that Malaysia's action was hindering unity in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and ``could decrease the
group's bargaining power in international negotiations.''
	   Utusan accused Surin of attempting to ruin unity in ASEAN, which
has a longstanding policy of noninterference in member nations'
internal affairs .
	   ``Surin is interfering with Malaysia's internal affairs because
he is harboring his own selfish interests and political agenda,''
the Utusan editorial said.
	   Malaysia and Thailand belong to the economic grouping along with
Indonesia and the Philippines, whose leaders have also expressed
open support for Anwar.
	   On Friday, the pro-government Utusan told the Thai minister not
to point fingers at neighboring Malaysia.
	   ``Thailand doesn't even have stability because its governments
are often toppled by political foes that dish out criticisms
indiscriminately through the mass media,'' the editorial said.
	   On Thursday, a Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Surin
felt he was misquoted and that the trial by itself could not affect
ASEAN unity.
	   Anwar's trial, which began Monday, attracted international
attention after he showed up at his arraignment Sept. 29 with a
black eye and bruises. He said police beat him after his arrest.

Shellfish banned in southern France after discovery of toxic algae
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Police near this southern French port
have banned the sale of shellfish possibly contaminated by a rare
toxic algae, dealing a blow to oyster and mussel producers before
their busiest season.
	   Traces of the algae, which is fatal if ingested, were discovered
Thursday evening in shellfish as well as in the Thau lagoon,
according to the French Ocean Research Institute (IFREMER).
	   Scientists conducted tests for the algae after shellfish were
banned for the first time in early October, when abnormalities were
first discovered in the lagoon.
	   Specialists, who are conducting further tests, said they don't
yet know the origin of the algae or if it will disappear naturally.
	   Shellfish, including oysters and mussels, are traditional French
fare for the Christmas and New Year's holidays.

Cook issues fresh warning to Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Thursday
issued a fresh warning that Iraq faced the ``severest
consequences'' if Saddam Hussein did not back down in the latest
standoff over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Although a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Saddam
did not specifically authorize military force, Cook said legal
authority exists for air strikes if inspectors are not allowed to
resume their work.
	   ``We are quite confident that if it comes to that, there is
adequate legal basis for us to proceed,'' Cook said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview. ``All options are open.''
	   Iraq's decision Saturday to end all cooperation with disarmament
monitors has been condemned by the U.N. Security Council as a
``flagrant violation'' of the country's agreements with the world
body. On Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen lobbied
Gulf states for support of possible military action.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking to a group of students
Thursday, also spoke of the government's readiness to use military
force if necessary.
	   ``The reason that we are supporting the U.S. and the U.S. is
supporting us is because we believe in what we are doing in
relation to Iraq,'' Blair said. ``The international community must
be prepared to act, if necessary by military force, to stop him.''
	   Cook said that while the current emphasis is on a diplomatic
solution to the crisis, U.S.-led forces assembled in the region in
February remain ready to strike.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, more than 20 warships
including the carrier USS Eisenhower, and about 170 warplanes and
helicopters in the Gulf region, according to the Pentagon.
	   ``What they (Iraq) are reneging on is not an agreement just with
U.K. or U.S., it is defiance of the whole of the Security
Council,'' Cook said.
	   ``(Saddam) is not going to get away with it,'' Cook said. ``He
cannot win.''

Philippine defense chief warns against Chinese encroachments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines is protesting recent
actions by China in a disputed reef because they could lead to
further Chinese encroachments on Philippine territory, Defense
Secretary Orlando Mercado said Friday.
	   On Thursday, the Department of Foreign Affairs summoned the
Chinese ambassador to protest the presence of Chinese ships off
Mischief Reef, which is claimed by both countries.
	   The Chinese started renovating platforms on the reef last week
in violation of a ``code of conduct'' which requires both sides to
refrain from provocative actions, Mercado said.
	   Foreign Undersecretary Leonides Caday conveyed to Ambassador
Guan Dengming Manila's demand that the ``activities being
undertaken by the Chinese personnel on the illegal structures ...
be immediately halted and terminated,'' the foreign office said.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada said his administration is
determined to resolve the issue through diplomatic means, and that
he hopes it will not fan tensions with China.
	   The reef is part of the Spratlys, a chain of islands and atolls
claimed in part or in whole by China, the Philippines, Brunei,
Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.
	   ``What we see as the emerging strategy of China is `talk and
take,' '' Mercado said in a radio interview.
	   ``There is a code of conduct, the Chinese president even came
here ... but they are doing something else. That is what is
worrisome.''
	   Mercado said the Chinese ships were first spotted by air force
planes Oct. 28.
	   He showed photographs of the Chinese ships off the reef, about
215 miles (345 kilometers) from the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   ``If they are allowed to stay there, what will follow next? If
we measure the 200-mile exclusive economic zone from Mischief Reef,
even Metro Manila would be included in the EEZ of China,'' he
added. ``If we do not protest, they would later be in Palawan.''
	   The Chinese Embassy said in a statement that it is China's
sovereign right to reinforce the structures because they had been
damaged by natural forces and were endangering the lives of Chinese
staff based on the reef.
	   It said the reinforcements were being made to the original
facility ``and it serves completely the purpose of peaceful use.''
	   Mercado, however, said that under the agreement, the Chinese
should have just abandoned the structures.
	   The Philippines protested in 1995 when China built concrete
platforms on Mischief Reef, one of several areas in the Spratlys
claimed by both Manila and Beijing.
	   China said the platforms were shelters for fishermen but the
Manila government said they could be used militarily.
	   China's behavior caused suspicion among countries in the region
that it might be trying to gradually seize the Spratlys, which are
believed to lie atop vast deposits of oil, minerals and natural
gas.
	   Mercado said that since the Spratlys straddle vital sea lanes
and trade routes, any dispute would affect world trade.
	   ``Let us abide by the code of conduct, let us not change it,''
he said. ``Let the sleeping dogs lie, do not disturb them ... if we
want peace.''

Taiwan welcomes rare visit by U.S. cabinet official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Savoring a rare chance to host a U.S.
cabinet member, Taiwan on Friday welcomed an upcoming visit from
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that has already drawn strong
condemnations from China.
	   ``Richardson's visit illustrates the United States' concern for
substantive relations with us, including trade,'' said Shen
Lyu-shun, the ministry's director of North American affairs.
	   Greater attention from Washington is warranted, Shen said,
because despite Taiwan's small size it buys more than twice as many
U.S. exports annually as China.
	   Richardson will arrive Monday, then on Tuesday address a joint
U.S.-Taiwan business conference in Taipei on ``economic and
commercial issues of mutual interest,'' the U.S. Energy Department
said.
	   Richardson also was expected to meet with Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui, U.S. officials said.
	   Richardson's arrival will be just the third by U.S. cabinet
member since the United States revised its policy in 1994 to allow
such visits.
	   The visit is an attempt by Washington to reassure Taiwan
following President Bill Clinton's trip to China this past summer,
Taiwan's China Times said.
	   In Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry restated its opposition to
any type of official contact between the United States and Taiwan.
	   Such visits violate agreements between China and the United
States, the ministry said in a statement that warned of possible
damage to the ``hard-won development in China-U.S. ties.''
	   A similar visit by then-U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico
Pena in 1994 prompted China to bar Pena from a planned visit to
Beijing.
	   Since 1949, China has considered Taiwan a rebel province without
the right to international relations.
	   The United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, receives 23
percent of the island's exports and accounts for 20 percent of its
imports.
	   Despite that trade relationship, Taiwan and the United States
have not had diplomatic relations since 1979.

Taiwan to crack down on speculators profiting from business woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Wrapping up a week that saw Taiwanese
stocks fall 5 percent, officials vowed Friday to catch and jail
speculators alleged to have capitalized on the economic slump by
spreading rumors that hurt share prices.
	   Lin Tsong-yung, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
said authorities will investigate traders believed to have helped
the speculators by filling the market with damaging rumors.
	   Chen Yao-hao, head of the Tuntex textile and chemicals group,
said Friday a ``black hand'' had emerged in the stock market.
	   ``They spread rumors everyday about companies bouncing checks,''
Chen told a news conference. ``We must address this issue or it
could lead to economic turmoil.''
	   Tuntex's shares tumbled Wednesday and Thursday on rumors that
the group had bounced checks, but Chen insisted his company remains
financially sound.
	   Tuntex plans to halt some overseas investment plans, while
suspending further real estate buys, but only because of Asia's
economic troubles.
	   The China Times Express reported that a group of speculators,
claiming themselves as ``Taiwan's Soros,'' a reference to American
financier George Soros, has raised a fund of at least 100 billion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 3 billion) to sell shares on the market
in hopes that prices would fall.
	   Hit by Asia's financial crisis, Taiwan's economy has slowed and
domestic consumption fallen. Several business groups faced
financial difficulties as they struggled to pay off debts that they
ran up when times were better.
	   Another conglomerate, Chunghsin Textiles, saw its share price
plunge and ended up Thursday denying rumors that it had bounced
checks.
	   Blue chips on the Taiwan Stock Exchange fell slightly on Friday
to close at 6,889.65 points, shedding a total of 5.2 percent for
the week.

UEFA to decide on Fiorentina-Grasshoppers match Sunday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's control and disciplinary body
will decide Sunday what action to take over the incident that
caused the suspension of a match between Fiorentina and
Grasshoppers of Switzerland, the European body said Wednesday.
	   UEFA representatives asked the referee not to start the second
half of Tuesday's second-round second leg UEFA Cup match after an
off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device hurled
from the stands.
	   The game was being played in Salerno, near Naples, following the
suspension of Fiorentina's own ground and to raise funds for the
victims of recent floodings in southern Italy.
	   Fiorentina was paying the second and last round of suspension of
its Franchi stadium as a result of its fans misbehavior during a
Cup Winners Cup game against Barcelona in 1997.
	   Although playing away from home Fiorentina still was considered
responsible for the fans' behavior in Salerno.
	   The Italian club could face a ban from European competition of
one or more seasons and a 3-0 forfeit defeat.
	   The incident occurred as players and officials were walking to
the dressing rooms at the end of the first half.
	   Fiorentina, which had won the first leg 2-0, was a favorite to
qualify. The Italian club was leading 2-1 in the second leg when
the game was suspended.

Asian stock markets close generally mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Asian stock markets ended the week generally
mixed Friday, with prices falling in Tokyo and Hong Kong but
surging in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average declined 219.40
points, or 1.53 percent, to close at 14,121.97. It had shed 186.44
points, or 1.28 percent, on Thursday.
	   Share prices declined for a second day as investors cashed in on
a rally earlier in the week. Before retreating on Thursday, the
Nikkei had soared 963.30 points, or 7.1 percent, over the course of
the previous two days.
	   The profit-taking was prompted by growing worries that a
government economic stimulus package due out later this month will
be insufficient to put Japan back on track for recovery, traders
said.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.00 yen in late
afternoon trading, up 0.36 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also
above its late New York level of 117.67 yen.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong also closed lower for a second
straight session on profit-taking Friday.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 82.23 points, or 0.8 percent,
closing at 10,139.75. On Thursday, the index had slumped 286.27
points.
	   Brokers said investors continued to take profits following the
index's sharp gains in the past week.
	   Thai stock prices soared, with the key index rising 4 percent
after Thai Farmers Bank announced it will lower its prime rate 150
basis points to 12 percent.
	   Prime rates at other banks range up to 15 percent, but several
banks in Thailand announced rate cuts on Friday.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index gained 14.52 points to
376.60.
	   Malaysian share prices also soared on buying by local investors.
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's key Composite Index, which tracks
prices of 100 key stocks, closed at 453.29 points, up 14.63 points,
or 3.3 percent.
	   Philippine stocks closed sharply higher on follow-through buying
set off by Wall Street's overnight gains, despite a 1.2 percent
drop in the value of the peso against the dollar, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 35.77 points,
or 2 percent, to 1,797.37, extending Thursday's 47.51-point gain.
	   The peso weakened as some banks took profits on previous dollar
purchases and others bought pesos to cover their weekly reserve
requirements, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 40.047 pesos for the day, up 1.2 percent
from Thursday's average of 39.585 pesos.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower. The market's key Weighted
Stock Price Index fell 67.62 points, or 1 percent, to 6,889.65.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower on
profit-taking. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 6.27
points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,023.46.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, with the banking
sector bouncing back from a tough few days and resource stocks
showing strength. The All Ordinaries Index rose 24.9 points, or 0.9
percent, to 2,697.3.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite stock
Price Index fell 1.90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 416.30.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower. The Straits Times
Index fell 15.76 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,283.76.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed slightly lower on profit-taking.
The Composite Index fell 1.550 points, or 0.4 percent, to 353.978.

Tens of thousands of immigrants apply for work permits,
</HEADLINE>
overwhelming authorities &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Desperate to obtain one of the 38,000 work permits
Italy will issue in the next five weeks, tens of thousands of
illegal immigrants are lining up outside police stations day and
night, overwhelming authorities trying to grapple with the
paperwork.
	   Italian dailies reported Friday that many police stations had
run out of application forms and that immigrants were confused and
angry. Fights also regularly break out among immigrants trying to
reach the front of the line.
	   Italy began issuing the permits Wednesday under a limited
amnesty decree. To qualify, immigrants need to prove they entered
the country prior to March 27 and that they have a job and place to
stay.
	   Most of those applying for permits entered the country illegally
and work in the underground economy. Lacking proper documents, they
are using everything from parking tickets to old grocery bills to
try to demonstrate when they arrived and where they work.
	   Illegals have until Dec. 15 to apply for the permits, which
would allow them to live and work in Italy for two years.
	   Italy plans to accept at least 3,000 Albanians and 1,500
Moroccans and Tunisians.
	   This is the first time Italy has set quotas for immigrants. It
previously granted permits on a case-by-case basis to those who
could prove they were victims of persecution at home or had a job
awaiting them in Italy.
	   Many businesses, especially in the agricultural sector,
currently rely on illegal immigrants for seasonal jobs such as
tomato picking. The legalization of 38,000 immigrants is in part
intended so that employers have the workers they need for jobs
Italians won't take, despite the country's 12.5 percent
unemployment rate.
	   Thousands of would-be immigrants have reached Italy's long
coastline on boats in the past year, fleeing violence in the
Balkans or abandoning northern Africa in search of a better life.

England and France to play friendly in February
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ World Champion France will play England in a soccer
friendly early next year at London's Wembley Stadium, the French
Football Federation said Friday.
	   The match, the first between the two nations since England beat
France 1-0 in June 1997, is scheduled for Feb. 10, FFF spokesman
Jean-Yves Le Huede said.
	   France is also arranging a match against Morocco in Marseille on
Jan. 20.
	   Both matches will serve as preparation for France's March 27
European Championship qualifier against Ukraine.
	   France's calendar has been eased since pulling out of the Jan.
8-20 Confederations Cup in Mexico. France withdrew after several
European clubs complained about losing their French stars.

Cohen ends Arab tour with no public support for strikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ended
his tour of Arab nations Friday with little sign of support for
military strikes on Iraq after it ended all links with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Cohen left for Turkey after talks with Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan that began later Thursday and ended in the early hours of
Friday.
	   Cohen did not speak with reporters but Hassan's comments
indicated that Jordan was not keen on a military strike.
	   It ``is imperative to find a way out of the current crisis and
to find the appropriate conditions to resume cooperation between
the United Nations and Iraq,'' Hassan said.
	   He then added: ``It is important to avert in the region another
confrontation and to settle the crisis diplomatically.''
	   Similar public statements have been made by officials in some of
the other countries Cohen visited _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
	   However, in a statement Thursday, Cohen's spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said the meetings were ``successful'' and that the secretary
``is confident that the United States will have the support it
needs to take appropriate action to uphold the United Nations
Security Council resolutions.''
	   Meanwhile, the government of Saddam Hussein remained defiant,
even after a resolution of condemnation by the Security Council
Thursday. Iraq demands a timetable for the lifting of U.N. economic
sanctions before cooperation can resume.
	   During a standoff between Iraq and the U.N. in February, Kuwait
was the only Arab state that opened its air bases to U.S. and
British warplanes.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   Iraq's worsening plights under the sanctions has earned it
widespread sympathy in the region. But the sanctions cannot be
lifted until the weapons inspectors certify Iraq is rid of all
weapons of mass destruction.

Eiffel Tower open again after strike ends
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Eiffel Tower, closed to a disappointed public
for a week due to a strike, reopened Friday after management agreed
to workers' demands to hire more staff.
	   Some 200 workers at the Eiffel Tower had been demanding more
personnel, rejecting as insufficient the recent hiring of 20
people, with plans to recruit five more workers next year.
	   Management on Thursday evening accepted workers' demands to
accelerate the hiring of seven new employees, the press office
said.
	   The strike, which began last Friday, cost the Eiffel Tower an
estimated 300,000 francs (dlrs 55,000) per day.
	   November is a slack period for tourists. Some 310,000 people
visited the Eiffel Tower in November 1997, compared to 850,000
visitors in August.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet announced within hours of a
market bombing Friday that it will put off a vote indefinitely on
whether to ratify the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack
down further on terrorism.
	   Israel radio said the 18-member Cabinet debate on the Wye River
accord would resume only after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority fulfilled all of its commitments under the agreement,
including arresting Islamic militants.
	   The Cabinet also insisted that Arafat convene the Palestinian
National Council, a parliament in exile, to abrogate the
Palestinian National Charter, which calls for Israel's destruction.
	   The Israeli Cabinet had convened for a second day in an attempt
to approve the Wye agreement.
	   ``To our sorrow, since the Wye agreement ... there has been
relentless terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens,'' according
to a Cabinet statement read on the radio.
	   Israel radio quoted officials saying the Cabinet would also

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet suspending ratification of peace
agreement. At least 21 wounded. Hamas claims reponsibility.
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car rigged with explosives blew up Friday
morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed with Israelis
shopping for the Jewish Sabbath, killing two people and wounding
21.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has tried to stop the
peace agreement, claimed responsibility, police said.
	   In response to the attack, the Israeli cabinet suspended
ratification of the Wye agreement until there ``is verification
that the Palestinian authority is indeed fighting terrorism.''
	   The Israeli Cabinet also announced it will begin to build houses
in the controversial Jewish settlement of Har Homa in east
Jerusalem.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had held up the work in recent
months in an apparent attempt to not disrupt negotiations with the
Palestinians.
	   Aides to Netanyahu were not immediately available for comment.
	   The Cabinet ministers had just begun a second day of of talks on
the peace agreement about a mile (kilometer) away from the entrance
to the market and just meters (yards) from the site of a suicide
bombing last year.
	   In Friday's explosion, the rigged car, a red Fiat, blew up at
about 9:45 a.m. (0745 GMT) at the entrance of Mahane Yehuda market,
just meters (yards) away from the site of a suicide bombing in July
1997.
	   Witnesses heard a series of small explosions.
	   Yair Cohen, 43, said he was buying cookies when he saw a car
driving slowly, with smoke coming out of the hood and exhaust
pipes. ``People started to shout `car on fire.' After a while, we
heard a blast, and something hit me in the stomach,'' said Cohen
who was treated for minor injuries at Hadassah Hospital.
	   The car was a mass of twisted metal sitting in the middle of the
main intersection outside the market. Flames shot 100 feet (30
meters) in the air. A charred corpse, covered by a blanket, lay
several meters away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.
	   Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool
of blood below the head. Rescue workers covered the body with
sodden pieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags.
	   ``There was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an
Israeli border policeman who was patrolling the market and was
lightly injured.
	   One heavy-set woman, apparently in shock, climbed into an
ambulance, weeping. Three paramedics talked to her, persuading her
that she did not need medical treatment, and after a few moments
she climbed out of the vehicle again.
	   Soldiers and police wearing plastic gloves held back the crowds.
``It's dangerous _ stay back!'' they shouted.
	   Just a block away from the blast, shoppers went about their
business. One young woman shopper said: ``We can't stop with what
we are doing when this happens.''
	   Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian peace negotiator, said the
Palestinian Authority condemned the attack. ``This is a crime and
whoever commits this, hurts the interests of the Palestinian
people.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Blood and soot-blackened water ran in rivulets
from the charred wreckage. A burly policeman bent to cover a
bloodied corpse with whatever was at hand _ a sodden piece of
cardboard, a plastic shopping bag.
	   Two people were killed and at least 21 injured when an
explosives-rigged car blew up Friday at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda
market, only meters (yards) from the site of a suicide bombing 16
months ago.
	   At police barricades set up along Jerusalem's busiest
thoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, some
frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded
market only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   ``Please, please, is there a girl with red hair who is hurt?''
an older, heavyset woman said tearfully, trying to push her way
past police. A young female soldier patted her arm consolingly.
	   Some of the onlookers gave vent to fury over the new peace
agreement, which was being debated by Israel's Cabinet even as the
blast occurred.
	   ``Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat!'' a small crowd of
demonstrators shouted. Police tried to grab one of them, but he
escaped into the crowd.
	   The explosives-rigged car was a mass of twisted metal, with only
the steering column intact. Next to the wreckage lay a completely
charred body with stumps of arms and legs _ apparently that of the
bomber.
	   Witnesses said they heard a series of explosions. Although shop
windows closest to the car were shattered, market stalls only a few
more feet (yards) away were completely intact, and stacked with
neat piles of bananas and onions.
	   Eyewitness Yaakov Shlomo said initial, smaller blasts scared
most onlookers away.
	   ``When the big explosion went, there were already not that many
people nearby,'' he said. ``That was a miracle from heaven.''
	   Shlomo Meir, a black-clad Orthodox Jew, was standing nearby when
he heard a blast. When he tuirned he saw fire. ``It was terrible,''
he said, red-eyed. ``I thought, `Again!'''
	   Only a block away, some stalls were still open and shoppers were
buying produce. One woman, with almost maniacal determination,
sorted through a pile of oranges.
	   ``We can't stop what we're doing when this happens,'' she said
grimly.
	   By the police barricades, wearing bright-orange vests, stood a
group of Orthodox Jewish volunteers who search scenes of accidents
and attacks for body parts, in keeping with their religious belief
that bodies must be buried intact.
	   One young volunteer squinted down the street as his group waited
for permission to begin its grisly task. ``It's hard, this work,
but it's very important to us,'' he said.

Israeli Cabinet postpones Wye ratification indefinitely

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet saying it has decided to suspend vote
indefinitely &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet decided Friday to suspend
indefinitely its ratification of the land-for-security agreement
with the Palestinians.
	   The decision came less than three hours after a car rigged with
explosives blew up in an outdoor market in downtown Jersualem. Two
people were killed and 21 others were wounded in the attack for
which the Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility.
	   The Cabinet said it would not resume its debate or hold a vote
on the accord until the Palestinian Authority has taken steps
against terrorism. The Cabinet also said it would not resume the
ratification process until Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has
clarified the procedure for revoking clauses in the PLO founding
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The procedure is part of the Wye River agreement negotiated last
month. However, Israelis and Palestinians have widely divergent
interpretations of how the clauses should be rescinded.
	   Israel says it should be done by a vote by the Palestine
National Council. The Palestinians say a vote is not required.

World Bank president to visit Russia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ World Bank President James Wolfensohn will make a
brief visit to Moscow next Thursday to examine the country's
response to its economic crisis, a news report said Friday.
	   Wolfensohn is to meet Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and top
economic policymakers during a stopover from Tokyo, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank this summer
lined up a loan package worth more than dlrs 22 billion for Russia
this year and next. But the installments have been frozen since the
country's economic crisis hit in August.

Tajik govt. forces track down rebel warlord

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rebels using hostages as human shield, other
details of fighting in new grafs 4-5, 14-17. &QL; 
 &UR; By UMED BABAKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajik government and former
opposition groups joined forces Friday to combat a maverick warlord
who has threatened to blow up a dam and flood huge territories in
Central Asia.
	   Government troops and their new allies have retaken control of
the northern city of Khodzhand, but were still facing some pockets
of residence in mountainous northern Tajikistan, officials said.
	   The rebel leader, former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, has
demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political
prisoners and bring his supporters to the government. Rakhmonov
firmly ruled out any talks with the rebels, saying the government
will destroy or capture them all.
	   The government has already captured about 100 prisoners, the
president said on Tajik television.
	   According to the government's estimates, more than 100 people
have died in the fighting that has raged since Wednesday, when the
rebels raided Khdozhand, the city 200 kilometers (125 miles) north
of the capital, Dushanbe.
	   The government started gaining the upper hand Thursday, but
Khudoberdyev said his guerrillas had mined the dam on the
Kairakkhum channel as a ``deterrence measure.''
	   ``It will flood vast territories of Central Asia,'' Khudoberdyev
warned in a statement received by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The dam he threatened to destroy holds a reservoir so large it
is referred to locally as a ``sea.'' Rakhmonov dismissed the
threat, saying that the government forces were protecting the dam.
	   The fighting this week has been one of the most serious
outbursts of violence since a peace accord was signed last year,
ending five years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central
Asian nation.
	   During the war, the secular government battled a mostly Muslim
opposition. But the main opposition groups are now participating in
the government and the armed forces, and were taking part this week
in the operation against the renegade ex-colonel.
	   Speaking on national television Friday, the country's
Constitution Day, Rakhmonov said the old opposition had agreed to
help the government crush the new rebellion.
	   ``No one will be able to thwart the peace process,'' Rakhmonov
said in a television address.
	   He said that the government again held Khodzhand and its
airport, allowing reinforcements to be brought to the region
quickly. However, some rebels continued their resistance in an
ancient fortress in the city, Rakhmonov said.
	   Tajik Defense Minister Sherali Khairuloyev said Friday that the
rebels had driven some 90 civilian hostages to the fortress and
threatened to shoot them in case of a government attack, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The rebels did blow up a bridge on a strategic highway linking
Dushanbe with northern regions to prevent the government from
sending in more troops by land, Rakhmonov said.

More than 100 settlements flooded in western Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Heavy rains in western Ukraine have now
flooded more than 100 towns and villages, officials said Friday.
	   A total of 107 small towns villages and two cities were flooded
in the Zakarpattia region, while 11 settlements in the Lviv region
were hit, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   Floods and landslides have damaged roads, railways and
electricity lines in the region, and several villages in remote
areas have become unreachable by road, the ministry said.
	   About 3,000 people have been evacuated from the settlements as
of Thursday, but no casualties were reported.
	   President Leonid Kuchma was expected to visit Zakarpattia on
Friday, where more than 2,500 people supervised by Emergency
Situations Minister Valeriy Kalchenko were working to repair the
damages.
	   State emergency officials have been told to calculate losses
incurred by the floods so that the Cabinet can allocate money from
its reserve fund. The government has already allocated 1.2 million
hryvna (dlrs 350,000) for repair works.

England midfielder fined for hand gesture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Ince was fined 1,500 pounds (dlrs 2,500) by
the Football Association on Friday for making an obscene gesture
after being sent during England's Euro 2000 qualifier against
Sweden.
	   The Liverpool midfielder, who made the gesture as he walked off
the pitch in Stockholm on Sept. 5, was found guilty of misconduct
by an FA disciplinary commission.
	   The FA said Ince apologized for his action.
	   ``Both the player and Liverpool FC pointed out he had already
been punished with a suspension by UEFA arising from the
dismissal,'' the statement said.
	   Ince was sent off after receiving a second yellow card in
England's 2-1 defeat in Stockholm. He later claimed his gesture was
made towards England's assistant coach John Gorman, but coach Glenn
Hoddle later insisted that was not the case.
	   Ince received another red card Tuesday night during Liverpool's
UEFA Cup match in Spain against Valencia, and now faces a minimum
three-match European ban.

French stunt climber scales Tokyo skyscraper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ French daredevil Alain Robert was arrested in Japan
Friday on trespassing charges after he climbed a 54-story Tokyo
skyscraper.
	   Police said they waited for Robert on the rooftop of the
232-meter (766-foot) Shinjuku Center Building in downtown Tokyo
after a witness called police.
	   Robert, 39, dubbed ``Spiderman'' for his worldwide
stunt-climbing, reached the roof in about 30 minutes, said the
police official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The climber from Valence, France makes his living scaling tall
buildings as publicity stunts. He uses only his bare hands. He has
climbed more than 30 skyscrapers, including the Empire State
Building.

Japan's Mitsubishi Motors announces major restructuring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TOK101
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced a global
restructuring drive Friday that will include major job cuts in the
United States and Thailand, factory closures in Japan and a steep
reduction in production.
	   Mitsubishi, one of Japan's biggest automakers, will lay off
1,000 workers at subsidiaries in Illinois and California, which now
employ 5,100 workers, as well as 1,200 of its 4,000 employees in
Thailand, said company president Katsuhiko Kawasoe.
	   The company will also reduce the number of its car models by 40
percent and close two plants in Japan, Kawasoe told reporters.
	   Mitsubishi said it hopes to cut costs by 350 billion yen (dlrs 3
billion) by 2001 and return to profitability after suffering huge
losses from Japan's recession and the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``The economic situation is very severe, but we have to do our
utmost to return to profitability as soon as possible,'' Kawasoe
said.
	   Mitsubishi reported heavy losses Friday for the first half of
the current fiscal year ended Sept. 30, posting a net loss of 28.64
billion yen (dlrs 243 million). It posted a profit of 8.60 billion
yen (dlrs 73 million) for the same period last year.
	   Mitsubishi said it had been hit hardest in Japan by a sharp fall
in consumer demand for cars and stiffer competition among
automakers. It said that the economic turmoil in Asia also sharply
cut into the profitability of its overseas operations.
	   Mitsubishi announced that it would cut 700 jobs at its
Mitsubishi Motors Mfg. of America plant in Illinois, which makes
the Galant, Eclipse and Eclipse Spider convertible models. The
subsidiary now employs about 3,900 workers.
	   Three hundred jobs, or 25 percent of the employees at Mitsubishi
Motors Sales of America in California, will also be cut.
	   Mitsubishi said it aims to return to profitability on a group
level by the fiscal year ending March 2001, in which it hopes to
post a group profit of 20 billion yen (dlrs 170 million) on sales
of 4 trillion yen (dlrs 34.90 billion).
	   In fiscal 1997, ending in March this year, Mitsubishi posted a
group loss of 101.9 billion yen (dlrs 864 million).

Cohen ends Arab tour with no public support for strikes on Iraq

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen ended
his tour of Arab nations Friday with little sign of support for
military strikes on Iraq after it ended all links with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Cohen left for Turkey after talks with Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan that began later Thursday and ended in the early hours of
Friday.
	   Cohen did not speak with reporters, but Hassan's comments
indicated Jordan was not keen on a military strike.
	   It ``is imperative to find a way out of the current crisis and
to find the appropriate conditions to resume cooperation between
the United Nations and Iraq,'' Hassan said.
	   However, ``It is important to avert in the region another
confrontation and to settle the crisis diplomatically,'' he said.
	   Similar public statements have been made by officials in some of
the other countries Cohen visited _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
	   In a statement Thursday, Cohen's spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
the meetings were ``successful'' and that the secretary ``is
confident that the United States will have the support it needs to
take appropriate action to uphold the United Nations Security
Council resolutions.''
	   Meanwhile, the government of Saddam Hussein remained defiant,
even after a resolution of condemnation Thursday by the Security
Council. Iraq demands a timetable for the lifting of U.N. economic
sanctions before cooperation can resume.
	   During a standoff between Iraq and the United Nations in
February, Kuwait was the only Arab state that opened its air bases
to U.S. and British warplanes.
	   The United States has some 24,000 troops, an aircraft carrier
and some 170 warplanes and helicopters in the Gulf region,
according to the Pentagon.
	   Iraq's worsening plights under the sanctions has earned it
widespread sympathy in the region. But the sanctions cannot be
lifted until the weapons inspectors certify Iraq is rid of all
weapons of mass destruction.

Japan's Mitsubishi Motors announces major restructuring

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced a global
restructuring drive Friday that will include major job cuts in the
United States and Thailand, factory closures in Japan and a steep
reduction in production.
	   Mitsubishi, one of Japan's biggest automakers, will lay off
1,000 workers at subsidiaries in Illinois and California, which now
employ 5,100 workers, as well as 1,200 of its 4,000 employees in
Thailand, said company president Katsuhiko Kawasoe.
	   The company will also reduce the number of its car models by 40
percent and close two plants in Japan, Kawasoe told reporters.
	   Mitsubishi said it hopes to cut costs by 350 billion yen (dlrs 3
billion) by 2001 and return to profitability after suffering huge
losses from Japan's recession and the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``The economic situation is very severe, but we have to do our
utmost to return to profitability as soon as possible,'' Kawasoe
said.
	   Mitsubishi reported heavy losses Friday for the first half of
the current fiscal year ended Sept. 30, posting a net loss of 28.64
billion yen (dlrs 243 million). It posted a profit of 8.60 billion
yen (dlrs 73 million) for the same period last year.
	   Mitsubishi said it had been hit hardest in Japan by a sharp fall
in consumer demand for cars and stiffer competition among
automakers. It said that the economic turmoil in Asia also sharply
cut into the profitability of its overseas operations.
	   Mitsubishi announced that it would cut 700 jobs at its
Mitsubishi Motors Mfg. of America plant in Illinois, which makes
the Galant, Eclipse and Eclipse Spider convertible models. The
subsidiary now employs about 3,900 workers.
	   Three hundred jobs, or 25 percent of the employees at Mitsubishi
Motors Sales of America in California, will also be cut.
	   Mitsubishi said it aims to return to profitability on a group
level by the fiscal year ending March 2001, in which it hopes to
post a group profit of 20 billion yen (dlrs 170 million) on sales
of 4 trillion yen (dlrs 34.90 billion).
	   In fiscal 1997, ending in March this year, Mitsubishi posted a
group loss of 101.9 billion yen (dlrs 864 million).

Hong Kong, Singapore locked in fight over new stock futures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After busting the stock speculators at home,
Hong Kong is now trying to stop them abroad as it fights
Singapore's plans to open a futures market that tracks the
blue-chip Hang Seng Index.
	   And once again, investors worry that Hong Kong's laissez faire
system could be getting too much hands-on control.
	   Executives of the feuding exchanges met here Friday but reported
no progress in making peace _ with the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange planning on Nov. 23 to launch futures trading of
a stock index that is virtually a carbon copy of the Hang Seng.
	   The chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Alec Tsui,
told reporters afterward he will press ahead with efforts to block
Singapore's access to real-time stock quotes.
	   If Singapore's SIMEX, as the exchange is known, cannot get
instant prices, its new futures contract might be unable to survive
in a global market where dealers respond to major events in mere
seconds.
	   SIMEX President Ang Swee Tian said late Friday in a statement
that he had assured Hong Kong executives the futures dealings would
``preserve market integrity, prevent market manipulation and
protect customers' interests.''
	   The meeting included representatives of Morgan Stanley Capital
International, which compiles the Hong Kong index that SIMEX wants
to trade. SIMEX says its futures will have a ``99.995 percent
correlation with the Hang Seng Index.''
	   Hong Kong exchange executives worry that futures traders in
Singapore could end up manipulating Hong Kong prices in dealings
beyond their regulatory reach.
	   ``We don't know what the regulation is of that offshore
market,'' said Henry Law, a spokesman for the Hong Kong Exchange.
He added: ``You don't expect your competitor to support you.''
	   SIMEX officials say they were surprised by Hong Kong's reaction
and added their regulations ``are in line with international
standards of best practice.''
	   SIMEX already conducts offshore futures trading based on Tokyo
and Taipei shares, and it says Hong Kong's stance goes against
regulators' previous statements that anybody is free to trade
derivatives based on Hong Kong shares.
	   Controversy over control of the markets is nothing new in Hong
Kong.
	   The territory's government faced a crisis in the summer, when
traders were selling the Hong Kong dollar, forcing monetary
authorities to drive up interest rates, while at the same time
selling shares, which went down as interest rates went up.
	   Seeing no end to the spiral, the government intervened, snapping
up U.S. dlrs 15 billion in shares to drive out the speculators.
	   The Hong Kong Futures Exchange then reformed its rules in an
effort to stop large investors from manipulating prices, by
requiring disclosure of anybody who makes particularly large bets
on the market.
	   The feud with SIMEX prompted more changes as the Hong Kong
futures exchange tries to protect its own business selling Hang
Seng futures.
	   The chief executive, Randy Gilmore, said Friday his market will
cut trading fees and extend opening hours ``to meet the SIMEX
challenge.''
	   Hong Kong stock bosses also met with financial information
provider Reuters, reportedly to tell Reuters not to distribute
real-time stock prices to SIMEX.
	   It remains unclear whether the Hong Kong exchange can stop the
flow of information, however.
	   The latest moves in Hong Kong are raising concerns among traders
who are still unsure whether the government market intervention
will have any lasting impact on investor confidence.
	   Few are willing to air their gripes publicly, however.
	   ``It seems like they just want a lot of control in the market
here which investors don't like,'' said one futures trader at a
major Hong Kong brokerage, speaking only on condition of anonymity.

Report: Russia, U.S. likely to strike food aid agreement Friday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States and Russia were likely to reach
a food aid agreement Friday, though Moscow has balked at some
American demands, a Russian official said.
	   A U.S. delegation has been in Moscow all week for negotiations
on a plan to deliver 3.1 million metric tons of American food to
help see Russia through the long winter.
	   However, the Americans are worried about possible corruption,
and want to set strict guidelines on how the food is distributed.
This prevented an agreement Thursday, but a deal was still likely
on Friday, Vladimir Scherbak, the first deputy agriculture
minister, told the Interfax news agency.
	   Some of the U.S. guidelines were ``utterly unacceptable to
Russia,'' he said, without giving specifics.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, who has led the Russian
delegation, said Thursday the Americans were insisting profits from
any food aid sold by the Russian government go to the country's
Pension Fund, which is chronically short of cash. As a result, many
retirees have to wait months to receive their pension money.
	   Also, the United States wants the food aid exempted from both
taxes and import duties.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael Hurley said Thursday evening that
``there were just a couple of loose ends'' in the negotiations.
Neither Hurley nor the other embassy official would elaborate on
the negotiations.
	   Russia's economic crisis, along with shrinking food imports and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years, has raised concerns about
possible food shortages.
	   Store shelves remain well-stocked, but food prices have risen
sharply in recent months and some poor Russians may not be able to
afford what's available.
	   About half of the U.S. food would be provided for free. The
other half would be sold to Russia for around dlrs 500 million
under a 20-year loan. The shipments would include wheat, corn,
soybeans, meat and produce.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   The Russian government's Customs Committee announced Thursday it
was temporarily cutting import duties on some food products,
apparently in an effort to get more food flowing into the country.
The reduction primarily targets meat, poultry, dairy products and
vegetable oil.

Supreme court rejects petition for delay in Salinas confiscation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE (AP) _ The Swiss supreme court said Friday it has
turned down a petition by Raul Salinas de Gortari for a delay in
Switzerland's confiscation of dlrs 114.4 million as probable
laundered drug money.
	   The Federal Tribunal ruled against the move by Salinas, the
brother of the former Mexican president Carlos Salinas, as the
confiscation cannot be completed pending the outcome of Salinas'
appeal against the seizure.
	   It will likely be months before the case comes to court.
	   Switzerland's federal prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, last month
ordered the confiscation of the money in accounts in Switzerland
and Britain after a 2 1/2 year investigation of Raul Salinas.
	   The investigation concluded that Salinas had taken at least dlrs
500 million from traffickers to protect drug shipments.
	   Salinas is in prison in central Mexico pending competion of
trials in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal
enrichment during his brother's administration between 1988 and
1994.
	   Del Ponte has said she is ``very confident'' the supreme court
will uphold the seizure.

Sharp rise in ships violating Japanese waters, coast guard says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The number of vessels illegally entering Japanese
waters to fish or smuggle ashore workers has surged in the last
decade, Japan's coast guard warned in a report Friday.
	   While no one was arrested in 1989 for trying to sneak into
Japan, last year 605 such arrests were made, the Maritime Safety
Agency said in its annual white paper.
	   As of October of this year, 401 people had been arrested trying
to enter Japan. More than 90 percent were Chinese, mostly those in
search of work, the report said.
	   In one case, 16 Chinese men and women were discovered last
August inside a container unloaded on a dock near Tokyo. Half of
the occupants had died of dehydration.
	   The report also said coast guard sightings last year of foreign
fishing ships illegally operating in Japanese waters more than
doubled from the year before to 19,000.
	   Of those, 12,000 were Chinese vessels, it said. Most of the rest
were Taiwanese, Korean and Russian.
	   The report said Japanese coast guard ships issued warnings to
816 foreign vessels and seized 28 within Japanese waters.

Japan's steelmakers report losses for fiscal first half as economy
</HEADLINE>
slumps

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's biggest steelmakers reported losses of
hundreds of millions of dollars for the first half of the year on
Friday, saying demand for steel weakened sharply as the country
slipped into recession.
	   The world's largest steel manufacturer, Nippon Steel Corp.,
suffered a net loss of 44.34 billion yen (dlrs 376 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30, down from a net profit of 8.10 billion
yen (dlrs 69 million) in the same period a year earlier.
	   The earnings report covered the parent company only and did not
include Nippon Steel's subsidiaries.
	   The loss was the second-worst for the company since it was set
up in 1970.
	   Demand for steel from construction and manufacturing companies
has fallen sharply amid the worst recession in Japan's postwar
history and an economic crisis in much of the rest of Asia, the
company said.
	   The company's crude steel output slumped to 12.05 million metric
tons, the lowest level for any six-month period since 1970.
	   The story was much the same for three other big Japanese
steelmakers _ NKK Corp. and Kobe Steel Ltd. suffered large losses
while Kawasaki Steel Corp. said profits fell by nearly a quarter.
All blamed shrinking demand at home.
	   NKK Corp. reported a net loss for its parent company of 30.04
billion yen (dlrs 255 million) in the first half of its business
year, down sharply from 11.23 billion yen (dlrs 95 million) last
year.
	   Kobe Steel said its parent company suffered a net loss of 3.33
billion yen (dlrs 28 million) during the six-month period, down
from last year's 7 billion yen (dlrs 59 million) profit.
	   Kawasaki said net profit for the parent company slumped 23
percent for the half year to 4.02 billion yen (dlrs 34 million)
from 5.22 billion yen (dlrs 44 million) last year.

East Timor settlement talks at pivotal stage, U.N. envoy says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a new
United Nations proposal to settle their dispute over East Timor,
and talks between the two sides are at a crucial stage, according
to a U.N. envoy.
	   Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. envoy for East Timor, said late
Thursday that the proposal envisages broad autonomy for the
disputed Southeast Asian territory.
	   ``We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical,
moment in the talks,'' Marker told reporters after a dinner with
President Jorge Sampaio.
	   He said the U.N. plan includes ``a proposal for very
wide-ranging autonomy for East Timor,'' a former Portuguese colony
which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and later annexed.
	   Lisbon and Jakarta have agreed to discuss the proposal, which
was ``couched in legal terms'' and could provide the foundation for
a future Constitution for East Timor, Marker said, though he
declined to give further details.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlement
on East Timor, was on the second day of a three-day visit for talks
with Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.
	   After the resignation of authoritarian President Suharto in May,
Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to the
territory of 800,000 people, but insisted on retaining control over
its defense, economic and foreign policy.
	   Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected that
proposal and insisted a referendum be held inside the territory to
decide its future.

 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Friday he will only visit jailed former Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim if Malaysia's government gives its approval.
	   ``If they will allow me, I will be very happy to visit,''
Estrada told reporters.
	   ``It is up to them if they will allow me. That is their country
and that is their domestic issue in which we will not interfere.''
	   Estrada has frequently criticized Anwar's arrest and treatment
in jail. Anwar was sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
then arrested after he called for Mahathir's resignation.
	   He has attended court sessions with a black eye and neck brace
and said he was beaten by police.
	   Estrada is to visit Malaysia later this month to attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic forum in Kuala Lumpur, and has said he would
like to visit Anwar, whom he considers a friend.
	   He also planned to meet Mahathir and urge him to protect Anwar's
human rights.
	   However, Mahathir has decided not to hold customary bilateral
meetings with any of the APEC leaders, except for last year's APEC
host, Canada, and next year's host, New Zealand, Philippine
officials said.

UEFA to decide on Fiorentina-Grasshoppers match Sunday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; REPEATING PROTECTIVELY

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's control and disciplinary body
will decide Sunday what action to take over the incident that
caused the suspension of a match between Fiorentina and
Grasshoppers of Switzerland, the European body said Friday.
	   UEFA representatives asked the referee not to start the second
half of Tuesday's second-round second leg UEFA Cup match after an
off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device hurled
from the stands.
	   The game was being played in Salerno, near Naples, following the
suspension of Fiorentina's own ground and to raise funds for the
victims of recent floodings in southern Italy.
	   Fiorentina was paying the second and last round of suspension of
its Franchi stadium as a result of its fans misbehavior during a
Cup Winners Cup game against Barcelona in 1997.
	   Although playing away from home Fiorentina still was considered
responsible for the fans' behavior in Salerno.
	   The Italian club could face a ban from European competition of
one or more seasons and a 3-0 forfeit defeat.
	   The incident occurred as players and officials were walking to
the dressing rooms at the end of the first half.
	   Fiorentina, which had won the first leg 2-0, was a favorite to
qualify. The Italian club was leading 2-1 in the second leg when
the game was suspended.

Drug maker warns against unauthorized sales of Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The company that produces Viagra
warned Filipinos Friday not to buy it from unauthorized dealers
after robbers stole a large amount of the anti-impotence drug.
	   The robbers broke into a warehouse of the Philippines' largest
drug store chain last Saturday and fled with various prescription
drugs, including Viagra.
	   Dr. Sandra Torres, Philippine medical director for Pfizer, said
Viagra should be bought only from the 850 drugstores authorized to
sell the medicine nationwide.
	   Pfizer sales director Patrick del Prado said the company also is
monitoring drug stores to prevent the stolen stocks from being
sold.
	   Drugstores began selling Viagra in the Philippines last week,
but it is too expensive for most Filipinos.
	   A regular 50-milligram tablet costs about 500 pesos (dlrs
12.20), enough to buy rice to feed a family of five for three
weeks.
	   Police said 12 to 15 men wearing police shirts and armed with
rifles and pistols raided the warehouse of Mercury Drug Corp. in
suburban Quezon City last Saturday.
	   The robbers tied up five security guards and cut through iron
grills in a window to enter a room where they seized the drugs and
then fled in a company van.
	   Mercury officials are still conducting an inventory to determine
the amount of drugs stolen. Investigators suspect an inside job.

Health ministry tries to stem rise in AIDS cases among adults
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In an effort to curb the increase in
AIDS cases in Romania, the Health Ministry is introducing tough
measures that would violate privacy laws elsewyere, an educator
said Friday.
	   Romanians, who spend more than six months abroad, pregnant women
and couples waiting to get married will have to get an HIV test,
according to new Health Ministry rules.
	   The cash-strapped government hasn't the money to implement
nationwide education programs, so this is another way to stem the
increase, said Monica Dan, and AIDS educator working for the
non-governmental Romanian anti-AIDS Association.
	   Dan said she was concerned that the tests would be expensive and
hard to administer and claimed the money would be better spent on
education programs.
	   Children are the main victims of AIDS in Romania. In December
1997, there were 4,594 children with AIDS and 553 adults. Six
months later, 4,683 children and 597 adults were officially
reported to be infected.
	   Romania has the highest number of AIDS infants in Europe.
Children get infected mainly from needles and blood transfusions,
Dan said.
	   Sex education in schools began only after the fall of communism,
but it is patchy and only students in cities benefit.
	   Under former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, AIDS was
officially non-existent and unknown. As a result, doctors took no
preventive measures.
	   After Ceausescu was overthrown in 1989, several thousand
children were revealed to be infected with the HIV virus. Several
thousand have died in recent years.

Car bomb explodes; Israel suspends ratification of peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS leade UPDATES with Cabinet statement &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A suicide car bomb exploded in a Jerusalem
market Friday crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The
blast killed two and wounded 21, and in response, Israel's Cabinet
suspended implementation of the peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas which has been trying to
sabotage the peace accord claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m.
(0745 gmt) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market, police said.
	   Palestinian negotiators accused Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding up the agreement that
was to give the Palestinians another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the main
intersection at the entrance of Mahane Yehuda, smoke coming out of
the hood and windows. ``People started to shout `car on fire,'''
said Yair Cohen, a bus company employee who was buying cookies.
	   A series of explosions went off inside the car and flames shot
10 feet into the air. Shoppers fled, screaming, as black smoke
engulfed the area.
	   The force of the blast turned the car into a mass of twisted
metal. Israel radio said two suitcases filled with explosive
materials were found nearby, suggesting that the blast had gone off
prematurely and that the assailants had planned to set off a more
powerful explosion.
	   A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay several
meters away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street. Another
bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool of blood
below the head. Rescue workers covered the body with sodden pieces
of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags.
	   Israel TV said the two dead were the assailants.
	   ``There was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an
Israeli border policeman who was patrolling the market and was
lightly injured. Soldiers and police wearing plastic gloves held
back the crowds. ``It's dangerous _ stay back!'' they shouted.
	   Two policemen led away an elderly woman who gripped a blue
plastic shopping bag filled with groceries. One officer put his arm
around a young woman who was sobbing.
	   One heavy-set woman, apparently in shock, climbed into an
ambulance, weeping. Three paramedics talked to her, persuading her
that she did not need medical treatment, and after a few moments
she climbed out of the vehicle again.
	   Just a few meters from the site of the explosion, two Islamic
militants had blown themselves up in July 1997, killing themselves
and 16 shoppers.
	   Just a block away from Friday's blast, shoppers went about their
business. One young woman shopper said: ``We can't stop with what
we are doing when this happens.''
	   When the explosion went off, the Israeli Cabinet had just
gathered about a mile away, at Netanyahu's office, to discuss the
peace agreement under which Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank over 12 weeks, in exchange for a Palestinian
campaign against Islamic militants.
	   The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by the
Cabinet, and Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said at the start of
the session that he had expected a vote later Friday.
	   However, the session broke off when word of the attack reached
the ministers. The meeting was resumed shortly after noon, with
ministers deciding to suspending the ratification process
indefinitely.
	   ``The government of Israel will resume the discussion on the
agreement after it verifies that the Palestinian Authority is
taking vigorous steps for a relentless fight against terrorist
organizations and their infrastructure,'' a Cabinet statement said.
	   The Cabinet also demanded clarifications from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on the procedure for revoking clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye River agreement refers to the procedure, but is vague
enough to allow different interpretations. It says the Palestine
National Council and other Palestinian organizations will meet in
mid-December to ``reaffirm'' a letter by Arafat to U.S. President
Bill Clinton in which the Palestinian leader spells out which
clauses are being annulled.
	   The Palestinians dispute Israel's contention that the agreement
calls for the PNC to hold a vote on the clauses.
	   The Cabinet also said it would act to strengthen Jerusalem as
Israel's capital. Israel radio initially said the ministers decided
to begin construction of the Jewish neighborhood of Har Homa in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem next. Bar-Illan said construction
would be authorized ``in the near future,'' but would not give a
date.
	   Palestinian officials said Israel was playing into the hands of
the militants. ``This is exactly what they want,'' said Palestinian
negotiator Hassan Asfour. ``This is political blackmail and its not
helpful. We hope that Mr. Netanyahu will not yield to the pressure
and demands of the right wing in his government.''

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of students rallied at the
University of Indonesia and about 300 others marched on parliament
Friday, demanding that the powerful military get out of politics
and that the ex-president be sent to trial.
	   Both groups said plans to retain military appointees in the
nation's otherwise elected parliament contradict a government
pledge to deliver sweeping democratic reforms.
	   The protesters also said former President Suharto should be
arrested for ``political and economic crimes'' and human rights
abuses.
	   ``Suharto has to be dragged into court and tried,'' said Fitra
Arsil, a protest organizer.
	   Suharto stepped down last May following a wave of protests and
deadly riots amid the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Since resigning, he has denied allegations of widespread
corruption. Opposition groups have criticized a government inquiry
into his business dealings that has so far failed to unearth any
evidence against him.
	   Next week, Indonesia's highest legislative body is scheduled to
debate new political laws ahead of elections planned for next May
or June.
	   About 300 Islamic students marched down a busy road toward
parliament but were stopped by security personnel about 200 meters
(yards) from the legislature.
	   The protesters waved anti-government banners. Dozens of women in
the group wore Islamic head scarves.
	   Briefly after the Muslim students dispersed, a group of young
men came in and were allowed by police to march to a road behind
the parliament building where they held a pro-government rally.
	   ``Don't disturb the extraordinary meeting of MPR,'' said a big
banner waved by the group.
	   Massive student protests are expected to be held when the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly meets next week,
starting Tuesday.
	   A major issue before the assembly will be the future of the
military in Indonesia's parliament. At present the military
directly appoints 75 representatives in the 500-member legislature.
	   Under proposed reform legislation this is expected to be cut to
55 seats, but pro-democracy groups want all military appointees out
of parliament.
	   ``It's impossible to defend a situation where appointees of the
armed forces sit in parliament. It contradicts the constitution,''
a student statement said Friday.
	   Last week, 8,000 students demonstrated outside the Jakarta's
national parliament building, where the assembly is to be held.
	   The government of Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie,
says about 30,000 troops, police and other security personnel will
be deployed across the capital, Jakarta, to protect the assembly.
	   Habibie wants the assembly to endorse what he says will be major
democratic reforms to a political system that had been tightly
controlled by the authoritarian Suharto for three decades.
	   However, critics doubt that the assembly, dominated by former
supporters of Suharto, will deliver true democratic change.

	   DUNKIRK, France (AP) _ Customs officers seized a huge stash of
drugs _ including 400,000 tablets of ecstasy _ in a truck en route
to Britain from Germany, police said Friday.
	   Police found the drugs on Oct. 28 in a British-licensed truck
during routine checks on a highway on the outskirts of this
northern port town.
	   Of the 400,000 ecstasy tablets, the vast majority were said to
be of a new brand 100 times stronger than usual, with effects
similar to LSD.
	   The truck also was carrying 201 kilograms (442 pounds) of
cannabis resin, 220 kilograms (484 pounds) of hashish and 92
kilograms (202 pounds) of amphetamine sulphate.
	   The driver, identified only as a 59-year-old Briton, was
arrested and is in custody in Dunkirk. He denied any knowledge of
the drugs.
	   Police said he had been previously arrested in southern France
in 1990 for drug trafficking.
	   It wasn't clear why police waited until Friday to announce the
seizure.

Myanmar government follows ruling on Massachusetts boycott law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Myanmar military regime was closely
watching Friday a U.S. court decision striking down a Massachusetts
law preventing the state's government from dealing with companies
doing business in the country.
	   A spokesman for the Myanmar government, which has been widely
condemned in the West for suppressing the pro-democracy movement
led by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi, said the case was
being followed ``with interest.''
	   Massachusetts adopted the law in 1996 to pressure the military
to open a dialogue with Suu Kyi and allow more democracy in
Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   For Myanmar's government, the law was as a potential danger to
their attempt to develop the country's economy while keeping a
tight lid on political dissent. The military has ruled Myanmar
since 1962.
	   ``We are following the court hearing with much interest because
it seems that this is one of the very few cases (is any exist)
where states and cities can infringe on the federal government's
exclusive foreign affairs power,'' a government spokesman said in a
fax.
	   ``We always believe that the truth will eventually prevail and
hope those states which have imposed sanctions due to incorrect
information or misinformation will come to realize the true
situation in Myanmar.''
	   The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro on
Wednesday could affect the purchasing laws of 44 states.
Massachusetts expects to decide by Friday whether to appeal the
decision.
	   Byron Rushing, the Boston state representative who wrote the
law, said that if the ruling stood, taxpayers and local governments
would lose their rights to decide whom to do business with.
	   ``If selective purchasing had been banned 10 years ago, Nelson
Mandela might still be in prison today,'' Rushing said.
	   Tauro ruled that the law ``impermissibly infringes on the
federal government's power to regulate foreign affairs.''
	   The lawsuit was brought by the National Foreign Trade Council,
which represents major U.S. corporations that it won't name for
fear consumers will boycott them.
	   ``Our system of government was not designed to allow the 50
states and hundreds of municipalities to conduct their own
individual foreign policies,'' said NFTC Director Frank Kittredge.
	   The Myanmar government has been accused of drug trafficking,
torture and using slave labor.

Car bomb explodes; Israel suspends ratification of peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead with both dead believed to be the assailants.
UPDATES with Cabinet statement. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A suicide car bomb exploded in a Jerusalem
market Friday crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The
blast killed two and wounded 21. In response, Israel's Cabinet
suspended implementation of the peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying to
sabotage the peace accord, claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m.
(0745 gmt) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market, police said. Israel
TV said the two dead were the assailants.
	   Palestinian negotiators accused Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding up the agreement that
was to give the Palestinians another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the main
intersection at the entrance of the outdoor market, smoke coming
out of the hood and windows. ``People started to shout `car on
fire,''' said Yair Cohen, a bus company employee who was buying
cookies.
	   A series of explosions went off inside the car and flames shot
10 feet (3 meters) into the air. Shoppers fled, screaming, as black
smoke engulfed the area.
	   The force of the blast turned the car into a mass of twisted
metal. Israel radio said two suitcases filled with explosive
materials were found nearby, suggesting the blast went off
prematurely and that the assailants had planned to set off a more
powerful explosion.
	   A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay several
meters (yards) away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.
Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool of
blood below the head. Rescue workers covered the body with sodden
pieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags.
	   ``There was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an
Israeli border policeman who was patrolling the market and was
lightly injured. Soldiers and police wearing plastic gloves held
back the crowds. ``It's dangerous _ stay back!'' they shouted.
	   Two policemen led away an elderly woman who gripped a blue
plastic shopping bag filled with groceries. One officer put his arm
around a young woman who was sobbing.
	   One heavy-set woman, apparently in shock, climbed into an
ambulance, weeping. Three paramedics talked to her, persuading her
that she did not need medical treatment, and after a few moments,
she climbed out of the vehicle again.
	   In July 1997, two Islamic militants had blown themselves up just
a few meters (yards) from the site of the latest explosion, killing
themselves and 16 shoppers.
	   Just a block away from Friday's blast, shoppers went about their
business.
	   ``We can't stop with what we are doing when this happens,'' one
young female shopper said.
	   When the explosion went off, the Israeli Cabinet had just
gathered about a mile (kilometer) away, at Netanyahu's office, to
discuss the peace agreement under which Israel is to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks, in exchange for a
Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.
	   The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by the
Cabinet. Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said at the start of the
session that he had expected a vote later Friday.
	   However, the session broke off when word of the attack reached
the ministers. The meeting was resumed shortly after noon, with
ministers deciding to suspending the ratification process
indefinitely.
	   ``The government of Israel will resume the discussion on the
agreement after it verifies that the Palestinian Authority is
taking vigorous steps for a relentless fight against terrorist
organizations and their infrastructure,'' a Cabinet statement said.
	   The Cabinet also demanded clarifications from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on the procedure for revoking clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye River agreement refers to the procedure, but is vague
enough to allow different interpretations. It says the Palestine
National Council and other Palestinian organizations will meet in
mid-December to ``reaffirm'' a letter by Arafat to U.S. President
Bill Clinton in which the Palestinian leader spells out which
clauses are being annulled.
	   The Palestinians dispute Israel's contention that the agreement
calls for the PNC to hold a vote on the clauses.
	   The Cabinet also said it would act to strengthen Jerusalem as
Israel's capital. Israel radio initially said the ministers decided
to begin construction of the controversial Jewish neighborhood of
Har Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem next. Bar-Illan said
construction would be authorized ``in the near future,'' but would
not give a date.
	   Palestinian officials said Israel was playing into the hands of
the militants. ``This is exactly what they want,'' said Palestinian
negotiator Hassan Asfour. ``This is political blackmail and its not
helpful. We hope that Mr. Netanyahu will not yield to the pressure
and demands of the right wing in his government.''

Charles leaves `Dracula' land after 3-day visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Fed up with its country's stereotype
as the land of vampires and werewolves, a Romanian newspaper
protested coverage of Prince Charles' visit Friday.
	   The Prince of Wales spent three days in Romania on his Eastern
European tour, leaving Friday for Bulgaria on his private jet.
	   ``The British press see us as a primitive people,'' bemoaned the
Bucharest daily Evenimentul Zilei. ``Prince Charles ventured among
Romanian vampires without a crucifix and garlic,'' headlined the
paper.
	   Some historians say Charles is a distant relative of Vlad the
Impaler, the Romanian prince who inspired the Dracula legend.
	   According to Bram Stoker's novel, a crucifix and garlic can fend
off evil spirits. These methods of self-defense are found in
Romanian folklore.

Tajik govt. forces track down rebel warlord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 2-5, and final four grafs, with government putting
death toll at more than 200, notes that hostages are government
troops, not civilians as reported earlier. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajik government and former
opposition groups joined forces Friday to combat a maverick warlord
who has threatened to blow up a dam and flood large parts of the
Central Asian nation.
	   Government troops and their new allies have retaken control of
the northern city of Khodzhand, but were still facing some pockets
of residence in mountainous northern Tajikistan. Three days of
fighting have claimed more than 200 lives, officials said.
	   The rebel leader, former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, has
demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political
prisoners and bring his supporters to the government. Rakhmonov
firmly ruled out any talks with the rebels, saying the government
will destroy or capture them all.
	   Twenty-five government troops and eight civilians have died have
died in the fighting that has raged since Wednesday, when the
rebels raided Khdozhand, the city 200 kilometers (125 miles) north
of the capital, Dushanbe. The rebels lost 180 people, Tajik Defense
Minister Sherali Khairuloyev said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Also, more than 100 people have been wounded, the defense
minister said.
	   The government started gaining the upper hand Thursday, but
Khudoberdyev said his guerrillas had mined the dam on the
Kairakkhum channel as a ``deterrence measure.''
	   ``It will flood vast territories of Central Asia,'' Khudoberdyev
warned in a statement received by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The dam he threatened to destroy holds a reservoir so large it
is referred to locally as a ``sea.'' Rakhmonov dismissed the
threat, saying that the government forces were protecting the dam.
	   The fighting this week has been one of the most serious
outbursts of violence since a peace accord was signed last year,
ending five years of civil war in the small, impoverished Central
Asian nation.
	   During the war, the secular government battled a mostly Muslim
opposition. But the main opposition groups are now participating in
the government and the armed forces, and were taking part this week
in the operation against the renegade ex-colonel.
	   Speaking on national television Friday, the country's
Constitution Day, Rakhmonov said the old opposition had agreed to
help the government crush the new rebellion.
	   ``No one will be able to thwart the peace process,'' Rakhmonov
said in a television address.
	   He said that the government again held Khodzhand and its
airport, allowing reinforcements to be brought to the region
quickly. However, some rebels continued their resistance in an
ancient fortress in the city, Rakhmonov said.
	   Some 50 rebels had captured 95 government soldiers and taken
them to the fortress, threatening to shoot them if the government
attacked, Khairuloyev, the defense minister, said Friday.
	   He said the rebels were especially difficult to drive out,
because the fortress is surrounded by apartment buildings.
	   ``We will do everything to save lives of officers and soldiers
who are in the rebels' hands,'' he said, according to the Interfax.

Supreme court rejects petition for delay in Salinas confiscation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss supreme court said Friday
it has turned down a petition by the brother of former Mexican
President Carlos Salinas for a delay in Switzerland's confiscation
of dlrs 114.4 million as probable laundered drug money.
	   The Federal Tribunal ruled against the move by Raul Salinas de
Gortari because the confiscation cannot be completed pending the
outcome of his appeal against the seizure. It will likely be months
before the case comes to court.
	   Switzerland's federal prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, last month
ordered the confiscation of the money in accounts in Switzerland
and Britain after a 2 1/2 year investigation of Raul Salinas. The
investigation concluded he took at least dlrs 500 million from
traffickers to protect drug shipments.
	   Raul Salinas is in prison in central Mexico pending competion of
trials in a political assassination and on a charge of illegal
enrichment during his brother's administration between 1988 and
1994.
	   Del Ponte has said she is ``very confident'' the supreme court
will uphold the seizure.

	   Kagame said Rwanda had previously refused to acknowledge its
troops were in Congo because it wanted to avoid the impression that
the problems in the Congo were caused by an invasion from other
countries.
	   He insisted Rwandan troops moved into Congo well after the start
of the rebellion on August 2.
	   Kagame said he supports efforts to end the war.
	   ``The process is to find a solution. We support that process, to
have a ceasefire, a standstill of all troops and then negotiate a
settlement,'' he said.
	   Talks should include Congolese president Laurent Kabila and his
government, the Congolese rebels and all other countries involved
in the conflict, Kagame told reporters after meeting with Mandela.
	   ``We've informed President Mandela that we are there (Congo) to
defend Rwanda's national security,'' said Kagame.
	   Hutu rebels driven from Rwanda by Kagame's predominantly Tutsi
Rwandan Patriotic Front after the genocide in 1994, continued to
stage hit and run attacks on Rwanda from bases inside Congo.
	   Mandela said after recent talks ``many felt that the fact that
Rwanda did not admit they were combatants created immense
difficulty in moving forward.''
	   He said Rwanda had been under pressure from United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan and the organization of African unity
to acknowledge its presence in Congo.
	   Mandela said Rwanda's admission opens the way for talks and
improves chances for a ceasefire and for talks that will lead to an
end to the war and to free elections in Congo.
	   Rebels accuse Kabila of corruption, mismanagement and stirring
up ethnic rivalries. Since the fighting began in August, several
border nations have entered the fray.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have sent troops to help Kabila.
Fearing an escalation in the fighting, the United States sent Susan
Rice, the top State Department official for African affairs, to
help find a solution.

Unilever profit grows despite global economic woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Anglo-Dutch consumer products
giant Unilever said Friday its third-quarter net profit rose 33
percent to 2.22 billion guilders (dlrs 1.18 billion).
	   The global economic turmoil had no significant impact on
Unilever's European and North American business, but growth slowed
in developing and emerging markets as consumer demand weakened in
Southeast Asia and Latin America.
	   ``Against this mixed background, businesses have concentrated on
building market positions,'' Unilever said in a statement.
	   Worldwide, Unilever posted sales of 23.61 billion guilders (dlrs
12.6 billion), up from 23.40 billion guilders (dlrs 12.5 billion)
in the same period last year.
	   Results were boosted by a net gain of 828 million guilders (dlrs
442.8 million) raised by the July sale of Plant Breeding
International Cambridge Ltd. to Monsanto Co.
	   Poor summer weather hit Unilever's ice cream sales, contributing
to a 6 percent sales drop across Europe. But third quarter
operating profit in Europe rose to 1.71 billion guilders (dlrs
914.4 million) from 1.66 billion guilders (dlrs 887.7 million)
helped by improved operating margins.
	   North American sales rose 3 percent but operating profit fell to
552 million guilders (dlrs 295.2 million) from 615 million guilders
(dlrs 328.9 million) due to higher marketing investments in support
of product launches.
	   Price increases to recover higher costs in Southeast Asia
following the currency devaluations there helped sales in the
region rise 13 percent to 4.09 billion guilders (dlrs 2.19 billion)
while operating profit rose to 417 million guilders (dlrs 223.0
million) from 337 million guilders (dlrs 180.2 million).
	   Latin American sales rose to 2.73 billion guilders (dlrs 1.46
billion) from 2.63 billion guilders (dlrs 1.40 billion), but
operating profit fell to 233 million guilders (dlrs 124.6 million)
from 263 million guilders (dlrs 140.6 million). Unilever blamed a
combination of higher marketing investment, reorganization costs
and weakening consumer demand.
	   Unilever also said that it will likely spend about dlrs 490
million protecting the company from the millennium computer
problems.
	   Unilever shares rose 3 percent on the Amsterdam stock exchange
on Friday's results.

Prosecutors investigate two Wehrmacht soldiers for alleged Nazi

crimes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Frankfurt prosecutors are
investigating two former Wehrmacht soldiers for alleged Nazi
crimes, a spokesman said Friday.
	   The two men _ identified only as a 75-year-old from Ludwigshafen
and an 83-year-old from Taunus _ are suspected of shooting to death
12 civilians in the Italian city of Grimaldi in December 1944.
	   Italy requested help on an investigation into the murders
earlier this year, said Jost Tilmann, spokesman for the Frankfurt
prosecutors office.
	   Prosecutors were previously unaware of the deaths, Tilmann said,
and were trying to determine whether the Wehrmacht was stationed in
the city at the time, and if so, whether the suspects were assigned
to the unit.
	   No further details were immediately available.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week generally
mixed Friday, with prices falling in Tokyo and Hong Kong but
surging in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei stock
average declined 219.40 points or 1.53 percent to close at
14,121.97. Share prices decline for a second day as investors
cashed in on a rally earlier in the week. In Hong Kong, the
blue-chip Hang Seng index fell 82.23 points or 0.8 percent, closing
at 10,139.75. The U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.00 yen in late
afternoon trading, up 0.36 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo. Also
Friday, Thai stock prices soared with the key index rising 4
percent after Thai Farmers Bank announced it would lower its prime
rate 150 basis points to 12 percent. In Malaysian share prices also
soared on buying by local investors to close at 453.29 points, up
14.63 points, or 3.3 percent. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced a global
restructuring drive Friday that will include major job cuts in the
United States and Thailand, factory closures in Japan and a steep
reduction in production. Mitsubishi, one of Japan's biggest
automakers, will lay off 1,000 workers at subsidiaries in Illinois
and California, which now employ 5,100 workers, as well as 1,200 of
its 4,000 employees in Thailand, said company president Katsuhiko
Kawasoe. The company will also reduce the number of its car models
by 40 percent and close two plants in Japan. Mitsubishi said it
hopes to cut costs by 350 billion yen (dlrs 3 billion) by 2001 and
return to profitability after suffering huge losses from Japan's
recession and the Asian financial crisis. ``The economic situation
is very severe, but we have to do our utmost to return to
profitability as soon as possible,'' Kawasoe said. Mitsubishi
reported heavy losses Friday for the first half of the current
fiscal year ended Sept. 30, posting a net loss of 28.64 billion yen
(dlrs 243 million). It posted a profit of 8.60 billion yen (dlrs 73
million) for the same period last year. (JAPAN-MITSUBISHI LAYOFFS)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways
is forming an international consortium to bid for a stake in
troubled Philippine Airlines, according to reports Friday. Cathay
Pacific would own 40 percent of the airline _ the maximum allowed
to foreigners under Philippine law _ while the Philippine
subsidiary of the American Insurance Group and another unnamed
Philippine company would buy 10 percent between them, the Hong Kong
Standard reported. An airline analyst's report mentioned the same
potential partners but gave different sizes for their contemplated
stakes. Singapore-based DBS Securities Ltd. estimated Friday that
Cathay would pay about 1 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 128
million) for up to 30 percent of PAL, with AIG and the third
partner taking a combined 20 percent. Neither Cathay Pacific nor
AIG would comment. PAL, Asia's oldest airline, has been unable to
make payments on U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion in debt, and suffered a
pilots' strike in June. (HONG KONG-PHILIPPINE AIRLINES)
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Seven U.S. factories will stay dark over
the holiday season to limit production of Levi's jeans, said Levi
Strauss and Co., which has struggled to stay competitive in the
growing jeans market. More than 4,000 workers will be asked to stay
home December and January in Texas, Georgia, Tennessee and North
Carolina, the San Francisco-based company said Thursday. Demand for
Levi's trademark jeans has dropped in recent years. Competition
from newer fashion brands, such as The Gap and Tommy Hilfiger, has
cut the world's oldest denim maker's hold on the jeans market to
less than 17 percent. The plants are scheduled to reopen in
February. Until then, workers will receive 90 percent of their pay
through unemployment, supplementary compensation, vacation and
holiday pay, Churchman said. Levi Strauss, the world's largest
brand-name clothing maker, celebrated its 125th anniversary this
year. (US-LEVI CUTS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's massive public works spending package might
not be enough to spur domestic demand and power the sagging economy
out of recession, the government said Friday. The Economic Planning
Agency's monthly report said the economy was still floundering in
its worst downturn since World War II, with the outlook darkened by
unstable currency markets and slowdowns overseas. Despite the
planned stimulus, likely to be worth more than 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 86 billion), private capital outlays are still sagging
because of concerns about the long-term prospects for the economy,
the EPA said. One bright spot for the Japanese economy _ exports _
is also endangered by the recent surge of the yen and signs of
slowing economic growth overseas, said Takashi Omori, director of
the Economic Planning Agency's domestic economic affairs section.

All-Spanish and All-French showdowns in UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The third round of the UEFA Cup will feature
intriguing all-French and all-Spanish encounters.
	   Friday's draw in Geneva resulted in head-to-head showdowns
between Monaco and Olympique Marseille and Real Sociedad and
Atletico Madrid.
	   Monaco and Real Sociedad will be at home for the first leg games
on Nov. 24. The second leg is scheduled for Dec. 8.
	   In past years, UEFA has separated teams from the same country in
the draw. But this time, with four teams each from France and
Spain, and at least three from Italy, it was impossible to keep
clubs apart.
	   Italian clubs, which have won seven of the last 10 UEFA Cups,
were fortunate not to have been drawn against each other.
	   Title favorite Parma was pitted against Scottish side Glasgow
Rangers, Roma against FC Zurich and Bologna vs. Real Bettis. The
first legs will be played in Glasgow, Zurich and Bologna.
	   Fiorentina, a fourth Italian club, will likely not make it into
the third round. The club's second-round, second-leg game against
Swiss side Grasshoppers was abandoned at halftime Tuesday after an
off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device thrown
from the stands in Salerno, Italy.
	   UEFA is scheduled to annouce the outcome of the game Sunday,
with Fiorentina facing the likelihood of a 3-0 forfeit defeat and
the possibility of a European ban.
	   Whichever team is selected to advance will host French club
Bordeaux in the first leg of the third round.
	   The fourth French club, Lyon, is home vs. Belgian side Brugges.
	   Liverpool, England's only survivor, was drawn against Spanish
side Celta Vigo, which eliminated English Premier League leader
Aston Villa from the competition on Tuesday. Celta is at home for
the first leg.
	   It's the first time four French clubs have reached the third
round of the UEFA Cup. A French team has never won the competition,
while Real Madrid was the last Spanish club to capture the UEFA Cup
in 1986.
	   No German clubs made it to the final 16 this year.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car rigged with explosives blew up Friday
morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed with Israelis
shopping for the Jewish Sabbath, killing two people and wounding
21. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has tried to stop the
peace agreement, claimed responsibility, police said. In response
to the attack, the Israeli cabinet suspended ratification of the
Wye agreement until there ``is verification that the Palestinian
authority is indeed fighting terrorism.'' The Israeli Cabinet also
announced it will begin to build houses in the controversial Jewish
settlement of Har Homa in east Jerusalem. (ISRAEL-EXPLOSION)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Survivors of Hurricane Mitch, which
has killed more than 10,000 people according to official estimates,
face starvation and disease as aid workers struggle to reach them.
Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured Thursday into Central
America, where Hurricane Mitch destroyed scores of communities
before moving northwest off the Honduran coast for several days
last week. It crossed southern Florida on Thursday, injuring at
least seven people before dissipating in the Atlantic. More than
6,500 others are listed as missing in Central America, where
damaged roads and bridges greatly reduced the flow of aid to
hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle _ only as much as can
be dropped from a helicopter when they can get through. In the
Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have receded,
leaving a carpet of mud over hundreds of acres (hectares). In many
nearby villages, residents have gone days without clean water or
food. In the village of Olvido, a 7-month-old baby died after going
three days without food. (MITCH)
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajik government and former
opposition groups joined forces Friday to combat a maverick warlord
who has threatened to blow up a dam and flood huge territories in
Central Asia. Government troops and their new allies have retaken
control of the northern city of Khodzhand, but were still facing
some pockets of residence in mountainous northern Tajikistan,
officials said. The rebel leader, former army Col. Makhmud
Khudoberdyev, has demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free
all political prisoners and bring his supporters to the government.
Rakhmonov firmly ruled out any talks with the rebels, saying the
government will destroy or capture them all. According to the
government's estimates, more than 100 people have died in the
fighting that has raged since Wednesday, when the rebels raided
Khdozhand, the city 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of the
capital, Dushanbe. (TAJIKISTAN-FIGHTING)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of students rallied at the
University of Indonesia and about 300 others marched on the
Parliament Friday, demanding that the powerful military get out of
politics and that the ex-president be sent to trial. Both groups
said plans to retain military appointees in Indonesia's otherwise
elected Parliament contradict a government pledge to deliver
sweeping democratic reforms. The protesters also said former
President Suharto should be arrested for ``political and economic
crimes'' and human rights abuses. Suharto stepped down last May
following a wave of protests and deadly riots amid the worst
economic crisis in 30 years. Since resigning, he has flatly denied
allegations of widespread corruption. Opposition groups have
criticized a government inquiry into his business dealings that has
so far failed to unearth any evidence against him.
(INDONESIA-PROTEST)
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London
caused a deep split among Chileans, and now an equally profound
division is emerging on what to do when the former dictator returns
home. Some insist _ as they long have _ that he should be tried in
Chile for human rights violations that occurred during his long
regime. Others speak of forgiveness and the need for
reconciliation. One idea appears less controversial: Even some
staunch Pinochet supporters say that whatever the outcome of his
legal situation in London, he should retire from politics. Pinochet
was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a warrant from Spanish Judge
Baltasar Garzon, who wants to extradite him on accusations of
genocide, terrorism and torture. The London High Court recognized
Pinochet's immunity from prosecution as a former chief of state,
but an appeal on that ruling has yet to be decided by the House of
Lords. (CHILE-EXPECTING PINOCHET)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defense attorneys for Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister on Friday obtained a key police report
that said the sexual allegations against him were ``deliberately
created.'' Prosecutors agreed to hand over the 1997 police document
during the fifth day of the sensational corruption and sexual
misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
sacked Anwar as his deputy and finance minister Sept. 2, saying he
was morally unfit to lead, then had him expelled from the ruling
party. Anwar is standing trial on 10 counts of corruption and
sexual misconduct. He denies the charges and says they were
fabricated because Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to
his 17-year rule. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR TRIAL)

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An Italian accused of pouring boiling
water on his 5-year-old adopted Thai son was arrested Friday but
was released on bail.
	   Tonon Tiziano, 38, was released shortly after his arrest on
100,000 baht (dlrs 2,778) bail in Mae Hong Son province, 650
kilometers (404 miles) north of Bangkok, police said.
	   Tiziano had adopted the boy from an ethnic tribe in the
province, police said. The child, identified only as Rudy, was
badly burned on his torso and hospitalized.
	   Police said that Tiziano's reported the injury to welfare
authorities Thursday. The provincial governor ordered his arrest
Friday on child abuse charges.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ten people have been detained on suspicion of
counterfeiting U.S. dollars at a high-tech workshop in the restive
southern Russian region of Dagestan, a news report said Friday.
	   Police confiscated bags of dlrs 100 bills, complete with
watermarks and protection strips, that were so close to the real
thing they could pass the anti-counterfeiting machines used in
Russia's currency exchange offices, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Printing presses and high-tech equipment were seized during the
operation Thursday in Dagestan, the report said.
	   U.S. dollars are widely circulated in Russia, where the ruble's
instability has prompted many people to convert any savings into
foreign currencies. Russia has more cash dollars in circulation
than any country outside the United States, U.S. officials have
said.

Youths stone bus full of Serb basketball players

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A group of youths stoned a bus carrying
players and officials from the Serbian basketball club Crvena
Zvezda on Thursday night, according to a police report.
	   No injuries were reported, but the windshield of the coach
transporting the team to the local airport was shattered by blows
from a large slab of cement.
	   A police statement said the incident was motivated by the 80-77
loss of the home team, Cibona, to the visiting team about an hour
earlier in a Group B European League game.
	   Cibona and Crvena Zvezda were heated rivals in the former united
Yugoslav league, prior to the bloody Serb-Croat war in 1991-92. The
normalization of relations between Serbs and Croats has seen
sporting contests revived, but tensions still linger beneath the
surface.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Talks between senior defense officials
from Pakistan and India made little progress Friday in stopping a
Kashmir-related border dispute in which 13 soldiers have been
killed in 10 days.
	   The talks produced a meager agreement to continue discussions at
the next round of peace talks. Expectations had been low for the
talks, although officials hoped they could at least call a truce.
	   ``It is a very complicated matter and a complex situation. it
will take time to resolve it, '' Pakistani Defense Secretary
Iftikar Ali Khan told reporters when asked if an understanding had
been reached.
	   During the night, there were reports arrived of a heavy
artillery exchange on the Siachen Glacier, which forms the northern
sector of Kashmir to which both countries claim.
	   In the area of Kargil, five Indian civilians were reported
wounded by Pakistani shellfire, and India claimed it destroyed a
Pakistani bunker and a building.
	   Artillery and machine-gun fire has intensified in the last
month. India has accused Pakistani troops of trying to seize
territory on at least seven occasions. The Kashmir dispute has
bedeviled relations between the two neighbors for the 50 years
since they became independent from Britain.
	   Foreign secretary-level discussions last month on Kashmir ended
inconclusively.
	   Six days of scheduled talks began Thursday with a discussion on
using the water of the Jhelum River, which slices through Kashmir.
India's Water Resources Secretary S. Hasan said the two sides made
no headway but would meet again.
	   Other issues include a proposal to start a rail and bus service
between New Delhi and the Pakistani border city of Lahore, a
possible deal for Pakistan to sell electricity to India, and on
ways to fight terrorism and drug-trafficking.
	   India hopes progress on lesser issues can improve the atmosphere
and ease the way toward a breakthrough on Kashmir. But Pakistan
says no progress can be made without a Kashmir resolution.
	   India says 12 Pakistani soldiers and one Indian officer have
been killed in seven attempts by Pakistani units to move into
Indian-held territory on the 76-kilometer-long (47 miles) Siachen
Glacier.
	   The glacier, 600 miles (965 kilometers) north of New Delhi, is
20,000 feet (6000 meters) above sea level and is known as the
world's highest battlefield. More soldiers die from high-altitude
sickness and exposure than from enemy fire.
	   The dispute has been discussed on eight previous occasions, and
negotiators were near an agreement in 1989 to disentangle forces
and retreat to less inclement locations.
	   But a deal could not be sealed without a broader agreement on
Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, each
claiming the whole of the troubled province.
	   The Kashmir conflict assumed greater international importance in
May when India and Pakistan conducted underground atomic tests and
declared themselves nuclear powers.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee met his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif in July and agreed to resume peace
negotiations suspended in 1997. But when the talks began last
month, they yielded little more than pledges to meet again in
February.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A U.S. Army RC-12 believed to have
been carrying two people crashed near the German town of
Sommerhausen in southern Germany just Friday morning.
	   The plane burst into flames upon impact, police in nearby
Wuerzburg reported. There was no immediate word on the fate of the
occupants, said U.S. Army spokesman Capt. Martin Downie.
	   The twin-engine turbo prop was believed to have taken off from
Wiesbaden, where part of the 5th Corps is based, Downie said.
	   The plane, one of the Army's older models, carries out
reconnaissance missions, among others.

All-Spanish and All-French showdowns in UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The third round of the UEFA Cup will feature
intriguing all-French and all-Spanish encounters.
	   Friday's draw in Geneva resulted in head-to-head showdowns
between Monaco and Olympique Marseille and Real Sociedad and
Atletico Madrid.
	   Monaco and Real Sociedad will be at home for the first leg games
on Nov. 24. The second leg is scheduled for Dec. 8.
	   In past years, UEFA has separated teams from the same country in
the draw. But this time, with four teams each from France and
Spain, and at least three from Italy, it was impossible to keep
clubs apart.
	   Italian clubs, which have won seven of the last 10 UEFA Cups,
were fortunate not to have been drawn against each other.
	   Title favorite Parma was pitted against Scottish side Glasgow
Rangers, Roma against FC Zurich and Bologna vs. Real Bettis. The
first legs will be played in Glasgow, Zurich and Bologna.
	   Fiorentina, a fourth Italian club, will likely not make it into
the third round. The club's second-round, second-leg game against
Swiss side Grasshoppers was abandoned at halftime Tuesday after an
off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device thrown
from the stands in Salerno, Italy.
	   UEFA is scheduled to annouce the outcome of the game Sunday,
with Fiorentina facing the likelihood of a 3-0 forfeit defeat and
the possibility of a European ban.
	   Whichever team is selected to advance will host French club
Bordeaux in the first leg of the third round.
	   The fourth French club, Lyon, is home vs. Belgian side Brugges.
	   Liverpool, England's only survivor, was drawn against Spanish
side Celta Vigo, which eliminated English Premier League leader
Aston Villa from the competition on Tuesday. Celta is at home for
the first leg.
	   It's the first time four French clubs have reached the third
round of the UEFA Cup. A French team has never won the competition,
while Real Madrid was the last Spanish club to capture the UEFA Cup
in 1986.
	   No German clubs made it to the final 16 this year.
	   French club officials expressed frustration that Monaco and
Marseille would face each other.
	   ``Monaco is a team which is like Roma, Parma or Liverpool _ a
team we really didn't want to draw,'' Olympique Marseille's
Jean-Michel Roussier said. ``It's a shame for French soccer that we
should be together.''
	   ``It's not the worst draw but it's certainly not the best,''
Monaco vice president Max Poggi said. ``For French soccer this is
really not a good draw. It's a shame but that's the luck of the
draw.''
	   By coincidence, the same two clubs meet Friday night in an
important French league match. Marseille tops the French standings,
while Monaco is in fourth place. # (sw)

Marine fined in hit-and-run: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Marine corporal was fined 150,000 yen (dlrs
1,250) Friday in a hit-and-run last month in Okinawa that left a
Japanese man with minor injuries, Kyodo News agency said.
	   The Naha Summary Court released 22-year-old Cpl. Scotty Jackson
from Japanese jail Friday after he paid the fine for leaving the
scene of the Oct. 30 accident and for drunken driving, Kyodo said.
	   Court officials refused to comment. U.S. Marine officials were
not available for comment late Friday, and Jackson's home town was
not immediately available.
	   Jackson and an Air Force staff sergeant were arrested by
Japanese police on suspicion of fleeing the scene of an accident
after their military van hit a man on a moped.
	   The accident drew national attention in Japan because it came
after another Marine was charged with drunken driving and
hit-and-run in a separate accident that killed 18-year-old Yuki
Uema, also in Okinawa.
	   The trial for Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge, 23, has been set
for Nov. 18.
	   Many Okinawans harbor hard feelings toward the heavy U.S.
military presence on the southern island, about 1,600 kilometers
(1,000 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Three-quarters of the American troops in Japan are stationed on
Okinawa. Crime is an especially touchy issue.
	   The military presence is also a major issue in the campaign for
Okinawa governor in the Nov. 15 balloting.

Police seize major drug stash en route to Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUNKIRK, France (AP) _ Customs officers seized a huge stash of
drugs _ including 400,000 tablets of ecstasy _ in a truck en route
to Britain from Germany, police said Friday.
	   Police found the drugs on Oct. 28 in a British-licensed truck
during routine checks on a highway on the outskirts of this
northern port town.
	   Of the 400,000 ecstasy tablets, the vast majority were said to
be of a new brand 100 times stronger than usual, with effects
similar to LSD.
	   The truck also was carrying 201 kilograms (442 pounds) of
cannabis resin, 220 kilograms (484 pounds) of hashish and 92
kilograms (202 pounds) of amphetamine sulphate.
	   The driver, identified only as a 59-year-old Briton, was
arrested and is in custody in Dunkirk. He denied any knowledge of
the drugs.
	   Police said he had been previously arrested in southern France
in 1990 for drug trafficking.
	   It wasn't clear why police waited until Friday to announce the
seizure.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A U.S. Army RC-12 believed to have
been carrying two people crashed near the German town of
Sommerhausen of southern Germany late Friday morning.
	   The plane was apparently on a training flight when the accident
occurred in an unpopulated area between Sommerhausen and Erlach,
the Army's 5th Corps said in a statement.
	   The plane burst into flames upon impact, police in nearby
Wuerzburg reported. There was no immediate word on the fate of the
occupants, said U.S. Army spokesman Capt. Martin Downie.
	   U.S. and Germany rescue authorities were at the scene.
	   The twin-engine turbo prop was believed to have taken off from
Wiesbaden, where part of the 5th Corps is based, Downie said.
	   The plane, one of the Army's older models, carries out
reconnaissance missions, among others.

Israel says it will stop theft of Lebanese soil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Israeli army has taken measures to
stop the stealing by Israeli civilians of fertile soil in southern
Lebanon, a U.N. peacekeeping force spokesman said Friday.
	   The Israeli army has confirmed that Israeli civilians were
removing soil from an Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon and
carting them back home for civilian use, Timur Goksel, spokesman
for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, said.
	   The UNIFIL was informed by the Israeli army that it has
``already taken measures to prevent recurrence of such actions,''
Goksel said in a statement.
	   Israel had earlier dismissed reports of the soil theft as
``nonsense.'' Lebanon protested to the United Nations, the European
Union and the Arab League.
	   Lebanese soil is said to be richer than northern Israel's as the
farmlands of south Lebanon are little cultivated because of the
conflict between Israeli and guerrilla forces.
	   Lebanon has in the past accused Israel of stealing its water and
using south Lebanon to test missiles.

Barrett leads in penultimate U.S. LPGA event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANNO, Japan (AP) _ Tina Barrett tied her career-best score of
7-under-par 65 Friday and took a two-stroke lead in the opening
round of the dlrs 800,000 Japan Classic, the next-to-last official
U.S. LPGA tournament.
	   Barrett, of Scottsdale, Arizona, sank seven birdies in a
bogey-free trek over the 6,338-yard (5,768-meter), par-72
Musashigaoka Golf Club course near Tokyo.
	   She earlier posted a 65 during the second round of the 1995
Oldsmobile Classic.
	   ``I'm happy with today's round,'' said Barrett, in contention
for her first title since winning the Mitsubishi Motors Ocean State
Open in 1989. ``I was hitting the ball close and that kept me in
the game.''
	   Janny Lidback, of Houston, Texas, shot a 67 to share second
place with Huang Yu-chen of Taiwan.
	   Hiromi Kobayashi, winner of the Rainbow Foods LPGA Classic in
August, and Nayoko Yoshikawa, winner of 29 titles on the Japan
tour, were another stroke back at 68.
	   The Japan Classic is a limited-field event featuring 45 of the
top players from the U.S. LPGA Tour and 38 members of the Japan
LPGA Tour.
	   Annika Sorenstam, who leads the race for U.S. LPGA's Player of
the Year points and the season money list, has skipped the
tournament.
	   So did rookie sensation Pak Se-ri, who has already clinched the
1998 Rolex Rookie of the Year honors.
	   The 21-year-old South Korean, forced to withdraw due to illness
and fatigue, will have only the Tour Championship in her bid to
overcome her 185.99-225.89 deficit against Sorenstam in the points
race.
	   The field at Hanno includes Sweden's Liselotte Neumann, who
hopes to defend her title. She turned in a 72 Friday.
	   Neumann has had a successful history at the Japan Classic,
finishing seventh or better in five out of eight tries, including
her victory last year and in 1991.
	   LPGA Hall of Famer Betsy King, winner of back-to-back Japan
Classic titles in 1992 and 1993, also went around in 72.
	   Akiko Fukushima, who was paired with King, shot a 73. The
25-year-old Fukushima, Japan's top money winner in the last two
seasons, has just qualified for the U.S. tour.

 &UR; EDs: NEW grafs 5-10 with Russia official saying the countries still
disagree on tax issues, EU delegation discussing humanitarian aid. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States and Russia were likely to reach
a food aid agreement Friday, though Moscow has balked at some
American demands, Russian officials said.
	   A U.S. delegation has been in Moscow all week for negotiations
on a plan to deliver 3.1 million metric tons of American food to
help see Russia through the long winter.
	   However, the Americans are worried about possible corruption,
and want strict guidelines on how the food is distributed. This
prevented an agreement Thursday, but a deal was still likely
Friday, Vladimir Scherbak, the first deputy agriculture minister,
told the Interfax news agency.
	   Some of the U.S. guidelines were ``utterly unacceptable to
Russia,'' he said.
	   The United States wants the food aid exempted from taxes and
import duties, and the two sides still had disagreements Friday on
``tax matters,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, who has
led the Russian delegation.
	   The Americans also have insisted that profits from food aid sold
by the Russian government go to the country's Pension Fund, which
is chronically short of cash. As a result, many retirees have to
wait months to receive their pension money.
	   Kulik said that issue had been resolved.
	   ``We are ready to give (the money) to the Pension Fund and spend
it on social programs,'' he was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael Hurley said Thursday evening that
``there were just a couple of loose ends'' in the negotiations. He
did not elaborate on the negotiations.
	   In another development, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
discussed possible humanitarian aid with a European Commission
delegation. The talks were described as preliminary and no details
were announced.
	   Russia's economic crisis, along with shrinking food imports and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years, has raised concerns about
possible food shortages.
	   Store shelves remain well-stocked, but food prices have risen
sharply in recent months and poor Russians may not be able to
afford what's available.
	   Under the aid plan, about half the U.S. food would be provided
for free. The other half would be sold to Russia for around dlrs
500 million under a 20-year loan. The shipments would include
wheat, corn, soybeans, meat and produce.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Revenue from tourists slump 28.8 percent in the first nine months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Tourist spending slumped 28.8 percent to 39.4
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.0 billion) in the first nine
months of this year, compared with the same period in 1997, the
Hong Kong Tourist Association said Friday.
	   The decline was due to a 12.2 percent drop in tourist arrivals
to 6.95 million visitors because of Asia's economic crisis.
	   Hong Kong's strong currency, which is linked to the U.S. dollar,
has made Hong Kong very expensive for many tourists from Southeast
Asian countries.
	   According to the Tourist Association, visitors from Taiwan were
the biggest spenders, spending 7.686 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 985 million) in the first nine months of this year. That
figure, however, was down 17.9 percent from a year earlier.
	   For all visitors, average spending fell 19.9 percent to 5,440
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 697) a person.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A U.S. Army RC-12 carrying two people
crashed near the German town of Sommerhausen in southern Germany
late Friday morning.
	   The plane was apparently on a training flight with two pilots on
board when it crashed in an unpopulated area between Sommerhausen
and Erlach, the Army's 5th Corps said in a statement.
	   The plane burst into flames upon impact, police in nearby
Wuerzburg reported. There was no immediate word on the fate of the
occupants, said U.S. Army spokesman Capt. Martin Downie.
	   U.S. and Germany rescue authorities are at the scene.
	   The twin-engine turbo prop was believed to have taken off from
Wiesbaden, where part of the 5th Corps is based, Downie said.
	   The plane, one of the Army's older models, carries out
reconnaissance missions, among others.

UEFA to decide on Fiorentina-Grasshoppers match Sunday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from clubs, UEFA. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's control and disciplinary body
will decide Sunday what action to take over the explosion that
caused the suspension of a match between Fiorentina and
Grasshoppers of Switzerland, the European body said Friday.
	   ``It will be a difficult decision to take,'' said Gerhard
Aigner, UEFA general secretary. ``We have to make a decision that
makes sense in the context of football.''
	   UEFA representatives asked the referee not to start the second
half of Tuesday's second-round second leg UEFA Cup match after an
off-field official was injured by the blast from a device hurled
from the stands.
	   Melo Governato, sports director of Fiorentina, said he was
confident ``everything will turn out all right. We could do nothing
about the incident. We consider it a terrorist act by one person.
It has nothing to do with sports. It was just a mad person.''
	   Fred Bickel, Grasshoppers' technical coordinator, said, ``It's a
bit idiotic what happened.''
	   The game was being played in Salerno, near Naples, following the
suspension of Fiorentina's own ground and to raise funds for the
victims of recent flooding in southern Italy.
	   ``The investigation is ongoing,'' Aigner told reporters.
``Evidence still has to be produced. For the moment it is still
unclear who the culprit is.''
	   Police in Salerno have questioned an unidentified local man who
is a suspect, according to Italian newspapers.
	   Although playing away from home Fiorentina still was considered
responsible for the fans' behavior in Salerno and could face a ban
from European competition of one or more seasons and a 3-0 forfeit
defeat.

Israel says it will stop theft of Lebanese soil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Israeli army has taken measures to
stop the stealing by Israeli civilians of fertile soil in southern
Lebanon, a U.N. peacekeeping force spokesman said Friday.
	   The Israeli army has confirmed that Israeli civilians were
removing soil from an Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon and
carting them back home for civilian use, Timur Goksel, spokesman
for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, said.
	   The UNIFIL was informed by the Israeli army that it has
``already taken measures to prevent recurrence of such actions,''
Goksel said in a statement.
	   Israel had earlier dismissed reports of the soil theft as
``nonsense.'' Lebanon protested to the United Nations, the European
Union and the Arab League.
	   Lebanese soil is said to be richer than northern Israel's as the
farmlands of south Lebanon are little cultivated because of the
conflict between Israeli and guerrilla forces.
	   Lebanon has in the past accused Israel of stealing its water and
using south Lebanon to test missiles.

Spanish Cabinet Mulls Approving Pinochet Extradition Request
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID (AP) _ The Spanish Cabinet was expected Friday to approve
a request to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
from Britain to face charges of genocide.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose warrant against the 82-year-old
Pinochet led to the ex-despot's arrest Oct. 16 in London, this week
passed on an extradition request to the Spanish government.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government has criticized
Garzon's probe into human rights crimes committed in Chile under
Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule and in Argentina, saying he lacks
jurisdiction.
	   But Aznar and other government officials have said they would
pass on an extradition request to Britain if they received one,
calling the affair a matter for courts to decide.
	   Spain's National Court ruled last week that the Spanish justice
system does in fact have jurisdiction to try crimes like those
cited against Pinochet.
	   An official Chilean government report says more than 3,000
suspected leftists were killed or disappeared during his 17-year
rule.
	   The court said there are grounds to try Pinochet for genocide
because he allegedly tried to eliminate an entire group of people _
his political opponents _ and that under Spanish law, Spanish
courts can prosecute genocide no matter where it occurred.
	   Pinochet cannot be tried in Chile because he has a immunity as a
senator for life, a job he created in a constitution he guided to
enactment before stepping down in 1990.
	   Approval by the Spanish Cabinet would leave Pinochet's fate in
Britain's hands.
	   After Pinochet's arrest, the English High Court ruled that it
was illegal because he is entitled to immunity as a former head of
state.
	   A five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords is hearing an
appeal and is expected to rule next week.
	   If the panel rejects the High Court decision, Pinochet could be
handed over to Spanish authorities. Should it uphold the earlier
decision, the former dictator will most likely be free to fly home.

Former Chechen officials calls for Islamic law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former top Chechen official called Friday for
abolishing secular laws in the breakaway republic and introducing
only Islamic statutes, a news report said Friday.
	   Former Foreign Minister Movladi Udugov was sacked recently after
he accused President Aslan Maskhadov of keeping too-close ties with
Russia.
	   Udugov called Friday for distancing his republic even more from
Moscow by introducing Shariah, or Islamic law, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``Secular and western state models are not suitable for
Chechnya,'' Udugov told a news conference.
	   Most Chechens practice a moderate version of Islam, and the
republic has introduced Shariah courts. But Chechnya also has some
secular laws.
	   The mixture has caused a ``severe constitutional crisis that may
lead to total chaos,'' Udugov was quoted as saying.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew two years ago. But no country has recognized its
independence, and Moscow insists the territory is still part of
Russia.
	   Meanwhile, conflict has been brewing within Chechnya in recent
months, with leading opposition figures demanding that Maskhadov
resign.
	   Salman Raduyev, a rebellious warlord convicted of attempting a
coup against Maskhadov, said the ruling meant that ``a civil war
has actually started in Chechnya.''
	   Raduyev, who was tried in absentia, was sentenced earlier this
week by a Shariah court, but he remained at large Friday and said
he had no intention of obeying, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Raduyev, a field commander in the 1994-96 war for independence
with Russia, has lately been rallying the country's opposition
around the demand for Maskhadov's resignation.
	   Raduyev said he planned no retaliation for the sentence against
him, but has increased the number of his bodyguards and will fight
any attempts to arrest him, ITAR-Tass reported.

Turkish, Azeri delegations discuss Caspian Sea oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish and Azeri delegations met in
Turkey on Friday to put the final touches on agreements for the
construction of a pipeline that would carry Caspian Sea oil to a
Turkish Mediterranean port.
	   Under the agreements, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, whose
territory the pipeline would cross, give official consent to the
project.
	   ``We expect to finalize the host-country and inter-governmental
agreements by next week,'' Yurdakul Yigitguden, undersecretary of
the energy ministry, said. ``We want them to be realized as soon as
possible.''
	   The pipeline will run from the Azeri capital Baku to Turkey's
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, via Georgia.
	   Representatives from an international oil consortium, that will
chose the export route for the oil, were also taking part in the
meeting in Istanbul, Yigitguden said.
	   Turkey and four former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan, Kazakstan,
Uzbekistan and Georgia, signed a declaration in Ankara on Oct. 29
supporting the Turkish route, which is backed by the United States.
	   The consortium is expected to announce its decision next month.
	   The main alternative to Baku-Ceyhan is an existing pipeline from
Baku to the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa, from where the oil
would be transferred in tankers through the Bosporus.
	   Russia is also vying for pipelines to traverse its territory.
	   Turkey opposes routes through Bosporus, a narrow waterway
bisecting Istanbul, fearing tanker collisions.

Guerrillas to establish civilian rule on rebel territory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Showing their dissatisfaction with
the Kosovo peace process, ethnic Albanian rebels said Friday they
intend to establish their own civilian rule in territory they
control in the province.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the Kosovo Liberation
Army said its military command had decided to form local government
institutions, disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic
Albanian political leaders.
	   ``The purpose is to ease our army of the burden of civilian
administration in populated areas,'' the guerrillas' statement
read, adding that such a move was needed in present conditions of
war in Kosovo.
	   The move signals defiance toward not only the Serbs but also
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and international officials
who are trying to broker a joint political solution on self-rule
for the separatist province.
	   The KLA has accused Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders of
trying to sell short their goal of independence for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   Showing more support for the U.S.-led peace process, Rugova
noted Friday that Kosovo refugees are slowly returning to the homes
they fled in the fighting and are beginning to rebuild their
shattered lives.
	   ``There are first signs of life,'' he told reporters in
Pristina, three days after touring Kosovo's countryside for the
first time in nine years. ``There is a great willingness on the
part of the people to get back to their homes and properties. They
should be offered a bit of sense of security.''
	   Rugova voiced hope that the 2,000-strong international
monitoring mission led by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe will provide that sense of safety. The
mission is expected to be launched later this month.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, involved in shuttle
diplomacy between Belgrade and Pristina, was back in Kosovo Friday.
	   Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia,
said in Belgrade Thursday that the talks were producing hopeful
signs despite occasional skirmishes in Kosovo.
	   ``We are working with Ambassador Hill on an interim agreement
for Kosovo... and the forming of an independent Kosovo police force
which will reflect the ethnic structure and which would work with
the help of the international community,'' Rugova said.
	   There are new signs of defiance this week by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose government rejected attempts by the U.N.
war crimes tribunal to come investigate charges of war crimes and
atrocities against civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louse Arbour.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, on Friday, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the alliance ``strongly supports Mrs. Arbour's
request.''
	   He called on Milosevic to cooperate fully with the international
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in accordance with its
obligations under U.N. Security Council resolution 1203.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa, (AP) _ Rwandan Vice President Paul
Kagame acknowledged Friday that Rwandan troops were in the Congo.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, says the admission
``removes the last stumbling block'' in the process to finding
peace in the Congo.
	   Rwandan troops had been in the Congo since late August and he
was willing to negotiate a withdrawal, Kagame said.
	   Maj. Gen. Kagame refused to specify the number of troops in
Congo or to discuss their activities.
	   Kagame said Rwanda had previously refused to acknowledge its
troops were in Congo because it wanted to avoid the impression that
the problems in the Congo were caused by an invasion from other
countries.
	   He insisted Rwandan troops moved into Congo well after the start
of the rebellion on August 2.
	   Kagame said he supports efforts to end the war.
	   ``The process is to find a solution. We support that process, to
have a cease-fire, a standstill of all troops and then negotiate a
settlement,'' he said.
	   Talks should include Congolese president Laurent Kabila and his
government, the Congolese rebels and all other countries involved
in the conflict, Kagame told reporters after meeting with Mandela.
	   ``We've informed President Mandela that we are there (Congo) to
defend Rwanda's national security,'' said Kagame.
	   Hutu rebels driven from Rwanda by Kagame's predominantly Tutsi
Rwandan Patriotic Front after the genocide in 1994, continued to
stage hit and run attacks on Rwanda from bases inside Congo.
	   Mandela said after recent talks ``many felt that the fact that
Rwanda did not admit they were combatants created immense
difficulty in moving forward.''
	   He said Rwanda had been under pressure from United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan and the organization of African unity
to acknowledge its presence in Congo.
	   Mandela said Rwanda's admission opens the way for talks and
improves chances for a cease-fire and for talks that will lead to
an end to the war and to free elections in Congo.
	   Rebels accuse Kabila of corruption, mismanagement and stirring
up ethnic rivalries. Since the fighting began in August, several
border nations have entered the fray.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have sent troops to help Kabila.
Fearing an escalation in the fighting, the United States sent Susan
Rice, the top State Department official for African affairs, to
help find a solution.

EU welcomes Turkish resumption of dialogue; will review new aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission welcomed on
Friday Turkey's move to normalize ties with the European Union but
reiterated Ankara must still improve its human rights record if it
wants to join the EU.
	   Turkey's decision may encourage the EU foreign ministers, who
meet here Monday, to approve dlrs 180 million for industrial
development projects in Turkey and enable Ankara to make full use
of a 1995 customs union with the EU.
	   ``We are pleased Turkey plans to resume its dialogue with the
EU,'' said EU spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan.
	   She added, however, the EU remained clearly of the view Ankara
must do more to improve human rights.
	   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Thursday ``the road
toward developing our relations has opened'' after the EU
Commission added Turkey to a group of 11 countries negotiating
membership in a report assessing entry chances of each country.
	   Turkey is not an immediate candidate because of an economy
incompatible with that of Europe, a shaky human rights record and
territorial disputes with EU member Greece. Last December, the EU
agreed not to begin membership talks leading Turkey to freeze
relations.
	   At their monthly meeting Monday, the 15 EU foreign ministers
will debate two aid schemes for Turkey, totaling dlrs 180 million.
	   The funds, worth 150 million European currency units, would
underpin a strategy, adopted by the EU leaders in June, to pull
Turkey closer without giving it EU membership any day soon.
	   One package, worth 15 million ecus (dlrs 18 million), is
designed to improve Turkey's chances of benefiting from a customs
union by helping it to make its industrial and commercial
standards, laws and practices compatible with those in the EU.
	   Another 135 million ecus (dlrs 162 million) would be for help
and know-how in energy, telecommunications, industrial
diversification, transport, private sector restructuring and
cooperation to promote democracy and human rights.
	   EU sources said they do not expect Greece to veto the measure.
In 1995, Athens blocked an aid package worth 375 million ecus (dlrs
450 million) accompanying the EU-Turkey customs union.

 &UR; Israel says it will stop theft of Lebanese soil &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Israeli army has taken measures to
stop the stealing by Israeli civilians of fertile soil in southern
Lebanon, a U.N. peacekeeping force spokesman said Friday.
	   The Israeli army has confirmed that Israeli civilians were
removing soil from an Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon and
carting them back home for civilian use, Timur Goksel, spokesman
for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, said.
	   The UNIFIL was informed by the Israeli army that it has
``already taken measures to prevent recurrence of such actions,''
Goksel said in a statement.
	   Israel had earlier dismissed reports of the soil theft as
``nonsense.'' Lebanon protested to the United Nations, the European
Union and the Arab League.
	   Lebanese soil is said to be richer than northern Israel's as the
farmlands of south Lebanon are little cultivated because of the
conflict between Israeli and guerrilla forces.
	   Lebanon has in the past accused Israel of stealing its water and
using south Lebanon to test missiles.

Japan's Mitsubishi Motors announces major restructuring

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced a global
restructuring drive Friday that will include major job cuts in the
United States and Thailand, factory closures in Japan and a steep
reduction in production.
	   Mitsubishi, one of Japan's biggest automakers, will lay off
1,000 workers at subsidiaries in Illinois and California, which now
employ 5,100 workers, as well as 1,200 of its 4,000 employees in
Thailand, said company president Katsuhiko Kawasoe.
	   The company will also reduce the number of its car models by 40
percent and close two plants in Japan, Kawasoe told reporters.
	   Mitsubishi said it hopes to cut costs by 350 billion yen (dlrs 3
billion) by 2001 and return to profitability after suffering huge
losses from Japan's recession and the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``The economic situation is very severe, but we have to do our
utmost to return to profitability as soon as possible,'' Kawasoe
said.
	   Mitsubishi reported heavy losses Friday for the first half of
the current fiscal year ended Sept. 30, posting a net loss of 28.64
billion yen (dlrs 243 million). It posted a profit of 8.60 billion
yen (dlrs 73 million) for the same period last year.
	   Mitsubishi said it had been hit hardest in Japan by a sharp fall
in consumer demand for cars and stiffer competition among
automakers. It said that the economic turmoil in Asia also sharply
cut into the profitability of its overseas operations.
	   Mitsubishi announced that it would cut 700 jobs at its
Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America plant in Illinois, which
makes the Galant, Eclipse and Eclipse Spider convertible models.
The subsidiary now employs about 3,900 workers.
	   Three hundred jobs, or 25 percent of the employees at Mitsubishi
Motor Sales of America in California, will also be cut.
	   Mitsubishi said it aims to return to profitability on a group
level by the fiscal year ending March 2001, in which it hopes to
post a group profit of 20 billion yen (dlrs 170 million) on sales
of 4 trillion yen (dlrs 34.90 billion).
	   In fiscal 1997, ending in March this year, Mitsubishi posted a
group loss of 101.9 billion yen (dlrs 864 million).

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A U.S. Army RC-12 carrying two people
crashed near the German town of Sommerhausen in southern Germany
late Friday morning, killing a pilot, a U.S. Army spokesman in
Wuerzburg said.
	   Rescuers were searching for the other pilot on board.
	   The plane was on a training flight when it crashed in an
unpopulated area between Sommerhausen and Erlach, the Army's 5th
Corps said in a statement.
	   The plane burst into flames upon impact, police in nearby
Wuerzburg reported.
	   U.S. and Germany rescue authorities are at the scene.
	   The twin-engine turbo prop was believed to have taken off from
Wiesbaden, where part of the 5th Corps is based, another Army
spokesman said. The plane, one of the Army's older models, carries
out reconnaissance missions, among others.

U.N. rights panel calls on Japan to cut back death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Japan should move to cut back on crimes punishable
by the death penalty and improve conditions for prisoners on death
row, a key U.N. rights panel said Friday.
	   The U.N. Human Rights Committee also took Japan to task for
using popularity to justify some policies.
	   ``We identified easily some points where legislation and
practice has to improve,'' the head of the committee, Christine
Chanet, said as the panel presented its final conclusions.
	   The 18-member committee reviewing adherence to the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights last week considered Japan's
latest report.
	   Chanet said then she was disappointed that the Japanese
delegation defended the country's use of the death penalty on the
grounds that public opinion supported it.
	   ``Protection of human rights and human rights standards are not
determined by popularity polls,'' the committee said in its final
conclusions.
	   Members said they were ``gravely concerned'' Japan had not
reduced the number of crimes punishable by the death penalty, and
recommended it be limited to only the most serious crimes while
measures are taken to abolish it.
	   The panel criticized ``undue restrictions on visits and
correspondence'' to prisoners on death row and failures to notify
families and lawyers of executed prisoners.
	   Although welcoming moves toward gender equality, the committee
said it was still concerned at some laws, including the different
age of marriage for women and men and discrimination against
children born out of wedlock.
	   It also deplored a high incidence of domestic violence and rape
against women ``and the absence of any remedial measures to
eradicate this practice.''
	   Chanet last week said she felt ``a little frustration'' at
Japan's position.

GaultMillau's chef of year mixes modern and family style
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Guy Martin, chef of the opulent Paris restaurant Le
Grand Vefour, was already celebrating when he learned that the
GaultMillau guidebook had named him chef of the year.
	   ``It was the day of my seventh anniversary at the restaurant so
I was already in a good mood,'' Martin said Friday, two days after
getting the news.
	   For Martin, originally from the French Alps region, the
distinction rewards cooking that he describes as ``modern yet
familial.''
	   The restaurant, which looks out onto the gardens of the Palais
Royal on Paris' Right Bank, was also elevated in the GaultMillau's
1999 edition to its highest rating of 19/20.
	   Second in influence only to the red Michelin guide, the
GaultMillau rates 8,000 restaurants and hotels on a scale of 1-19.
	   Martin's cooking is influenced by recipes from his native Alps
region, but he also takes inspiration from Asian and Middle Eastern
palates. At the moment, his favorite dish is a filet of sole with
preserved lemon and middle eastern spices. For dessert? Martin
suggests a sweet artichoke tart.

Italy's inflation rate at 1.7 percent in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's year-on-year inflation rate stood at 1.7
percent in October, in line with markets and government
expectations.
	   It compared to an inflation rate of 1.8 percent in September and
1.6 percent in October 1997.
	   The figures were realesed on Friday by the state statistical
institute, which also reported a 0.2 percent rise in Italy's
consumer price index in October from the previous month.
	   The October rise was mostly due to an increase in the price of
recreational and leisure-time items, including soccer tickets.

	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government has criticized
Garzon's probe into human rights crimes committed in Chile under
Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule and in Argentina, saying he lacks
jurisdiction.
	   But Aznar and other government officials had said that they
would pass on an extradition request to Britain if they received
one, calling the affair a matter for courts to decide.
	   Spain's National Court ruled last week that the Spanish justice
system does in fact have jurisdiction to try crimes like those
cited against Pinochet.
	   The court said there are grounds to try Pinochet for genocide
because he allegedly tried to eliminate an entire group of people _
his political opponents _ and that under Spanish law, Spanish
courts can prosecute genocide no matter where it occurred.

	   An official Chilean government report says more than 3,000
people died or disappeared under Pinochet's rule as he tried to
crush a perceived communist threat.
	   Pinochet cannot be tried in Chile because he has a immunity as a
senator for life, a job he created in a constitution he guided to
enactment before stepping down in 1990.
	   The approval by the Spanish Cabinet leaves Pinochet's fate in
Britain's hands.
	   After Pinochet's arrest, the English High Court ruled that it
was illegal because he is entitled to immunity as a former head of
state.
	   A five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords is hearing an
appeal.
	   If the panel rejects the High Court decision, Pinochet could be
handed over to Spanish authorities. Should it uphold the earlier
decision, the former dictator will most likely be free to fly home.

Spanish Cabinet Approves Pinochet Extradition Request
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines urgent series, minor edits &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government on Friday approved a
request for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to be
extradited from Britain to face charges of genocide.
	   The approval was announced by government spokesman Josep Pique
at a news conference after a cabinet meeting.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose warrant against the 82-year-old
Pinochet led to the ex-despot's arrest in London October 16, passed
on an extradition request to the Spanish government this week.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government has criticized
Garzon's probe into human rights crimes committed in Chile under
Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule and in Argentina, saying he lacks
jurisdiction.
	   But Aznar and other government officials had said that they
would pass on an extradition request to Britain if they received
one, calling the affair a matter for courts to decide.
	   Spain's National Court ruled last week that the Spanish justice
system does in fact have jurisdiction to try crimes like those
cited against Pinochet.
	   The court said there are grounds to try Pinochet for genocide
because he allegedly tried to eliminate an entire group of people _
his political opponents _ and that under Spanish law, Spanish
courts can prosecute genocide no matter where it occurred.
	   An official Chilean government report says more than 3,000
people died or disappeared under Pinochet's rule as he tried to
crush a perceived communist threat.
	   Pinochet cannot be tried in Chile because he has a immunity as a
senator for life, a job he created in a constitution he guided to
enactment before stepping down in 1990.
	   The approval by the Spanish Cabinet leaves Pinochet's fate in
Britain's hands.
	   After Pinochet's arrest, the English High Court ruled that it
was illegal because he is entitled to immunity as a former head of
state.
	   A five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords is hearing an
appeal.
	   If the panel rejects the High Court decision, Pinochet could be
handed over to Spanish authorities. Should it uphold the earlier
decision, the former dictator will most likely be free to fly home.

Rwanda acknowledges its troops in Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore overline &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Combines urgent series, Minor editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa, (AP) _ Rwandan Vice President Paul
Kagame acknowledged Friday that Rwandan troops were in the Congo.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela, says the admission
``removes the last stumbling block'' in the process to finding
peace in the Congo.
	   Rwandan troops had been in the Congo since late August and he
was willing to negotiate a withdrawal, Kagame said.
	   Maj. Gen. Kagame refused to specify the number of troops in
Congo or to discuss their activities.
	   Kagame said Rwanda had previously refused to acknowledge its
troops were in Congo because it wanted to avoid the impression that
the problems in the Congo were caused by an invasion from other
countries.
	   He insisted Rwandan troops moved into Congo well after the start
of the rebellion on August 2.
	   Kagame said he supports efforts to end the war.
	   ``The process is to find a solution. We support that process, to
have a cease-fire, a standstill of all troops and then negotiate a
settlement,'' he said.
	   Talks should include Congolese president Laurent Kabila and his
government, the Congolese rebels and all other countries involved
in the conflict, Kagame told reporters after meeting with Mandela.
	   ``We've informed President Mandela that we are there (Congo) to
defend Rwanda's national security,'' said Kagame.
	   Hutu rebels driven from Rwanda by Kagame's predominantly Tutsi
Rwandan Patriotic Front after the genocide in 1994, continued to
stage hit and run attacks on Rwanda from bases inside Congo.
	   Mandela said after recent talks ``many felt that the fact that
Rwanda did not admit they were combatants created immense
difficulty in moving forward.''
	   He said Rwanda had been under pressure from United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan and the organization of African unity
to acknowledge its presence in Congo.
	   Mandela said Rwanda's admission opens the way for talks and
improves chances for a cease-fire and for talks that will lead to
an end to the war and to free elections in Congo.
	   Rebels accuse Kabila of corruption, mismanagement and stirring
up ethnic rivalries. Since the fighting began in August, several
border nations have entered the fray.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have sent troops to help Kabila.
Fearing an escalation in the fighting, the United States sent Susan
Rice, the top State Department official for African affairs, to
help find a solution.

Small explosion damages labor office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A small explosion damaged the entrance of
a government labor office early Friday, but there were no injuries,
police said.
	   Police said the makeshift explosive device consisted of four
small propane gas canisters, two of which went off in the
explosion.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, which was similar
to more than 100 other blasts this year. Most have been claimed by
obscure leftist groups and have targeted cars, government offices,
policemen and foreign businesses.
	   The labor office is responsible for paying unemployment benefits
and registering migrant workers.

Russia, Brazil, three other teams fined for baggy shirts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Russia, Brazil and three other women's volleyball
teams were fined dlrs 3,000 each Friday for overly baggy shirts
that failed to meet the new uniform standards for international
competitions.
	   The control committee for the Women's World Volleyball
Championship 1998 said the national teams from Bulgaria, Croatia
and Italy were also fined for wearing shirts that were ``too loose
and baggy.''
	   The fine will be deducted from each team's prize money, it said.
	   The board of administration for FIVB, volleyball's world
governing body, approved in March a new standard for uniforms,
calling for tight one-piece or one-piece-like uniforms in a bid to
emphasize the sport's power and speed.
	   Also on Friday, the FIVB named host Japan, Cuba, South Korea,
Peru and Thailand as candidates for the Volleyball Uniform Fashion
Award to be given for the ``new volleyball look.''
	   The preliminary round in the 16-team women's competition ended
Thursday. It continues Saturday for a three-day quarterfinal round,
to be followed by the semifinals and placement finals next
Wednesday and Thursday.
	   The 24-team men's tournament will start Nov. 13 in six cities
across Japan.

Government denies report that Blair gives up on England bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Government ministers said Friday they remain fully
committed to England's bid for the 2006 World Cup, denying a report
that the country had given up hope of staging soccer's showpiece
event.
	   The Financial Times reported Friday that Prime Minister Tony
Blair has withdrawn his active support for the bid because FIFA
president Sepp Blatter was backing South Africa's candidacy.
	   Blatter told Blair in London last week that Africa, which has
never staged the World Cup, was the ``logical'' choice for the 2006
tournament _ provided that the facilities, transport, security and
accomodations were up to scratch.
	   The Financial Times said Blair's closest aides have advised him
to distance himself from the bid amid ``signs of growing confusion
over the status of England's application'' to hold the world's
largest single sports event.
	   The newspaper said the government was now relying on junior
ministers, such as Sports Minister Tony Banks, to work alongside
the 2006 campaign.
	   ``Other ministers can do their bit but the prime minister
doesn't want to be too close to something likely to go the wrong
way,'' an unidentified government member was quoted as saying.
	   Banks went on television and radio to deny the report as
``absolutely absurd.''
	   ``He (Blatter) also said to the Prime Minister that he thought
England's bid was a very strong one and a very competitive one and
I can tell you this, the Prime Minister was hugely encouraged by
what Sepp Blatter said,'' Banks said.
	   Chris Smith, the cabinet minister in charge of sport, also
dismissed the newspaper report and reaffirmed the government's
support for the bid.
	   ``The whole government. ... are putting our full backing behind
the 2006 bid,'' he said.
	   Smith said Blatter stressed that South Africa had to meet strict
conditions regarding facilities and infrastructure.
	   ``Right now that isn't the case,'' Smith said. ``We have those
things in place. We believe we are still in there with a very good
chance.''
	   England bid director Alec McGivan said Major was offering his
``total'' support for the campaign.
	   ``The Government have been strong supporters of the bid and will
continue to be,'' he said. ``The Prime Minister has personally been
a fantastic friend to the bid and he will continue to play an
enormous role in the next 15 months as we build up to the decision
as to who gets the 2006 World Cup.''
	   The winner will be selected in March 2000 after a vote by a
24-member FIFA committee.
	   Apart from South Africa and England, Germany has also entered a
bidf. Blatter said he also expects bids from Brazil, Morocco,
Nigeria and Egypt.

Prosecutor questions veteran coach Trapattoni
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ The Turin prosecutor investigating alleged
drug use in Italy's Serie A on Friday questioned veteran coach
Giovanni Trapattoni.
	   Trapattoni, current coach of Fiorentina and former coach of such
soccer powerhouses as Juventus of Turin, Internazionale of Milan
and Bayern Munich, told reporters after the questioning by
prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello that ``it was a pleasant chat about
soccer in Italy and Germany.''
	   ``I think soccer is a clean sport, which must be safeguarded,''
he added, without elaborating.
	   Trapattoni was the latest in a series of soccer officials,
players and team doctors questioned by Guariniello in relation to
the alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs in Italian sports.
	   Italian soccer has been under inquiry since July when AS Roma
coach Zdenek Zeman suggested systematic drug abuse by some clubs.
	   No legal charges have been brought, but Mario Pescante resigned
as head of the Italian Olympic Commitee and Italy's major
anti-doping laboratory in Rome was ordered closed.

Floods claim two lives in Slovenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Devastating floods which engulfed
large parts of central and eastern Slovenia claimed two lives,
according to a police report Friday.
	   A 47 year-old man, from Velenje, near the Italian border,
slipped into a gushing stream and drowned late Thursday, while
another unidentified victim was supected to have drowned trying to
pull to safety valuables from a cellar.
	   At least one person died during flood in Romania. A 73-year-old
woman died Thursday in the village of Teceu near the Ukrainian
border after she suffered a heart attack, shocked by her house
being submerged, doctors said.
	   Supplies of drinking water, food and tents arrived in the
stricken area Friday. Local authorities estimate damage at 11.2
billion lei (dlrs 1.1 million).
	   One village, Poiana de sub Munte, was still cut off. Two army
helicopters were to fly to isolated villages.
	   In Slovenia, the floods, which rose up to a half-meter (nearly
two feet), followed several days of heavy rains which destroyed
hundreds of homes and closed main traffic corridors.
	   There were no estimates regarding the damage, but the government
approved funds for the reparation of destroyed infrastructure in an
emergency session.
	   The area of Celje, northeast of the capital of Ljubljana,
suffered the most severe damage. About 2,000 firemen and rescue
teams were sent to help thousands of people whose houses were
flooded Thursday. Most were still on hand Friday although
conditions were reported to be slightly improving.
	   Water flowed through streets and filled houses, factories and
hospitals in the Celje region, while a number of local roads,
closed to traffic due to floods or slides, remained blocked Friday.
	   Road and rail links between Ljubljana and the northern city of
Maribor, however, were reopend and several other areas blacked-out
had their electricity and water restored.
	   Earlier, the Hungarian state news agency MTI reported that
children and elderly people have been evacuated from four
communities along the Tisza river in Hungary in what was seen as a
purely precautionary move.

Israel's parliament speaker praises Bulgaria for saving Jews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The speaker of the Knesset, Israel's
parliament, Friday praised Bulgaria for saving its Jews from Nazi
concentration camps in World War II and remaining free of
anti-Semitism.
	   ``Unlike other states in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria has never seen
anti-Semitism,'' Dan Tihon said. ``Jews have always been an organic
part of the life of Bulgarian society.''
	   Tihon addressed Bulgarian lawmakers in a session commemorating
Dimitar Peshev, a Bulgarian lawmaker who played a key role in
saving the 48,000 Jews living in the country in 1943 from being
deported to a death camp.
	   As deputy chairman of Bulgarian parliament, Peshev vehemently
opposed plans of the then pro-fascist government to send the entire
Jewish community to Auschwitz.
	   Though an ally of Germany in the war, Bulgaria was the only
Eastern European country that prevented its Jews from being
deported to Nazi death camps.
	   ``We want to talk about Dimitar Peshev in order to build an
example in the fight against new genocides,'' said Gabriele Nissim,
whose book ``The Man Who Stopped Hitler,'' was presented at the
ceremony.
	   After 1948, Bulgarian authorities let 45,000 Jews emigrate to
Israel. The Jewish community in Bulgaria now numbers about 5,000,
most of whom live in Sofia.
	   In 1992, the Bulgarian government granted the country's Jewish
community the right to dozens of buildings nationalized by the
Communist government in the late 1950s and 1960s.
	   But roughly a third of the property hasn't changed hands yet
because of legal disputes and difficulties reaccommodating
administrative services, schools and hospitals housed there.

Turkish police clash with leftist, pro-Kurdish demonstrators

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A protest by students over state control
of higher education turned violent Friday when police clashed with
a pro-Kurdish students who unfolded flags of a banned rebel Kurdish
group.
	   Riot police charged a group of about a hundred masked youths who
gathered in downtown Beyazit square. The group fled into
backstreets throwing gasoline bombs, the semi-official Anatolia
news agency said.
	   Three police officers were injured by flying stones, Anatolia
said. A number of students were detained.
	   Pro-Islamic students joined the protest, shouting slogans
against the Higher Education Board's ban on the wearing of
Islamic-style head scarves on campuses.
	   Police used water cannon to disperse the Islamic protesters.
	   The board has been criticized for measures increasing the
state's clout on universities such as appointing allegedly
pro-government deans and for enforcing a strict secularist dress
code.
	   The Kurdish rebels are fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey since 1984. Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in the
conflict.

Italy selects Holocaust movie for Oscar nomination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy on Friday selected Roberto Benigni's
tragic-comedy ``Life is Beautiful'' as its candidate for an Oscar
nomination for best foreign language film.
	   The movie, which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film
Festival last May, is the story of a father who uses desperate and
hilarious means to shield his son from the horrors of a Nazi death
camp and convince him it is all an elaborate game.
	   Benigni directed and starred in the film, called in Italian ``La
Vita e Bella.'' It is now showing in the United States.
	   Nominations for the Oscars will be announced Feb. 9 and the
awards presented March 21.

EU slows down Malta application drive; Sees mid-February review
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission told Malta
Friday it will know by mid-February _ two months later than
forecast _ if the Mediterranean island can join the European Union.
	   EU Foreign Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek told
Maltese Foreign Minister Guido de Marco his country's
off-again-on-again application has delayed pre-accession
preparations compared with other candidates.
	   ``We have to see how we can overcome that gap,'' said EU
spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan.
	   Malta first applied to join in July, 1990 but put that on hold
in October, 1996, after a change of government. The Labor
government that came to power last September has renewed the
application.
	   On Friday, Van den Broek sent de Marco home with a detailed
questionnaire on how his government plans to absorb the entire body
of EUn rules and regulations.
	   Although the European Commission declared Malta admissible as a
candidate in 1993, it must determine if that assessment is still
valid.
	   Malta has a population of only 376,000. EU figures put its 1997
unemployment and inflation rates at 4 and 3 percent respectively.
That compares favorably to the EU but Malta's per capita annual
income of dlrs 12,000 a year makes it a poor EU neighbor.
	   If it joins, Malta must adopt all EU legislation as its own. One
problem that is already evident, officials said, is that Malta has
no value added taxes, a source of EU income in each member state.

IRA man at center of U.S. extradition fight freed from prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ An Irish Republican Army
escapee at the center of a marathon legal battle to stay in the
United States was the latest convict paroled Friday under terms of
Northern Ireland's peace accord.
	   Joe Doherty, sentenced to life in abstentia for killing a
British army commando in 1980, walked free from the anti-terrorist
Maze prison, six years after losing a U.S. Supreme Court appeal
against extradition.
	   Doherty and seven IRA comrades shot their way out of Belfast's
Crumlin Road Jail during their 1981 trials, after swapping clothes
with their visiting lawyers. The others were recaptured, but
Doherty used a fake Irish passport to reach New York.
	   The FBI found and arrested Doherty working in a Manhattan bar in
1983. During his fight to stay in the United States, he won broad
support from the city's Irish-American lobby, even having a street
named after him and being honored as grand marshall of a St.
Patrick's Day parade.
	   Upon his return, he became one of the IRA's wing commanders
within the Maze prison, which has seen its population tumble ever
since eight political parties struck April's historic accord on how
Protestants and Catholics should jointly govern Northern Ireland.
	   Three of the Maze's eight H-shaped cell blocks already have
closed, with more than 200 of an eligible 450 prisoners freed in
the past two months.
	   The rest are supposed to be paroled by mid-2000 if the IRA and
rival outlawed pro-British groups maintain their cease-fires.
	   Three other IRA escapees from Northern Ireland are continuing to
fight extradition from California back to the Maze prison, from
which they and 35 other IRA members escaped in 1983. Last month in
San Francisco, the trio won the right to a retrial and bail.
	   Also Friday, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern returned to
Belfast for the second time this week to challenge the prevailing
deadlock in the peace process, meeting with Sinn Fein party leader
Gerry Adams.
	   April's agreement specified that a new cross-community
government for Northern Ireland should have begun holding summits
by now with Ahern's government.
	   But the designated head of the still-unformed Northern Ireland
government, Protestant politician David Trimble, has refused to
form one until Sinn Fein's IRA allies start disarming, an objective
in the accord that the IRA has rejected.

Planes stuck in melted asphalt on runway at new Milan hub
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The sticky resin that grounded about 20
planes at Milan's problematic Malpensa airport has been cleared
from the runway and flights are back on schedule, airport officials
said Friday.
	   One of the airport's two runways was closed Thursday after
officials discovered that a resin applied overnight had melted and
was sticking to the wheels of aircraft that landed or were trying
to take-off. The resin was applied to make the runways more visible
to pilots.
	   The head of the company that runs the airport blamed workers
that had been sub-contracted for the job and said he would report
the incident to authorities. Prosecutors in Varese, about 50
kilometers (48 miles) north of Milan, on Friday opened an
investigation into the incident.
	   Chaos has raged at the newly revamped Malpensa hub since it
opened Oct. 25.
	   For days, baggage was lost and flights were delayed for several
hours or diverted elsewhere. Escalators broke and passengers had to
walk long distances to gates. There weren't enough parking places
for planes nor shuttle buses to transport travelers from boarding
gates to the aircraft.
	   The EU transport commissioner has reportedly sent a letter to
Italy's transport ministry demanding explanations for the chaos.

Car bomb explodes; Israel suspends ratification of peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new witness quotes, Palestinian
comment, background on previous Hamas attacks. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Friday in a Jerusalem
market crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The blast
killed two, apparently the assailants, and wounded 21 Israelis. In
response, Israel's Cabinet suspended implementation of the new
peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying to
sabotage the peace accord, claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m.
(0745 GMT) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market, police said.
	   Friday's bombing marked the third time in less than three weeks
that Hamas tried, but failed, to carry out an attack with large
numbers of Israeli casualties, suggesting that a recent crackdown
by Israel and the Palestinian Authority has had an effect.
	   Palestinian officials condemned the attack, but accused Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding up
the agreement that was to give the Palestinians another 13 percent
of the West Bank.
	   In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the main
intersection at the entrance of the outdoor market, smoke coming
out of the hood and windows.
	   Rahel Zaken, who was waiting in line at a bakery to buy Sabbath
bread, turned toward the street and glimpsed the driver. ``I saw
his eyes. He looked right at me,'' said Zaken, a 23-year-old
secretary. Seconds later, an explosion shook the area.
	   ``I fell to the ground and stumbled over one of the beggars and
crawled away on my hands and legs,'' she said. She was hospitalized
after complaining of ringing in the ears.
	   Other witnesses said they heard two explosions, followed by fast
pops, like the sound of firecrackers. Israel radio said two
suitcases filled with explosives were found near the car,
suggesting the blast went off prematurely and that the assailants
had planned a more powerful explosion.
	   Israel TV said the two dead were the assailants.
	   A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay several
meters (yards) away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.
Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool of
blood.
	   In July 1997, two Islamic militants blew themselves up just a
few meters (yards) from the site of the latest explosion, killing
themselves and 16 shoppers.
	   When Friday's explosion went off, the Israeli Cabinet had just
gathered about a mile (kilometer) away, at Netanyahu's office, to
discuss the peace agreement under which Israel is to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a Palestinian campaign
against Islamic militants.
	   The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by the
Cabinet. Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said at the start of the
session that he had expected a vote later Friday.
	   However, the session broke off when word of the attack reached
the ministers. Later, the ministers decided to indefinitely suspend
the ratification process.
	   ``The government of Israel will resume the discussion of the
agreement after it verifies that the Palestinian Authority is
taking vigorous steps for a relentless fight against terrorist
organizations and their infrastructure,'' a Cabinet statement said.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat condemned the
attack, but said Israel was playing into the hands of the militants
by suspending the peace process.
	   ``I wished that the Israeli government would not point its
finger at the Palestinian Authority,'' Erekat said. ``The
Palestinian Authority is exerting the maximum effort to foil terror
and violence.''
	   The Cabinet also demanded clarifications from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on the procedure for removing sections of the PLO
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye River agreement says the Palestine National Council and
other Palestinian organizations will meet in mid-December to
``reaffirm'' a letter by Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton that
spells out the clauses being annulled.
	   Israel contends that the agreement requires the PNC to hold a
vote on the clauses.
	   The Cabinet also said it would act to strengthen Jerusalem as
Israel's capital. Bar-Illan said construction would be authorized
``in the near future'' of the controversial Jewish neighborhood of
Har Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, but would not give a
date.
	   At the scene of Friday's explosion along Jerusalem's busiest
thoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, some
frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded
market only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   A small crowd of protesters shouted, ``Death to Arabs! Death to
Arafat!''
	   Just a block away from Friday's blast, shoppers went about their
business. ``We can't stop with what we are doing when this
happens,'' one young female shopper said.

Criticism over ruling on Islamic classes in Berlin schools
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A Berlin-based Islamic group that won the right to
offer religion classes in public schools has called on the city's
divided Islamic community to unite behind the effort.
	   A Berlin court ruled Wednesday that the Islamic Federation, an
umbrella group representing 12 of 70 mosques in Berlin, had the
right to organize voluntary religious instruction in public
schools, just like Catholic and Protestant churches.
	   The decision has unleashed controversy not only from German
conservatives skeptical of moves toward what they term
``multiculturalism,'' but also from two other Islamic associations
that consider the Islamic Federation too radical.
	   Its chairman, Nail Dural, also serves as vice chairman of Milli
Gorus, a group that advocates creating an Islamic state in Turkey.
	   The liberal Turkish Union called on Berlin's Muslim parents to
keep their children out of the religion classes, which are expected
to begin when the new school term opens next August.
	   ``The Islamic Federation is not a religious organization, but a
political one,'' Turkish Union chairman Kenan Kolat told the BZ
newspaper.
	   But the court, overturning a lower court's ruling, found that
the Islamic Federation's members represented a broad enough
spectrum of Islam to qualify it to be accepted by the school system
as a religious community.
	   Religious classes are mandatory in most German states, but
voluntary in Berlin and two other states. The classes generally
deal with Catholic and Protestant teachings, however, North
Rhine-Westphalia has offered courses on Islam since 1986.
	   In Berlin, the Islamic Federation called in a statement late
Thursday on all Islamic groups to join them in ``putting together
the religion lessons and filling them with life.''
	   Although Germany has by far the largest population of foreigners
in Europe _ 7 million, including 2 million Turks _ it has long had
difficulties coming to terms with the increasingly multiethnic
nature of German society, especially in big cities like Berlin.
	   In an attempt to promote integration, Germany's newly elected
center-left government last month announced plans to make it easier
for foreigners living here to acquire German citizenship.
	   Berlin's commissioner of foreign affairs, Barbara John, welcomed
the court ruling as another step toward promoting integration and
overcoming prejudices among some Germans who view Islam as a
militant threat.
	   She also called on all three Islamic groups to form a single
group that can work out a lesson plan with school officials modeled
on those taught by the Christian churches.
	   But Berlin's conservative interior minister, Joerg Schoenbohm,
criticized the ruling as contradictory to Germany's western
cultural tradition.

Spanish government seeks Pinochet's extradition

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government said Friday it will
ask Britain to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
to Madrid so he can face charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture.
	   Approval of Judge Baltasar Garzon's extradition request for
Pinochet was announced by government spokesman Josep Pique after a
cabinet meeting.
	   Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, present at the briefing, said he
expected the request to reach the British Interior Ministry on
Tuesday.
	   Garzon, whose warrant against the 82-year-old Pinochet led to
the ex-despot's arrest Oct. 16 in London as he recovered from back
surgery, passed on a formal extradition request this week to the
Madrid government.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's administration has criticized
Garzon's probe into human rights crimes committed in Chile under
Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule and in Argentina, saying he lacks
jurisdiction.
	   But Aznar and other government officials had said that they
would pass on an extradition request to Britain if they received
one, calling the affair a matter for courts to decide.
	   Matutes reiterated this Friday.
	   ``We understand that this is a delicate matter which must be
treated with prudence,'' he said. ``But most important it is a
judicial matter. We have to respect the law and the decisions of
our judges, whether it pleases the government or not.''
	   Spain's National Court ruled last week that the Spanish justice
system does in fact have jurisdiction to try crimes such as those
Pinochet is charged with committing.
	   The court said there are grounds to try Pinochet for genocide
because he allegedly tried to eliminate an entire group of people _
his political opponents _ and that under Spanish law, Spanish
courts can prosecute genocide no matter where it occurred.
	   An official Chilean government report says more than 3,000
people died or disappeared under Pinochet's rule as he tried to
crush a perceived communist threat.
	   Pinochet cannot be tried in Chile because he has immunity as a
senator for life, a job he created in a constitution he guided to
enactment before stepping down in 1990.
	   The approval by the Spanish Cabinet leaves Pinochet's fate in
Britain's hands.
	   After Pinochet's arrest, the British High Court ruled that his
detention was illegal because he is entitled to immunity as a
former head of state.
	   A five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords is hearing an
appeal, which is expected to continue next week.
	   If the panel rejects the High Court decision, Pinochet could be
handed over to Spanish authorities. Should it uphold the earlier
decision, the former dictator would likely be free to fly home.

	   ROME (AP) _ Crowds of illegal immigrants trying to obtain a
limited number of work permits knocked down three police officers
and beat each other up Friday as they pushed to reach the front of
a long line outside a police station.
	   Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have been applying for
the 38,000 work permits Italy plans to issue in the next five weeks
under a limited amnesty decree that went into effect Wednesday.
	   The immigrants have been sleeping outside police stations to
make sure they are first in line at opening time.
	   Three police officers were injured when an unruly group of
immigrants rushed a Milan police station early Friday as it opened.
One officer broke an ankle and the others sustained cuts and
bruises.
	   The paperwork has also overwhelmed police. Italian dailies
reported Friday that many police stations had run out of
application forms and that immigrants were confused and angry.
	   To qualify for permits, immigrants need to prove they entered
the country prior to March 27 and that they have a job and place to
stay.

Youths riot in northern England on annual `bonfire night'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRADFORD, England (AP) _ About 80 youths, some armed with
gasoline bombs and fireworks rockets, clashed with riot police in
two northern cities after annual ``Bonfire Night'' celebrations,
authorities said Friday.
	   A crowd gathered near the Toller Lane police station in the
northern England town of Bradford at 1 a.m. (0100 GMT) Friday and
refused to disperse, despite orders to do so from community leaders
and police.
	   In addition to clashes with police, a local car dealer's garage
was set on fire and destroyed, authorities said.
	   No one was injured and no arrests were made.
	   Bonfire Night is an annual celebration of the discovery of the
1605 ``Gunpowder plot'' by Guy Fawkes to blow up the Houses of
Parliament. It is celebrated throughout the country with bonfires
and fireworks displays.
	   Earlier, at about 7 p.m. (1900 GMT) Thursday, violence broke out
in nearby Halifax, with several police cars set alight.
	   Local community leaders and officers from across West Yorkshire
were called in to help disperse the crowd.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London
caused a deep split among Chileans, and now an equally profound
division is emerging on what to do when the former dictator returns
home.
	   Some insist _ as they long have _ that he should be tried in
Chile for human rights violations that occurred during his long
regime. Others speak of forgiveness and the need for
reconciliation.
	   One idea appears less controversial: Even some staunch Pinochet
supporters say that whatever the outcome of his legal situation in
London, he should retire from politics.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a warrant from
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who wants to extradite him on
accusations of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   The Spanish government, which had said Garzon lacked
jurisdiction for his probe into human rights crimes committed in
Chile, approved Friday his extradition request.
	   The government has called the affair a matter for courts to
decide.
	   The English High Court recognized Pinochet's immunity from
prosecution as a former chief of state, but an appeal on that
ruling has yet to be decided by the House of Lords. A hearing was
to continue Monday and was expected to last through Tuesday. It was
not clear how soon the judges would announce their ruling.

Pig farmers rally to protest plunging prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pig farmers blocked roads and held noisy rallies
across France Friday to protest plunging prices and to demand rapid
distribution of government aid.
	   Four thousand farmers rallied in the city of Rennes, Britanny. A
delegation of pork producers was to meet with local authorities.
	   A rally was also being held in Bailleul, northern France, where
dozens of farmers at midday set tires and haystacks on fire. Other
rallies were planned in Montauban and Lyon.
	   In northern France, traffic was snarled on a major highway after
farmers deliberately drove slowly and blocked access roads between
Dunkirk and Lille.
	   Farmers have been squeezed for months by the price of pork,
which was selling Friday at 5.18 francs (95 cents) a kilo (2.2
pounds), about 4 francs (70 cents) below production costs. They say
they can't cover their costs with such low prices, caused by
falling demand and overproduction.
	   The French government said Tuesday it would provide 150 million
francs (dlrs 27 million) in extra aid to the producers. The farmers
said Friday they would not tolerate any delay.
	   ``Since the end of 1997 I've been losing money,'' said Pierre
Hughes, a pig farmer from Fletres. ``I had put some money aside,
but if this continues the banks will cut off my allowance.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bacher, Lloyd arriving in London; ADDS Bacher
quotes, Mandela letter &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South African and West Indian cricket officials
met Friday with disgruntled West Indies players to mediate a pay
dispute that threatens to wipe out the islanders' historic South
African tour.
	   Ali Bacher, head of South African cricket, traveled to London
accompanied by Clive Lloyd, manager of the the West Indies touring
squad.
	   ``I'm certain everybody wants this tour to take place,'' Bacher
told reporters at Heathrow Airport before going into closed-door
talks with the players at a nearby hotel.
	   ``One therefore must be very confident there will be a
resolution to this impasse, in a situation that is acceptable to
the West Indies board and the players.''
	   Bacher was carrying a letter from South African President Nelson
Mandela urging a resolution of the impasse. Mandela stressed his
hope that the West Indies can go ahead with its first official tour
of South Africa since the end of apartheid.
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher said.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The first match of the three-month tour is scheduled to begin
next Tuesday. The first Test is scheduled for Nov. 26.
	   The tour is considered crucial in promoting the game among South
African blacks in a country where whites run the sport.
	   The dispute came to a head Wednesday when the West Indies
Cricket Board fired captain Brian Lara and vice-captain Carl Hooper
after they refused to travel to South Africa. They are seeking
better pay for the players.
	   The WICB said it would fine the no-show players between 5 and 10
percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs 60,000
for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide player support. Only seven of the 16
members of the squad traveled to South Africa, and they reportedly
have since flown to London to rally around Lara.
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, rated the world's best batsman, hinted Thursday the tour
might go on if a compromise can be reached.
	   ``What has resulted so far is a bit unfortunate and I hope it
can be resolved in the near future,'' he said. ``The main thing is
that the West Indies tour to South Africa should be on. The people
want the tour to be on and hopefully something positive will come
out of it (in the meeting).
	   ``I am not a member of the West Indies cricket team at the
moment, but I would love to be there. My life is playing cricket.
When it is possible you could be there and you are not there
because of circumstances _ as in this case _ it is very
unfortunate.''
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

East Timor settlement talks at pivotal stage, U.N. envoy says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a new
proposal to settle their dispute over East Timor, and talks between
the two sides are at a crucial stage, according to a U.N. envoy.
	   Envoy Jamsheed Marker said late Thursday that the U.N. proposal
envisages broad autonomy for the disputed Southeast Asian
territory.
	   ``We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical,
moment in the talks,'' Marker told reporters after a dinner with
President Jorge Sampaio.
	   He said the U.N. plan includes ``a proposal for very
wide-ranging autonomy for East Timor,'' a former Portuguese colony
that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and later annexed.
	   Lisbon and Jakarta have agreed to discuss the proposal which was
``couched in legal terms'' and could provide the foundation for a
future Constitution for East Timor, Marker said, though he declined
to give further details.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlement
on East Timor, was on the second day of a three-day visit for talks
with Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.
	   After the May resignation of authoritarian President Suharto,
Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to the
territory of 800,000 people, but insisted on retaining control over
its defense, economic and foreign policy.
	   Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected that
proposal and insisted a referendum be held inside the territory to
decide its future.

Indonesian army slams East Timor terrorist attack threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS final six grafs to UPDATE with killing of soldier in East
Timor and U.N. envoy comment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military said Friday that
it was ready to act against a threat from an East Timor rebel group
to launch terrorist attacks.
	   ``We will not tolerate any activity that threatens economic or
military installations in East Timor or elsewhere in Indonesia,''
said military spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif.
	   In the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, an East Timorese group
opposed to Indonesian rule in the disputed territory said Thursday
that it was ready to resort to terrorism if Jakarta does not let
six East Timorese asylum-seekers leave the country.
	   Azancot de Menezes, the exiled Lisbon representative of the
Timor Socialist Party, said his group was ready to coordinate the
attacks with pro-independence guerrillas based inside East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of
Portugal's colonial administration.
	   The pro-independence Timor Socialist Party wants Indonesia to
permit the departure of six East Timorese holed up in the Austrian
Embassy in Jakarta.
	   The party's secretary-general, Avelino da Silva, his wife and
two daughters ages 4 and 6, and two other East Timorese clambered
over the embassy compound's walls 14 months ago.
	   Indonesia's military have accused Da Silva and his wife of being
members of a bomb-making gang, known as the Black Brigade.
	   The group allegedly planned to blow up civilian targets in their
fight for East Timor's independence.
	   The Indonesian government has refused to let them leave the
country and says they should be prosecuted.
	   Meanwhile, military officials said an Indonesian soldier was
killed early Friday in Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southeast of Dili, East Timor capital.
	   The military blamed pro-independence rebels in the killing of
the native East Timorese soldier, whose name was still not known.
The rebels also took his gun, said Col. Suhartono Suratman, chief
of the local military.
	   Last Friday, two soldiers and one civilian were beaten to death
by pro-independence activists in Manufahi, he said, without giving
further details.
	   In Lisbon, Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. envoy for East Timor, said
late Thursday that Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a new United
Nations proposal that envisages broad autonomy for East Timor.
	   ``We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical,
moment in the talks,'' Marker told reporters.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlement
on East Timor, was on the second day of a three-day visit for talks
with Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.

Yokoo stays on top in Acom International
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IWAKI, Japan (AP) _ Kaname Yokoo collected five points Friday
and maintained a four-point lead after two rounds in the 120
million yen (dlrs 1.02 million) Acom International.
	   Yokoo, seeking his first title in three years as a pro,
scattered four birdies and three bogeys en route to a 36-hole total
of 22 points at the 6,948-yard (6,323-meter), par-72 Seve
Ballesteros Golf Club course.
	   The tournament's modified Stableford scoring system awards 8
points for a double eagle, 5 for an eagle, 2 for a birdie, zero for
par, minus-1 for a bogey and minus-3 for a double bogey or worse.
	   Toshimitus Izawa, winner of the Tokai Classic last month, also
had 5 points to share second place at 18 with Shusaku Sugimoto, who
earned 18 points with nine birdies.
	   Hirofumi Miyase and Katsumasa Miyamoto were another point behind
at 17, followed by Toru Suzuki's 16.

All-Spanish and All-French showdowns in UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes; REPEATING. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The third round of the UEFA Cup will feature
intriguing all-French and all-Spanish encounters.
	   Friday's draw in Geneva resulted in head-to-head showdowns
between Monaco and Olympique Marseille and Real Sociedad and
Atletico Madrid.
	   Monaco and Real Sociedad will be at home for the first leg games
on Nov. 24. The second leg is scheduled for Dec. 8.
	   In past years, UEFA has separated teams from the same country in
the draw. But this time, with four teams each from France and
Spain, and at least three from Italy, it was impossible to keep
clubs apart.
	   Italian clubs, which have won seven of the last 10 UEFA Cups,
were fortunate not to have been drawn against each other.
	   Title favorite Parma was pitted against Scottish side Glasgow
Rangers, Roma against FC Zurich and Bologna vs. Real Bettis. The
first legs will be played in Glasgow, Zurich and Bologna.
	   Fiorentina, a fourth Italian club, will likely not make it into
the third round. The club's second-round, second-leg game against
Swiss side Grasshoppers was abandoned at halftime Tuesday after an
off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device thrown
from the stands in Salerno, Italy.
	   UEFA is scheduled to annouce the outcome of the game Sunday,
with Fiorentina facing the likelihood of a 3-0 forfeit defeat and
the possibility of a European ban.
	   Whichever team is selected to advance will host French club
Bordeaux in the first leg of the third round.
	   The fourth French club, Lyon, is home vs. Belgian side Brugges.
	   Liverpool, England's only survivor, was drawn against Spanish
side Celta Vigo, which eliminated English Premier League leader
Aston Villa from the competition on Tuesday. Celta is at home for
the first leg.
	   It's the first time four French clubs have reached the third
round of the UEFA Cup. A French team has never won the competition,
while Real Madrid was the last Spanish club to capture the UEFA Cup
in 1986.
	   No German clubs made it to the final 16 this year.
	   French club officials expressed frustration that Monaco and
Marseille would face each other.
	   ``Monaco is a team which is like Roma, Parma or Liverpool _ a
team we really didn't want to draw,'' Olympique Marseille's
Jean-Michel Roussier said. ``It's a shame for French soccer that we
should be together.''
	   ``It's not the worst draw but it's certainly not the best,''
Monaco vice president Max Poggi said. ``For French soccer this is
really not a good draw. It's a shame but that's the luck of the
draw.''
	   By coincidence, the same two clubs meet Friday night in an
important French league match. Marseille tops the French standings,
while Monaco is in fourth place. (sw)

Sudan wants Egyptians to farm land
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's powerful spiritual leader on
Friday called on Egyptians to migrate in ``millions'' to Sudan to
cultivate government farm lands left fallow because of scarcity of
farmers.
	   Sudan ``invites Egyptians to come in millions to make use of
millions of acres (hectares) that are not cultivated because Sudan
is underpopulated,'' Hassan Turabi, who is also the Parliament
speaker, told a gathering of doctors in Khartoum.
	   His comments were broadcast by state television. Turabi has
extended similar invitations in the past but without results.
	   Sudan covers an area of 1 million square miles (2.6 million
square kilometers), making it Africa's largest country, and its
population is estimated at 28 million.
	   Egypt's area is 385,229 square miles (1 million square
kilometers), but about 90 percent of its 60 million people live on
5 percent of the land along the Nile river. The rest is mostly
desert.
	   Turabi has long maintained that Egyptians are master farmers,
reaping the benefit of Nile Valley, the most fertile land in the
world.
	   He indicated that the Egyptians who take up his offer will be
allowed to own lands. But he did not specify the areas where arable
land has been left uncultivated.
	   Egyptian farmers often migrate to other countries in search of
work but migration of farmers is not known. In September, Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi also said he will accept 1 million Egyptians
to cultivate land watered by a new gigantic irrigation project but
it is not known how many went.
	   Turabi's comments come as relations between Egypt and Sudan are
at a low point over Egyptian allegations that Sudan supports Muslim
militants seeking to topple the Egyptian government.
	   Also Friday, Sudanese President Hassan al-Bashir talked on the
telephone with Yemeni President President Ali Abdullah. Reports say
the tiny Gulf state is trying to patch up relations between Egypt
and Sudan.
	   The official Sudan News Agency said al-Bashir and Abdullah
discussed ``security and stability in the region.''

Government denies report that Blair gives up on England bid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; REPEATING PROTECTIVELY
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Government ministers said Friday they remain fully
committed to England's bid for the 2006 World Cup, denying a report
that the country had given up hope of staging soccer's showpiece
event.
	   The Financial Times reported Friday that Prime Minister Tony
Blair has withdrawn his active support for the bid because FIFA
president Sepp Blatter was backing South Africa's candidacy.
	   Blatter told Blair in London last week that Africa, which has
never staged the World Cup, was the ``logical'' choice for the 2006
tournament _ provided that the facilities, transport, security and
accomodations were up to scratch.
	   The Financial Times said Blair's closest aides have advised him
to distance himself from the bid amid ``signs of growing confusion
over the status of England's application'' to hold the world's
largest single sports event.
	   The newspaper said the government was now relying on junior
ministers, such as Sports Minister Tony Banks, to work alongside
the 2006 campaign.
	   ``Other ministers can do their bit but the prime minister
doesn't want to be too close to something likely to go the wrong
way,'' an unidentified government member was quoted as saying.
	   Banks went on television and radio to deny the report as
``absolutely absurd.''
	   ``He (Blatter) also said to the Prime Minister that he thought
England's bid was a very strong one and a very competitive one and
I can tell you this, the Prime Minister was hugely encouraged by
what Sepp Blatter said,'' Banks said.
	   Chris Smith, the cabinet minister in charge of sport, also
dismissed the newspaper report and reaffirmed the government's
support for the bid.
	   ``The whole government. ... are putting our full backing behind
the 2006 bid,'' he said.
	   Smith said Blatter stressed that South Africa had to meet strict
conditions regarding facilities and infrastructure.
	   ``Right now that isn't the case,'' Smith said. ``We have those
things in place. We believe we are still in there with a very good
chance.''
	   England bid director Alec McGivan said Major was offering his
``total'' support for the campaign.
	   ``The Government have been strong supporters of the bid and will
continue to be,'' he said. ``The Prime Minister has personally been
a fantastic friend to the bid and he will continue to play an
enormous role in the next 15 months as we build up to the decision
as to who gets the 2006 World Cup.''
	   The winner will be selected in March 2000 after a vote by a
24-member FIFA committee.
	   Apart from South Africa and England, Germany has also entered a
bidf. Blatter said he also expects bids from Brazil, Morocco,
Nigeria and Egypt.

Foot injury forces McColgan out of Tokyo Marathon.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Surgery on a recurring foot injury has forced
British athlete Liz McColgan to withdraw from next week's Tokyo
Marathon.
	   The 1996 London Marathon winner sustained a heal injury during
her second-place finish in the London Marathon in April and has not
raced since.
	   The injury failed to improve despite extensive physiotherapy,
forcing McColgan to undergo surgery to remove a cyst from her left
toe.
	   She is not expected to race for at least two months.
	   The Scottish runner usually competes in two marathons each year
and had planned to compete in the Tokyo event on Nov. 15. She has
run in the Tokyo event since 1991 when she took up racing over the
distance.

Car bomb explodes; Israel suspends ratification of peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with defense minister saying the two dead were the
assailants, Netanyahu adviser saying ratification still possible
next week &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb blew up Friday in a Jerusalem market
crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The blast killed
two assailants, wounded 21 Israelis and prompted Israel to suspend
implementation of the peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying to
sabotage the agreement, claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m.
(0745 gmt) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market.
	   Palestinian officials condemned the attack, but accused Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding up
the agreement that was to give the Palestinians another 13 percent
of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the main
intersection at the market entrance, smoke coming out of the hood
and windows. ``People started to shout `car on fire,''' said Yair
Cohen, a bus company employee.
	   Rahel Zaken, waiting in line at a bakery to buy Sabbath bread,
turned toward the street and got a glimpse of the driver. ``I saw
his eyes. He looked right at me,'' said Zaken, a 32-year-old
secretary. Seconds later, an explosion shook the area.
	   ``I fell to the ground and stumbled over one of the beggars and
crawled away on my hands and legs,'' she said. She was hospitalized
after complainging of ringing in the ears.
	   Others said they heard two explosions, followed by fast pops,
like the sound of firecrackers. Israel radio said two suitcases
filled with explosives were recovered near the car, suggesting the
blast went off prematurely and that the assailants had planned to
set off a more powerful explosion.
	   Friday's bombing marked the third time in less than three weeks
that Hamas tried, but failed, to carry out an attack with large
numbers of Israeli casualties, suggesting that a recent crackdown
by Israel and the Palestinian Authority has produced results.
	   A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay several
meters (yards) away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.
Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool of
blood below the head. Rescue workers covered the body with sodden
pieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the two dead were the
assailants. Asked about Hamas' apparent difficulty to launch a
large-scale attack, he said: ``We can't depend on miracles.''
	   The explosion turned the car into a mass of twisted metal, and a
large cloud of smoke engulfed the area.
	   ``There was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an
Israeli border policeman. Soldiers and police held back the crowds.
``It's dangerous _ stay back!'' they shouted.
	   At police barricades set up along Jerusalem's busiest
thoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, some
frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded
market only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   ``Please, please, is there a girl with red hair who is hurt?''
an older, heavyset woman said tearfully, trying to push her way
past police. A young female soldier patted her arm consolingly.
	   Two policemen led away an elderly woman who gripped a blue
plastic shopping bag filled with groceries.
	   A small crowd of protesters shouted, ``Death to Arabs! Death to
Arafat!'' Police tried to grab one of them, but he escaped into the
crowd.
	   Just a block away from Friday's blast, shoppers went about their
business. ``We can't stop with what we are doing when this
happens,'' one young female shopper said.
	   In July 1997, two Islamic militants blew themselves up just a
few meters (yards) from the site of the latest explosion, killing
themselves and 16 shoppers.
	   When Friday's blast rocked downtown Jerusalem, the Israeli
Cabinet had just gathered about a mile (kilometer) away, at
Netanyahu's office, to discuss the peace agreement under which
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for a Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.
	   The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by the
Cabinet. Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said at the start of the
session that he had expected a vote later Friday.
	   However, the session broke off when word of the attack reached
the ministers. The meeting was resumed shortly after noon, with
ministers deciding to suspend the ratification process.
	   The Cabinet said in a statement will only reconvene after ``it
verifies that the Palestinian Authority takes vigorous steps for an
all-out war against terrorist organizations and their
infrastructure.''
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, condemned the
attack, but said Israel was playing into the hands of the militants
by suspending the peace process.
	   He also said the Palestinians were doing all they could to stop
the violence. ``I wished that the Israeli government would not
point its finger at the Palestinian Authority,'' Erekat said.
	   Bar-Illan said ratification was possible as early as next week
if the Palestinians take decisive steps against militants.
	   The Cabinet also demanded clarifications from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on the procedure for revoking clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye River agreement refers to the procedure, but is vague
enough to allow different interpretations. It says the Palestine
National Council and other Palestinian organizations will meet in
mid-December to ``reaffirm'' a letter by Arafat to U.S. President
Bill Clinton in which the Palestinian leader spells out which
clauses are being annulled.
	   The Palestinians dispute Israel's contention that the agreement
calls for the PNC to hold a vote on the clauses.
	   The Cabinet also said it would act to strengthen Jerusalem as
Israel's capital. Israel radio initially said the ministers decided
to begin construction of the controversial Jewish neighborhood of
Har Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem next. Bar-Illan said
construction would be authorized ``in the near future,'' but would
not give a date.

Producer of brandy that killed 43 people sentenced to 15 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - The Serbian maker of a poisonous
brandy that killed 43 people was sentenced to 15 years in jail
Friday, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Miroslav Zivadinovic, who earlier this year produced and sold
grape brandy that was tainted by poisonous methyl alcohol, received
the maxim term for ``jeopardizing people's health.''
	   The cheap brandy was sold in street markets and shops. Besides
the 43 people who died, numerous others were reported to have
suffered lasting health consequences.
	   During the court proceedings, Zivadinovic claimed he tested
every sample that came out of his alcohol plant in Nis, central
Serbia, ``but nothing happened to me.''
	   At least one woman died after drinking the brandy at the funeral
for her son - the Serbian tradition at burials _ who also died from
the lethal liquor.

Lebanese-American businessman indicted for visiting Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Authorities on Friday leveled another
charge in absentia against a Lebanese-American businessman,
accusing him of visiting Israel and concluding a trade deal there.
	   Military Magistrate Riad Talieh said in an indictment that Roger
Tamraz violated the rules on the Arab boycott of Israel when he
entered Israel without permission from the Lebanese authorities and
struck a commercial deal with the Jewish state.
	   Lebanon is technically at war with Israel and forbids contacts
with it.
	   Tamraz had previously been sentenced in absentia to three years
in jail for collaboration with Israel. That case was based on a
reported meeting in Paris between Tamraz and an Israeli diplomat,
David Kimche.
	   The latest indictment was issued following reports published in
Lebanese newspapers on Sept. 9, quoting the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz that Tamraz had visited Israel and concluded a trade deal
with it.
	   Talieh demanded that Tamraz, who is believed to be living in the
United States, be given an unspecified jail term with hard labor.
	   Tamraz has been wanted in Lebanon since 1989 for allegedly
embezzling up to dlrs 200 million while he was chairman of the Al
Mashreq Bank when it went bankrupt during the 1975-90 civil war.

U.N. ready to assist 650,000 displaced Rwandans in looming crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The United Nations, unwilling to create a
permanent encampment of Rwandans, Friday said it will only provide
short-term aid to 650,000 people who fled their homes in fear of
attacks by Hutu rebels.
	   U.N. officials said they did not want to be drawn into financing
a long-term resettlement of majority Hutus _ against their will _
in northwestern villages protected by the Tutsi-led army.
	   So far, more than 650,000 Rwandans have left their hillside
farmlands to seek protection from the military, which has launched
operations to crush a four-year Hutu insurgency and separate the
rebels from civilians who provide them with money, food and
shelter.
	   Most of the civilians are living under banana trees this rainy
season with little food, water or sanitation because they are
afraid if they return home they will be killed by rebels who see
them as government collaborators.
	   The rebels are former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible
for the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and
politically moderate Hutus.
	   ``This is foreseen by the government as part of the final
solution to the security problems _ trying to separate innocent
victims from the insurgents,'' said Steve Brown, the U.N. resident
coordinator. ``A great concern of the international community is
that whatever happens is done with the consent of the
beneficiaries.''
	   Aid workers believe the Hutu civilians have moved into camps
voluntarily, he said. ``We would also like that spirit to prevail,
wherever they are moved next.''
	   The government said the displaced people _ whose number has
doubled since August _ have sought army protection because they are
tired of intimidation, extortion and forced recruitment into rebel
ranks.
	   The U.N. Development Program, in coordination with the
government, will appeal for dlrs 30 million to aid the rising
number of displaced in the next six months.
	   ``We've received certain assurances from the government that
this is a relatively short-term humanitarian crisis and we hope
that is true,'' Brown said.
	   ``The concern of the donors is not to be engaged in what may
turn out to be a more or less interminable period of emergency
assistance. They don't want, nor does the government want Rwanda to
be dubbed again as an emergency country.''
	   For more than two years, donors spent in excess of dlrs 1
million a day to care for nearly 2 million Hutu refugees who fled
to neighboring countries in 1994, fearing retaliation for the
genocide.
	   Next week, U.N. aid workers plan to reopen an office in
Ruhengeri, 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of Kigali, to
coordinate food aid convoys and monitor the new arrivals.
	   The office was closed last year when rebels stepped up attacks
on army convoys, schools, and Hutus and Tutsis alike.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan quibbled Friday over
strategic military positions on a Himalayan glacier, failing to
silence gunfire across the world's highest battle ground where 13
soldiers were reported killed in the last 10 days.
	   A meeting of the senior defense officials of both countries in
the Indian capital produced a meager agreement _ to continue
discussions on the Siachen Glacier, in the disputed frontier
province of Jammu-Kashmir, at the next round of peace talks in
February.
	   The negotiations were aimed at disengaging forces and ultimately
settling the competing claims of ownership.
	   Pakistani officials rejected an Indian proposal for a
cease-fire, demanding that India redeploy troops on the Saltoro
range near the glacier. Indian Defense Secretary Ajit Kumar said
his government was ready to talk about shifting troop positions
once the cease-fire was in force.
	   As the delegations met, reports arrived of a heavy artillery
exchange during the night from the 20,000-foot-high
(6,000-meter-high) battlefield. In the nearby sector of Kargil,
five Indian civilians were reported wounded by Pakistani shellfire,
and India claimed it destroyed a Pakistani bunker and a building.
	   Expectations had been low for the negotiations, although
officials had hoped they could at least call a truce to the latest
series of artillery and mortar duels. But India said 250 artillery
shells were fired since Thursday night alone.
	   ``Pakistanis are just trying to grab a toehold on the Saltoro,''
India's Director-General for Military Affairs, Inder Verma, said.
``This is a national frontier. It's sacrosanct. There is a threat
to it, so we have to take appropriate action.''
	   When asked if an understanding had been reached to contain the
fighting, Pakistani Defense Secretary Iftikhar Ali Khan said ``it
is a very complicated matter and a complex situation.''
	   India says 12 Pakistani soliders and one Indian officer have
been killed in nine attempts by Pakistani units to move into
Indian-held territory on the 76-kilometer-long (47 miles) Siachen
Glacier.
	   Pakistan denied any such military offensives had occurred.
	   ``Fighting takes place every day but there has been no attempt
to capture Indian posts,'' said Tariq Altaf, a senior Pakistani
official at the discussions.
	   The glacier, 600 miles (965 kilometers) north of New Delhi, is
known as the world's highest battlefield. More soldiers die from
high-altitude sickness and exposure than from enemy fire.
	   The dispute has been discussed on six previous occasions, and
negotiators were near an agreement as long ago as 1989 to
disentangle forces and retreat to less inclement locations.
	   The discussions in New Delhi between the two defense secretaries
are part of a fresh round of talks, but all these issues are
overshadowed by the toughest dispute: the rival claims to Kashmir,
of which the Siachen Glacier forms the northern part.
	   Negotiations began Thursday on using the water of the Jhelum
River, which slices Kashmir. The agenda also includes a proposal
for bus service between New Delhi and the Pakistani border city of
Lahore, for Pakistan to sell electricity to India, for fighting
terrorism and drug-trafficking.
	   India hopes progress on less controversial issues of trade and
cooperation can improve the atmosphere and ease the way toward a
breakthrough on Kashmir. But Pakistan maintains that no progress
can be made without a Kashmir resolution.
	   But a deal could not be sealed without a broader agreement on
Kashmir, which has bedeviled relations between the two neighbors
for the last 50 years since they became independent from Britain.
India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir.
	   The Kashmir conflict assumed greater international importance in
May when India and Pakistan conducted underground atomic tests,
declared themselves nuclear powers and generated global fears of a
nuclear confrontation.

Burns leads in Rally Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ England's Richard Burns was in
commanding form to finish day two of Rally Australia more than a
minute ahead of his nearest rival after 11 stages.
	   Burns, 27, covered the 11 stages, following one Thursday night,
in 1 hour, 17 minutes, 31.1 seconds in his Mitsubishi with
Frenchman Didier Auriol second in his Toyota with 1:18:37.4.
	   Rally Australia is the penultimate round of the 13-race world
championship and three drivers are still in with a chance of the
title.
	   Standings leader Carlos Sainz of Spain struggled as first driver
on the gravel roads but was third in his Toyota before easing up in
the 2.2-kilometer (1.36-mile) last stage to end the day in fifth on
1:18.57.6. Defending champion Tommi Makinen was eighth after a
difficult day of racing.
	   The Finn's Mitsubishi suffered a broken suspension after he hit
a rock on stage eight. He was also docked 80 seconds after repair
work ran overtime.
	   Scotland's Colin McRae, who must win this round to keep his
title chances alive, is eight points behind Sainz and six behind
Makinen on the overall standings. McRae was sixth in his Subaru, 1
minute 36 seconds behind Burns.
	   Meanwhile, Italian driver Piero Liatti crashed out of the race
when he struck a tree in his final race for Subaru.

Troubled vote over 1999 income tax law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The lower house of parliament delayed the
final vote Friday on the 1999 income tax law after Solidarity
deputies unexpectedly approved exemptions that would cut revenues
by 150 million zlotys (dlrs 44 million), threatening next year's
budget.
	   Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz said the situation was
``very serious.''
	   He said that Solidarity, the senior partner in Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek's government, voted ``against its own government,
against its own prime minister and against its own budget.''
	   The amendment provides for tax exemptions for families with at
least three children in 1999, for families with at least two
children in 2000 and for families with at least one child in 2001.
	   Marian Pilka, a Solidarity leader said the vote was in line with
Solidarity's electoral program and promises.
	   The final vote on income tax was expected still Friday, and
Solidarity leaders said they will approve it with the tax
exemptions that have been a sore point in coalition discussions all
along.
	   On Monday, the 460-member lower house, or Sejm, was to discuss
the 1999 draft budget.

Norway's Aker RGI reports strong gain in operating profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's Aker RGI ASA on Friday reported an
operating profit of 559 million kroner (dlrs 75.5 million) for the
first nine months of the year, compared to a loss of 55 million
kroner (dlrs 7.4 million) in the same period last year.
	   Aker RGI said the improvement was due mainly to higher profits
from its key oil and gas technology business, cement and building
materials operations, and shipyard business.
	   However, the company also said its pretax profits had declined
to 409 million kroner (dlrs 55.2 million) for the nine months from
576 million kroner (dlrs 77.8 million) for the same period of 1997.
	   Aker RGI was formed a year ago through the merger of Aker, with
roots in shipyards founded in the 1850s, and RGI, which expanded
rapidly in real estate and fishing in the 1990s. The merged concern
has interests in oil, construction, fisheries and real estate.

Producer of brandy that killed 43 people sentenced to 15 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Serbian maker of a poisonous
brandy that killed 43 people was sentenced to 15 years in jail
Friday, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Miroslav Zivadinovic, who earlier this year produced and sold
grape brandy that was tainted by poisonous methyl alcohol, received
the maxim term for ``jeopardizing people's health.''
	   The cheap brandy was sold in street markets and shops. Besides
the 43 people who died, numerous others were reported to have
suffered lasting health consequences.
	   During the court proceedings, Zivadinovic claimed he tested
every sample that came out of his alcohol plant in Nis, central
Serbia, ``but nothing happened to me.''
	   At least one woman died after drinking the brandy at the funeral
for her son _ the Serbian tradition at burials _ who also died from
the lethal liquor.

Russia warns against use of force in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia warned Friday that attempts to use force
against Iraq would lead to ``most unpredictable consequences,'' and
expressed hope that Iraq would let U.N. weapons inspectors resume
their work.
	   The United Nations passed a resolution Thursday urging Iraq to
allow unimpeded work by the inspectors, who must certify that Iraq
has dismantled all weapons of mass destruction as a condition for
lifting economic sanctions against the country.
	   ``Baghdad will again thoroughly analyze the situation and revoke
the decision on limiting inspectors' activity in Iraq,'' the
Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement quoted by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The ministry also warned that attempts to use force to make Iraq
comply are ``fraught with most unpredictable consequences for peace
and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a whole.''
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars by Iraq, is generally
sympathetic to the Arab nation and has called for an early lifting
of the sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered a
lackluster Marcelo Rios in the quarterfinal of the dlrs 2.55
million Paris Open on Friday, easily beating the world No. 2, 6-3,
6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, took exactly one hour to beat Rios,
who was roundly booed off the court by spectators who felt he
hadn't made an effort.
	   The match turned in the eighth game of the first set.
	   Kafelnikov broke serve while leading 4-3 with a smart backhand
drop volley, and held serve to take the set.
	   The Russian blasted Rios off the court in the second set with a
display of blistering serves and powerful returns.
	   Rios could have ended the week as world No. 1 by winning the
Paris Open, if Pete Sampras were to lose in the quarterfinals. But
the Chilean never looked comfortable against the powerful Russian.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb exploded Friday in a Jerusalem
market crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The blast
killed the two assailants and wounded 21 Israelis, and prompted
Israel's Cabinet to suspend implementation of a new peace accord
with the Palestinians.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying to
sabotage the peace accord, claimed responsibility for the morning
attack in the Mahane Yehuda market, police said.
	   The bombing marked the third time in less than three weeks that
Hamas tried, but failed, to carry out an attack producing large
numbers of Israeli casualties.
	   Just a few yards from the site of Friday's explosion, two
Islamic militants had blown themselves up in July 1997, killing
themselves and 16 shoppers.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the two dead were the
assailants. Asked about Hamas' apparent difficulty to launch a
large-scale attack, he said: ``We can't depend on miracles.''
	   Palestinian negotiators condemned the attack, but accused
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of political blackmail
for holding up the agreement that was to give the Palestinians
another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   President Bill Clinton expressed sympathy for the latest
victims, calling Friday's attack an ``outrageous and cowardly act
by enemies of peace'' who seek to derail the Wye River agreement.
	   ``I hope we can regain the momentum and implementation of the
Wye agreement as soon as possible,'' Clinton said.
	   In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the main
intersection at the entrance of Mahane Yehuda, smoke coming out of
the hood and windows.
	   A series of explosions went off inside the car and flames shot
10 feet (three meters) into the air. Shoppers fled, screaming, as
black smoke engulfed the area.
	   Seconds later an explosion shook the area, said Rahel Zaken, who
was waiting in line at a bakery to buy Sabbath bread.
	   ``I fell to the ground and stumbled over one of the beggars and
crawled away on my hands and legs,'' said Zaken, a 23-year-old
secretary. Zaken was hospitalized after complaining of ringing in
the ears.
	   Other witnesses said they heard two explosions, followed by fast
pops, like the sound of firecrackers.
	   Israel radio said two suitcases filled with explosive materials
were found nearby, suggesting that the blast had gone off
prematurely and that the assailants had planned to set off a more
powerful explosion.
	   The force of the explosion turned the car into a mass of twisted
metal. A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay several
meters (yards) away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.
Another barelegged body lay in the street, face down, with a pool
of blood below the head. Rescue workers covered the body with
sodden pieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags.
	   The explosion went off shortly after the Israeli Cabinet had
gathered at Netanyahu's office to discuss the peace agreement under
which Israel is to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the
West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian campaign against Islamic
militants.
	   The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by the
Cabinet, and Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said at the start of
the session that he had expected a vote later Friday.
	   However, the session broke off when word of the attack reached
the ministers, and the ministers later decided to suspend the
ratification process indefinitely.
	   ``The government of Israel will resume the discussion of the
agreement after it verifies that the Palestinian Authority is
taking vigorous steps for a relentless fight against terrorist
organizations and their infrastructure,'' a Cabinet statement said.
	   Bar-Illan said ratification was still possible as early as next
week if the Palestinians take decisive steps against militants.
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, condemned the
attack, but said Israel was playing into the hands of the militants
by suspending the peace process.
	   ``I wished that the Israeli government would not point its
finger at the Palestinian Authority,'' Erekat said. ``The
Palestinian Authority is exerting the maximum effort to foil terror
and violence.''
	   The Israeli Cabinet also demanded clarifications from
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the procedure for revoking
clauses in the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   At the scene of the bombing, soldiers and police held back
crowds of people, some frantic about loved ones shopping in the
crowded market only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   A small crowd of protesters shouted, ``Death to Arabs! Death to
Arafat!''
	   A block away, shoppers went about their business. ``We can't
stop with what we are doing when this happens,'' one woman said.

French foreign minister calls on Israel to move on peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on Friday
deplored the latest violence in Israel, but called on the country's
leaders to move ahead anyway with the accord reached with the
Palestinians last month.
	   ``If Israeli authorities really don't want to relaunch the peace
process, they will always find tragic events to justify their
dilatory attitude,'' Vedrine said in a statement.
	   Two people were killed and 21 wounded when a suicide car bomb
went off in a Jerusalem market Friday. Israel's Cabinet immediately
suspended implementation of the peace accord reached with the
Palestinian Authority at Wye, Maryland last month.

Investigators: Aftermath posed no significant health risk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Fumes and smoke from the deadly
crash of an El Al Boeing 747 cargo jet that plowed into a high-rise
apartment building in 1992 posed virtually no long-term health
risk, the government said Friday.
	   Hundreds of residents in Amsterdam's Bijlmermeer neighborhood
still complain of ill health ranging from chronic fatigue and
breathing difficulties to cancer. Most blame their troubles on the
Oct. 4, 1992 crash, which killed at least 43 people, most on the
ground.
	   Dutch Health Minister Els Borst ordered an investigation into
the possible effects of the crash in an attempt to find the cause
of the health complaints.
	   The National Institute of Public Health and the Environment
concluded that a small quantity of depleted uranium which was used
as ballast in the stricken plane _ and which burned up in the crash
_ could be expected to cause cancer in just one in 100 million
people.
	   Other material, including heavy metals, consumed in the inferno
also posed a minimal risk, according to the report.
	   But the findings, based on an analysis of the plane's cargo and
the possible effects of it being burned, did little to allay the
fears of victims. Scores of people have angrily demanded a full
accounting of what the Israel-bound plane was carrying when it went
down shortly after takeoff from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
	   ``I find it very premature for people to publish these findings
into the health risks of the plane's cargo without actually having
investigated the people affected,'' Andre Bos, a spokesman for the
victims, told the Amsterdam daily Het Parool.
	   The report was handed to a parliamentary commission
investigating all aspects of the crash. The panel, which has the
power to subpoena witnesses, is trying to determine the exact
cargo.
	   Officials have disclosed that the flight was carrying a small
amount of unspecified military equipment. Israeli authorities
recently admitted the plane was carrying chemicals that can be used
in the manufacture of the nerve gas sarin.

	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Thirteen people were
killed during clashes between members of an outlawed militia group
and Congolese security forces, police reported.
	   The dead included three civilians and ten policemen, caught in
the cross fire as security forces launched an assault on the
``Ninja'' militia in the town of Mouyondzi, 350 kilometers (560
miles) southwest of Brazzaville, a police spokesman said Thursday.
	   Ninjas have stepped up a campaign of violence in the region
around Mouyondzi against the government of President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso, targeting government officials visiting the region.
	   Dozens of officials have been killed over the past few months,
news reports say.
	   The Ninjas backed former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas during
Republic of Congo's civil war last year. Kolelas, an ally of ousted
President Pascal Lissouba, went into exile when the war ended, but
elements of his militia have resisted disarmament and are waging a
campaign against his government.
	   Lissouba was ousted by Sassou-Nguesso, a former Congolese
president, during the five-month war. Sassou-Nguesso was later
declared president again.
	   Since his take over, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including his own Cobras.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Singing children, soccer matches
and military bands kicked off on Friday the latest round of
Ethiopia's polio immunization campaign.
	   The three-day program aims to vaccinate at least nine million
children under age 5.
	   Health Minister Adem Ibrahim said the government was committed
to a World Health Organization goal of eradicating polio in
Ethiopia by year 2000.
	   Ibrahim said the incidence of polio was declining worldwide, but
Ethiopia was among the nine countries, including neighboring
Somali, Sudan and Kenya, where polio still paralyzes thousands of
children every year.
	   Ibrahim said attempts would be made to vaccinate children in
cross-border areas in Somalia and Kenya.
	   Ibrahim said a total of 90,000 health workers and volunteers
were participating in the vaccination campaign, which was being
carried out at more than 30,000 vaccination posts in hospitals,
health centers, local administration offices, schools, churches,
mosques and markets.
	   ----
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The army has ordered an end to rent
payments for officers living off barracks, saying the money saved
would be spent on new housing in military bases, New Vision
newspaper reported Friday.
	   It said the order by Brig. James Kazini, the army chief of
staff, came after some senior military officers resisted an earlier
order to move to barracks by the end of February.
	   ``These officers were ordered to go to Bondo (barracks) or stay
in their own homes, but the ministry will not pay their rent
anymore,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying.
	   In January, all officers in the countryside who had left their
families in Uganda's capital, Kampala, were ordered to move their
families closer to their stations to enable the Ministry of Defense
to reduce rent on private homes.
	   -----
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former Finance Minister Ronald Penza, who
won international acclaim for bold economic reforms, was shot dead
at his home in Lusaka early Friday, police said.
	   Police said Penza, fired by President Frederick Chiluba earlier
this year because his reforms were blamed for losing the government
popularity, died from gunshot wounds after six assailants entered
his home in Lusaka's exclusive southeastern Ibex Hill suburb.
	   Drawers in a cabinet in his bedroom had been forced open and a
music system was abandoned in the grounds of Penza's home,
suggesting robbery was the motive, said police spokesman Beenwell
Chinfwembe.
	   Penza, who was 49, remained a lawmaker in the Lusaka parliament,
and led a quiet private life, relatives said.
	   In 1996, Penza was voted the world's second best finance
minister by Euro Finance magazine, a leading European business
journal, for his strict market-led reforms known locally as
``Penzanomics.''
	   Those policies led to the lifting of state subsidies on
essential foods and an easing of currency controls that ended years
of socialist-style policies that cushioned the poor.
	   ----
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo has appointed a Zimbabwean
businessman to head up a new management committee to rescue the
country's ailing state copper and cobalt mining company, Gecamines.
	   Speaking on national television Thursday evening, senior
presidential aide Yerodia Abdoulayi Ndombasi named Zimbabwean Billy
Rautenbach as president of the committee, which has been given a
mandate of six months to save the troubled mining company.
	   Rautenbach's appointment follows a decision last week to suspend
Gecamines' president and director-general, Mbaka Kawaya Swana.
	   Former managers at Gecamines, including Kawaya, have now been
appointed advisors to the new committee.
	   Kawaya and Gecamines management had been accused by members of
the Congolese government of divulging the existence of a secret
joint venture mining agreement between the government and a private
company known as Ridgepoint Overseas Development Limited.
	   Gecamines' fortunes have dwindled in recent years as the coper
mines suffered from neglect, political instability and chronic
under investment.

Russia gets dlrs 800 million loan from Japan, reaches deal with
</HEADLINE>
creditors &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government on Friday won an offer from
Japan for a dlrs 800 million loan and reached a crucial agreement
with foreign creditors over treasury bill debt that Russia froze in
August.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi promised the loan in a
telephone conversation Friday with his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny
Primakov, the Russian government said in a statement. The Japanese
Foreign Ministry confirmed the offer.
	   The credit is part of a dlrs 22.6 international bailout package
lined up this summer by a group of international lenders led by the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
	   The IMF provided only dlrs 4.8 billion and froze further
disbursements after Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on
its domestic treasury debts in August _ two actions that prompted
President Boris Yeltsin to fire his government, crippled Russia's
markets and sent the economy into a tailspin.
	   Primakov and Obuchi also discussed the Japanese premier's trip
to Moscow, scheduled for next Thursday. Obuchi is to hold talks
with Yeltsin, who is recovering at a Black Sea resort from
exhaustion and high blood pressure. He is to return to Moscow to
see Obuchi.
	   The IMF and other lenders have demanded that the Russian
government reach an agreement with foreign holders of its domestic
treasuries, known as GKOs. Russia defaulted on what was then dlrs
40 billion in ruble-denominated debt in August.
	   In talks with Russian officials in London on Friday, foreign
creditors agreed to accept ruble-denominated paper in compensation
for the treasuries.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said the Russian
government, in turn, will drop attempts to include dlrs 7 billion
debt in forward contracts owed by Russian banks in its
restructuring scheme.
	   Foreign investors, who hold nearly a third of the treasuries
debt, rejected initial restructuring terms that would have left
them holding paper worth only a few cents on the dollar.
	   ``We have an agreement in principle,'' said Kasyanov, speaking
from his London hotel room to Dow Jones Newswires. ``All the
restructuring will only be in rubles.''
	   Kasyanov wouldn't elaborate on terms of the restructuring,
saying it was still ``premature.''
	   The agreement came as the United States and Russia were on the
verge of reaching agreement on 3.1 million tons of food aid on
Friday.
	   The IMF has demanded that Primakov's government provide a
detailed plan for dealing with the crisis and expressed
dissatisfaction with a blueprint the Cabinet finally delivered last
week. It said the new plan is short on specifics and heavy with
state intervention into the economy _ something it has staunchly
opposed.
	   The government promised to release the text of its plan on
Thursday, but said Friday that it would take until next week to
finalize and edit it for publication.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn will stop in Russia for a
one-day visit next week to get an idea about the government's
intentions, the bank's Moscow office said Friday. Like the IMF, the
World Bank has suspended its loan program when the crisis hit.
	   Wolfensohn will arrive next Thursday and will meet with Primakov
and several Cabinet members, said Michael Carter, head of the World
Bank's Moscow office.
	   If Russia doesn't receive any foreign aid, the government said
it would have to print new money to cover a huge deficit. First
Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said earlier this week that
Russia would also be forced to negotiate restructuring of its
foreign debt.
	   A senior lawmaker said Friday that the government believes the
soonest ratification of the START II arms reduction agreement is
essential for getting the IMF aid. The parliament's lower house,
the State Duma, dragged its feet on ratifying the agreement already
ratified by the U.S. Senate, claiming it damages Russian security.

Media organizations haggle over bed prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ International broadcasters say Sydney's
Olympic organizers have gone overboard with estimated charges for
accommodation in the media village for the 2000 games.
	   SOCOG gave broadcasters an estimate of U.S. dlrs 150 for a
single and U.S. dlrs 210 for a double room in the media village,
according to the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper.
	   Patrick Furlong, the director of the Asian Broadcasting Union
told the paper the quality of accommodation was good but ``we did
feel the prices were too high.''
	   The rates for the village, which will accommodate about 6,000
media workers, are almost three times the rate of any hotel in the
Homebush Bay area. Broadcasters felt the rates were more
appropriate for a five-star hotel than temporary housing with
shared bathrooms.
	   A SOCOG spokesman said the rates were not official but had been
provided on request as estimates.
	   NBC television executive Alex Gilady told the newspaper that the
price would likely be cut.
	   ``My understanding was it was just a number pulled out of the
air,'' Gilady was quoted as saying.
	   European Broadcasting Union deputy head of operations Fernando
Pardo said ``most of the broadcasters considered (the cost) a
little high.'' He said he was confident the price would fall.

German conservatives meet to chart post-Kohl era

 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Pushed out of the chancellor's office by a
younger rival, Helmut Kohl now will make way for a new generation
in the center-right party he led with a firm grip for 25 years.
	   Six weeks after its crushing election defeat, the Christian
Democratic Union meets Saturday to elect Kohl's hand-picked
successor as party chairman and start charting a strategy for
renewal after the crushing electoral loss.
	   It's part of the nation's farewell to its longest-serving
chancellor this century, whose bulky presence defined German
politics for 16 years until his defeat by Social Democrat Gerhard
Schroeder on Sept. 27.
	   Kohl's protege and designated successor, Wolfgang Schaeuble, is
the point man for rejuvenating and modernizing the party after its
worst showing in a national election in 49 years.
	   ``One should not have any illusions about the enormity of the
challenge,'' he said recently.
	   For Kohl, 68, the handover caps a transition back to life as an
ordinary member of parliament. He will give a farewell speech to
the party faithful at Saturday's convention, which is due to name
him to the ceremonial post of honorary party chairman.
	   Kohl's defeat has opened the gate for dissenters who charge that
he let the party fall behind the national mood while pursuing
historic goals such as German unification and European monetary
union.
	   Some of the most vocal criticism comes from a loose group of
regional party leaders who chafed under Kohl's heavy hand, known as
the ``Wild Youth.'' With many in their 40s, their youth is relative
to Kohl's 68 years, and another indication of his refusal to allow
the next generation to assume leadership roles.
	   One of them, the CDU chief in Lower Saxony, 39-year-old
Christian Wulff, is expected to be elected to one of the four
deputy chairmanships. Most other top leadership posts are also
being cleared for fresher faces.
	   But with Kohl's persona no longer uniting the Christian
Democrats, the party is struggling for direction as it settles into
an opposition role for at least four years until the next election.
	   Many of the new leaders say the Christian Democrats must reach
out more to intellectuals, environmentalists and labor unions. Some

Literary prize season opens with Femina, Medicis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's much-awaited literary prize season kicked
off Friday with the prestigious Medicis prize going to a former
jockey for his novel about _ surprise _ horses.
	   The Femina prize, meanwhile, went to a love story set in 20th
century China.
	   The awards are widely regarded as consolation prizes for authors
eliminated from the race for France's most coveted prize, the
Goncourt, to be announced Monday.
	   The Medicis Foreign prize, which goes to the year's best novel
by a non-French writer, went to Britain's Jonathan Coe for ``The
House of Sleep.''
	   In ``Le Loup Mongol'' (The Mongolian Wolf), published by
Grasset, the author Homeric, born Frederic Dion, takes readers on a
breathless search for horse thieves in 12th-century Mongolia during
the era of Genghis Khan.
	   Dion is a former jockey and currently writes for the daily
Liberation about horse racing and equestrian events.
	   The Femina went to the Chinese-born Francois Cheng for ``Le Dit
de Tianyia'' (published by Albin Michel), the tale of a love
triangle set against Mao's Cultural Revolution and work camps.
	   The Medici winners earn 4,500 francs (about drls 800) each. The
Femina carries no monetary prize.

Kosovo guerrillas to establish civilian rule in rebel territory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels will
establish their own civilian rule in territory they control in the
province of Kosovo, they said Friday, showing their dissatisfaction
with the peace process.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the Kosovo Liberation
Army said its military command had decided to form local government
institutions, disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic
Albanian political leaders.
	   ``The purpose is to ease our army of the burden of civilian
administration in populated areas,'' the statement said, adding
that such a move was needed under the present conditions of war in
Kosovo.
	   The move signals defiance toward not only the Serbs but also
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and international officials
who are trying to broker a political solution on self-rule for the
separatist Serbian province. Serbia, in turn, is the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo's ethnic Albanians already have a president, Rugova, and
assembly that they elected but Serbia does not recognize, and a
``government-in-exile'' in Germany that is loosely tied to Rugova.
	   The KLA has accused Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders of
trying to sell short their goal of independence for Kosovo, which
is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic began a crackdown on armed separatists in the province in
February. It has killed hundreds, mostly ethnic Albanian civilians,
and made refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
	   Showing more support for the U.S.-led peace process, Rugova
noted Friday that Kosovo refugees are slowly returning to the homes
they fled in the fighting and are beginning to rebuild their
shattered lives.
	   ``There are first signs of life,'' he told reporters in
Pristina, three days after touring Kosovo's countryside for the
first time in nine years. ``There is a great willingness on the
part of the people to get back to their homes and properties. They
should be offered a bit of sense of security.''
	   Rugova voiced hope that the 2,000-member international
monitoring mission led by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe will provide that sense of safety. The
mission is expected to be launched later this month.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, involved in shuttle
diplomacy between Belgrade and Pristina, was back in Kosovo on
Friday.
	   Hill, who is the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said
in Belgrade on Thursday that the talks were producing hopeful signs
despite occasional skirmishes in Kosovo.
	   Rugova said they were working on forming an independent Kosovo
police force that would reflect Kosovo's ethnic structure.
	   There are new signs of defiance this week by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose government rejected attempts by the U.N.
war crimes tribunal to investigate charges of war crimes and
atrocities against civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louse Arbour.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, on Friday, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the alliance ``strongly supports Mrs. Arbour's
request.''
	   He called on Milosevic to cooperate fully with the international
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

French World Cup striker joins Glasgow Rangers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ French World Cup striker Stephane
Guivarc'h ended his brief stint with Newcastle on Friday by signing
a 3.5 million-pound (dlrs 5.8 million) deal with Scottish soccer
giants, Glasgow Rangers.
	   Guivarc'h joined Newcastle in June for 3.5 million pounds and
was a member of the French squad which won the France '98 World Cup
in July.
	   He scored on his debut for Newcastle but had limited
opportunites after Kenny Dalglish was fired as Newcastle manager
and replaced by Dutchman Ruud Gullit.
	   ``I was not part of Ruud Gullit's plans and knew I had to move
on,'' Guivarc'h said Friday.
	   Guivarc'h, who rejected an approach from Rangers in May, has
been included in the Rangers squad for Sunday's Scottish Premier
League match against St. Johnstone.
	   He completed a medical at Ibrox and trained with his new team
Friday before confirming the three-year deal.
	   The 28-year-old striker was the leading goal scorer in the
French league in 1997 and 1998 but his World Cup ambitions were
curtailed when he was injured in France's opening pool match
against South Africa.

Criticism over ruling on Islamic classes in Berlin schools
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from foreigner affairs commissioner &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A Berlin-based Islamic group that won the right to
offer religion classes in public schools has called on the city's
divided Islamic community to unite behind the effort.
	   A Berlin court ruled Wednesday that the Islamic Federation, an
umbrella group representing 12 of 70 mosques in Berlin, had the
right to organize voluntary religious instruction in public
schools, just like Catholic and Protestant churches.
	   The decision has unleashed controversy not only from German
conservatives skeptical of moves toward what they term
``multiculturalism,'' but also from two other Islamic associations
that consider the Islamic Federation too radical.
	   Its chairman, Nail Dural, also serves as vice chairman of Milli
Gorus, a group that advocates creating an Islamic state in Turkey.
	   The liberal Turkish Union called on Berlin's Muslim parents to
keep their children out of the religion classes, which are expected
to begin when the new school term opens next August.
	   ``The Islamic Federation is not a religious organization, but a
political one,'' Turkish Union chairman Kenan Kolat told the BZ
newspaper.
	   But the court, overturning a lower court's ruling, found that
the Islamic Federation's members represented a broad enough
spectrum of Islam to qualify it to be accepted by the school system
as a religious community.
	   Religious classes are mandatory in most German states, but
voluntary in Berlin and two other states. The classes generally
deal with Catholic and Protestant teachings, however, North
Rhine-Westphalia has offered courses on Islam since 1986.
	   In Berlin, the Islamic Federation called in a statement late
Thursday on all Islamic groups to join them in ``putting together
the religion lessons and filling them with life.''
	   The city's commissioner of foreigner affairs, Barbara John,
backed the call, warning that competition between Islamic groups
with different political leanings over how to teach the classes
could lead to ``a tiny religious war.''
	   Although Germany has by far the largest population of foreigners
in Europe _ 7 million, including 2 million Turks _ it has long had
difficulties coming to terms with the increasingly multiethnic
nature of German society, especially in big cities like Berlin.
	   In an attempt to promote integration, Germany's newly elected
center-left government last month announced plans to make it easier
for foreigners living here to acquire German citizenship.
	   John welcomed the Islam classes as another step toward
abandoning the ``illusion'' that Germany is not a ``land of
immigration.''
	   She also felt it could help overcome prejudices against Islam as
an anti-Western, dangerous religion.
	   ``There is some sort of `Islam-phobia' growing in European
countries which stems from all the terrible news we have on TV
nearly every week ... where Islamic terrorists are killing
people,'' she said.
	   Yet, she added, ``there are more than 30,000 Muslim children in
Berlin who have the same right to get religious instruction as
children'' of other faiths.
	   But Berlin's conservative interior minister, Joerg Schoenbohm,
criticized the ruling as contradictory to Germany's western
cultural tradition.

Chelsea's Brian Laudrup to play for FC Copenhagen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Chelsea's Danish striker Brian
Laudrup is returning to Denmark, FC Copenhagen said Friday.
	   Laudrup has agreed on a 2 1/2 year contcat with the Copenhagen
team, club manager Flemming Oestergaard said in a statement.
	   ``The negotiations between Chelsea, Brian Laudrup and FC
Copenhagen have been concluded today,'' Oestergaard said.
	   The statement to the Copenhagen Stock Exchange gave no details
of a transfer sum or details of the contract. A press conference
would be held Tuesday in Copenhagen, it said.
	   The announcement confirmed recent news media reports that the
younger Laudrup was leaving the English Premier League team.
	   Ironically, Laudrup scored the deciding goal against FC
Copenhagen Thursday enabling Chelsea to advance to the
quarterfinals of the Cup Winners Cup.
	   After the game, Oestergaard said Laudrup likely would begin in
Copenhagen on Dec. 1.
	   On Danish radio, Laudrup said Friday he would take some time off
before playing for FC Copenhagen, adding he only had had two week's
holiday after the World Cup quarterfinals this summer.
	   Laudrup, who quit Denmark's national team after it was ousted
from the World Cup by Brazil, has said he wanted to go home because
is homesick after a decade-long professional career abroad.
	   His professional career began with Danish club Brondby and moved
on to Germany where he played for Bayer 05 Uerdingen and FC Bayern
Munich. Laudrup later played for Italian powerhouses Fiorentina and
Milan before joining the former Scottish champions of Glasgow
Rangers.
	   Laudrup joined the Danish side in 1987 and scored 21 goals in 82
matches.
	   His elder brother, Michael Laudrup, also retired after the World
Cup following a standout 17-year career.

Sudan wants Egyptians to farm land
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's powerful spiritual leader on
Friday urged Egyptians to migrate in ``millions'' to Sudan to
cultivate government farm lands left fallow because of scarcity of
farmers.
	   Sudan ``invites Egyptians to come in millions to make use of
millions of acres (hectares) that are not cultivated because Sudan
is underpopulated,'' Hassan Turabi, who is also the Parliament
speaker, told a gathering of doctors in Khartoum.
	   His comments were broadcast by state television. Turabi has
extended similar invitations in the past but without results.
	   Sudan covers 1 million square miles (2.6 million square
kilometers), making it Africa's largest country, and its population
is estimated at 28 million.
	   Egypt's area is 385,229 square miles (1 million square
kilometers), but about 90 percent of its 60 million people live on
5 percent of the land along the Nile river. The rest is mostly
desert.
	   Turabi has long maintained that Egyptians are master farmers,
reaping the benefit of Nile Valley, the most fertile land in the
world.
	   He indicated that the Egyptians who take up his offer will be
allowed to own lands. But he did not specify the areas where arable
land has been left uncultivated.
	   Egyptian farmers often migrate to other countries in search of
work but migration of farmers is not known. In September, Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi also said he will accept 1 million Egyptians
to cultivate land watered by a new gigantic irrigation project but
it is not known how many went.
	   Turabi's comments come as relations between Egypt and Sudan are
at a low point over Egyptian allegations that Sudan supports Muslim
militants seeking to topple the Egyptian government.
	   Also Friday, Sudanese President Hassan al-Bashir talked on the
telephone with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah. Reports say the tiny
Gulf state is trying to patch up relations between Egypt and Sudan.
	   The official Sudan News Agency said al-Bashir and Abdullah
discussed ``security and stability in the region.''

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Horace Engdahl, one of Sweden's top
literary critics, has been named head of the Swedish Academy, the
organization that chooses the Nobel Literature Prize winner, the
academy announced Friday.
	   Engdahl will replace Sture Allen, who is retiring as the

the post since 1986, will turn 70 on Dec. 31.
	   Along with selecting the winners of the prestigious prize, the
academy pursues other projects, notably a decades-long effort to
put together a definitive scholarly dictionary of the Swedish

Holbrooke, Kissinger inaugurate Berlin's American Academy
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany added critical weight to NATO pressure on
Slobodan Milosevic, bringing a turning point to the alliances'
success in winning concessions from the Yugloslav president on
Kosovo, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Friday.
	   He praised newly elected Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for
swiftly joining the alliances' airstrike threat.
	   Holbrooke, who as a former U.S. ambassador to Germany led
inaugural ceremonies for the American Academy in Berlin, told the
audience of his struggle in early October to convince Milosevic
that NATO strikes were a real possibility.
	   Milosevic was skeptical, Holbrooke said, because alliance
members Germany and Italy had not signed off on airstrikes. Italy's
communist party was pushing for a diplomatic solution, and Germany,
after recent elections, was in the midst of a change in government.
	   Germany resolved to join the strikes after Schroeder and his new
foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, met with U.S. President Bill
Clinton just days after the Sept. 27 vote. With Germany's key
backing, Holbrooke said he was able to tell Milosevic, ``It is over
... There will be an activation order in 72 hours'' for NATO
strikes.
	   Under the resulting Kosovo accord, Milosevic agreed to withdraw
troops and police from the province, which is in the south of the
Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia, and to hold talks with
majority ethnic Albanian leaders on restoring Kosovo's autonomy.
Milosevic also agreed to accept NATO aerial reconnaissance flights
and monitors on the ground to make sure he is complying with accord
conditions, including a ceasefire.
	   Holbrooke, the architect of peace in Bosnia and Clinton's
nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was ending his
tour as ambassador to Germany in 1994 when occupying U.S. troops
left Berlin and the American Academy was planned to help promote
German-U.S. friendship.
	   The privately funded academy, located in a lakeside villa once
used as a recreation center by the U.S. Army's Berlin Brigade,
provides yearlong fellowships to American scholars and artists.
	   Other speakers at the inauguration were former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, German cultural minister Michael Naumann,
Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen and U.S. Ambassador John Kornblum.

Unemployment hits 14-year low for roaring Irish economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The number of jobless people in Ireland's
strong-performing economy has hit a 14-year low, the latest
statistics showed Friday.
	   Unemployment in this nation of 3.6 million stood at 212,459 in
October, the lowest since 1984 and down more than 31,500 in the
past 12 months, the largest annual drop on record.
	   Overall, unemployment stood at 8.7 percent, compared to 13.2
percent in October 1994.
	   Throughout the 1990s, the Irish economy has grown more quickly
than the rest of western Europe, thanks to a combination of strong
U.S. and European Union investment, particularly in computer
electronics, financial services and pharmaceuticals.
	   Gross domestic product is averaging about 9 percent and
projected to grow in 1999 to more than 11 percent.
	   ``We are in a period of strong economic growth, with our first
overall budget surplus in 51 years,'' said Seamus Brennan, the
government's chief whip, who predicted that the jobs bonanza would
continue.

Budapest mayor launches attack on government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EVA KEKES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Mayor Gabor Demszky angrily accused the
central government Friday of delivering a slap in the face to
Budapest residents by backing out of an agreement to help fund a
new subway line.
	   Demszky said he was surprised by the decision because building
the subway was a strong plank in the election platform of
challenger Janos Latorcai in last month's local elections.
	   Latorcai, a member of the Young Democrats-Civic Party led by
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, lost to the incumbent Demszky, whose
liberal Free Democrats are in opposition to Orban in parliament.
	   ``Viktor Orban and his government deceived this city,'' Demszky
said. ``With yesterday's decision, they have slapped one-fifth of
the nation across the face.''
	   Budapest has a population of 2 million in a country of 10
million.
	   Last week, Orban nixed plans to build a new National Theater,
although work had already begun. The decision leaves a gaping hole
in the middle of downtown.
	   Among those surprised by the latest move are officials at the
European Investment Bank, which was ready to lend ECU 200 million
(dlrs 234 million) to the subway project. A contract for the first
ECU 50 million (dlrs 58.5 million) was signed in April.
	   ``We have a resolution from the government which says that in
1999 a contribution will be made to the Budapest metro,'' Emmanuel
Lindekens, the EIB's senior loan officer responsible for Hungary,
told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   Orban's confrontational style is ruffling many feathers.
	   He has disregarded a law passed by the previous government to
raise pensions and has told the Supreme Court he will not allow the
implementation of a law establishing regional courts, designed to
speed up the justice system.
	   ``Real leaders build on cooperation, rather than division,''
said Demszky, expressing hope the government ``will learn this.''

Lebanese-American businessman indicted for visiting Israel

 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Tamraz lives in U.S. graf 6; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Authorities on Friday leveled another
charge in absentia against a Lebanese-American businessman,
accusing him of visiting Israel and concluding a trade deal there.
	   Military Magistrate Riad Talieh said in an indictment that Roger
Tamraz violated the rules on the Arab boycott of Israel when he
entered Israel without permission from the Lebanese authorities and
struck a commercial deal with the Jewish state.
	   Lebanon is technically at war with Israel and forbids contacts
with it.
	   Tamraz had previously been sentenced in absentia to three years
in jail for collaboration with Israel. That case was based on a
reported meeting in Paris between Tamraz and an Israeli diplomat,
David Kimche.
	   The latest indictment was issued following reports published in
Lebanese newspapers on Sept. 9, quoting the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz that Tamraz had visited Israel and concluded a trade deal
with it.
	   Talieh demanded that Tamraz, who lives in the United States, be
given an unspecified jail term with hard labor.
	   Tamraz has been wanted in Lebanon since 1989 for allegedly
embezzling up to dlrs 200 million while he was chairman of the Al
Mashreq Bank when it went bankrupt during the 1975-90 civil war.

Fire erupts in casino of newly renovated Atlantis resort in
</HEADLINE>
Bahamas &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ A brief fire erupted early Friday at the
casino of the new Atlantis mega-resort on Paradise Island, but it
was quickly contained and the main hotel complex was not affected,
the police said.
	   There were no injuries, Police Assistant Commissioner Paul
Farquharson said. ``There was no disruption of operations. It was
contained very quickly. Things are back to normal,'' he said.
	   Police blocked the bridge from Nassau, the Bahamian capital, to
the island of tourist resorts, and the telephone at Atlantis rang
with no reply.
	   It appeared that the fire did not reach a new hotel attached to
the casino by a passage. The 23-story, 1,200-room Royal Towers
dwarfs everything in the Bahamas and is the showcase of a dlrs
750-million renovation. The plushest suites are to rent for dlrs
25,000 a night when the it opens next month.
	   The resort _ with opulent pools, gardens with rope bridges and
underwater tunnels through tanks filled with sharks _ is a
celebration of the marine life of the mythical lost continent of
Atlantis. It is the brainchild of South Africa mogul Sol Kerzner,
whose Sun International Hotels owns properties in the United
States, Mauritius and France.

French foreign minister calls on Israel to move on peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment from Jewish group

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on Friday
deplored the latest violence in Israel, but called on the country's
leaders to move ahead anyway with the accord reached with the
Palestinians last month.
	   ``If Israeli authorities really don't want to relaunch the peace
process, they will always find tragic events to justify their
dilatory attitude,'' Vedrine said in a statement.
	   A Jewish group responded angrily to Vedrine's comments.
	   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions (CRIF) said in
a statement they were ``surprised by the comments in the wake of
the third terrorist attack in ten days aimed at massacring Israeli
civilians.''
	   Two people were killed and 21 wounded when a suicide car bomb
went off in a Jerusalem market Friday. Israel's Cabinet immediately
suspended implementation of the peace accord reached with the
Palestinian Authority at Wye, Maryland last month.

Police seize major drug stash en route to Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying truck was coming from the
Netherlands, via Germany, background on other ecstasy seizures. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUNKIRK, France (AP) _ Customs officers seized a huge stash of
drugs _ including 400,000 ecstasy tablets _ in a truck en route to
Britain from the Netherlands, police said Friday.
	   Police found the drugs on Oct. 28 in a British-licensed truck
during routine checks on a highway on the outskirts of this
northern port town.
	   Of the 400,000 ecstasy tablets, the vast majority _ 335,000 _
were said to be of a new brand uncommon in Europe and 100 times
stronger than usual, with effects similar to LSD.
	   The truck also was carrying 201 kilograms (442 pounds) of
cannabis resin, 220 kilograms (484 pounds) of hashish and 92
kilograms (202 pounds) of amphetamine sulphate.
	   The driver, identified only as a 59-year-old Briton, was
arrested and is in custody in Dunkirk. He denied any knowledge of
the drugs.
	   Police said he had been previously arrested in southern France
in 1990 for drug trafficking.
	   It wasn't clear why police waited until Friday to announce the
seizure.
	   The north of France is a major conduit for drug traffickers
working between Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain.
	   In March, French police seized 350,000 ecstasy tablets hidden in
a British truck traveling through the Channel Tunnel.
	   In 1997, French customs seized 150,000 ecstasy tablets, and in
1998 almost one million, the majority in Dunkirk.

Japan unsure if public spending will perk economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS final two grafs for three new grafs to UPDATE with EPA
head quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's massive public works spending package might
not be enough to spur domestic demand and power the sagging economy
out of recession, the government said Friday.
	   The Economic Planning Agency's monthly report said the economy
was still floundering in its worst downturn since World War II,
with the outlook darkened by unstable currency markets and
slowdowns overseas.
	   Despite a government stimulus package, private capital spending
is still sagging because of concerns about the long-term prospects
for the economy, the EPA said.
	   One bright spot for the Japanese economy _ exports _ are also in
danger. Exports had been powered by steady U.S. and European demand
as well as a relatively weak yen until a month ago.
	   But the recent surge of the yen combined with signs of slowing
economic growth overseas have posed new risks for Japan, said
Takashi Omori, director of the Economic Planning Agency's domestic
economic affairs section.
	   ``There are signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and there is
uncertainty in financial markets due to Latin America,'' Omori
said.
	   Flagging overseas demand is particularly worrisome because Japan
suffers from stagnant domestic demand, as consumers cut back
spending and corporations reduce investment.
	   The government announced Thursday that household spending dipped
1.5 percent in September from a year earlier, stretching the
longest-ever streak of such declines to the 11th month.
	   ``Private sector sentiment is chilled. Although government
expenditure is on the rise, we have to watch closely how much it
will act to stimulate demand in the private sector,'' Omori said.
	   The EPA said industrial output is still declining, but noted
this time that the pace of decline has leveled off somewhat.
	   The report also said for the first time that the effects of the
16.7 trillion yen (dlrs 141.5 billion) supplemental budget enacted
last summer have started to show up in the economy.
	   Underscoring that point, public works orders to the 50 largest
companies rose 19.5 percent in September from a year ago, marking
the first year-on-year increase in 15 months.
	   EPA head Taichi Sakaiya said in a national television program
Friday that he expected the economy to bottom out later this year.
	   He also said the government stimulus package, to be announced
Nov. 16, will be ``quite a bit'' bigger than the initially proposed
16.7 trillion yen, although he would not elaborate or specify a
figure.
	   Sakaiya ruled out lowering Japan's 5 percent consumption tax, as
some politicians have suggested. The tax, which went up from 3
percent in April 1997, has discouraged consumer spending.

Strikes end at Eiffel Tower, National Library
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates BC-France-Eiffel Tower &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Tourists were climbing the Eiffel Tower again
Friday after a weeklong strike ended, and disgruntled workers at
the new National Library agreed to hit the stacks again next week.
	   The strikes were among the latest social protests to
inconvenience Parisians. High school students demonstrated
Thursday, and some transport workers walked off the job Monday.
	   The Eiffel Tower had turned away more than 8,000 visitors daily
since last Friday because of 200 striking workers demanding the
hiring of more staff.
	   On Thursday evening, the tower's management accepted workers'
demands to accelerate the hiring of seven new employees, its press
office said.
	   The strike, which began last Friday, cost the Eiffel Tower an
estimated 300,000 francs (dlrs 55,000) per day.
	   November is a slack period for tourists. Some 310,000 people
visited the Eiffel Tower in November 1997, compared to 850,000
visitors in August.
	   Library workers, meanwhile, fed up with ongoing glitches in the
new automated book delivery system, had been manning picket lines
since Oct. 20. Thousands of readers and scholars, including
visitors from abroad, were turned away.
	   Library management agreed to workers' demands to close the
library on Mondays through January, and on Monday mornings through
the end of June.
	   Workers said they were still learning to handle the library's
high-tech computerized system of recovering documents and other
research materials.
	   About 80 percent of France's 11 million volumes have been
transferred from the Richelieu facility in central Paris to the new
library overlooking the Seine in southeastern Paris.

Russia gets dlrs 800 million loan from Japan, reaches deal with
</HEADLINE>
creditors &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Western banker confirming agreement in new 12th
graf; ADDS dropped word 'billion' in 3rd graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government on Friday won an offer from
Japan for a dlrs 800 million loan and reached a crucial agreement
with foreign creditors over treasury bill debt that Russia froze in
August.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi promised the loan in a
telephone conversation Friday with his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny
Primakov, the Russian government said in a statement. The Japanese
Foreign Ministry confirmed the offer.
	   The credit is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion international bailout
package lined up this summer by a group of international lenders
led by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
	   The IMF provided only dlrs 4.8 billion and froze further
disbursements after Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on
its domestic treasury debts in August _ two actions that prompted
President Boris Yeltsin to fire his government, crippled Russia's
markets and sent the economy into a tailspin.
	   Primakov and Obuchi also discussed the Japanese premier's trip
to Moscow, scheduled for next Thursday. Obuchi is to hold talks
with Yeltsin, who is recovering at a Black Sea resort from
exhaustion and high blood pressure. He is to return to Moscow to
see Obuchi.
	   The IMF and other lenders have demanded that the Russian
government reach an agreement with foreign holders of its domestic
treasury bills, known as GKOs. Russia defaulted on what was then
dlrs 40 billion in ruble-denominated debt in August.
	   In talks with Russian officials in London on Friday, foreign
creditors agreed to accept ruble-denominated paper in compensation
for the treasuries, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said.
	   He said the Russian government, in turn, will drop attempts to
include dlrs 7 billion debt in forward contracts owed by Russian
banks in its restructuring scheme.
	   Foreign investors, who hold nearly a third of the treasuries
debt, rejected initial restructuring terms that would have left
them holding paper worth only a few cents on the dollar.
	   ``We have an agreement in principle,'' said Kasyanov, speaking
from his London hotel room to Dow Jones Newswires. ``All the
restructuring will only be in rubles.''
	   Kasyanov wouldn't elaborate on terms of the restructuring,
saying it was still ``premature.''
	   Western bankers in Moscow confirmed a deal Friday. They said
creditors had decided to accept ruble-denominated paper because the
Russian government's dollar offer was nearly worthless.
	   The agreement came as the United States and Russia were on the
verge of reaching agreement on 3.1 million tons of food aid on
Friday.
	   The IMF has demanded that Primakov's government provide a
detailed plan for dealing with the crisis and expressed
dissatisfaction with a blueprint the Cabinet finally delivered last
week. It said the new plan is short on specifics and heavy with
state intervention into the economy _ something it has staunchly
opposed.
	   The government promised to release the text of its plan on
Thursday, but said Friday that it would take until next week to
finalize and edit it for publication.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn will stop in Russia for a
one-day visit next week to get an idea about the government's
intentions, the bank's Moscow office said Friday. Like the IMF, the
World Bank has suspended its loan program when the crisis hit.
	   Wolfensohn will arrive next Thursday and will meet with Primakov
and several Cabinet members, said Michael Carter, head of the World
Bank's Moscow office.
	   If Russia doesn't receive any foreign aid, the government said
it would have to print new money to cover a huge deficit. First
Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said earlier this week that
Russia would also be forced to negotiate restructuring of its
foreign debt.
	   A senior lawmaker said Friday that the government believes the
soonest ratification of the START II arms reduction agreement is
essential for getting the IMF aid. The parliament's lower house,
the State Duma, dragged its feet on ratifying the agreement already
ratified by the U.S. Senate, claiming it damages Russian security.

England midfielder fined for hand gesture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Updates with reaction from Liverpool coaches

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Ince was fined 1,500 pounds (dlrs 2,500) by
the Football Association on Friday for making an obscene gesture
after being sent during England's Euro 2000 qualifier against
Sweden.
	   The Liverpool midfielder, who made the gesture as he walked off
the pitch in Stockholm on Sept. 5, was found guilty of misconduct
by an FA disciplinary commission.
	   The FA said Ince apologized for his action.
	   ``Both the player and Liverpool FC pointed out he had already
been punished with a suspension by UEFA arising from the
dismissal,'' the statement said.
	   Ince was sent off after receiving a second yellow card in
England's 2-1 defeat in Stockholm. He later claimed his gesture was
made towards England's assistant coach John Gorman, but coach Glenn
Hoddle later insisted that was not the case.
	   He received an automatic two match international ban, but a UEFA
disciplinary committee extended the ban to three matches when it
found Ince guilty of making inappropriate comments to the referee.
	   Liverpool co-coaches Gerard Houllier and Roy Evans criticized
the FA for punishing Ince a third time for the same incident.
	   Houllier said the fine was ``silly.''
	   ``The worse thing for a player is being banned,'' Houllier said.
``He's got those three matches out and he can't play. What is the
point of fining him?''

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Horace Engdahl, one of Sweden's top
literary critics, has been named head of the Swedish Academy, the
organization that chooses the Nobel Literature Prize winner, the
academy announced Friday.
	   Engdahl will replace Sture Allen, who is retiring as the
academy's permanent secretary because of age. Allen, who has held
the post since 1986, will turn 70 on Dec. 31.
	   Along with selecting the winners of the prestigious prize, the
academy pursues other projects, notably a decades-long effort to
put together a definitive scholarly dictionary of the Swedish
language.
	   Engdahl, 49, was elected to the academy in October 1997, and is
its second-youngest member.

Serb police say five Albanian guerrillas killed in shoot-out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Five ethnic Albanian guerrillas were
killed Friday in a shoot-out with Serb police, according to a Serb
media statement.
	   The details of the deaths could not be immediately confirmed,
but previous statements about similar violence have accurately
reported the number of casualties.
	   According to the statement issued by the Serb Media Center, a
mouthpiece for the Serb government, a police patrol in southern
Kosovo came under attack from guerrillas on Friday morning.
	   The statement said police fired back, killing five of the
attackers, who were dressed in uniforms of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and had automatic rifles and mortars.
	   No policemen were injured, the statement said. It added that two
vehicles used by the attackers, one with Kosovo license plates and
one with foreign plates, contained mortars, hand grenades, an
assault rifle and ammunition.
	   Two other Albanians were killed Thursday, according to Albanians
interviewed in central Kosovo. Police reported one Albanian
guerrilla died in a shoot-out near Klina, and uniformed KLA
fighters were seen preparing for a funeral Friday near Buroja in
the same area.
	   Albanians in the region gave a similar account, saying two men
were attacked by police while driving. One died and another was
injured, they said.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Monaco and Olympique Marseille will make history
later this month as the first two French clubs to play each other
in European competition.
	   And they're not happy about it.
	   Friday's draw in Geneva for the third round of the UEFA Cup also
matched Spanish sides Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid.
	   Monaco and Real Sociedad will be at home for the first leg games
Nov. 24. The second leg is scheduled for Dec. 8.
	   In past years, UEFA has separated teams from the same country.
But this time, with four teams each from France and Spain, and at
least three from Italy, it was impossible to keep clubs apart.
	   ``Monaco is a team which is like Roma, Parma or Liverpool _ a
team we really didn't want to draw,'' Olympique Marseille's
Jean-Michel Roussier said. ``It's a shame for French soccer that we
should be together.''
	   ``It's not the worst draw but it's certainly not the best,''
Monaco vice president Max Poggi said. ``For French soccer this is
really not a good draw. It's a shame but that's the luck of the
draw.''
	   By coincidence, the same two clubs were to meet Friday night in
an important French league match. Marseille tops the French
standings, while Monaco is in fourth place.
	   Italian clubs, which have won seven of the last 10 UEFA Cups,
were fortunate not to have been drawn against each other.
	   Title favorite Parma was pitted against Scottish side Glasgow
Rangers, Roma against FC Zurich and Bologna vs. Real Bettis. The
first legs will be played in Glasgow, Zurich and Bologna.
	   Fiorentina, a fourth Italian club, will likely not make it into
the third round. The club's second-round, second-leg game against
Swiss side Grasshoppers was abandoned at halftime Tuesday after an
off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device thrown
from the stands in Salerno, Italy.
	   UEFA is scheduled to announce the outcome of the game Sunday,
with Fiorentina facing the likelihood of a 3-0 forfeit defeat and
the possibility of a European ban.
	   Whichever team is selected to advance will host French club
Bordeaux in the first leg of the third round.
	   The fourth French club, Lyon, is home vs. Belgian side Brugges.
	   It's the first time four French clubs have reached the third
round of the UEFA Cup. A French team has never won the competition,
while Real Madrid was the last Spanish club to capture the UEFA Cup
in 1986.
	   No German clubs made it to the final 16 this year.
	   Liverpool, England's only survivor, was drawn against Spanish
side Celta Vigo, which eliminated English Premier League leader
Aston Villa from the competition on Tuesday. Celta is at home for
the first leg.
	   ``It's a very difficult draw,'' said Peter Robinson, executive
vice chairman of Liverpool. ``Celta Vigo has already disposed of
Aston Villa, currently leader of the English league. I just hope
that our good fortune against Spanish clubs will continue.''
	   ``I may be wrong, but I don't believe Liverpool has ever been
eliminated by a Spanish club.''
	   Horacio Gomez Araujo injected some humor, which he can afford to
these days as the president of one of Spain's hottest teams.
	   ``From a sporting situation, we would have preferred an easier
team. But from an economic point of view, this game is very good,''
he said.
	   ``To be honest, we would have liked Zurich if we'd had a choice.
Switzerland is closer and has better chocolate.''
	   The draw for the quarterfinals of the Champion Cup, UEFA Cup and
Cup Winners Cup is Dec. 16.

Lenin's statue bombed in Belarusian town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A monument to Soviet founder Vladimir
Lenin in a Belarusian city was damaged by a makeshift bomb on
Friday, on the eve of the anniversary of 1917 Bolshevik revolution,
officials said.
	   The gray granite statue has adorned the city of Zhodino, 55
kilometers (34 miles) east of the capital, Minsk, for 40 years.
	   Valery Kashevsky, the town mayor, said police had launched a
search for the unidentified attackers. In the past, unknown vandals
splashed paint on the monument, he said.
	   Hundreds of Lenin monuments have been removed from the streets
of cities in Russia and other former Soviet republics, but Belarus
has kept them all.
	   They are protected under law as ``historic and cultural
monuments,'' with vandalism punishable by up to five years in
prison.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, an admirer of Soviet
times, has also pushed for a nationwide referendum that would
re-establish the Soviet-style red flag and emblem as state symbols.
	   Belarus continues to celebrate Revolution Day as a national
holiday.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A U.S. Army RC-12 carrying two people
crashed near the German town of Sommerhausen in southern Germany
late Friday morning, killing both pilots, the U.S. Army's 5th Corps
in Heidelberg said.
	   The plane was on a training flight when it crashed in an
unpopulated area between Sommerhausen and Erlach, the Army said in
a statement.
	   It was not immediately clear what kind of a mission the aircraft
was on, said spokesman Capt. Martin Downie.
	   The plane burst into flames upon impact, police in nearby
Wuerzburg reported.
	   U.S. and Germany rescue authorities are at the scene. The
identities of the pilots were not released, pending notification of
family members, said Downie.
	   The twin-engine turbo prop, made by Beechcraft, was believed to
have taken off from Wiesbaden, where part of the 5th Corps is
based. The plane, one of the Army's older models, carries out
reconnaissance missions, among others.

Chile recalls ambassador to Spain to protest Pinochet extradition

request &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile recalled its ambassador to Spain on
Friday to protest the Spanish government's decision to request the
extradition of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   The Spanish Council of Ministers on Friday approved a request
from Judge Baltasar Garzon to extradite Pinochet from Britain to
Spain to try him for genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza admitted that the decision
clearly affects bilateral relations with Madrid but said the ties
will not be broken or suspended.
	   He said the decision expresses Chile's displeasure over the
Spanish government's decision.
	   Ambassador Sergio Pizarro is expected in Santiago over the
weekend, Insulza said.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in Britain at the request of
Garzon, for the human rights abuses during his 1973-90
dictatorship.
	   A visibly angered Insulza said the Council of Minister acted
``as a mere mailbox for judge Garzon's requests.''
	   The Chilean government has sought to secure his release,
claiming he has diplomatic immunity and saying Spanish courts have
no jurisdiction over events in Chile.

Fortum nine-month profit falls to dlrs 294 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Citing low prices of crude oil and
cheaper electricity, Finland's leading energy company, Fortum,
reported Friday a drop in nine-month pretax profit to 1.47 billion
markkaa (dlrs 294 million), from 2.1 billion markkaa for the same
period in 1997.
	   The group's net sales also fell from January to September, to 38
billion markkaa (dlrs 7.6 billion) from 43 billion markkaa last
year.
	   During the period, crude oil prices were down by a third and
heavy rainfall increased the supply of inexpensive
hydroelectricity, which kept electricity prices down, Fortum Corp.
said.
	   ``Low crude prices ... and a low market price for electricity
will also be reflected in the business during the last quarter,''
the company said, adding that it expected a weaker result this year
than in 1997.
	   Fortum Corp. was formed in February when the state-owned oil and
gas company, Neste, merged with a leading Finnish power concern,
IVO. The two companies employ a total of some 19,000 people.
	   The Finnish government owns 97 percent of Fortum Corp.

Teen jailed with adults for crime committed when six
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ A 13-year-old Gypsy girl from a
desperately poor family of 24 was jailed in a maximum security
prison for a crime she committed when she was six, it was reported
Friday.
	   Both her jailing and alleged mistreatment during her custody
among adult prisoners, dealt a new blow to the credibility of a
legal system already reeling from prostitution and corruption
scandals in the police department.
	   Compounding the embarrassment was a report that the family's 22
children had been singled out for state assistance in 1993. At the
time, the father was given his current job as a gardener's
assistant at city hall and the family put on welfare.
	   According to media reports, the girl was arrested at a police
station in this northern port city on Oct. 31 when she went with
her father to register for an identity card.
	   Police told the girl's father she had been convicted in absentia
three years ago for allegedly robbing 45,000 drachmas (dlrs 150)
from a department store together with five older children in 1991.
	   She was arrested and sent to an adult holding facility. Police
apparently were unaware that the custody laws in effect when she
was convicted have now been abolished.
	   Legal experts also said that courts have always been banned from
convicting children under the age of seven. Instead the are usually
place into special supervision programs.
	   Police at the holding facility then reportedly placed the girl
in a van with adult prisoners and drove her 500 kilometers (312
miles) to the Korydallos maximum security prison on the outskirts
of Athens.
	   A lawyer representing the girl told local media that she was
allegedly sexually harassed by male inmates traveling with her in
the van.
	   But although Korydallos officials dispute claims she was held
for five days and say she was released immediately, local media
reported that she was transferred from Korydallos to Salonica in
another police van Thursday.
	   A public prosecutor who found out about the case personally
intervened Thursday, calling a judge who ordered the girl released
and returned to her family.

Japan, Thailand agree on dlrs 2.3 bil aid package: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo agreed to extend a dlrs 2.3 billion aid
package to Thailand Friday, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   More than dlrs 1 billion of that will be part of the new dlrs 30
billion aid recently promised last month by Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa to help troubled Asian economies, the report said quoting
unidentified Japanese Finance Ministry officials.
	   The package will also include money from the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank, it said.
	   Thailand plans to use the aid mainly to cover monetary shortages
and to carry out economic stimulus measures, Kyodo said.
	   A joint statement issued Friday by the Japanese and Thai
governments said Tokyo ``expressed its firm commitment to provide
strong support for Thailand in its restructuring efforts.''
	   A Japanese government delegation has been visiting Bangkok
Thursday and Friday to meet with Thai finance officials. Japanese
officials welcomed the progress that Thailand has made in financial
reforms.

Fortum nine-month profit falls to dlrs 294 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Finland's leading energy company,
Fortum, reported Friday a drop in nine-month pretax profit to 1.47
billion markkaa (dlrs 294 million), from 2.1 billion markkaa for
the same period in 1997. It cited low prices of crude oil and
cheaper electricity as the reason for the drop.
	   The group's net sales also fell from January to September, to 38
billion markkaa (dlrs 7.6 billion) from 43 billion markkaa last
year.
	   During the period, crude oil prices were down by a third and
heavy rainfall increased the supply of inexpensive
hydroelectricity, which kept electricity prices down, Fortum Corp.
said.
	   Fortum Corp. was formed in February when the state-owned oil and
gas company, Neste, merged with a leading Finnish power concern,
IVO. The two companies employ 19,000 people.
	   The Finnish government owns 97 percent of Fortum Corp.

Investigators: Aftermath posed no significant health risk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Fumes and smoke from the deadly
crash of an El Al Boeing 747 cargo jet that plowed into a high-rise
apartment building in 1992 posed virtually no long-term health
risk, the government said Friday.
	   Hundreds of residents in Amsterdam's Bijlmermeer neighborhood
still complain of ill health ranging from chronic fatigue and
breathing difficulties to cancer. Most blame their troubles on the
Oct. 4, 1992 crash, which killed at least 43 people, most on the
ground.
	   Israeli authorities recently admitted the plane was carrying
chemicals that can be used in the manufacture of the nerve gas
sarin.
	   Dutch Health Minister Els Borst ordered an investigation into
the possible effects of the crash in an attempt to find the cause
of the health complaints.
	   The National Institute of Public Health and the Environment
concluded that a small quantity of depleted uranium which was used
as ballast in the stricken plane _ and which burned up in the crash
_ could be expected to cause cancer in just one in 100 million
people.
	   Other material, including heavy metals, consumed in the inferno
also posed a minimal risk, according to the report.
	   But the findings, based on an analysis of the plane's cargo and
the possible effects of it being burned, did little to allay the
fears of victims. Scores of people have angrily demanded a full
accounting of what the Israel-bound plane was carrying when it went
down shortly after takeoff from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
	   ``I find it very premature for people to publish these findings
into the health risks of the plane's cargo without actually having
investigated the people affected,'' Andre Bos, a spokesman for the
victims, told the Amsterdam daily Het Parool.
	   The report was handed to a parliamentary commission
investigating all aspects of the crash. The panel, which has the
power to subpoena witnesses, is trying to determine the exact
cargo.

Serb police kill five Albanian guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Five ethnic Albanian guerrillas were
killed Friday in a shoot-out with Serb police, according to a Serb
media statement. It was the highest reported death toll in any
clash since an Oct. 12 agreement that established a de-facto cease
fire.
	   The details of the deaths could not be immediately confirmed,
but previous statements about similar violence have accurately
reported the number of casualties.
	   According to the statement issued by the Serb Media Center, a
mouthpiece for the Serb government, a police patrol in southern
Kosovo came under attack from guerrillas on Friday morning.
	   The statement said police fired back, killing five of the
attackers, who were dressed in uniforms of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and had automatic rifles and mortars.
	   No policemen were injured, the statement said. It added that two
vehicles used by the attackers, one with Kosovo license plates and
one with foreign plates, contained mortars, hand grenades, an
assault rifle and ammunition.
	   Two other Albanians were killed Thursday, according to Albanians
interviewed in central Kosovo. Police reported one Albanian
guerrilla died in a shoot-out near Klina, and uniformed KLA
fighters were seen preparing for a funeral Friday near Buroja in
the same area.
	   Albanians in the region gave a similar account, saying two men
were attacked by police while driving. One died and another was
injured, they said.
	   The rebels were not formally part of the Oct. 12 agreement
signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that committed him
to pulling back Yugoslav troops and Serb police from Kosovo, an
Albanian majority province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   Showing their dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process,
ethnic Albanian rebels said Friday they intend to establish their
own civilian rule in territory they control in the province.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the Kosovo Liberation
Army said its military command had decided to form local government
institutions, disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic
Albanian political leaders.
	   ``The purpose is to ease our army of the burden of civilian
administration in populated areas,'' the guerrillas' statement
read, adding that such a move was needed in present conditions of
war in Kosovo.
	   The move signals defiance toward not only the Serbs but also
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and international officials
who are trying to broker a joint political solution on self-rule
for the separatist province. Rugova has been elected Kosovo
president in elections authorities consider invalid, and an
Albanian assembly also exists, though it is rarely convened and
also is not recognized by Serbian authorities.
	   The KLA has accused Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders of
trying to sell short their goal of independence for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   Rugova noted Friday that Kosovo refugees are slowly returning to
the homes they fled in the fighting and are beginning to rebuild
their shattered lives.
	   ``There are first signs of life,'' he told reporters in
Pristina, three days after touring Kosovo's countryside for the
first time in nine years. ``There is a great willingness on the
part of the people to get back to their homes and properties. They
should be offered a bit of sense of security.''
	   Rugova voiced hope that the 2,000-strong international
monitoring mission led by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe will provide that sense of safety. The
mission is expected to be launched later this month.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, involved in shuttle
diplomacy between Belgrade and Pristina, was back in Kosovo Friday.
	   Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia,
said in Belgrade Thursday that the talks were producing hopeful
signs despite occasional skirmishes in Kosovo.
	   ``We are working with Ambassador Hill on an interim agreement
for Kosovo ... and the forming of an independent Kosovo police
force which will reflect the ethnic structure and which would work
with the help of the international community,'' Rugova said.
	   There are new signs of defiance this week by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose government rejected attempts by the U.N.
War crimes tribunal to come investigate charges of war crimes and
atrocities against civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
persecutor, Louse Arbor.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, on Friday, NATO Secretary-general Javier
Solana said the alliance ``strongly supports Mrs. Arbour's
request.''
	   He called on Milosevic to cooperate fully with the international
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in accordance with its
obligations under U.N. Security Council resolution 1203.

Canada's jobless rate falls to eight-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Canada's unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent in
October from 8.3 percent in September, reaching its lowest point
since July 1990, the government reported Friday.
	   Statistics Canada said the economy gained 57,000 full-time jobs
to bring this year's employment growth so far to 322,000. It was
the fourth straight month employment has increased.
	   In Quebec, the unemployment rate fell from 10.2 percent to 9.7
percent, which may give some ammunition to separatist Premier
Lucien Bouchard in his current election campaign against the
anti-separatist Liberal Party. The provincial election is Nov. 30,
and Bouchard plans to call another referendum on secession from
Canada if he wins.
	   The jobless rate in other provinces ranged from 18.1 percent in
Newfoundland to 6.1 percent in Manitoba.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Sohail Abbas and Atif Bashir scored
second-half goals and Pakistan beat Germany 3-1 to earn a match
with the Netherlands for the Champions Trophy title.
	   Pakistan, a three-time winner of the title including its last in
1994, will meet the Dutch, also three-time champs on Sunday for the
crown. The Netherlands beat Australia 4-1 earlier Friday to finish
atop the six-nation pool standings.
	   Germany, the defending champion, drew one and lost all four of
its other games and will meet Spain (1-1-3) for fifth place.
	   Pakistan finished with a 2-2-1 record and eight points, same as
Australia and South Korea, but finished second on goal difference.
	   Pakistan took the lead in the 12th minute on a goal by Haider
Hussain but Christian Kurtz drew Germany even off a penalty corner
in the 32nd.
	   Abbas scored the eventual game-winner in the 55th and Bashir
added the insurance with three minutes remaining.
	   ``We have beaten Holland in the league match and I hope we will
repeat the performance on Sunday,'' said Pakistan skipper Mohammad
Usman.
	   Pakistan upset the Dutch Wednesday 5-3, the Netherlands' only
loss in pool play.
	   ``Ours (Pakistan) is a young side and we are in a rebuilding
process, but the way all the boys have so far played I think we
have a good chance against Holland,'' Usman said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States and Russia were likely to reach
a food aid agreement Friday, though Moscow has balked at some
American demands, Russian officials said.
	   A U.S. delegation has been in Moscow all week for negotiations
on a plan to deliver 3.1 million metric tons of American food to
help see Russia through the long winter.
	   However, the Americans are worried about possible corruption,
and want strict guidelines on how the food is distributed. This
prevented an agreement Thursday, but a deal was still likely
Friday, Vladimir Scherbak, the first deputy agriculture minister,
told the Interfax news agency.
	   Some of the U.S. guidelines were ``utterly unacceptable to
Russia,'' he said.
	   The United States wants the food aid exempted from taxes and
import duties, and the two sides still had disagreements Friday on
``tax matters,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, who has
led the Russian delegation.
	   The Americans also have insisted that profits from food aid sold
by the Russian government go to the country's Pension Fund, which
is chronically short of cash. As a result, many retirees have to
wait months to receive their pension money.
	   Kulik said that issue had been resolved.
	   ``We are ready to give (the money) to the Pension Fund and spend
it on social programs,'' he was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael Hurley said Thursday evening that
``there were just a couple of loose ends'' in the negotiations. He
did not elaborate on the negotiations.
	   In another development, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
discussed possible humanitarian aid with a European Commission
delegation. The talks were described as preliminary and no details
were announced.
	   Russia's economic crisis, along with shrinking food imports and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years, has raised concerns about
possible food shortages.
	   The State Statistics Committee reported Friday that grain
production had been tentatively measured at 51.5 million tons this
year, down 45 percent from 1997, Interfax said. Previously, the
government had said 55 million tons had been harvested this year.
	   Store shelves remain well-stocked, but food prices have risen
sharply in recent months and poor Russians may not be able to
afford what's available.
	   Under the aid plan, about half the U.S. food would be provided
for free. The other half would be sold to Russia for around dlrs
500 million under a 20-year loan. The shipments would include
wheat, corn, soybeans, meat and produce.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

FIFA dissolves Cameroon soccer's executive body
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA has dissolved the executive body
of Cameroon soccer following a ``series of recurrent problems,''
the world governing body said Friday.
	   Following a FIFA team's visit to the African country in
September and October, FIFA appointed eight officials to a
12-member interim executive and called on the Cameroon authorities
to nominate the remaining officials.
	   The new governing body, headed by Mohammed Iya, will serve for a
maximum nine months, FIFA said in a statement.
	   It is charged with revising the statutes of the Cameroon
Football Federation (FECAFOOT) and managing the country's soccer
until a replacement executive is elected.
	   The administrators must also settle the association's debts, pay
salaries due to its staff and set up fully functioning offices and
equipment, FIFA said.
	   Last year, FIFA warned Cameroon it could be suspended from all
international competition, including the World Cup, if it didn't
pay overdue wages to one of its former players.
	   The world body notified FECAFOOT Oct. 16 of the move to dissolve
the existing administrative body, elected in 1996.

Jewish leader says anti-Semitism growing among German
</HEADLINE>
intellectuals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Ignatz Bubis, the most prominent
defender of Jewish interests in Germany, said Friday he was at a
``crossroads,'' tired of what he calls growing anti-Semitism in the
country and tempted to give up his role as spokesman.
	   ``I'm asking myself if it was worth it. I realize I was speaking
to a wall, I didn't achieve anything,'' Bubis was quoted as saying
in an interview with the Berliner Morgenpost.
	   ``Intellectual nationalism is growing,'' said Bubis, a Frankfurt
businessman and long-time president of Germany's Central Council of
Jews.
	   Bubis pointed to a recent speech by well-known author Martin
Walser made while accepting the Frankfurt Book Fair's Peace Prize
last month.
	   In the speech, Walser said constant references to Germany's Nazi
past were being used to ``instrumentalize our shame for current
purposes,'' which was to inflict guilt on a new generation of
Germans.
	   Nodding and loud applause that greeted the speech was evidence
that anti-Semitism and far-right views were spreading from what
Bubis earlier has called ``primitive circles'' to Germany's
political and cultural elite, Bubis said.
	   Walser, 71, has sought through his numerous books and plays to
reconcile German guilt over the Holocaust with a young postwar
generation's desire to look to the future.
	   In a separate interview, Bubis said the large majority of
Germans, particularly young Germans, was ignorant about Judaism.
	   ``In this group there are those who hate the Jews out of
ignorance, and there are also those who love Jews for their
Jewishness,'' Bubis was quoted as saying.

German mother to be tried third time in children's deaths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ The federal appeals court on Friday
ordered a third trial for a German woman accused of killing her two
young daughters because they burdened her relationship with a U.S.
soldier.
	   The appeals court ruled that a Giessen state court that
acquitted 40-year-old Monika Boetcher last year following a second
trial did not sufficiently consider witness evidence.
	   The case, which stretches back more than 12 years, continues to
make headlines in Germany.
	   Boetcher, whose family name was Weimar until she divorced her
husband while in prison and took back her maiden name, was
originally convicted in 1988 of strangling 5-year-old Karola and
7-year-old Melanie on Aug. 4, 1986.
	   Prosecutors charged that she had killed the girls in hopes that
she could eventually marry her American boyfriend, a soldier
stationed in Germany.
	   She maintained her husband, who was being treated for
psychological problems, killed the girls.
	   The original court sentenced her to life in prison.
	   In May 1994, a higher court ordered a retrial after police
experts uncovered new evidence and an amateur detective told police
her ex-husband had admitted to him he had killed the girls.
	   She was then acquitted on April 24, 1997.
	   Hesse state prosecutors appealed the acquittal to the federal
court, which overturned the ruling after a two-day session and
ordered a new trial to take place in Frankfurt on an as yet
unspecified date.

China calls Philippine claims over disputed reef groundless

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Friday dismissed complaints by the
Philippines that Chinese ships visited a disputed South China Sea
reef and repaired structures for possible military use.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said the repairs
did not violate an agreement between Beijing and Manila to refrain
from hostile acts while they sorted out their disputes over the
Spratly islands.
	   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado on Thursday accused
China of acting provocatively. He displayed air force
reconnaissance photos that showed gun-bearing ships off Mischief
Reef, 215 miles (345 kilometers) west of the Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   To underscore its anger, Manila called in China's ambassador and
vowed to bring up the dispute during a meeting of Asia-Pacific
economies later this month in Malaysia.
	   In a statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, Zhu
called the claims ``groundless'' and accused Manila of ignoring
``basic facts.
	   Zhu described the structures on the reef as fishing shelters
that were damaged by natural causes. He said authorities began
repairs recently for the safety of fishermen.
	   Tensions over Mischief Reef first flared in 1995 when the
Philippines first spotted the concrete structures built by China.
Disputes over the reef and several other areas in the Spratlys have
since periodically upset relations.
	   The Spratlys are believed to lie atop valuable mineral and gas
deposits. But claims over all or part of the chain by six
governments _ China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and
Vietnam _ have prevented thorough exploration.

Sri Lanka reaches 245 for 7 in Coca Cola opener
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL be UPDATED with India innings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Avishka Gunuwardena and
Marvan Atapattu both hit half centuries to help Sri Lanka reach 245
for seven against India in the opening match of the Coca Cola
Trophy on Friday.
	   The World Cup champions, put into bat by Indian captain Mohammed
Azharuddin, jumped out to 72 from 14 overs by an unusually subdued
Sanath Jayasuriya _ 27 of 42 balls _ and Gunawadena _ 52 off 55
balls.
	   Gunawardena, playing his third one-day international, overcame a
tentative start to accelerate the scoring, hammering three
successive cover drives off the otherwise impressive paceman
Javagal Srinath and hit eight boundaries in all.
	   However, the quick dismissals of Gunawardena and Aravinda de
Silva, who went for duck off leg spinner Anil Kumble's bowling, saw
the Lankans slump from 72 for no loss to 86 for three.
	   Captain Arjuna Ranatunga and Atapattu, however, steadied the
innings with a watchful partnership of 89 in 21 overs. Ranatunga,
who hit a straight six, made 43 from 66 deliveries.
	   Atapattu, meanwhile, went on to lead all batsmen with 64 off 94
balls.
	   India needed an average five runs per over in the 50 over to
beat Sri Lanka in the opening day-night match held at the Sharjah
stadium. Zimbabwe is the third nation playing in dlrs 85,000
tournament, which ends on Nov. 13.

Teen jailed with adults for crime committed when six
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 5th graf with girl's jail sentence not known &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ A 13-year-old Gypsy girl from a
desperately poor family of 24 was jailed in a maximum security
prison for a crime she committed when she was six, it was reported
Friday.
	   Both her jailing and alleged mistreatment during her custody
among adult prisoners, dealt a new blow to the credibility of a
legal system already reeling from prostitution and corruption
scandals in the police department.
	   Compounding the embarrassment was a report that the family's 22
children had been singled out for state assistance in 1993. At the
time, the father was given his current job as a gardener's
assistant at city hall and the family put on welfare.
	   According to media reports, the girl was arrested at a police
station in this northern port city on Oct. 31 when she went with
her father to register for an identity card.
	   Police told the girl's father she had been convicted in absentia
three years ago for allegedly robbing 45,000 drachmas (dlrs 150)
from a department store together with five older children in 1991.
Her sentence was not known.
	   She was arrested and sent to an adult holding facility. Police
apparently were unaware that the custody laws in effect when she
was convicted have now been abolished.
	   Legal experts also said that courts have always been banned from
convicting children under the age of seven. Instead the are usually
place into special supervision programs.
	   Police at the holding facility then reportedly placed the girl
in a van with adult prisoners and drove her 500 kilometers (312
miles) to the Korydallos maximum security prison on the outskirts
of Athens.
	   A lawyer representing the girl told local media that she was
allegedly sexually harassed by male inmates traveling with her in
the van.
	   But although Korydallos officials dispute claims she was held
for five days and say she was released immediately, local media
reported that she was transferred from Korydallos to Salonica in
another police van Thursday.
	   A public prosecutor who found out about the case personally
intervened Thursday, calling a judge who ordered the girl released
and returned to her family.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Five ethnic Albanian guerrillas were
killed Friday in a shoot-out with Serb police, according to a Serb
media statement. It was the highest reported death toll in any
clash since an Oct. 12 agreement that established a de-facto cease
fire.
	   The details of the deaths could not be immediately confirmed,
but previous statements about similar violence have accurately
reported the number of casualties.
	   According to the statement issued by the Serb Media Center, a
mouthpiece for the Serb government, a police patrol in southern
Kosovo came under attack from guerrillas on Friday morning.
	   The statement said police fired back, killing five of the
attackers, who were dressed in uniforms of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and had automatic rifles and mortars.
	   No policemen were injured, the statement said. It added that two
vehicles used by the attackers, one with Kosovo license plates and
one with foreign plates, contained mortars, hand grenades, an
assault rifle and ammunition.
	   Two other Albanians were killed Thursday, according to Albanians
interviewed in central Kosovo. Police reported one Albanian
guerrilla died in a shoot-out near Klina, and uniformed KLA
fighters were seen preparing for a funeral Friday near Buroja in
the same area.
	   Albanians in the region gave a similar account, saying two men
were attacked by police while driving. One died and another was
injured, they said.
	   The rebels were not formally part of the Oct. 12 agreement
signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that committed him
to pulling back Yugoslav troops and Serb police from Kosovo, an
Albanian majority province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   Showing their dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process,
ethnic Albanian rebels said Friday they intend to establish their
own civilian rule in territory they control in the province.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the Kosovo Liberation
Army said its military command had decided to form local government
institutions, disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic
Albanian political leaders.
	   ``The purpose is to ease our army of the burden of civilian
administration in populated areas,'' the guerrillas' statement
read, adding that such a move was needed in present conditions of
war in Kosovo.
	   The move signals defiance toward not only the Serbs but also
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and international officials
who are trying to broker a joint political solution on self-rule
for the separatist province. Rugova has been elected Kosovo
president in elections authorities consider invalid, and an
Albanian assembly also exists, though it is rarely convened and
also is not recognized by Serbian authorities.
	   The KLA has accused Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders of
trying to sell short their goal of independence for the
Albanian-majority province.
	   Rugova noted Friday that Kosovo refugees are slowly returning to
the homes they fled in the fighting and are beginning to rebuild
their shattered lives.
	   ``There are first signs of life,'' he told reporters in
Pristina, three days after touring Kosovo's countryside for the
first time in nine years. ``There is a great willingness on the
part of the people to get back to their homes and properties. They
should be offered a bit of sense of security.''
	   Rugova voiced hope that the 2,000-strong international
monitoring mission led by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe will provide that sense of safety. The
mission is expected to be launched later this month.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, involved in shuttle
diplomacy between Belgrade and Pristina, was back in Kosovo Friday.
	   Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia,
said in Belgrade Thursday that the talks were producing hopeful
signs despite occasional skirmishes in Kosovo.
	   ``We are working with Ambassador Hill on an interim agreement
for Kosovo ... and the forming of an independent Kosovo police
force which will reflect the ethnic structure and which would work
with the help of the international community,'' Rugova said.
	   There are new signs of defiance this week by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose government rejected attempts by the U.N.
War crimes tribunal to come investigate charges of war crimes and
atrocities against civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
persecutor, Louise Arbour.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, on Friday, NATO Secretary-general Javier
Solana said the alliance ``strongly supports Mrs. Arbour's
request.''
	   He called on Milosevic to cooperate fully with the international
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in accordance with its
obligations under U.N. Security Council resolution 1203.

Swiss investigators go to Canada on crash homicide complaint
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The parents of a Swiss teen-ager killed in the
crash of Swissair 111 have lodged a complaint of negligent homicide
in hopes of learning what caused the accident, their lawyer said
Friday.
	   Neither the name of the 19-year-old victim nor of his parents
were disclosed.
	   It was the first complaint filed in Switzerland, but American
lawyer Mitch Baumeister has so far filed three suits in the United
States, each demanding dlrs 125 million in damages.
	   Lawyer Christian Luescher stressed that the parents, a French
man and his Swiss wife, were not seeking damages, but by charging
``persons unknown'' were only trying to find out what happened.
	   Authorities in Geneva, where the victim lived, have begun an
inquiry and sent an investigative commission to Halifax, Nova
Scotia, to obtain information on the crash.
	   Investigating judge Christine Junod told the AP that information
was being sought from the Canadian authorities and from Swissair.
	   All 229 passengers and crew were killed when the flight from New
York to Geneva went down in the sea off Halifax on Sept. 2.

Scientist said tremors do not foreshadow volcanic eruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELLSWORTH CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROSSEAU, Dominica (AP) _ Tremors that have rattled this
Caribbean island for two weeks are diminishing and do not indicate
a volcanic eruption is imminent, according to a scientist called in
by the government to study the tremors.
	   At the peak of the seismic activity, about 180 tremors were
detected on Oct. 22, but the frequency has diminished to about five
or six a day, said Dr. John Sheppard of Trinidad.
	   ``That means that a volcanic eruption is not now a significant
hazard,'' Sheppard said late Thursday.
	   The worst of the tremors caused widespread fear among residents,
leading the government to call in Sheppard to study the seismic
activity.
	   Dominica, an island of 290 square miles (755 square kilometers)
in the eastern Caribbean, has five dormant volcanoes. Sheppard said
the activity appeared to be centered deep underground.
	   Residents in the region were reminded of the danger of volcanic
activity in recent years after most of the island of Montserrat was
left uninhabitable by numerous eruptions of the Soufriere Hills
volcano, including one that killed 10 people.
	   Sheppard said none of the tremors in Dominica exceeded 3.0 in
magnitude. Tremors below magnitude 2.5 are generally not detected
by humans.

Egypt's Coptic pope accuses media of exaggerating torture claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The pope of Egypt's Coptic Christians said
Friday that police had committed ``some transgressions'' against
his community, but accused foreign media of exaggerating them.
	   Pope Shenouda III described the murder of two Copts in a
southern farming town in September as a ``normal case.''
	   Egyptian human rights groups have condemned the police
investigation into the murder in el-Kusheh, 400 kilometers (245
miles) south of Cairo. The groups allege that police detained about
1,200 Christians and tortured scores of them.
	   The groups suggest that police sought to find a Christian
culprit to avoid tension between the town's Christian majority and
Muslim minority.
	   The police's conduct was criticized by two local Christian
clerics and received widespread publicity in the foreign media. A
British Sunday newspaper accused police officers of conducting a
crackdown on the town's Copts and of crucifying and raping
individuals.
	   In his first comments on the affair, Shenouda said ``some
transgressions by police took place during the investigation of
this murder.''
	   Shenouda rarely criticizes state policy. His statement, issued
to Egypt's official Middle East News Agency, did not elaborate on
the transgressions.
	   ``The recent reports in some foreign media concerning the
incidents of the el-Kusheh village were exaggerated and did damage
to Egypt's reputation. We do not accept this,'' the pope said.
	   Rights groups have said that the police's conduct did not amount
to a government crackdown on Copts, but was rather an instance of
common police brutality.
	   Government officials have repeatedly denied that torture took
place and said only a few people were arrested.
	   But Osama al-Baz, an advisor to President Hosni Mubarak, has
been quoted in the opposition Al-Ahali newspaper as admitting there
were ``transgressions.''
	   Police said Thursday they were conducting an inquiry into the
affair and that four officers in el-Kusheh had been transferred to
another town to ensure that the investigation was fair.
	   Some 2,000 Egyptian Christians issued a statement Thursday
denying that their community was mistreated.

U.S. Defense Secretary seeks Turkish support against Iraq

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Friday that the United States would ask the support of its allies
in case of military action against Iraq.
	   ``We would ask that we have the support of all of our friends
should any military action be required,'' Cohen said, after meeting
Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin.
	   ``What action that might constitute will be discussed in the
future,'' he added.
	   Cohen's visit to Ankara is part of his tour in the region to
seek support for possible U.S.-led strikes against Iraq for its
refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   After talks with Sezgin, President Suleyman Demirel, and the
commander of the armed forces, Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, Cohen left
Ankara for Paris.
	   Cohen described his recent visits to the Gulf states as a
success, despite indications that he had gathered little support in
the region for U.S. military action.
	   Iraq declared Saturday that it would end all cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In an indication of Washington's growing impatience with Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein, Cohen warned that ``it is important that
that decision of (Saddam's) be reversed very soon.''
	   Cohen was not expected to get any firm backing from Turkey which
suffered financially and politically from the division of Iraq
after the Gulf War. During the war Turkey acted as a staunch ally
of the U.S.-led coalition.
	   Turkish officials did not comment on Ankara's position on
eventual strikes, but Cohen said Turkey shared the view that Saddam
must comply with U.N. resolutions.
	   The U.N. Security Council resolution on Thursday demanded that
Iraq resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors but stopped short of
explicitly allowing military strikes against Iraq.
	   Security Council members are still divided over whether to
authorize military force.
	   Turkey allows the use of its southern Incirlik air base by some
50 U.S. and British jets who monitor a no-fly zone over northern
Iraq. Some U.S. air strikes originated from Incirlik during the
Gulf war.
	   Cohen said the issue of whether Incirlik would be used in case
of strikes against Iraq was not discussed during the talks.
	   ``He made no request of us,'' said Sezgin.

Steffi Graf advances and reaches earnings landmark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf broke the all-time career
earnings record in women's sports Friday when she beat Anne-Gaelle
Sidot to reach the semifinals of the Leipzig Open.
	   With her latest comeback picking up speed, Graf beat the French
qualifier 7-5, 6-3 to earn a semifinal showdown with third-seeded
Dominique van Roost.
	   The victory pushed Graf's total career earnings to dlrs
20,348,992, vaulting her past Navratilova's 13-year-old earnings
mark of 20,344,061.
	   ``Such records do show what you've achieved but they are not all
that important to me,'' said Graf, a former longtime No. 1 who has
dropped to No. 22 after various injuries had curtailed her career
over the last 18 months.
	   The 29-year-old German is coming off surgery in the right wrist
that had sidelined her for two months and she is unseeded in a
tournament for the first time in 13 years.
	   ``I did not expect such a performance and I did not expect to
reach the semifinals,'' Graf said. ``I am moving well, I am
fighting, I am able to turn the match. I've made more progress than
I expected.''
	   Graf was one of the founders of the first tournament to be held
in former East Germany and has won the dlrs 450,000 event four
times. The victory over Sidot brought her record in Leipzig to
23-0.
	   Sidot, 19, broke Graf in the opening game and was serving for
the set when she had her serve broken as Graf's game picked up
momentum and her shots gained in power and precision.
	   ``It took me three-four games to loosen up,'' Graf said.
	   Graf won five games in a row as she clinched the first set and
went up 1-0 in the second. She broke serve again for a 3-1 lead,
but dropped her own serve in seventh game.
	   Leading 40-15 in the next, the 74th-ranked Sidot allowed Graf to
come back and break serve again. The German then served out the
match.
	   In another quarterfinal, second-seeded Nathalie Tauziat beat
eighth-seeded Anke Huber of Germany 6-3, 6-4.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States and Russia signed an agreement
Friday on 3.1 million tons of food aid to help see Russia through
the long winter after extended talks in Moscow, Russian news
agencies reported.
	   ``Our common cause has been fulfilled,'' Deputy Prime Minister
Gennady Kulik said after the talks ended Friday, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Calls to U.S. officials were not immediately returned.
	   Russian officials said the talks had stalled over American
worries about possible corruption, and demands for strict
guidelines on how the food is distributed. This prevented an
agreement Thursday
	   Some of the U.S. guidelines were ``utterly unacceptable to
Russia,'' Vladimir Scherbak, the first deputy agriculture minister,
told Interfax.
	   Kulik, who headed the Russian delegation, said both sides had
worked out differences over U.S. demands that the food aid be
exempted from taxes and import duties, Interfax said. It did not
elaborate.
	   The Americans also have insisted that profits from food aid sold
by the Russian government go to the country's Pension Fund, which
is chronically short of cash. As a result, many retirees have to
wait months to receive their pension money.
	   Kulik said that issue had been resolved.
	   ``We are ready to give (the money) to the Pension Fund and spend
it on social programs,'' he was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael Hurley said Thursday evening that
``there were just a couple of loose ends'' in the negotiations. He
did not elaborate on the negotiations.
	   In another development, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
discussed possible humanitarian aid with a European Commission
delegation. The talks were described as preliminary and no details
were announced.
	   Russia's economic crisis, along with shrinking food imports and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years, has raised concerns about
possible food shortages.
	   The State Statistics Committee reported Friday that grain
production had been tentatively measured at 51.5 million tons this
year, down 45 percent from 1997, Interfax said. Previously, the
government had said 55 million tons had been harvested this year.
	   Store shelves remain well-stocked, but food prices have risen
sharply in recent months and poor Russians may not be able to
afford what's available.
	   Under the aid plan, about half the U.S. food would be provided
for free. The other half would be sold to Russia for around dlrs
500 million under a 20-year loan. The shipments would include
wheat, corn, soybeans, meat and produce.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Car bomb explodes; Israel suspends ratification of peace accord

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb blew up Friday in a Jerusalem market
crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The blast killed
two assailants, wounded 21 Israelis and prompted Israel to suspend
implementation of the peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying to
sabotage the agreement, claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m.
(0745 gmt) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market.
	   Palestinian officials condemned the attack, but accused Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding up
the agreement that was to give the Palestinians another 13 percent
of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat urged the United States to
step in and make sure that Israel will ratify the accord.

Sestriere, Madonna will alternate in hosting WC Slalom

<TEXT>
	   BOLZANO, Italy (AP) _ The Italian resorts of Sestriere and
Madonna di Campiglio will alternate in the yearly organization of a
men's World Cup slalom in a move to keep Madonna on the
international ski calendar.
	   Officials of the Italian ski federation said Friday that
Sestriere, site of the 1997 World Championships in Italy's western
Alps, will organize this year's slalom on Dec. 14 with Madonna di
Campiglio, in the Dolomites, hosting the race next year.
	   Until last year both Sestriere and Madonna were part of the the
men's World Cup program. It also features two downhills and a giant
slalom in other Italian venues _ Val Gardena, Bormio and Alta
Badia.
	   Madonna was dropped from the program by the International Ski
Federation (FIS) beginning this year.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Yoo Moon-ki and Yeo Woon-kon scored two
minutes apart early in the second half and sent South Korea on its
way to a 6-3 victory over Spain Friday that put the Asians in the
third-place game at the Champions Trophy.
	   Yoo's goal in the 45th minute and Yeo's off a penalty corner in
the 47th gave South Korea a 3-0 lead that would enable it to beat
back a second-half Spanish rally.
	   The victory finished South Korea with a 2-2-1 record and eight
points, same as Pakistan and Australia but trailing on goal
difference. It still will play Australia on Sunday for third place.
	   Spain finished 1-1-3 with four points just behind South Korea
and will place last-placed and defending champion Germany for
fifth.
	   Kang Keon-wook scored in the minute before halftime before Yoo's
and Yeo's goals gave South Korea control.
	   After Jordi Casas tallied off a penalty corner for Spain in the
49th, Song Seong-tae scored the eventual game winner two minutes
later.
	   Juan Escarre led Spain's resurgence with goals in the 53rd and
56th minutes, but Kim Young-Kui scored a pair of his own in the
65th and 70th to squash Spain's hopes.

Pig farmers rally to protest plunging prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with color from rallies

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Angry pig farmers, protesting plunging prices
rallied nationwide Friday. At one demo, the sow said it all. Set
loose, its back carried a message: ``At this price, my trough's
empty!''
	   More than 10,000 farmers handed out pork sausages and set
haystacks and tires alight, from northern France to small towns in
the southwest to dramatize their plight.
	   They were all demanding urgent distribution of promised
government aid.
	   Farmers have been squeezed for months by the price of pork,
which was selling Friday at 5.18 francs (95 cents) a kilo (2.2
pounds), about 4 francs (70 cents) below production costs. They say
they can't cover their costs with such low prices, caused by
falling demand and overproduction.
	   The French government said Tuesday it would provide 150 million
francs (dlrs 27 million) in extra aid to the producers. The farmers
said Friday they would not tolerate any delay.
	   ``Since the end of 1997 I've been losing money,'' said Pierre
Hughes, a pig farmer from Fletres. ``I had put some money aside,
but if this continues the banks will cut off my allowance.''
	   The biggest rally was in Rennes, Britanny, where a large
delegation met with officials. Outside, banners read ``Save our
jobs'' and ``Don't let the producers die.'' And the pig with the
message ran loose.
	   Jacques Lemaitre, president of the National Pork Federation said
10-11,000 farmers were mobilized nationwide.
	   In Montauban, near Toulouse, in southwest France, 1,500 farmers
rallied, police said, many handing out pork sausages to passers-by.
	   Traffic was snarled on a major highway after farmers
deliberately drove slowly and blocked access roads between Dunkirk
and Lille.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Downtown businesses returned to near
normal on Friday but heavily armed troops remained in outlying
townships to prevent a recurrence of violent protests over fuel
price increases.
	   A strike by private taxis and buses against the
government-mandated 67 percent hike in petrol costs kept most
workers from reaching downtown businesses on Wednesday, but the
situation improved Thursday and Friday.
	   Thousands of commuters gathered at bus parks and street corners
in the dormitory town of Chitungwiza, 25 kilometers (15 miles)
south of the capital, to catch state-owned buses or hitch rides in
private vehicles.
	   But outlying factories remained mostly closed due to transport
problems.
	   There were no reports of fresh violence that began on Wednesday
when demonstrators stoned passing cars and erected makeshift
barricades.
	   Some of the taxis that continued to operate have doubled their
fares.
	   Information Minister Chen Chimutengwende on Friday criticized
the operators for raising fares by more than 67 percent.
	   ``Operators are conniving and coming up with unacceptably high
increases. This is gross irresponsibility,'' said Chimutengwende,
the chief government spokesman.
	   Earlier this year, the Zimbabwe government called out troops to
control civil unrest over worsening economic conditions.
	   In the latest disturbances, commuters criticized the
government's spending an estimated dlrs 500,000 a day on the
deployment of 6,000 troops to back embattled Congolese President
Laurent Kabila.
	   The government said the gasoline increases were forced by an 80
percent slide in the value of the Zimbabwe currency against the
U.S. dollar in the past year.
	   Worsening economic hardships and civil unrest are seen as the
biggest threat to the presidency of Robert Mugabe, the only black
leader since independence.

Laudrup joins Copenhagen after knocking side from Cup Winners Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS leads; adds Chelsea confirmation

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Brian Laudrup joined FC Copenhagen on
Friday, just a day after his goal for Chelsea eliminated the Danish
side from the Cup Winners Cup.
	   Chelsea and FC Copenhagen officials closed the deal Friday in a
transfer reported at around 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million).
	   ``The negotiations between Chelsea, Brian Laudrup and FC
Copenhagen have been concluded today,'' Copenhagen manager Flemming
Oestergaard said.
	   He said Laudrup had agreed to a 2 1/2-year contract.
	   ``All parties have now signed the agreement and Brian's
registration with Chelsea was canceled at the FA this afternoon. He
will be registered today for FC Copenhagen,'' said Chelsea managing
director Colin Hutchinson.
	   The 29-year-old Laudrup, a former Danish international, said
last week he wanted to return home after playing only three months
for Chelsea following a move from Glasgow Rangers.
	   Ironically, Laudrup scored on a header in Thursday's
second-round, second-leg Cup Winners Cup match in Copenhagen as
Chelsea won 1-0 to eliminate the Danish side from the competition.
	   It was Laudrup's first goal for Chelsea.
	   Oestergaard said Laudrup likely would begin playing for
Copenhagen on Dec. 1. Danish radio reported he would take some time
off as he tries to recover from this summer's World Cup.
	   Laudrup, who quit Denmark's national team after it was ousted in
the World Cup quarterfinals by Brazil, began with Danish club
Brondby and then played in Germany for Bayer 05 Uerdingen and FC
Bayern Munich.
	   He later played for Italian powerhouses Fiorentina and Milan
before joining the former Scottish champions of Glasgow Rangers.
	   He joined the Danish national side in 1987 and scored 21 goals
in 82 matches. His elder brother, Michael Laudrup, also retired
after the World Cup following a standout 17-year career.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus officials on Friday denied that the
Turin club has extended the contract of its classy French
midfielder Zinedine Zidane through 2005.
	   Meanwhile, Turin's daily La Stampa suggested that the French
international may be willing to leave La Juve before his current
contract ends in 2003.
	   La Stampa, which is controlled by the Agnelli family which
indirectly owns the Turin club, wrote that Zro,'' La Stampa wrote Friday.
	   Zidane, who led France to the world title last summer, has been
a key to Juventus' most recent triumphs in the Italian league. He's
a top candidate for the 1998 award of best player of the year.

New German leader makes do with small apartment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ He may be Germany's new chancellor, but
Gerhard Schroeder will squeeze into a one-bedroom apartment when
he's in Bonn running the nation.
	   The reason: Schroeder has allowed his predecessor, Helmut Kohl,
to stay in the chancellor's residence as long as he wants _ in
practice, until the government returns to Berlin next year.
	   The offer was the strangest episode in a cordial handover of
power, in which Schroeder treated Kohl like a respected uncle after
defeating him in September elections.
	   Schroeder has moved into an apartment in Palais Schaumburg, a
mansion in the same fenced-off park on the Rhine River as the
chancellor's residence and offices, government spokesman
Uwe-Karsten Heye said Friday.
	   ``It's big enough to allow his family to visit and has the
advantage of not requiring additional security measures,'' Heye
said.
	   Bonn, Germany's Cold War capital, is only an interlude for
Schroeder. He has said he want to start governing from Berlin next
spring, even before the government's scheduled move over the
summer.
	   His fourth wife, Doris, has refused to move to Bonn, saying she
doesn't want her seven-year-old daughter to change schools twice
within a year. She is staying in Hanover, the capital of Lower
Saxony state, which Schroeder governed until he became chancellor.

Somalis mourn slain aid worker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somali (AP) _ Hundreds of mourners on Friday
remembered a senior Somali aid worker who was killed by gunmen
while trying to rebuild roads destroyed by floods.
	   Hassan Mohamed Ga'al, an engineer in charge of a U.N.
Development Office in Somalia, was fatally shot Thursday in
Aliyaleh village, 15 kilometers (10 miles) north of Mogadishu.
	   Six of his colleagues were killed in the same attack, which
witnesses said was carried out by eight men armed with assault
rifles and hand grenades.
	   The reason for the attack and the identity of the gunmen
remained unknown, but some sources said there was a contract
dispute between Ga'al and the gunmen.
	   Witnesses also said the gunmen were seen stealing two sacks of
Somali shillings from Ga'al's vehicle.
	   Clan elders sent five battlewagons and more than 100 heavily
armed militiamen to the area where the attack took place. Three
militiamen suspected to have been among the attackers were taken
into custody by elders.
	   Ga'al was oveseeing a project to repair roads in middle Shabelle
region, which were destroyed by floods last year.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since 1991 when the
country's longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted by clan
factions. The factions then turned on each other and the country
disintegrated into clan fiefdoms.

Spanish government seeks Pinochet's extradition

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Chile recalling ambassador; ADDS

 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain is to ask Britain to extradite former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to face charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture, a government spokesman said Friday.
	   Within hours of the announcement Chile protested by recalling
its ambassador, Sergio Pizarro, from Madrid to Santiago for
consultations.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes told reporters the
extradition request, approved at a weekly cabinet meeting, would be
before the British Home Office on Tuesday.
	   The extradition had been sought by Judge Baltasar Garzon whose
warrant led to the arrest of 82-year-old Pinochet Oct. 16 in London
as he recovered from back surgery.
	   The approval leaves Pinochet's fate in Britain's hands as a
five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords hears an appeal of a
High Court ruling that Pinochet's detention was illegal because he
is entitled to immunity as a former head of state.
	   The hearing is expected to continue next week.
	   If the panel rejects the High Court decision, Pinochet could be
handed over to Spanish authorities. Should it uphold the earlier
decision, the former dictator would likely be free to fly home.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's administration had
previously frowned on Garzon's probe into human rights crimes
committed in Chile under Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule and in Argentina
under similar military regimes.
	   But the government had said it would pass on an extradition
request if it received one.
	   ``We understand that this is a delicate matter which must be
treated with prudence,'' Matutes said. ``But most important it is a
judicial matter. We have to respect the law and the decisions of
our judges, whether it pleases the government or not.''
	   Matutes said the government was aware that ``obviously Chile
does not feel the same...but it understands that Spain must respect
its laws.''
	   He expressed confidence that the decision would not hurt the
traditionally warm ties between both countries.
	   Spain's National Court ruled last week that the Spanish justice
system has jurisdiction to try crimes such as those allegedly
committed by Pinochet.
	   The court said there are grounds to try Pinochet for genocide
because he allegedly tried to eliminate an entire group of people _
his political opponents _ and that under Spanish law, Spanish
courts can prosecute genocide no matter where it occurred.
	   An official Chilean government report says more than 3,000
people died or disappeared under Pinochet's rule as he tried to
crush a perceived communist threat.
	   Pinochet cannot be tried in Chile because he has immunity as a
senator for life, a job he created in a constitution he guided to
enactment before stepping down in 1990.
	   For some, the simple fact that Pinochet has been arrested and
his extradition sought is in itself an achievement.
	   ``Morally, Pinochet has already been condemned by all mankind,''
Isabel Allende, daughter of President Salvador Allende who was
killed during the Pinochet coup in 1973 said in Madrid earlier
Friday. ``If he returns to Chile, he does so humiliated and knowing
that at least seven countries have extradition warrants against
him.''
	   Allende was confident the British law lords would overturn the
immunity ruling and added that although she would prefer a trial to
take place in Chile, she said accepted that it could be held
anywhere.
	   ``There were no borders for the crimes he (Pinochet) committed.
We feel that in the same way there should be no borders for
justice,'' Allende said giving the example of Chilean Foreign
Minister Orlando Letelier who was killed in a car-bomb blast in
Washington in 1976.

New Zealand confident of historic series win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLTON, England (AP) _ Already 1-0 up in the three-test series,
the New Zealand rugby league team goes into Saturday's second test
against Britain confident of securing its first series win in
Britain since 1971.
	   The Kiwis won last Saturday's first test 22-16 at Huddersfield
and coach Frank Endacott on Friday named an unchanged line-up for
the second test.
	   ``Great Britain are going to be a desperate side but we're just
as desperate,'' said Endacott. ``We would like to put it away on
Saturday.''
	   Britain had the bulk of the possession and the penalty count in
the first test but failed to overcome the well-drilled New
Zealanders.
	   But Britain coach Andy Goodway said his team would concentrate
on speed at the play-the-ball on Saturday and would not allow New
Zealand the luxury of holding down the tackled player.
	   ``We didn't take the game to them enough in the first test and
that's one of the things we've got to turn around,'' Goodway said
Friday. ``We've got to play them at our speed and at our level of
intensity.''
	   The British team will be bolstered by the inclusion of
second-row forward Adrian Morley, who missed the first test through
injury.
	   The in-form backrower passed a fitness test Friday and is
expected to take his place in the starting team, with
Australian-based forward Harvey Howard on the bench as cover.
	   Goodway is also expected to utilize Leeds Rhinos pivot Iestyn
Harris from the kick-off to increase the British backline's
attacking options.
	   Harris was relegated to the reserves to start the first test
when Goodway experimented with using an extra forward to soften the
New Zealand defense early in the match.
	   Sheffield Eagles prop Dale Laughton is also expected to be
called into Britain's starting line-up, at the expense of Darren
Fleary, to add some extra muscle in the forward exchanges.

Spanish government approves aid package for victims of Hurricane

Mitch
 &UR; with BC-Mitch &QL; 
 &UR;  &HT;    MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government on Friday approved
1.89 billion pesetas (dlrs 13.4 million) in an emergency aid
package for victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America.

<TEXT>
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said the aid would be disbursed
immediately and showed Spain's ``complete solidarity'' with
countries that have a ``special connection'' based on linguistic
and cultural ties.
	   Spanish humanitarian organizations also reported donations
pouring in for victims of the hurricane, which killed thousands and
caused widespread damage in what were already some of the world's
poorest countries.
	   The Spanish branch of the Red Cross said it has received 2.1
billion pesetas (dlrs 15 million) in donations so far this week.
	   Another major aid group, Caritas, said it had collected 600
million (dlrs 4.3 million) pesetas over the first three days and
expected the rate of donations to increase.
	   A third group, Intermon, said it had so far taken in 302 million
pesetas (2.1 million dollars).

Ethiopians flee town after Eritrean shelling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD LEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHIRARO, Ethiopia (AP) _ The shell-cratered roads of this border
town were deserted but for armed fighters, and shops were padlocked
shut after Ethiopian civilians fled another round of Eritrean
shelling.
	   ``We are waiting to regain what we've lost,'' Gebremichael
Gebreyesus, an elderly militiaman toting a machine gun and nursing
a shrapnel wound, said Thursday.
	   Sporadic fighting has erupted on three fronts in the past two
weeks, although Ethiopia and Eritrea have agreed to try to settle
their six-month border conflict this weekend in Burkina Faso.
	   This latest attempt, hosted by the Organization of African
Unity, followed several failed efforts by the OAU as well as U.S.
and Rwandan officials.
	   Eritrean gunners on Tuesday pummeled Shiraro, 1,000 kilometers
(625 miles) northwest of the capital Addis Ababa, killing at least
nine people.
	   When the artillery duel stopped, civilians rounded up a few
possessions and their livestock to flee to the bush and nearby
settlements.
	   Only about 200 people, mostly soldiers and militiamen, stayed
behind in this once-bustling town of 18,000. Animal pens were
empty. House were boarded up. A few houses and a bar hit by mortars
were in shambles.
	   Ethiopian authorities have refused to comment on the shelling of
Shiraro, which has not been reported in state-run media.
	   The incident is awkward for the government, which wants to avoid
political pressure from Tigray Province, bordering Eritrea. Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi's government gets most of its support from
his native Tigray, and its people have been pressing the government
to chase away the Eritreans.
	   The shelling Tuesday was the second of Shiraro since Oct. 24.
	   On Wednesday, Adigrat, 600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Addis
Ababa, was shelled by long-range artillery, killing one person and
wounding an unknown number, a reliable source said.
	   Government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse refused to comment.
	   Eritrea previously bombed Adigrat on June 11, killing four
people. Eritrean officials said bombers were sent in retaliation
after the Ethiopians bombed the airport in the capital, Asmara.
	   On Oct. 29, Eritrean and Ethiopian troops exchanged artillery
fire across their disputed border at Zala Ambessa, an Ethiopian
border town now controlled by Eritrean troops. No casualty figures
were available.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993, but the border between the two countries has
never been officially demarcated.

Serb police kill five Albanian guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with killings of rebels on Friday. Edits

 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Five ethnic Albanian guerrillas were
killed Friday in a shoot-out with Serb police in Kosovo, Serb
sources said. It was the highest reported death toll in any clash
since an Oct. 12 agreement that established a de-facto cease-fire
in the restive Serbian province.
	   The details of the deaths could not be immediately confirmed,
but previous statements about similar violence have accurately
reported the number of casualties.
	   According to the statement issued by the Serb Media Center, a
mouthpiece for the Serb government, police killed the five rebels
Friday morning after they attacked a police patrol in southern
Kosovo. The statement said the attackers were dressed in uniforms
of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and had automatic rifles and
mortars.
	   No policemen were injured, the statement said.
	   Police reported that one ethnic Albanian guerrilla died in a
shootout near Klina. Ethnic Albanians in the region said police
attacked a vehicle, killing one ethnic Albanian and injuring
another.
	   The rebels were not formally part of the October agreement
signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. He agreed to
pulling back Yugoslav troops and Serb police from Kosovo, the
mostly ethnic Albanian province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   Showing their dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process,
ethnic Albanian rebels said Friday they intend to establish their
own civilian rule in territory they control in the province.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the KLA said its rebel
command had decided to form local government institutions,
disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanian political
leaders.
	   ``The purpose is to ease our army of the burden of civilian
administration in populated areas,'' the guerrillas' statement
read, adding that such a move was needed in present conditions of
war in Kosovo.
	   The move signals defiance not only of the Serbs but also of
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and international officials
trying to broker self-rule for the secessionist province. Rugova
has been elected Kosovo president in elections authorities consider
invalid, and an ethnic Albanian assembly also exists, though it is
rarely convened and also is not recognized by Serbian authorities.
	   The KLA has accused Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders of
trying to sell short their goal of independence.
	   Rugova noted Friday that Kosovo refugees are slowly returning to
the homes they fled in the fighting and are beginning to rebuild
their shattered lives.
	   ``There are first signs of life,'' he told reporters in
Pristina, three days after touring Kosovo's countryside for the
first time in nine years. ``There is a great willingness on the
part of the people to get back to their homes and properties. They
should be offered a bit of sense of security.''
	   Rugova voiced hope that the 2,000-strong international
monitoring mission led by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe will provide that. The mission is expected to
be launched later this month.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, was back in Kosovo
on Friday.
	   Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia,
said in Belgrade Thursday that the talks were producing hopeful
signs despite occasional skirmishes in Kosovo.
	   Rugova said he was working with Hill on an interim agreement for
Kosovo and on forming ``an independent Kosovo police force which
will reflect the ethnic structure and which would work with the
help of the international community.''
	   There are new signs of defiance this week by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose government rejected attempts by the U.N.
War crimes tribunal to come investigate charges of war crimes and
atrocities against civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, on Friday, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the alliance ``strongly supports Mrs. Arbour's
request.''
	   He urged Milosevic to cooperate fully with the international
tribunal according to its obligations under a U.N. Security Council
resolution.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations plans to reduce its
team of weapons inspectors in Iraq because Baghdad has banned all
inspections and monitoring activities, a spokesman said Friday.
	   The decision to pull back about 20 percent of the permanent
staff dealing with weapons inspections was disclosed less than 24
hours after the U.N. Security Council demanded that Iraq reverse
its decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. inspectors.
	   ``This partial paring back doesn't affect our ability to be up
and running if and when Iraq decides to rescind its decision,''
said Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission,
which is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The commission, known by its initials as UNSCOM, will withdraw
26 people starting Saturday, Buchanan said. UNSCOM has a permanent
staff of about 120 people.
	   ``It makes no sense to keep high-powered people sitting there
doing nothing when presumably they all have jobs to do in their own
countries,'' he said. ``These people are all on loan to us from
governments. ... We are wasting a resource.''
	   Iraq stopped short of expelling the inspectors when it banned
all UNSCOM monitoring activities Oct. 31, except changing film and
cassettes on stationary cameras. The Iraqis halted spot inspections
of weapons facilities on Aug. 5.
	   The Security Council unanimously passed a resolution condemning
Iraq and demanding that it rescind the ban. But council members are
still divided on whether the resolution authorizes military force
to make Iraq comply.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered a
lackluster Marcelo Rios in the quarterfinal of the dlrs 2.55
million Paris Open on Friday, easily beating the world No. 2, 6-3,
6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, took exactly one hour to beat Rios,
who was roundly booed off the court by spectators who felt he
hadn't made an effort.
	   The match turned in the eighth game of the first set.
	   Kafelnikov broke serve while leading 4-3 with a smart backhand
drop volley, and held serve to take the set.
	   The Russian blasted Rios off the court in the second set with a
display of blistering serves and powerful returns.
	   Rios could have ended the week as world No. 1 by winning the
Paris Open, if Pete Sampras were to lose in the quarterfinals. But
the Chilean never looked comfortable against the powerful Russian.
	   ``The first set was unbelievable but he let himself down in the
second with some loose play,'' Kafelnikov said. ``From that point
on he gave me a lot of extra confidence and I never looked back.''
	   ``Once you give the idea that you are a bit down, or not
satisfied with something, that gives your opponent extra
confidence,'' the Russian said.
	   Kafelnikov's win also improves his chances of qualifying for the
ATP World Championship in Hanover next month.
	   Rios still hopes to end the year as number one.
	   ``Hanover will decide it,'' he said.
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Kafelnikov will play Britain's Greg
Rusedski, the player that beat him in the first round of last
month's Vienna Open event.
	   Rusedski, who retains a small chance of qualifying for Hanover,
had little trouble beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-2 in another
quarterfinal contest.

Egypt's Coptic pope accuses media of exaggerating torture claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: INSERTS what AP reporter found graf 6; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The pope of Egypt's Coptic Christians said
Friday that police had committed ``some transgressions'' against
his community, but accused foreign media of exaggerating them.
	   Pope Shenouda III described the murder of two Copts in a
southern farming town in September as a ``normal case.''
	   Egyptian human rights groups have condemned the police
investigation into the murder in el-Kusheh, 400 kilometers (245
miles) south of Cairo. The groups allege that police detained about
1,200 Christians and tortured scores of them.
	   The groups suggest that police sought to find a Christian
culprit to avoid tension between the town's Christian majority and
Muslim minority.
	   The police's conduct was criticized by two local Christian
clerics and received widespread publicity in the foreign media. A
British Sunday newspaper accused police officers of conducting a
crackdown on the town's Copts and of crucifying and raping
individuals.
	   An Associated Press correspondent interviewed residents of
el-Kusheh who displayed scars of what they said was electric shock
torture on their ears, abdomen and genitals.
	   In his first comments on the affair, Shenouda said ``some
transgressions by police took place during the investigation of
this murder.''
	   Shenouda rarely criticizes state policy. His statement, issued
to Egypt's official Middle East News Agency, did not elaborate on
the transgressions.
	   ``The recent reports in some foreign media concerning the
incidents of the el-Kusheh village were exaggerated and did damage
to Egypt's reputation. We do not accept this,'' the pope said.
	   Rights groups have said that the police's conduct did not amount
to a government crackdown on Copts, but was rather an instance of
common police brutality.
	   Government officials have repeatedly denied that torture took
place and said only a few people were arrested.
	   But Osama al-Baz, an adviser to President Hosni Mubarak, has
been quoted in the opposition Al-Ahali newspaper as admitting there
were ``transgressions.''
	   Police said Thursday they were conducting an inquiry into the
affair and that four officers in el-Kusheh had been transferred to
another town to ensure that the investigation was fair.
	   Some 2,000 Egyptian Christians issued a statement Thursday
denying that their community was mistreated.

	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that an agreement had been reached.
	   Russian officials said the talks had stalled for a time over
American worries about possible corruption, and demands for strict
guidelines on how the food is distributed. Those concerns
forestalled an agreement Thursday and pushed the negotations into a
final, long day.
	   Some of the U.S. guidelines were ``utterly unacceptable to
Russia,'' Vladimir Scherbak, the first deputy agriculture minister,
told Interfax.
	   Kulik, who headed the Russian delegation, said Russia had agreed
to U.S. demands that the food aid be exempt from taxes and import
duties at the border, Interfax said. He said the issue of taxation
within Russia would be worked out later.
	   The Americans also insisted that profits from food aid sold by
the Russian government go to the country's Pension Fund, which is
chronically short of cash. As a result, many retirees have to wait
months to receive their pension money.
	   Kulik said that issue had been resolved.
	   ``We are ready to give (the money) to the Pension Fund and spend
it on social programs,'' he was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   In another development, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
discussed possible humanitarian aid with a European Commission
delegation. The talks were described as preliminary and no details
were announced.
	   Russia's economic crisis, along with shrinking food imports and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years, has raised concerns about
possible food shortages.
	   The State Statistics Committee reported Friday that grain
production had been tentatively measured at 51.5 million tons this
year, down 45 percent from 1997, Interfax said. Previously, the
government had said 55 million tons had been harvested this year.
	   Store shelves remain well-stocked, but food prices have risen
sharply in recent months and poor Russians may not be able to
afford what's available.
	   Under the aid plan, about half the U.S. food would be provided
for free. The other half would be sold to Russia for around dlrs
500 million under a 20-year loan. The shipments would include
wheat, corn, soybeans, meat and produce.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Council of Europe studies human rights in Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Council of Europe delegation left
Belarus on Friday after trying to gauge the possibility of dialogue
with this former Soviet republic ruled by an autocratic president.
	   The head of the delegation refused to spell out his conclusions
Friday. The delegation will present its views next month to
colleagues at the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human
rights organization.
	   Belarus lost its special guest status in the Council of Europe
after President Alexander Lukashenko disbanded the Belarusian
parliament in 1996 and put together a new body made up of his
supporters.
	   Belarus is the only European nation that is neither a member nor
a special guest in the Council of Europe.
	   The delegation, headed by vice president of the Council's
parliamentary assembly, Robert Antretter, met with Lukashenko, his
government officials and lawmakers, and members of the opposition
and of the former, disbanded parliament.
	   The delegation also studied Belarusian laws on the court system,
media, human rights and electoral system, Antretter said.
	   ``The fact that we are here means that we have certain hopes,''
Antretter told a news conference in capital Minsk. ``On the map of
Europe, this country is the only white spot. This situation is
intolerable. We hope that a time will come when this white spot
will disappear.''
	   Lukashenko, meanwhile, again criticized the exclusion of his
country from the Council of Europe.
	   ``I am absolutely convinced that our state meets all standards
applied to member nations,'' he said.
	   ``Moreover, the level of democracy, the protection of our
people's rights is not one bit lower than in the countries that
have recently joined this respected and very influential
organization,'' Lukashenko told Antretter.
	   Lukashenko has persecuted independent media, banned rallies by
his political opponents, and his police have routinely beaten and
arrested demonstrators.
	   But Lukashenko insists that this is the necessary toll of his
attempt to bring about Soviet-style ``stability'' to Belarus.
	   The 40-nation Council of Europe was created in 1949 to promote
democracy, human rights and the rule of law. It is best known for
its European Convention on Human Rights that forbids members to
impose the death penalty.

Iranian foreign minister arrives in Jiddah
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi arrived in this Red Sea port Friday for talks aimed at
enhancing the recently improved relations between Iran and Saudi
Arabia.
	   Saudi officials said that during his two-day visit, Kharrazi
will discuss regional development and cooperation with his
counterpart, Saud al-Faisal.
	   Kharrazi will also discuss plans for a visit by Iran's first
deputy president to the kingdom, the officials said on condition of
anonymity. No date has been disclosed for the visit.
	   Saudi Arabia used to be extremely wary of Iran owing to Tehran's
stated policy of exporting its Islamic revolution. The kingdom, a
Sunni Muslim state, also disapproved of citizens from Iran, a
Shiite Muslim state, holding demonstrations during the annual
pilgrimage to Mecca.
	   But relations began to improve after Iran's President Mohammad
Khatami, a political moderate, took office last year. The ties
received a boost in February when Iran's former president, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, visited the kingdom.
	   In May, the two countries signed a wide-ranging agreement on
trade, exchanges of academics and students, and technological
cooperation.

Australia hammers Pakistan by 86 runs

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Darren Lehmann's maiden one-day century
and paceman Glenn McGrath's three-wicket haul before the 10th over
to carry Australia to a record 86-run victory over Pakistan on
Friday in the first of three one-day internationals.
	   Chasing 325 runs for victory, Pakistan was only 76 for six by
the end of 16th over. Yousaf Youhanna's 92 off 110 balls gave
Pakistan some respectability but it was dismissed for 238 in the
48th over.
	   Pakistan never recovered from its early losses when McGrath
removed opener Salim Elahi off the second delivery and took the
wickets of Shahid Afridi (6) and experienced Ijaz Ahmed (22) _ all
before the 10th over.
	   Seamer Damien Fleming helped with the important wicket of
Pakistan captain Aamir Sohail, who was dropped by Brendon Julian in
the second slip, but was comfortably caught by Mark Waugh.
	   Youhanna then stablized the Pakistan innings with his 92. Wasim
Akram hit two fours and a six in his brief 28, while Shoaib Akhtar,
who put on 91 runs for the ninth wicket with Youhanna, made 36 off
55 balls to dampen Australia's victory.
	   Brendon Julian, with his left-arm medium fast delivery, removed
Moin Khan (16) and Youhanna (92).
	   Earlier Australian openers Adam Gilchrist (45) and Mark Waugh
combined for a first wicket of 52.
	   Paceman Shoaib Akhtar removed Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting (16)
in his successive overs as Australia slumped to 83 for three in the
15th over.
	   Captain Steve Waugh also lasted for only 16 deliveries before he
was smartly caught by Shahid Afridi off Arshad Khan. With Australia
losing its fourth wicket at the total of 113, it was Lehmann and
Michael Bevan's fifth-wicket effort of 157 which gave Australia a
solid platform for a big total.
	   Their 138-ball partnership diminished Pakistan's hopes of
winning before 35,000 fans. Both left-handed batsmen rotated the
strike and were especially harsh on Pakistan's left-arm medimum
fast Kabir Khan, who allowed 59 runs during his erratic seven overs
and Shahid Afridi, who allowed 63 during his nine overs.
	   Lehmann's innings of 103 came off 101 balls and featured eight
fours.
	   Bevan's 83 off 77 balls ended with Sohail taking a catch off
Arshad Khan, who finished with three for 70 in his 10 overs as
Australia piled up 85 runs in the last 10 overs to finish with 324
for eight.

Turkey urges new German leaders to improve relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A senior Turkish official urged Germany's
new government Friday to improve relations between the two
countries.
	   Relations have been cool since Turkish premier Mesut Yilmaz
accused former Chancellor Helmut Kohl of masterminding the European
Union's refusal to consider Turkey's bid for membership last year.
	   Turkish deputy foreign minister Korkmaz Haktamir said the
election of Gerhard Schroeder as chancellor offered ``a very
important chance'' to overcome the strains.
	   He said Foreign Minister Ismail Cem has invited his German
colleague, Joschka Fischer, for talks as soon as possible. No date
has been set, German officials said.
	   ``We believe in the strength of our ties,'' Haktamir told
reporters.
	   However, his German counterpart, Hans-Friedrich von Ploetz, said
it was ``absolutely irresponsible'' to name a target date for
Turkey's EU membership.
	   He also said Schroeder's government would stress concerns about
human rights in Turkey ``at least as much'' as Kohl's did.
	   Both officials attended a Bonn meeting of the German-Turkish
Cooperation Council, a grouping of business and political leaders
from both countries that was launched in 1993.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air
market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. On Oct. 29, an assailant
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
	   The Mahane Yehuda market _ several square blocks of narrow,
stone-walled lanes and wooden stalls heaped high with fruit,
vegetables and spices _ was packed with shoppers making last-minute
purchases before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   The blast sent a billowing cloud of black smoke pouring into the
air. Shoppers _ many of them Orthodox Jews clad in sweeping skirts
or long black frock coats _ fled in panic, some scattering their
purchases on the street.
	   At the market's entrance, the assailants' red Fiat was reduced
to a mass of twisted metal, with only the steering column left
intact. Next to it was a charred body cut nearly in half by the
force of the blast; a few feet (meters) away was a second body,
bare-legged and face down in a pool of blood.
	   Police said they had determined the identities of the
assailants, but refused to release any details. Witnesses' accounts
suggested the blast had gone off prematurely, perhaps averting a
much larger loss of life.
	   Onlookers said they saw smoke and flames coming from the car and
heard a series of popping explosions before a larger blast shook
the area. By then, people had already started running away.
	   ``When the big explosion went, there were not that many people
nearby,'' said witness Yaakov Shlomo. ``That was a miracle from
heaven.''
	   Almost all the injuries were minor, from flying debris; by
nightfall seven people remained hospitalized.
	   Blasted-apart suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel
radio reported, suggesting that the attackers had perhaps intended
to carry parcels of explosives deep into the crowd. That method was
used to deadly effect in an attack at the market 16 months ago that
killed the two suicide bombers and 16 others.
	   Israeli officials acknowledged that the toll was remarkably
light for an attack surely meant to kill and maim many, but said it
still showed the daily danger Israelis face from Islamic militants.
	   ``We can't depend on miracles _ we need to fight the cycle of
terrorism,'' said Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. He and other
Cabinet ministers, who were in the midst of debate over ratifying
the agreement at the time of the attack, cut short their session
and did not schedule a date for resumption.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said he still expected the accord to be ratified eventually. But
the suspension of debate will almost certainly bring delays in the
tightly timed 12-week schedule for implementation.
	   The Cabinet it would take up the accord again only after
verifying ``that the Palestinian Authority is taking vigorous steps
for an all-out war against terrorist organizations.''
	   Palestinian officials denounced the attack and urged Israel not
to let it hold up the accord.
	   ``I hope that at this critical period, we will concentrate on
the bigger picture,'' senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
said as he headed into a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet. ``The
answer to extremists on both sides sworn to sabotage this process
must be a big `No.'''
	   He also urged the United States to step in and make sure that
Israel will ratify the accord.
	   Immediately after the bombing, small but furious protests by
right-wing Israelis broke out. ``Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat!''
a dozen or more demonstrators shouted from behind the police
barricades. Several were arrested.
	   At times like this, Israel has a small-town feel; within moments
of the blast, people all over Jerusalem knew of it.
	   In the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, itself the scene of a suicide
bombing 14 months ago, people in open-air cafes clustered around
radios, listening, nodding and relaying the news. ``Bomb, Mahane
Yehuda,'' they told passersby.
	   Yair Cohen, 45, a bus-company worker who was shopping at the
market, said that moments before the blast he had given money to a
beggar on the street as a ``mitzvah'' _ a good deed that observant
Jews believe will help lead to their own salvation.
	   ``I said to myself, `Maybe this will save my life,''' he
recounted later at the hospital, his gray T-shirt stained with
blood where he was hit by flying shrapnel. ``And ten minutes later,
there was the explosion _ and I really did escape death.''

Turkey imposes new shipping rules for Bosporus

Bosporus, considers increasing shipment fees, ADDS byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey imposed new navigation rules for
the Bosporus effective Friday in a bold move to eliminate
competitors in the race to carry Caspian Sea oil to world markets.
	   Bosporus Strait is the sole access to the Mediterranean for
tankers sailing from Black Sea, from which two main competitors,
Georgia and Russia, propose to ship the Caspian oil.
	   While pushing for a pipeline through its territory, Turkey
opposes the shipment of Caspian oil through Bosporus, fearing
tanker collisions.
	   The new rules empowers Turkey to stop traffic according to the
currents in the strait, stop any ship on legal grounds, require
more ships to take local pilots, impose traffic regulations on
military ships and demand more advance notice for the passage of
ships depending on the size of ships or type of cargo.
	   ``It would also make the Bosporus option as the main export
route for Caspian oil economically irrational,'' State Minister
Burhan Kara, in charge of maritime affairs, said. He said Turkey
also retains the right to increase the current transit fees
five-fold.
	   Russia criticized a similar crackdown in 1994, saying that it
violates the 1936 Montreux Convention which requires that during
peacetime all ships have freedom of passage in the straits, ``by
day and by night, under any flag and with any cargo, without any
formalities.''
	   Kara's announcement coincided with a meeting of Turkish and
Azeri delegations in Istanbul to put the final touches on
agreements for the construction of a pipeline that would carry
Caspian Sea oil to a Turkish Mediterranean port.
	   Under the agreements, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, whose
territory the pipeline would cross, give official consent to the
project.
	   ``We expect to finalize the host-country and inter-governmental
agreements by next week,'' Yurdakul Yigitguden, undersecretary of
the energy ministry, said. ``We want them to be realized as soon as
possible.''
	   Turkey and four former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan, Kazakstan,
Uzbekistan and Georgia signed a declaration in Ankara Oct. 29
supporting the Turkish proposal, which is backed by the United
States.
	   Representatives from an international oil consortium that will
chose the export route were also taking part in the Istanbul
meeting. The consortium is expected to announce its decision next
month.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered a
lackluster Marcelo Rios in the quarterfinal of the dlrs 2.55
million Paris Open on Friday, easily beating the world No. 2, 6-3,
6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, took exactly one hour to beat Rios,
who was roundly booed off the court by spectators who felt he
hadn't made an effort.
	   The match turned in the eighth game of the first set.
	   Kafelnikov broke serve while leading 4-3 with a smart backhand
drop volley, and held serve to take the set.
	   The Russian blasted Rios off the court in the second set with a
display of blistering serves and powerful returns.
	   Rios could have ended the week as world No. 1 by winning the
Paris Open, if Pete Sampras were to lose in the quarterfinals. But
the Chilean never looked comfortable against the powerful Russian.
	   ``The first set was unbelievable but he let himself down in the
second with some loose play,'' Kafelnikov said. ``From that point
on he gave me a lot of extra confidence and I never looked back.''
	   ``Once you give the idea that you are a bit down, or not
satisfied with something, that gives your opponent extra
confidence,'' the Russian said.
	   Kafelnikov's win also improves his chances of qualifying for the
ATP World Championship in Hanover next month.
	   Rios still hopes to end the year as number one.
	   ``Hanover will decide it,'' he said.
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Kafelnikov will play Britain's Greg
Rusedski, the player that beat him in the first round of last
month's Vienna Open event.
	   Rusedski, who retains a small chance of qualifying for Hanover,
had little trouble beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-2 in another
quarterfinal contest.

Russia, U.S. strike food aid agreement

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States and Russia signed an agreement
Friday for 3.1 million tons of U.S. food aid to help see Russia
through the long winter.
	   ``Our common cause has been fulfilled,'' Deputy Prime Minister
Gennady Kulik said after the talks ended Friday, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that an agreement had been reached. She said she was not
familiar with its details.
	   According to Russian news agencies, the agreement provides for
1.5 million tons of American wheat to be given to Russia, along
with a dlrs 600 million loan for the purchase of an additional 1.5
million tons of assorted other U.S. foodstuffs, including corn,
soybeans, meat and dried milk.
	   Finally, the U.S. would send 100,000 tons of food directly to
needy Russian regions.
	   Russian officials said the talks had stalled for a time over
American worries about possible corruption, and demands for strict
guidelines on how the food is distributed. Those concerns
forestalled an agreement Thursday and pushed the negotations into a
final, long day.
	   Some of the U.S. guidelines were ``utterly unacceptable to
Russia,'' Vladimir Scherbak, the first deputy agriculture minister,
told Interfax.
	   Kulik, who headed the Russian delegation, said Russia had agreed
to U.S. demands that the food aid be exempt from taxes and import
duties at the border, Interfax said. He said the issue of taxation
within Russia would be worked out later.
	   The Americans also insisted that profits from food aid sold by
the Russian government go to the country's Pension Fund, which is
chronically short of cash. As a result, many retirees have to wait
months to receive their pension money.
	   Kulik said that issue had been resolved.
	   ``We are ready to give (the money) to the Pension Fund and spend
it on social programs,'' he was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   In another development, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
discussed possible humanitarian aid with a European Commission
delegation. The talks were described as preliminary and no details
were announced.
	   Russia's economic crisis, along with shrinking food imports and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years, has raised concerns about
possible food shortages.
	   The State Statistics Committee reported Friday that grain
production had been tentatively measured at 51.5 million tons this
year, down 45 percent from 1997, Interfax said. Previously, the
government had said 55 million tons had been harvested this year.
	   Store shelves remain well-stocked, but food prices have risen
sharply in recent months and poor Russians may not be able to
afford what's available.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

DaimlerChrysler shares to start trading Nov. 17
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ DaimlerChrysler shares will start
trading Nov. 17 on the Frankfurt and New York stock exchanges,
under the stock symbol DCX, Daimler-Benz announced Friday.
	   Also Friday, Daimler ended its six-week stock swap, during which
shareholders could exchange Daimler shares for new Daimler-Chrysler
ones. Shareholders received one extra share for every 200 they
swapped. About 97 percent of shareholders participated during the
first four weeks.
	   Unswapped Daimler shares will remain on stock exchanges _ even
after the DaimlerChrysler merger _ because of lawsuits pending from
Daimler shareholders protesting the merger, a Daimler-Benz
spokesman said. The lawsuits do not pose a threat to the merger of
the German auto giant with U.S. carmaker Chrysler Corp.
	   Daimler shareholders who did not voluntarily swap their shares
will receive a lower dividend payment.

Combined Britain-Ireland golf team cancels Chile trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ A combined British-Irish women's
golf team on Friday pulled out of next week's World Amateur Golf
Team Championship in Chile over concerns for player safety.
	   The move came as Britain's highest court was to resume hearings
Monday to decide on the legality of the arrest in London of former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   The tournament involving three dozen teams is set for Nov. 12-15
is Santiago, the Chilean capital.
	   Jill Edwards, the chairman of the Ladies' Golf Union, said she
had followed the advice of Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth
Office and the union's legal advisers.
	   `` We are extremely disappointed that we have had to take this
course of action,'' she said. ``But given the recent developments
both in Chile and in our own courts we have decided to withdraw the
GB and I team from the championship.''
	   The combined Britain and Ireland team members were Rebecca
Hudson, Becky Morgan, Kim Andrew and captain Claire Dowling.
	   The men's event is set for Nov. 19-22 in Santiago, giving the
Royal and Ancient Club an extra week to decide on the trip. Men's
team members are Gary Wolstenholme, Luke Donald, Lorne Kelly and
Paddy Gribben.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Aid workers struggled Friday to
reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, who are in danger of dying from
starvation and disease in the wake of the storm that officials
estimate killed more than 10,000 people.
	   Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central
America, but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of
supplies reaching hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle:
only as much as could be dropped from a helicopter, when the
aircraft can get through.
	   In the Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have
receded, leaving a carpet of mud over hundreds of acres (hectares).
In many nearby villages, residents have gone days without potable
water or food.
	   A 7-month-old baby died in the village of Olvido after three
days without food. Residents feared more children would die.
	   ``The worst thing, the saddest thing, are the children. The
children are suffering, even dying,'' said the Rev. Cecilio Escobar
Gallindo, the parish priest.
	   A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally quiet
Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa,
delivering aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina.
	   Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn,
intended to visit Nicaragua on Friday to learn more about the
hurricane's impact, The Carter Center in Atlanta announced.
	   ``We hope this visit will help call attention to the suffering
and humanitarian need this disaster has created,'' Carter said in a
statement.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton requested a ``global relief effort''
to help Central America and boosted U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70
million. Clinton is dispatching a delegation next week led by
Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to deliver some of the
supplies destined for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala.
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added Nicaragua and Honduras
to a trip she plans to the region beginning Nov. 16.
	   Taiwan said today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to
Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The four countries
are among a dwindling number of nations that recognize Taiwan,
which China claims is a breakaway province.
	   Two British ships that were in the area on an exercise were on
their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, the Defense Ministry
said Friday.
	   ``It's a coincidence that the ships are there but they've got
men and equipment that can be put to work in an organized way,''
said International Development Secretary Clare Short.
	   Nicaragua said Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send
doctors as long as the communist nation flies them in on its own
helicopters and with their own supplies. Nicaraguan leaders
previously had refused Cuba's offer of medical help, saying it did
not have the means to transport or support the doctors.
	   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, who maintained close relations
with Fidel Castro during their 1979-90 rule, had criticized the
refusal by President Arnoldo Aleman's administration.

Germany's top central banker underlines banks' independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Moving to defuse a row, Germany's top
central banker said Friday he welcomed talks with politicians over
the country's interest rates but underlined the independence of the
country's central bank.
	   ``We want a productive cooperation that preserves our
independence,'' Hans Tietmeyer said.
	   Germany's new Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has conducted a
public row over interest rates with the country's central bank, the
Deutsche Bundesbank, and the new European Central Bank.
	   Lafontaine wants the banks to drop rates to boost growth and
help the government cut Germany's 10.1 percent unemployment.
	   Central bankers have refused, saying monetary policy should not
be swayed by broader social or economic considerations.
	   Both the Bundesbank and the ECB, which soon will set monetary
policy for most of Europe, were sovereign enough ``to carefully
weigh up all arguments, including those proposed by politicians and
in public,'' and to make their own decisions, ``whether in specific
cases against, or for public suggestions,'' Tietmeyer said.
	   The Bundesbank Thursday left Germany's core 3.3 percent interest
rate unchanged, even though Lafontaine attended the central council
reaching that decision, in a move widely interpreted as a rebuff.
	   Economic crises in Asia and Russia demanded above all a durable,
stability-oriented monetary policy, Tietmeyer said, adding that
``our interest rates are already low, however you twist and turn''
on the issue.
	   The ECB will set monetary policy for 11 of the European Union's
15 member states joining the launch of the common currency, the
euro, on Jan. 1.
	   It will set a common interest rate for the euro-zone, as the new
unified zone is known, requiring all the countries to converge
their rates to one, almost certainly Germany's 3.3 percent.
	   Since Germany's rate is the lowest of the 11 countries, that
means interest rates in Europe are already shifting substantially.
	   ``In this context, it is purely impossible to change interest
rates,'' said Bundesbanker Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher, speaking on
Inforadio Berlin-Brandenburg.

Serb police kill five Albanian guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. envoy meeting rebels. No pickup.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Five ethnic Albanian guerrillas were
killed Friday in a shoot-out with Serb police in Kosovo, Serb
sources said. It was the highest reported death toll in any clash
since an Oct. 12 agreement that established a de-facto cease-fire
in the restive Serbian province.
	   The details of the deaths could not be immediately confirmed,
but previous statements about similar violence have accurately
reported the number of casualties.
	   According to the statement issued by the Serb Media Center, a
mouthpiece for the Serb government, police killed the five rebels
Friday morning after they attacked a police patrol in southern
Kosovo. The statement said the attackers were dressed in uniforms
of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and had automatic rifles and
mortars.
	   No policemen were injured, the statement said.
	   Police reported that one ethnic Albanian guerrilla died in a
shoot-out near Klina. Ethnic Albanians in the region said police
attacked a vehicle, killing one ethnic Albanian and injuring
another.
	   The rebels were not formally part of the October agreement
signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. He agreed to
pulling back Yugoslav troops and Serb police from Kosovo, the
mostly ethnic Albanian province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   Showing their dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process,
ethnic Albanian rebels said Friday they intend to establish their
own civilian rule in territory they control in the province.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the KLA said its rebel
command had decided to form local government institutions,
disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanian political
leaders.
	   ``The purpose is to ease our army of the burden of civilian
administration in populated areas,'' the guerrillas' statement
read, adding that such a move was needed in present conditions of
war in Kosovo.
	   The move signals defiance not only of the Serbs but also of
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and international officials
trying to broker self-rule for the secessionist province. Rugova
has been elected Kosovo president in elections authorities consider
invalid, and an ethnic Albanian assembly also exists, though it is
rarely convened and also is not recognized by Serbian authorities.
	   The KLA has accused Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders of
trying to sell short their goal of independence.
	   The American envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, on Friday
handed rebel representatives a copy of the draft peace plan, said
Albanian sources, who asked for anonymity. Hill's office confirmed
a meeting but would not elaborate on its substance, beyond saying
the peace process had been discussed.
	   Rugova noted Friday that Kosovo refugees are slowly returning to
the homes they fled in the fighting and are beginning to rebuild
their shattered lives.
	   ``There are first signs of life,'' he told reporters in
Pristina, three days after touring Kosovo's countryside for the
first time in nine years. ``There is a great willingness on the
part of the people to get back to their homes and properties. They
should be offered a bit of sense of security.''
	   Rugova voiced hope that the 2,000-strong international
monitoring mission led by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe will provide that. The mission is expected to
be launched later this month.
	   Hill, also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said in
Belgrade Thursday that the talks were producing hopeful signs
despite occasional skirmishes in Kosovo.
	   Rugova said he was working with Hill on an interim agreement for
Kosovo and on forming ``an independent Kosovo police force which
will reflect the ethnic structure and which would work with the
help of the international community.''
	   Despite agreeing to troop pullback after being threatened by
NATO airstrikes, Milosevic is showing new defiance. The Serbian
government, which he controls, has rejected attempts by the U.N.
War crimes tribunal to come investigate charges of war crimes and
atrocities against civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, on Friday, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the alliance ``strongly supports Mrs. Arbour's
request.''
	   He urged Milosevic to cooperate fully with the international
tribunal according to its obligations under a U.N. Security Council
resolution.

French politician calls for renaming of London's Waterloo Station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGELA DOLAND &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ As French travelers emerge from the train that
crosses the Channel Tunnel, they step foot into London's Waterloo
Station.
	   But a station by any other name would seem more sweet.
	   ``It's a bit humiliating,'' says Florent Longuepee, a French
conservative politician who has asked British Prime Minister Tony
Blair to rename the station.
	   Longuepee feels the British are still chiding the French for
their defeat at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo, which signaled the end
of Napoleon's reign.
	   So he's sent a communique to British Prime Minister Tony Blair
gently rebuking the British for their lack of politesse.
	   ``At the time of European integration, to which I know you are
attached, it seems more than an opportune time that England rename
this train station,'' wrote Longuepee, a member of Jacques Chirac's
Rally for the Republic party.
	   The French and British, longtime rivals, both like to take a dig
at each other now and then over their past rivalries.
	   But now that the Channel has brought the two nations closer
together, the jokes must stop, said Longuepee, who is also a
councilman in the Paris region.
	   ``It's not a state affair,'' Longuepee explained in a telephone
interview. ``I'm not relaunching the Hundred Years' War,'' which
pitted France against England in the 14th and 15th centuries.
	   And he's certainly not suggesting the two countries rename all
monuments that have names evocative of past military glory.
	   What would Paris be without the Rue de Rivoli or the Austerlitz
train station _ both reminders of Napoleonic victories?
	   But Waterloo pushes the envelope of good taste, he said.
	   ``Phrased another way, it would be as if we renamed the train
station that welcomes travelers from Germany,'' he said. ``We could
call it `Verdun Station,' '' referring to the great World War I
battle in eastern France that Germany lost.
	   So far Blair has not commented on the letter, Longuepee said.
	   And if he declines to rebaptize the station?
	   ``Then, revenge,'' says Longuepee, laughing.
	   The French could rename the station on the other end of the
tunnel ``Fontenoy Station,'' he said.
	   After Fontenoy, where the French army beat the British in 1745.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government on Friday approved
1.89 billion pesetas (dlrs 13.4 million) in emergency aid for
Central America's victims of Hurricane Mitch.
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said the aid would be disbursed
immediately and showed Spain's ``complete solidarity'' with
countries that have a ``special connection'' based on linguistic
and cultural ties.
	   Spanish humanitarian organizations also reported donations
pouring in for victims of the hurricane, which killed thousands and
caused widespread damage in what were already some of the world's
poorest countries.
	   The Spanish branch of the Red Cross said it has received 2.1
billion pesetas (dlrs 15 million) in donations this week.
	   The Roman Catholic aid group, Caritas, said it had collected 600
million (dlrs 4.3 million) pesetas over three days and expected the
rate of donations to increase.
	   A third aid group, Intermon, said it had so far taken in 302
million pesetas (2.1 million dollars).

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government said Friday it will
ask Britain to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
to Madrid so he can face charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture.
	   Within hours of the announcement Chile protested by recalling
its ambassador, Sergio Pizarro, from Madrid for consultations.
	   The extradition had been sought by Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose
warrant led to the Oct. 16 arrest of 82-year-old Pinochet in London
as he recovered from back surgery.
	   The approval of Garzon's extradition request was announced by
government spokesman Josep Pique after a cabinet meeting.
	   Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, present at the briefing, said he
expected the request to reach the British Interior Ministry on
Tuesday.
	   Garzon passed on a formal extradition request this week to the
Madrid government.

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Bram Lomans scored two goals off penalty
corners and the Netherlands cruised to a 4-1 victory over Australia
Friday and into the Champions Trophy final.
	   The Dutch victory finished them with a 4-0-1 record and 12
points, atop the pool standings. It also enabled Pakistan to
overtake Australia for second place with a 3-1 victory over Germany
later in the day. Pakistan, Australia and South Korea finished with
eight points (2-2-1) but Pakistan edged out the other two on goal
difference.
	   Australia likewise edged out South Korea, but the two will face
off Sunday for third place.
	   The Dutch had to overcome not only the Australians, but the loss
of forward Teun de Nooijer, who returned home Thursday because of a
death in the family.
	   Remco van Wijk gave the Netherlands' the lead in 27th minute
before Lomans scored the first of his pair two minutes before
halftime.
	   Lomans struck again off a 39th minute before Marten Eikelboom
sealed the match with a superb field goal in the 51st minute.
	   Trailing 4-0, Australia's Adam Commens scored his team's loan
goal with a fast reverse flick from the top of the circle to defeat
goalkeeper Guus Vogels.

South Africa aim for British grand slam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South Africa's world champion rugby union team
arrived in England Friday for its month-long British Isles tour,
with coach Nick Mallett predicting a clean sweep of victories.
	   The Springboks, fresh from an undefeated Tri-Nations series win
over Australia and New Zealand, are confident of scoring a British
grand slam, commencing against Wales at Wembley on Nov. 14 and
culminating with a test against England at Twickenham on Dec. 5.
	   ``We've not lost for 18 (international matches) and we don't
intend to start now,'' Mallett told reporters in London. ``I don't
want to sound arrogant but I expect us to beat Wales, Scotland,
Ireland and England.''
	   The South Africans thrashed Wales by a record 96-13 in June, had
two convincing wins over Ireland and then beat England 18-0 at Cape
Town before winning the Tri-Nations series.
	   Mallett said the tour was important preparation for next year's
World Cup and the players and coaching staff were taking each match
seriously, starting with a tour match against Glasgow Caledonians
in Scotland on Tuesday.
	   ``We need to experience English winter conditions, so I'm hoping
for lots of bad weather,'' he said.
	   Mallett rated the Welsh team which South Africa humiliated in
June as the weakest test side he had ever seen on a tour but said
Wales would be harder to beat on home soil.
	   ``We turned them over in the summer but I expect this match to
be very different. They were missing many of their best players and
they've now got one of the world's best coaches in Graham Henry,''
he said.
	   Mallett said England would be the toughest team his side would
face on tour despite England's distastrous summer tour to Australia
and New Zealand.
	   ``They will want to wipe the slate clean after the summer and
I'm expecting them back to the form they were in when they held the
All Blacks last year,'' he said.
	   South Africa is the first team to attempt a grand slam tour of
Britain and Ireland since Australia achieved the feat in 1984.
	   But Mallett said the Springboks were capable of the grand slam
and of claiming the world record for the most consecutive test
victories in the process.
	   The All Blacks won 17 consecutive test matches in the
late-1960s. South Africa had a mini form slump after winning the
World Cup in 1995 but has recovered to win 14 successive tests,
including 13 under Mallett.

Holyfield-Lewis bout headed for Toronto or New York

	   TORONTO (AP) _ The heavyweight title fight between Evander
Holyfied and Lennox Lewis will be held in either Toronto or New
York, the Toronto Star reported.
	   ``This is a two-horse race,'' Greg Fritz, an official with Don
King Productions, told the Star. ``The Toronto people have made an
extremely attractive bid and Don is very interested in meeting
these guys in person.''
	   Fritz says SkyDome is in a close battle with New York City's
Madison Square Garden to secure the fight, scheduled for March 13.
	   Las Vegas was also bidding for the fight but dropped out last
week to concentrate on organizing Mike Tyson's comeback fight,
tentatively scheduled for Jan. 16.
	   Fritz said the departure of Las Vegas helped Toronto, but New
York may have a slight edge.
	   ``Right now it's 60-40 in New York's favor,'' Fritz said. ``But
that margin is narrowing to 50-50.''

India throws open Internet services to private sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India surrendered its Internet monopoly
Friday, offering foreign companies up to 49 percent stake in local
joint ventures, a domestic news agency reported.
	   Licenses would be issued to private companies for 15 years,
Junior Communications Minister Kabindra Purkayastha was quoted as
saying by United News of India.
	   Companies will be charged no license fee for the first five
years and will pay one rupee (less than a cent) for the next 10
years, Purkayastha said.
	   The federal government decided in September 1997 to throw open
Internet to private service providers, but implementation has been
stalled by bureaucratic problems.
	   License agreements that were to have been signed between the
government and prospective private Internet service providers were
blocked in February by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,
which said it had not been properly consulted in drawing up license
rules. New policy guidelines then had to be developed.
	   The Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited, the state-owned Internet
provider, is capable of serving only a limited number of users, and
current subscribers complain its service is overpriced and poor.

Serb police kill five Albanian guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 12 with U.S. envoy meeting rebels. Minor edits
throughout. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Five ethnic Albanian guerrillas were
killed Friday in a shootout with Serb police in Kosovo, Serb
sources said. It was the highest reported death toll since an Oct.
12 agreement established a de-facto cease-fire in the restive
Serbian province.
	   The details of the deaths could not be immediately confirmed,
but previous statements about violence have accurately reported the
number of casualties.
	   According to the statement issued by the Serb Media Center, a
mouthpiece for the Serb government, police killed the five rebels
after they attacked a police patrol Friday morning in southern
Kosovo. The statement said the attackers were dressed in uniforms
of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and had automatic rifles and
mortars.
	   No policemen were injured, the statement said.
	   Police reported that one ethnic Albanian guerrilla died in a
shootout near Klina. Ethnic Albanians in the region said police
attacked a vehicle, killing one ethnic Albanian and injuring
another.
	   The rebels were not formally part of the October agreement
signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. He agreed to pull
back Yugoslav troops and Serb police from Kosovo, the mostly ethnic
Albanian province in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
	   Showing their dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process,
ethnic Albanian rebels said Friday they intend to establish their
own civilian rule in territory they control.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the KLA said its rebel
command had decided to form local government institutions,
disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanian political
leaders.
	   ``The purpose is to ease our army of the burden of civilian
administration in populated areas,'' the guerrillas' statement
read, adding that such a move was needed in present conditions of
war in Kosovo.
	   The move signals defiance not only of the Serbs but also of
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and of international
officials trying to broker self-rule for the secessionist province.
Rugova has been elected Kosovo president in elections authorities
consider invalid, and an ethnic Albanian assembly also exists,
though it is rarely convened and is not recognized by Serbian
authorities.
	   The KLA has accused Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders of
trying to sell short their goal of independence.
	   The American envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, on Friday
handed rebel representatives a copy of the draft peace plan, said
ethnic Albanian sources, who asked for anonymity. Hill's office
confirmed a meeting but would not elaborate on its substance,
beyond saying the peace process had been discussed.
	   Rugova noted Friday that Kosovo refugees are slowly returning to
the homes they fled in the fighting and are beginning to rebuild
their shattered lives.
	   ``There are first signs of life,'' he told reporters in
Pristina, three days after touring Kosovo's countryside for the
first time in nine years. ``There is a great willingness on the
part of the people to get back to their homes and properties. They
should be offered a bit of sense of security.''
	   Rugova voiced hope that the 2,000-strong international
monitoring mission led by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe will provide that. The mission is expected to
be launched later this month.
	   Hill, also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said
Thursday in Belgrade that the talks were producing hopeful signs
despite occasional skirmishes in Kosovo.
	   Rugova said he was working with Hill on an interim agreement for
Kosovo and on forming ``an independent Kosovo police force which
will reflect the ethnic structure and which would work with the
help of the international community.''
	   Despite agreeing to troop pullback after threats of NATO
airstrikes, Milosevic is showing new defiance. The Serbian
government, which he controls, has rejected attempts by a U.N. war
crimes tribunal to come investigate alleged atrocities against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said
Friday that the alliance ``strongly supports Mrs. Arbour's
request.''
	   He urged Milosevic to cooperate fully with the international
tribunal according to its obligations under a U.N. Security Council
resolution.

Italian media group unplans to give up television channel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Mediaset SpA, Italy's television and
advertising company, said Friday that it didn't plan to give up a
television channel as part of its plan to create a European
television venture with Germany's Kirch Media Group.
	   ``We're working on the creation of a European network, but we're
not considering the sale or conferring of a television channel (to
a joint venture),'' said a spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, for Mediaset, the media arm of Fininvest, former Premier
Silvio Berlusconi's sprawling empire.
	   A report in Milan's financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore Friday
suggested that Mediaset could turn over one of its three channels
-- likely Rete 4 -- into a joint media venture with Kirch.
	   The report also said Kirch would give over its channel SAT1
while both Kirch and Mediaset would each turn over their 25 percent
stake in Spanish television station Telecinco to the new company.
	   Mediaset and Kirch have been in negotiations for a number of
months, but talks had previously stalled on a variety of issues.
	   While the newspaper report said that a letter of intent could be
signed soon, Mediaset said that details about the possible timing
of an accord, as well as other factors, weren't available.
	   In other media developments, RAI, Italy's state television,
approved a plan to seek a 10 percent stake in Telepiu as it seeks
to form a partnership in digistal television, newspapers reported.
The stake might grow to 35 percent through partners which may
include Olivetti, Wind and Banca Commerciale Italiana, the reports
said.
	   Italian dailies said the RAI board gave the green light on
Thursday to the plan, which would mean RAI cohabiting with an
offshoot of its rival television broadcaster. Telepiu is in
Berlusconi's media family.
	   There was no comment immediately available from RAI.
	   RAI was in heated negotiations wich Telecom Italia SpA until
recent management turmoil there drove RAI to consider other
alliances, namely the interest of France's Canal Plus AG, which
owns 90 percent of its Italian digital provider, Telepiu.
	   Telecom Italia chairman Gian Mario Rossignolo had been
spearheading negotiations with RAI, Rupert Murdoch's British Sky
Broadcasting Plc, and France's TF1, but was forced to resign last
month because of Telecom's management upheaval.

Rwanda acknowledges its troops in Congo

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ After three months of denial,
Rwanda on Friday officially acknowledged that it has troops in
Congo.
	   Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame made the admission after an
hour-long meeting with South African President Nelson Mandela, who
expressed hope the admission would remove ``the last stumbling
block'' after months of fruitless negotiations.
	   Civil war in the vast, mineral-rich central African country has
pulled in troops from at least six nearby countries since early
August.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila _ whose allies include
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad _ has charged that troops from
neighboring Rwanda back rebels trying to unseat him.
	   Kagame refused to specify the number of Rwandan troops in Congo
but said they were defending his country's security.
	   ``We support a withdrawal of all forces, including our own
forces,'' Maj. Gen. Kagame said. But ``any solution must take care
of our security concerns.''
	   Hutu rebels driven from Rwanda by Kagame's predominantly Tutsi
Rwandan Patriotic Front after the genocide in 1994 continued to
stage hit and run attacks on Rwanda from bases inside Congo.
	   Rwanda has refused to acknowledge its troops were in Congo to
avoid the impression that Congo's crisis stemmed from external, not
internal, friction, Kagame said.
	   But he said the ``situation has crystallized'' and shown that
not just rebels but other groups oppose Kabila's governance style.
Critics accuse Kabila of corruption, mismanagement and stirring up
ethnic rivalries.
	   Mandela said Rwanda's admission opened the way for a case fire,
withdrawal of all foreign troops and negotiations ``that will lead
to free elections'' in Congo.
	   The South African president said negotiations had to include the
government, rebels and political figures like former Prime Minister
Etienne Tshisekedi, Kabila's key political adversary.
	   In Kinshasa, Congo's Foreign Minister Jean Charles Okoto said
Kagame's admission merely confirmed what everyone knew all along.
He called for international sanctions against Rwanda.
	   ``Whatever reason they give for being in the Democratic Republic
of Congo cannot be legitimate,'' Okoto said.
	   Congolese rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba refused to comment
on Kagame's statement, and said only direct negotiations between
Kabila and the rebel coalition will bring peace.
	   ``There are two dimensions to the conflict: internal and
external. The sooner they are combined the better,'' Wamba said
from the eastern rebel stronghold of Goma.
	   Mandela said that after recent talks ``many felt that the fact
that Rwanda did not admit they were combatants created immense
difficulty in moving forward.''
	   He said Rwanda had been under pressure from United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Organization of African Unity
to acknowledge its presence in Congo.
	   Fearing an escalation in the fighting, the United States sent
Susan Rice, the top State Department official for African affairs,
to help find a solution.
	   But Kagame said her visit last week had just added one more
voice to many trying to speed up resolution of the crisis.
	   Kagame said Rwandan troops entered Congo in August, soon after
Hutu rebels attacked the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi on Aug. 8.

Arab League to meet on Palestinian-Israeli deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League will meet Monday to discuss
the aftermath of the Israeli-Palestinian accord, the league
announced Friday.
	   The meeting is at the instance of the Palestinian Authority,
whose officials have accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of seeking to delay implementation of the agreement.
	   In a statement, the league said Palestinian Planning Minister
Nabil Shaath handed its secretary general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, a
letter from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at a meeting in Cairo
on Friday.
	   Abdel-Meguid decided to call a meeting of the league's 22
permanent representatives, the statement said.
	   The accord signed in Washington on Oct. 23 commits Israel to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank over 12
weeks in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Muslim extremists.
	   Arafat's letter to the league would have been written before
Friday's bomb blast in a crowded market in Jerusalem, which killed
the two bombers and wounded 21 Israelis.
	   After the bombing, the Israeli Cabinet suspended the
implementation of the peace accord.

Lions vs. Eagles: Don't expect much offense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When they met in the 1995 playoffs, the Detroit
Lions and Philadelphia Eagles produced 95 points, an American
National Football League postseason record. Don't expect any such
fireworks on Sunday.
	   In fact, these teams might be hard-pressed to come close to the
24-17 score in their last game, two years ago.
	   The Eagles won both of those at Philadelphia, where they face
each other again this weekend. But those Eagles were a playoff team
and these are 1-7, have been blanked twice at home and come off a
34-0 shellacking by the Dallas Cowboys.
	   And these Lions are 2-6 and, barring an incredible second-half
surge, not headed for the playoffs _ or even a winning record.
	   ``Not only did we embarrass ourselves, we embarrassed the entire
city of Philadelphia,'' receiver Irving Fryar said of the Eagles'
nationally televised debacle against the Cowboys. ``Any glimpse of
hope we had is pretty much gone now.''
	   Adds coach Ray Rhodes: ``You put endless hours into doing this
stuff, and all of a sudden it blows up in your face. It's been a
long, long year. It's been hard. I ain't going to lie to anybody. I
don't think you can endure the type of season we've endured so far
and not have stress and be whacked out a little.''
	   The main interest at Veterans Stadium will be Barry Sanders, the
NFC's leading rusher once again. Sanders has a good chance to get
the 128 yards he needs for his 10th consecutive 1,000-yard season.
	   ``We run them twice a week after practice,'' Lions coach Bobby
Ross said. ``Barry runs every day. After practice, everybody's left
the field and there he is over there running.''
	   Sanders is fifth on the career list with 17,608 total yards and
needs 41 to pass Marcus Allen for fourth.
	   While the Eagles are playing out the string already, the Cowboys
(5-3) can take a stranglehold on the NFC East by beating the New
York Giants (3-5), particularly if the second-place Arizona
Cardinals (4-4) fall at home against Washington (1-7). The Redskins
won their first game of the season last Sunday over the Giants.
	   ``We really haven't put a whole lot of games together
back-to-back,'' Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin said. ``Until we do
that, we can't say we have a cushion. There's a doubt we'll be in
(the playoffs) until they start putting those Xs and Ys by your
name in the standings sheet.''
	   Dallas running back Emmitt Smith can break gridiron Pro Football
Hall of Famer Tony Dorsett's team record for rushing with 95 more
yards. Smith ranks eighth on the NFL's career rushing list with
11,942 yards.
	   The Redskins have new life after ending their slide, but the
game at Arizona means more for the Cardinals, who could be in
wild-card contention in the weak NFC by staying at .500.
	   Beating Washington might be a chore, though. The Skins came
storming out of their bye week to beat New York.
	   ``When you're struggling, it is a little depressing,'' coach
Norv Turner said. ``The whole approach when we started the bye was,
`Hey, let's put this behind us. We've got a week to regroup and we
can make this thing fun.' We can make these last nine weeks fun.''
	   Elsewhere Sunday, it's Atlanta at New England, Cincinnati at
Jacksonville, Indianapolis at Miami, New Orleans at Minnesota,
Oakland at Baltimore, St. Louis at Chicago, Carolina at San
Francisco, Buffalo at the New York Jets, Kansas City at Seattle,
San Diego at Denver and Tennessee at Tampa Bay.
	   Monday night, it's Green Bay at Pittsburgh.

Royal jigsaw fan borrows puzzles for a pittance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II doesn't waste a lot of the
royal purse on one of her favorite pastimes: She's joined a jigsaw
library that keeps her in puzzles for 30 pounds a year (dlrs 50).
	   The royal pet dogs apparently like to join in the fun, too.
	   ``Sometimes I get the puzzles back and some of the pieces have
been chewed _ I suppose it must be the corgis,'' says Pearl
Crompton, who runs the puzzle library from her home in Royal
Leamington Spa, central England.
	   Mrs. Crompton's most famous member prefers puzzles with pictures
of horses and dogs or portraits of historical figures.
	   ``I know I have sent her one of Windsor Castle, so that must
have been nice for her,'' the retired teacher said.
	   All the puzzles are wooden and the boxes have no pictures on the
front ``because it makes it more of a surprise,'' Mrs. Crompton
said.
	   She said the queen ``has been a member for 12 years and borrows
about 12 jigsaws every year at Christmas while she is at
Sandringham,'' the estate in southeast England where the royal
family usually spends the holidays.
	   Faced with this inroad into the queen's inner sanctum,
Buckingham Palace was noncommital.
	   ``The queen may well assemble jigsaws, but we don't comment on
her private pastimes,'' a palace spokeswoman said on customary
condition of anonymity.

Israel's parliament speaker praises Bulgaria for saving Jews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN TOSHKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The speaker of Israel's parliament, the
Knesset, praised Bulgaria on Friday for saving its Jews from Nazi
concentration camps in World War II and remaining free of
anti-Semitism.
	   ``Unlike other states in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria has never seen
anti-Semitism,'' Dan Tihon said. ``Jews have always been an organic
part of the life of Bulgarian society.''
	   Tihon addressed Bulgarian lawmakers in a session in memory of
Dimitar Peshev, a Bulgarian lawmaker who played a key role in
saving the 48,000 Jews living in the country in 1943 from being
deported to a death camp.
	   As deputy chairman of Bulgarian parliament, Peshev vehemently
opposed plans of the then pro-fascist government to send the entire
Jewish community to Auschwitz.
	   After a communist government took over in 1944, Peshev and the
rest of his government were sentenced for collaborating with the
Nazis. Peshev was sentenced to 15 years in prison and died in the
1970s.
	   Though an ally of Germany in the war, Bulgaria was the only
Eastern European country that prevented its Jews from being
deported to Nazi death camps.
	   ``We want to talk about Dimitar Peshev in order to build an
example in the fight against new genocides,'' said the Italian
Gabriele Nissim, whose book ``The Man Who Stopped Hitler,'' was
presented at the ceremony.
	   After 1948, Bulgarian authorities let 45,000 Jews emigrate to
Israel. The Jewish community in Bulgaria now numbers about 5,000,
most of whom live in Sofia.
	   In 1992, the Bulgarian government granted the country's Jewish
community the right to dozens of buildings nationalized by the
Communist government in the late 1950s and 1960s.
	   But roughly a third of the property hasn't changed hands yet
because of legal disputes and difficulties reaccommodating
administrative services, schools and hospitals housed there.

Norwegian company moves ahead with clean power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norsk Hydro ASA concern Friday announced
plans to build a hydrogen-burning power plant that it says could
produce electricity with virtually no climate-damaging emissions.
	   The 51-percent state-owned company notified the Norwegian Water
Resources and Energy Directorate of plans to build the plant, to be
called HydroKraft, pending approval by government agencies.
	   ``Assuming authority approvals during 1999, construction of the
power plant could be completed during 2002, with production startup
in early 2003,'' a company news release said.
	   Earlier this year, the concern announced a new technology that
would allow it to use clean-burning hydrogen to generate
electricity. The hyrdrogen for the plant would be extracted from
natural gas.
	   Norsk Hydro, a major petroleum producer, now says studies have
shown the proposal to be economically viable. It also said the
plant's carbon dioxide emissions would be 90 percent lower than
plants using natural gas.
	   Norway is the world's second-largest oil exporter, and also
produces vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore fields.
Virtually all of the country's electricity now comes from
hydroelectric plants.
	   Under the company's plans, natural gas, air and water would be
mixed to produce hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
	   The carbon dioxide would be sent by pipeline to the company's
planned Grane oil field in the North Sea and pumped into the
reservors to aid oil recovery. The hydrogen be burned to run
turbines producing 1,300 megawatts of electricity, or roughly 9
percent of Norway's current annual electricity productions.
	   Norsk Hydro wants to build the hydrogen-burning plant at
Karmoey, an island about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Oslo.

Woman who posed as mother of kidnapped baby arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A woman who posed for seven years
as the mother of a girl who disappeared in California was arrested
on weapons charges Friday after what may have been a suicide
attempt, police said.
	   The incident occurred at the home of Nilza Gierbolini hours
after she discovered the body of the man who lived at the house
with her, police said.
	   The series of events began when Gierbolini arrived at her home
in Carolina, a suburb of San Juan, and found the body of Rafael
Salort Bello, 41, who shared the residence with her. Police said
Salort was bleeding from the nose and mouth and the house appeared
ransacked, but the body showed no other signs of a struggle.
	   Friday morning, police said Gierbolini produced a gun and fired
one shot in what police described as a suicide attempt thwarted by
an official who was on the scene. Gierbolini was detained and the
gun was seized, police said.
	   Gierbolini was given a six-year suspended sentence in April for
falsifying a birth certificate of Crystal Leann Anzaldi, a girl who
disappeared from her home in San Diego in 1990 when she was 15
months old.
	   Gierbolini denied knowing that the girl had been reported
kidnapped. She said she was told by an acquaintance that the girl's
parents had died and she decided to return to Puerto Rico and raise
the girl as her own.
	   A grand jury in California investigated the case but no further
charges have been filed.
	   The girl is now in the custody of her father.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Twenty-two years after the Montreal Olympics,
members of the U.S. women's medley relay swim team have moved a
step closer to getting their silver medals upgraded to gold.
	   The case, which could set a precedent for retroactive action in
cases of alleged East German doping, is now in the hands of the
International Olympic Committee.
	   U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said Friday he
submitted a petition for the medal change to IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch.
	   Hybl said Samaranch accepted the letter without judgment and
promised to put the case before the IOC executive board meeting in
Lausanne, Switzerland, on Dec. 11-14.
	   The USOC is seeking ``appopriate medal recognition'' for the
American swimmers based on court evidence illustrating steroid use
by the East German team that beat them for the gold.
	   The U.S. team of Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camile Wright and
Shirley Babashoff finished 6.6 seconds behind the winning East
German team in Montreal.
	   A German court case has provided what the USOC sees as
irrefutable evidence that at least one of the East Germans, Andrea
Pollack Pinske, was boosted by anabolic steroids.
	   ``We're not going to seek medal recognition in any case where
there isn't conclusive evidence, either a confession or
conviction,'' Hybl said. ``We feel there is a conviction out of the
German court.''
	   Hybl said the USOC is not asking that the East German quartet _
Pollack, Ulrike Richter, Hannelore Anke and Kornelia Ender _
relinquish their medals because the doping appeared to be unknown
to the athletes at the time.
	   IOC officials have been reluctant to ``rewrite history'' by
revising results or medals from past Olympics. But the IOC said
earlier this year it would study individual cases involving
specific proof of alleged East German doping if they were brought
forward by national Olympic associations.
	   ``We're just asking to be dealt with on a case by case basis,''
Hybl said.
	   The USOC pressed ahead with its petition despite comments last
month by Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive board member, who said the
international body was opposed to retroactive action on suspected
drug users.
	   ``We are not going to change what happened in the past,'' Rogge
said. ``There's absolutely not going to be any change for things
that happened more than 10 years ago.''
	   If the U.S. petition is successful, it could open the floodgates
to claims from athletes who believe they were cheated out of medals
by doped East Germans.
	   Hybl said the USOC didn't rule out making further requests for
medal changes.
	   ``It's an on-going process,'' he said. ``At this juncture, we
are presenting one case. It depends what other convictions or
confessions come out of the German cases.''

For years, crisis in Caribbean cricket has been building up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Cricket-West Indies-Crisis &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ When the once-invincible West Indies
suffered humiliating defeat at the bats of minnows Kenya in the
1996 World Cup, Caribbean premiers decided it was time to act.
	   But two years later with West Indies cricket facing its worst
crisis in 20 years, the leaders seem to be advising from outfield,
compromised by their own failure to reinvigorate a sport
increasingly challenged in the region by basketball.
	   In the past, youngsters played impromptu cricket games on any
Caribbean back street, from Guyana, on the shoulder of South
America, to Jamaica in the northwest Caribbean to the British
territory of Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean.
	   Today, kids are shooting hoops and sporting Michael Jordan
T-shirts. It's an American that is their hero _ not cricket
superstar Brain Lara, the brilliant batsman from Trinidad who was
fired Wednesday as captain of the West Indian national team in a
pay dispute that threatens a long-awaited tour of South Africa.
	   To reverse this trend of cultural imperialism _ exported by
satellite TV _ and revive the fortunes of their cricket team, the
15-member Caribbean Community formed a committee in 1996. It
included the economic bloc's secretary-general, Edwin Carrington,
and Prime Ministers P.J Patterson of Jamaica, Edison James of
Dominica, Keith Mitchell of Grenada and Lester Bird of Antigua.
	   The most ambitious suggestion was to establish a kind of cricket
university to propagate the audacious style that supported a
15-year winning streak by the West Indies until Australia dethroned
them in the 1995-96 home series.
	   Later in 1996 came the unbelievable defeat by Kenya, debutantes
who scored the biggest upset in World Cup history.
	   In the end, the Caribbean leaders set themselves more modest
goals: to support the West Indies Cricket Board in administering
regional cricket and to help raise funds to keep players at home _
a move they hoped would revive crowd support to boost absymal match
attendance and inspire youngsters to further the game.
	   As if to justify the political intervention, the committee also
expressed the need to reinforce cricket's importance to tourism,
one of the biggest foreign currency draws, and as a unfiying force
in the region.
	   All the governments pledged to raise hundreds of thousands of
dollars for a fund to pay players not to compete for foreign club
teams, including in the South African league.
	   The board did pay lucrative fees last year to more than two
dozen cricket stars, including many who identified as future test
players. But this year, and for next, no money is available and
most players have resumed their play in England, Canada and other
leagues.
	   This latest crisis underlines the committee's failure.
	   It also comes at a time when the West Indies Cricket Board is
under scrutiny for a string of spectacular mistakes. Most notable
was the sedning of seven over-aged players to South Africa last
year to play in a world youth tournament. Organizers expelled the
players, attracting cries of shame and disgust from parents, media
and supporters throughout the Caribbean.
	   In addition, the board has yet to find sponsors for its premier
annual four-day tournament, making it the only country in the world
whose main competition cannot attract domestic or international
sponsorship. For 20 years, it was called the Shell Shield after its
main sponsor. When Shell pulled out, Jamaica's Red Stripe beer
company stepped in. But they too withdrew sponsorship last year.
	   Perhaps the most embarrassing moment came in January, when the
first test match against England at Jamaica's Sabina Park had to be
called off after barely an hour because the playing surface was so
cracked that dangerous balls bounced sharply, forcing the
Englishmen to duck. It was the first time in the 121-year history
of test cricket that a match was abandoned because of an unsuitable
pitch.
	   This week's decisions will provide more ammunition for critics
of the board, often described as secretive, elitist and unwilling
to account for its actions or expenditures.
	   Recently it has come under fire for drafting a new constitution
without consulting others and a decision to open an offshore bank
account on the British Virgin Islands that could further limit its
accountability.

Steffi Graf advances and reaches earnings landmark
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Spirlea reaching semifinals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf broke the all-time career
earnings record in women's sports Friday when she beat Anne-Gaelle
Sidot to reach the semifinals of the Leipzig Open.
	   With her latest comeback picking up speed, Graf beat the French
qualifier 7-5, 6-3 to earn a semifinal showdown with third-seeded
Dominique van Roost.
	   The victory pushed Graf's total career earnings to dlrs
20,348,992, vaulting her past Navratilova's 13-year-old earnings
mark of 20,344,061.
	   ``Such records do show what you've achieved but they are not all
that important to me,'' said Graf, a former longtime No. 1 who has
dropped to No. 22 after various injuries had curtailed her career
over the last 18 months.
	   The 29-year-old German is coming off surgery in the right wrist
that had sidelined her for two months and she is unseeded in a
tournament for the first time in 13 years.
	   ``I did not expect such a performance and I did not expect to
reach the semifinals,'' Graf said. ``I am moving well, I am
fighting, I am able to turn the match. I've made more progress than
I expected.''
	   Graf was one of the founders of the first tournament to be held
in former East Germany and has won the dlrs 450,000 event four
times. The victory over Sidot brought her record in Leipzig to
23-0.
	   Sidot, 19, broke Graf in the opening game and was serving for
the set when she had her serve broken as Graf's game picked up
momentum and her shots gained in power and precision.
	   ``It took me three-four games to loosen up,'' Graf said.
	   Graf won five games in a row as she clinched the first set and
went up 1-0 in the second. She broke serve again for a 3-1 lead,
but dropped her own serve in seventh game.
	   Leading 40-15 in the next, the 74th-ranked Sidot allowed Graf to
come back and break serve again. The German then served out the
match.
	   In another quarterfinal, second-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of
France beat eighth-seeded Anke Huber of Germany 6-3, 6-4.
	   Tauziat will next play fourth-seeded Irina Spirlea, the Romanian
who crushed Sarah Pitkowski of France 6-1, 6-1.

Death toll rises as Albanian rebels try to assert authority

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the worst violence in Kosovo
since a peace accord last month, five suspected ethnic Albanian
guerrillas died Friday in a shootout with Serb police, according to
a Serb media statement.
	   Details provided by the Serb Media Center, a mouthpiece for Serb
authorities, could not be immediately confirmed. But previous
statements about similar violence have accurately reported the
number of casualties.
	   The deaths raised the number of Albanians killed since Thursday
afternoon to seven and suggested violence was again on the rise as
the United States and European nations try to push ahead with the
Oct. 12 political agreement reached with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Foreign observers in Kosovo say attacks by both Serb forces and
Albanian guerrillas have increased this week. The Serb Radical
Party, an ultranationalist group in the government coalition with
Milosevic's Socialists, on Friday accused the guerrillas of attacks
that it said ``very seriously threaten to jeopardize efforts and
results'' of the agreement.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile, says Serb police
continue attacking and harassing Albanian villages to prevent
refugees from returning to their homes.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with KLA officials Friday in
Dragobilje, a village 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Albanian sources said he gave the rebels a draft
political agreement that will restore self-rule for the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo. Hill's office would only say that he
met with the rebels to discuss the peace process.
	   The rebels have rejected any political agreement that stops
short of full independence for Kosovo.
	   KLA representative Jakup Krasniqi confirmed the meeting and said
his side would comment on the document once it has had a chance to
review it.
	   Showing its dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process, the
KLA said Friday it intends to establish its own civilian rule in
territory it controls.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the guerrilla group said
its military command would form local government institutions,
disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanian political
leaders.
	   Such a move _ while difficult to achieve _ would widen a rift
among Albanians, most of whom support moderate leader Ibrahim
Rugova, and the minority that reject Rugova's nonviolent strategy
for the KLA.
	   Rugova has been elected Kosovo president in elections Serb
authorities consider invalid, and an Albanian assembly also exists,
though it is rarely convened and also is not recognized by Serbian
authorities.
	   At his weekly news conference Friday, Rugova said he hoped a
2,000-strong international monitoring mission led by the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe will provide
security for returning refugees. The mission is expected to be
launched later this month.
	   Milosevic stripped the majority Albanians of self-rule in 1989
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
That started a period of protests and increased violence that led
to his crackdown on Albanian separatists in February.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes against Serb and Yugoslav forces in Kosovo last month to
force Milosevic to agree to end his offensive, reduce forces to
pre-crackdown levels and allow refugees to return home.
	   The agreement also calls for reaching a political settlement,
and the proposal Hill gave the rebels on Friday was worked out with
moderate Albanian leaders who lack the support of the KLA.
	   According to the Serb Media Center, a police patrol in southern
Kosovo came under attack from guerrillas on Friday morning.
	   The statement said police fired back, killing five of the
attackers, who were dressed in KLA uniforms and had automatic
rifles and mortars.
	   No policemen were injured, the statement said. It added that two
vehicles used by the attackers, one with Kosovo license plates and
one with foreign plates, contained mortars, hand grenades, an
assault rifle and ammunition.
	   Two other Albanians were killed Thursday, according to Albanians
interviewed in central Kosovo. Police reported one Albanian
guerrilla died in a shootout near Klina, and uniformed KLA fighters
were seen preparing for a funeral Friday near Buroja in the same
area.

Norwegian company moves ahead with clean power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norsk Hydro ASA concern announced plans
Friday to build a hydrogen-burning power plant that it says will
produce electricity with virtually no climate-damaging emissions.
	   The 51-percent state-owned company notified the Norwegian Water
Resources and Energy Directorate of plans to build the plant, to be
called HydroKraft, pending approval by government agencies.
	   The company said if it receives the proper approvals in 1999,
construction of the plant would be completed during 2002 and
production startup would occur in early 2003.
	   Earlier this year, the company announced a new technology that
would allow it to use clean-burning hydrogen to generate
electricity. The hydrogen for the plant would be extracted from
natural gas.
	   Norsk Hydro, a major petroleum producer, now says studies have
shown the proposal to be economically viable. It also said the
plant's carbon dioxide emissions would be 90 percent lower than
plants using natural gas.
	   Norway is the world's second-largest oil exporter, and also
produces vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore fields.
Virtually all of the country's electricity now comes from
hydroelectric plants.
	   Under the company's plans, natural gas, air and water would be
mixed to produce hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
	   Norsk Hydro wants to build the plant at Karmoey, an island about
500 kilometers (300 miles) west of Oslo.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air
market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. Last Thursday, an assailant
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to express sorrow for the attack and said he
hoped it would not halt the peace agreement under which the
Palestinians are to gain 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of
January.
	   However, Netanyahu told Arafat that for the process to continue,
the Palestinians would have to step up their war against terrorists
in a significant way, a statement from Netanyahu's office said.

Arab League to meet on Palestinian-Israeli deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Explosion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League will meet Monday to discuss
the aftermath of the Israeli-Palestinian accord, it announced
Friday.
	   The meeting is at the insistence of the Palestinian Authority,
whose officials have accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of trying to delay implementation of the agreement.
	   In a statement, the league said Palestinian Planning Minister
Nabil Shaath handed its secretary general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, a
letter from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at a Friday meeting in
Cairo.
	   Abdel-Meguid decided to call a meeting of the league's 22
permanent representatives, the statement said.
	   The accord signed Oct. 23 in Washington commits Israel to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank over 12
weeks in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on Muslim extremists.
	   Arafat's letter to the league would have been written before
Friday's bomb blast in a crowded market in Jerusalem, which killed
the two bombers and wounded 21 Israelis.
	   After the bombing, the Israeli Cabinet suspended the
implementation of the peace accord.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air
market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. Last Thursday, an assailant
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to express sorrow for the attack and said he
hoped it would not halt the peace agreement under which the
Palestinians are to gain 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of
January.
	   However, Netanyahu told Arafat that for the process to continue,
the Palestinians would have to step up their war against terrorists
in a significant way, a statement from Netanyahu's office said.

Bacher, Lloyd travel to London for talk with Lara, Hooper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead; UPDATES with fresh Bacher quotes; official talks
could open tonight
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of South African cricket said Friday that
a letter from President Nelson Mandela could help resolve a pay
dispute that is threatening to wipe out the West Indies' historic
tour of the republic.
	   Ali Bacher, managing director of the South Africa cricket board,
traveled to London Friday accompanied by Clive Lloyd, manager of
the the West Indies touring squad, and West Indies Cricket Board
member Joel Garner.
	   The three met informally Friday with disgruntled West Indies
players, who are locked in a pay dispute with the WICB. Formal
talks with Countney Walsh, president of the West Indies Players
Association, were reported set for later Friday.
	   The WICB on Wednesday fired captain Brian Lara and vice-captain
Carl Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa. They want
better pay for players.
	   Bacher carried a letter from Mandela urging a resolution of the
impasse. Mandela stressed his hope that the West Indies can go
ahead with its first official tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid.
	   ``I'm sure the letter from the president will have a great
impression on the West Indies players,'' Bacher said. ``They know
him to be a man of great integrity and one of the great statesmen
of the century.''
	   ``One is confident of a result to the impasse,'' he added. ``I'm
sure the people in Caribbean and South Africa and world cricket in
general will see it as important that the tour goes ahead.''
	   The first match of the three-month tour is scheduled to begin
next Tuesday. The first Test is scheduled for Nov. 26.
	   The tour is considered crucial in promoting the game among South
African blacks in a country where whites run the sport.
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher said.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The WICB said it would fine the no-show players between 5 and 10
percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs 60,000
for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide player support. Only seven of the 16
members of the squad traveled to South Africa, and they reportedly
have since flown to London to rally around Lara.
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, rated the world's best batsman, hinted Thursday the tour
might go on if a compromise can be reached.
	   ``What has resulted so far is a bit unfortunate and I hope it
can be resolved in the near future,'' he said. ``The main thing is
that the West Indies tour to South Africa should be on. The people
want the tour to be on and hopefully something positive will come
out of it (in the meeting).
	   ``I am not a member of the West Indies cricket team at the
moment, but I would love to be there. My life is playing cricket.
When it is possible you could be there and you are not there
because of circumstances _ as in this case _ it is very
unfortunate.''
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

Death toll rises to four dead, two missing in Swiss explosion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARKUS BROTSCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The death toll rose Friday to four in
an explosion that destroyed a car dealership and an apartment
building in the Swiss capital of Bern, police said.
	   It is possible the death toll could rise to six, officials said.
Some 18 people, including two children, were injured.
	   City police say there is no evidence that the explosion Thursday
was deliberate.
	   The cause has yet to be determined, but it occured in the
basement, below the dealership's repair shop and gasoline pump,
said city prefect Sebastian Bentz.
	   A corner of the building was blown away and the rest of the
structure was in danger of collapse, complicating rescue efforts,
police said.
	   Only two of the bodies had been removed from the building Friday
afternoon because of the danger of collapse. One was identified as
a client of the garage.
	   Eighty firefighters were hindered by clouds of dust as they
tried to recover two other bodies. Police said two people were
still missing and they were unable to say whether they were the
bodies they are trying to reach.
	   The building will have to be demolished as soon as possible,
said Bentz.
	   The garage was owned by conservative Swiss lawmaker Walter Frey,
one of the country's biggest auto dealers.
	   Three years ago a a fire damaged another of his garages, with
suggestions at the time that it had been set by a political
opponent.
	   Insurance companies have estimated the cost of the damage at up
to 16 million francs (dlrs 11.5 million)

Barrett leads in penultimate U.S. LPGA event

 &UR; EDS: CORRECTING Lidback's first name to Jenny, CORRECTS
citizenship &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   HANNO, Japan (AP) _ American Tina Barrett tied her career-best
with a 7-under-par 65 Friday and took a two-stroke lead in the
opening round of the dlrs 800,000 Japan Classic, the next-to-last
official U.S. LPGA tournament.
	   Barrett sank seven birdies in a bogey-free trek over the
6,338-yard (5,768-meter), par-72 Musashigaoka Golf Club course near
Tokyo.
	   She earlier posted a 65 during the second round of the 1995
Oldsmobile Classic.
	   ``I'm happy with today's round,'' said Barrett, in contention
for her first title since winning the Mitsubishi Motors Ocean State
Open in 1989. ``I was hitting the ball close and that kept me in
the game.''
	   Swede-Peruvian Jenny Lidback shot a 67 to share second place
with Huang Yu-chen of Taiwan.
	   Hiromi Kobayashi, winner of the Rainbow Foods LPGA Classic in
August, and Nayoko Yoshikawa, winner of 29 titles on the Japan
tour, were another stroke back at 68.
	   The Japan Classic is a limited-field event featuring 45 of the
top players from the U.S. LPGA Tour and 38 members of the Japan
LPGA Tour.
	   Annika Sorenstam, who leads the race for U.S. LPGA's Player of
the Year points and the season money list, has skipped the
tournament.
	   So did rookie sensation Pak Se-ri, who has already clinched the
1998 Rolex Rookie of the Year honors.
	   The 21-year-old South Korean, forced to withdraw due to illness
and fatigue, will have only the Tour Championship in her bid to
overcome her 185.99-225.89 deficit against Sorenstam in the points
race.
	   The field at Hanno includes Sweden's Liselotte Neumann, who
hopes to defend her title. She turned in a 72 Friday.
	   Neumann has had a successful history at the Japan Classic,
finishing seventh or better in five out of eight tries, including
her victory last year and in 1991.
	   LPGA Hall of Famer Betsy King, winner of back-to-back Japan
Classic titles in 1992 and 1993, also went around in 72.
	   Akiko Fukushima, who was paired with King, shot a 73. The
25-year-old Fukushima, Japan's top money winner in the last two
seasons, has just qualified for the U.S. tour.

Kuwait beats Bahrain 2-0 in Gulf soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Kuwait beat Bahrain 2-0 Friday in a
lack-lustre game which cast doubt on their ability to retain the
Gulf Cup.
	   Kuwait attacked right from the start, but their tactics seemed
to click only in the last minute of the first half when Essam Saad
delivered a magnificent kick that brushed passed a defender's back
and into the right corner of the goal.
	   Forward Faraj Laheeb flicked the ball of a sliding Bahraini
keeper Mohammed Bubshait to give Kuwait its second goal in the 84th
minute.
	   Bahrain came close to scoring several times, but its players
failed to finish.
	   Bahraini defender Fayyadh Mahmoodh missed a penalty, provoking
groans from the host crowd of more than 20,000 spectators.
	   Kuwait now has six points in the tournament _ three from an
earlier win over Qatar. But it is a point behind Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates.
	   However, Kuwait can take comfort from the fact that the Saudis,
who are favored to win, only managed to draw with Bahrain.
	   In its next encounter Kuwait faces Oman.
	   The biannual tournament ends Nov. 12.

French politician calls for renaming of London's Waterloo Station
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment from Tony Blair's office in grafs 14-15 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA DOLAND &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ As French travelers emerge from the train that
crosses the Channel Tunnel, they step foot into London's Waterloo
Station.
	   But a station by any other name would seem more sweet.
	   ``It's a bit humiliating,'' says Florent Longuepee, a French
conservative politician who has asked British Prime Minister Tony
Blair to rename the station.
	   Longuepee feels the British are still chiding the French for
their defeat at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo, which signaled the end
of Napoleon's reign.
	   So he's sent a communique to British Prime Minister Tony Blair
gently rebuking the British for their lack of politesse.
	   ``At the time of European integration, to which I know you are
attached, it seems more than an opportune time that England rename
this train station,'' wrote Longuepee, a member of Jacques Chirac's
Rally for the Republic party.
	   The French and British, longtime rivals, both like to take a dig
at each other now and then over their past rivalries.
	   But now that the Channel has brought the two nations closer
together, the jokes must stop, said Longuepee, who is also a
councilman in the Paris region.
	   ``It's not a state affair,'' Longuepee explained in a telephone
interview. ``I'm not relaunching the Hundred Years' War,'' which
pitted France against England in the 14th and 15th centuries.
	   And he's certainly not suggesting the two countries rename all
monuments that have names evocative of past military glory.
	   What would Paris be without the Rue de Rivoli or the Austerlitz
train station _ both reminders of Napoleonic victories?
	   But Waterloo pushes the envelope of good taste, he said.
	   ``Phrased another way, it would be as if we renamed the train
station that welcomes travelers from Germany,'' he said. ``We could
call it `Verdun Station,' '' referring to the great World War I
battle in eastern France that Germany lost.
	   So far Blair has not commented on the letter, Longuepee said.
	   A spokesman for Blair, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said Blair's office has not received the alleged letter
asking for Waterloo to be renamed.
	   There are no plans to rename the station, he said.
	   Asked what would happen if Blair declines to rebaptize the
station, Longuepee, said laughing, ``Then, revenge.''
	   The French could rename the station on the other end of the
tunnel ``Fontenoy Station,'' he said.
	   After Fontenoy, where the French army beat the British in 1745.

UEFA to decide on Fiorentina-Grasshoppers match Sunday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from clubs, UEFA. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA's control and disciplinary panel
will decide Sunday what action to take over the explosion that
caused the suspension of a match between Fiorentina and
Grasshoppers of Switzerland, the European body said Friday.
	   ``It will be a difficult decision to take,'' UEFA general
secretary Gerhard Aigner said. ``We have to make a decision that
makes sense in the context of football.''
	   UEFA representatives asked the referee not to start the second
half of Tuesday's second-round second leg UEFA Cup match after an
off-field official was injured by the blast from a device hurled
from the stands.
	   Fiorentina sports director Melo Governato said he was confident
``everything will turn out all right. We could do nothing about the
incident. We consider it a terrorist act by one person. It has
nothing to do with sports. It was just a mad person.''
	   Fred Bickel, Grasshoppers' technical coordinator, said, ``It's a
bit idiotic what happened.''
	   The game was being played in Salerno, near Naples, following the
suspension of Fiorentina's own ground and to raise funds for the
victims of recent flooding in southern Italy.
	   ``The investigation is ongoing,'' Aigner said. ``Evidence still
has to be produced. For the moment it is still unclear who the
culprit is.''
	   Police in Salerno have questioned an unidentified local man who
is a suspect, according to Italian newspapers.
	   Although playing away from home Fiorentina still was considered
responsible for the fans' behavior in Salerno and could face a ban
from European competition of one or more seasons and a 3-0 forfeit
defeat.

DiMaggio has setback, being sedated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ American baseball legend Joe DiMaggio
had a setback in his fight against pneumonia and a lung infection,
and is expected to be hospitalized for at least six to eight weeks
more.
	   ``I just got back from the hospital and he's very sick,'' Morris
Engelberg, DiMaggio's lawyer and friend, said Friday.
	   The 83-year-old DiMaggio had been getting out of bed since the
weekend, and doctors said that aggravated his condition.
	   ``He will be sedated for four to six days so he can breathe
easier,'' said Engelberg, adding that DiMaggio also was aided by an
oxygen device.
	   ``But the doctors have told him his life is not in danger,'' he
said.
	   The setback ended hopes that the Yankees' Hall of Fame
outfielder would be out in time for his 84th birthday Nov. 25. He
entered Memorial Regional Hospital on Oct. 12.
	   ``He's going to be in the hospital, intensive care, for six to
eight weeks,'' Engelberg said. ``And then he will have to go into
rehabilitation just because he's been in bed for about 25 days
now.''

 &UR; Prince urges business leaders to be active in community
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Sofia events; CHANGES dateline

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ On the first day of a visit to Bulgaria,
Britain's Prince Charles urged local business people Friday to take
a role in community development and donated ambulances to a Sofia
hospital.
	   The Prince of Wales addressed members of Bulgaria's Business
Leaders' Forum, one of 30 similar organizations he helped establish
around the world, which encourage businesses to contribute to
social development.
	   ``Business has to have a truly human face, to be socially
responsive,'' Prince Charles said.
	   ``The more trouble you take with the community, the more your
business will be rewarded in the long term,'' he said. ``If you
help, for instance, to create small new enterprises with the young
talents who exist in Bulgaria, you are making a real contribution
to the country's future.''
	   Earlier in the day, the prince visited Sofia's Queen Ioanna
Hospital and delivered a donation of 12 British ambulances. He
toured the hospital and met leukemia patients in the children's
ward.
	   In front of the hospital, the heir to Britain's throne shook
hands and talked to some of the bystanders who cheered him.
	   Prince Charles was received by President Petar Stoyanov and his
wife, Antonina.
	   On Saturday, the Prince of Wales is scheduled to visit the
country's second-biggest city, Plovdiv, and meet members of the
local gypsy minority.
	   The prince began his trip to Southeastern Europe on Monday with
a visit to Slovenia. He then headed to Romania, before arriving in
Bulgaria on Friday. He leaves Sunday for Macedonia.

U.S. agrees to WTO report on shrimp import ban and turtle deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States on Friday formally accepted a
ruling by the World Trade Organization that its restrictions on
imported shrimps violate free trade _ but left open whether and how
it would change its laws.
	   U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said the Clinton administration
was consulting with Congress and other interested parties on what
to do and would advise the WTO within the required 30 days.
	   At issue is a U.S. embargo on shrimp imports from India,
Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand, which use trawling nets that trap
endangered sea turtles. Environmentalists say failure to equip
shrimp nets with turtle-excluder devices costing dlrs 75 causes the
death of 150,000 turtles a year worldwide.
	   A WTO appeals body last month upheld the findings of an expert
panel report that the U.S. rules amounted to ``arbitrary and
unjustifiable discrimination.''
	   Under WTO procedures, the report of its appellate body is final.
Hayes' announcement to the Dispute Settlement Body that Washington
would go along with the WTO findings was therefore a formality.
	   Significantly, although it faulted the United States for the way
its rules were carried out, the WTO appeals body said it recognized
the right of members to adopt conservation laws.
	   This recognition may prove to be important in the future.
	   The WTO has frequently come under fire from environmental groups
for putting free trade before conservation. A fringe group of
environmentalists last week hit WTO director-general Renato
Ruggiero with cream pies, accusing him of being a turtle killer.
	   ``We welcome the appellate body statement that sovereign states
can and should adopt effective measures to protect endangered
species such as sea turtles,'' Hayes told journalists.
	   ``To the United States, these findings support our view that WTO
rules, when they are appropriately interpreted, provide broad scope
for members to protect the environment and preserve very precious
resources,'' she said.
	   The U.S. view that the appellate body at least partly vindicated
its policy on shrimp imports may cause problems ahead if it doesn't
change its laws to the satisfaction of India, Malaysia, Pakistan
and Thailand.
	   Thailand's representative, Krit Garnjana-Goonchorn, said the
appeal body's view might set an unwelcome precedent.
	   ``The decision may already have opened a floodgate foreshadowing
greater abusive use of trade-related environmental measures in the
future,'' he said.
	   The Thai statement said the appeals body should not have
accepted submissions from environmental groups as they were not a
direct party in the dispute.

of three Palestinian militant groups joined ranks Friday to protest
the new peace accord with Israel and threaten violence.
	   Chanting ``revolution is the solution,'' the crowd called on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to abandon the peace process and
join them in their struggle against Israel.
	   At the rally, members of a radical PLO faction _ the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine _ as well as the Islamic
militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad stood united against the
accord signed two weeks ago in Washington.
	   In the agreement, Israel pledged to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank by the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on militant group. The agreement gave the CIA a role in
monitoring Palestinian compliance.
	   Islamic Jihad leader Abdallah Shami told the crowd of 350 that
U.S. involvement in Palestinian affairs.
	   ``We reject a CIA presence in our land just as we reject those
who have occupied us,'' Shami said.
	   Palestinian Communications Minister Imad Falouji, a former
spokesman for Hamas who has refused to adopt the Palestinian
Authority line in favor the peace agreement, spoke out harshly
against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon.
	   ``Netanyahu insists on blowing up the regional situation but we
want to tell him that if you put pressure on the Palestinian people
and against the Palestinian organizations, those groups will point
their arrows against you and against Sharon,'' Falouji said.
	   Falouji bristled at Arafat's promise to revoke clauses of the
PLO founding charter calling for the destruction of Israel.
	   ``They can throw away all the papers but we will continue to
remember every word and we will write it down not on paper but on
places which no one can steal or cover up,'' Falouji said.

U.N. torture expert invited to visit Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A top U.N. expert on torture has been invited for
a ten-day fact finding visit to Turkey, which has long been accused
of abusing prisoners and Kurdish sympathizers.
	   Special investigator Nigel Rodley plans to meet government
officials, non-governmental organizations and private individuals
during his trip Nov. 9-19, a U.N. statement said Friday.
	   He also hopes to visit prisons and other detention centers in
Ankara, Istanbul and the southeastern province of Diyarbakir _ one
of the bases of Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy from Turkey.
	   Rodley, a British law professor, will present his findings to
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights at its annual session next
March.
	   Human rights organizations like Amnesty International maintain
that torture is rife in Turkish prisons, which house some 9,000
prisoners linked to leftist or Kurdish groups. The government is
also frequently criticized for its violent suppression of the
Kurdish separatist movement.
	   Rodley has previously made visits to Russia, Rwanda, Colombia,
Chile, Pakistan and Mexico.

 &UR; Eds: FIXES Courtney Walsh spelling 3rd graf; ADDS call from WICB to
be fired in 13th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of South African cricket said Friday that
a letter from President Nelson Mandela could help resolve a pay
dispute that is threatening to wipe out the West Indies' historic
tour of the republic.
	   Ali Bacher, managing director of the South Africa cricket board,
traveled to London Friday accompanied by Clive Lloyd, manager of
the the West Indies touring squad, and West Indies Cricket Board
member Joel Garner.
	   The three met informally Friday with disgruntled West Indies
players, who are locked in a pay dispute with the WICB. Formal
talks with Courtney Walsh, president of the West Indies Players
Association, were reported set for later Friday.
	   The WICB on Wednesday fired captain Brian Lara and vice-captain
Carl Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa. They want
better pay for players.
	   Bacher carried a letter from Mandela urging a resolution of the
impasse. Mandela stressed his hope that the West Indies can go
ahead with its first official tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid.
	   ``I'm sure the letter from the president will have a great
impression on the West Indies players,'' Bacher said. ``They know
him to be a man of great integrity and one of the great statesmen
of the century.''
	   ``One is confident of a result to the impasse,'' he added. ``I'm
sure the people in Caribbean and South Africa and world cricket in
general will see it as important that the tour goes ahead.''
	   The first match of the three-month tour is scheduled to begin
next Tuesday. The first Test is scheduled for Nov. 26.
	   The tour is considered crucial in promoting the game among South
African blacks in a country where whites run the sport.
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher said.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The WICB said it would fine the no-show players between 5 and 10
percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs 60,000
for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide player support. Only seven of the 16
members of the squad traveled to South Africa, and six have since
flown to London to rally around Lara.
	   On Friday, Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll joined calls for
the WICB to be fired. ``The members of the board should be fired,''
he declared. ``This is not simply a matter of cricket and the board
cannot be allowed to treat the players in such a manner.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, rated the world's best batsman, hinted Thursday the tour
might go on if a compromise can be reached.
	   ``What has resulted so far is a bit unfortunate and I hope it
can be resolved in the near future,'' he said. ``The main thing is
that the West Indies tour to South Africa should be on. The people
want the tour to be on and hopefully something positive will come
out of it (in the meeting).
	   ``I am not a member of the West Indies cricket team at the
moment, but I would love to be there. My life is playing cricket.
When it is possible you could be there and you are not there
because of circumstances _ as in this case _ it is very
unfortunate.''
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

U.N. signs agreement to expand rights presence in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights signed
an agreement Friday with Yugoslavia intended to allow increased
monitoring of the situation on the ground.
	   The agreement states that U.N. human rights officials ``shall
enjoy unimpeded freedom of access throughout ... Yugoslavia,''
according to a statement by the office of Mary Robinson, the U.N.
commissioner.
	   The accord puts the office's operations in Belgrade, where it
has been since 1996, on a permanent footing.
	   Up to 12 monitors will be deployed in Yugoslavia by the end of
November. The statement added that Robinson ``hopes to reach a
quick agreement for the opening of sub-offices in the province of
Kosovo.''
	   Yugoslavia has undertaken to ``ensure that no person who comes
into contact with the office or its personnel is subjected to
abuse, threats or reprisals,'' the statement added.
	   Yugoslav ambassador Branko Brankovic signed the accord.
	   Its impact remains to be seen.
	   Belgrade refused late Wednesday to grant visas and allow staff
from the international war crimes tribunal to probe atrocities in
Kosovo.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Essam Saad finally converted after 44
minutes of Kuwaiti control and paced his nation to a 2-0 victory
over Bahrain in the Gulf Cup.
	   The Kuwaitis attacked from the start and finally led when Saad's
shot deflected in off a defender's back into the right corner of
the net.
	   Forward Faraj Laheeb added the insurance in the 84th, flicking
the ball past sliding Bahraini keeper Mohammed Bubshait.
	   Bahrain had several chances, including Fayyadh Mahmoodh's missed
penalty, provoking groans from the crowd of more than 20,000.
	   The victory improved Kuwait to 2-0-1 and six points, in third
one point behind Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Official: Mercedes could drop out of Formula One in 2002
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Mercedes could pull out of Formula One
racing after 2002 despite winning the title in the just-concluded
season, according to the chairman of the Daimler-Benz automobile
division.
	   ``It's imaginable. It's clear that we'll stay there until then.
But it's also clear that we won't be driving in the Formula One for
20 years,'' Juergen Hubbert was quoted as saying in Saturday's
edition of the Stuttgarter Zeitung.
	   Mika Hakkinen won this season's drivers' championship in a
McLaren car powered by a Mercedes engine and the team also clinched
the constructors' title.
	   Hubbert told the newspaper he was looking forward to BMW's entry
into Formula One in 2000, when the big German rival of Mercedes
will start supplying engines to the Williams team.
	   ``I have to take on this challenge, it's our next goal. This
will be another sensation for the German public,'' Hubbert was
quoted as saying in the interview.
	   The newspaper, which like Mercedes is based in Stuttgart,
released parts of the interview Friday in advance of its
publication Saturday.
	   Hubbert also urged another Stuttgart-based rival company,
Porsche, to return to Formula One racing.

Argentine GP disqualification lifted for Italian rider
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The international motorcycle racing federation has
lifted the disqualification of newly-crowned world 250-cc champion
Loris Capirossi following the Grand Prix of Argentina last month.
	   Capirossi's lawyer, Massimo Coccia, said Friday that the Italian
rider of Aprilia was reinstated to second place in the race behind
Valentino Rossi.
	   Capirossi had been punished by stewards of the Argentine GP
following a last-lap collision with Japanese rider Tetsuya Harada,
his top contender for the world title in the 250-cc class.
	   Harada fell and lost his title chances in the collision with
Capirossi.
	   Capirossi still clinched the world title despite
disqualification and the loss of championship points. He appealed
the decision.
	   ``I am happy because this decision takes some shadows off my
world title .... I only tried to overtake Harada while riding
through a difficult inside passage,'' Capirossi told the Italian
news agency ANSA.

U.S. agrees to WTO report on shrimp import ban and turtle deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three finals grafs on salmon decision &QL; 
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States on Friday formally accepted a
ruling by the World Trade Organization that its restrictions on
imported shrimps violate free trade _ but left open whether and how
it would change its laws.
	   U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said the Clinton administration
was consulting with Congress and other interested parties on what
to do and would advise the WTO within the required 30 days.
	   At issue is a U.S. embargo on shrimp imports from India,
Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand, which use trawling nets that trap
endangered sea turtles. Environmentalists say failure to equip
shrimp nets with turtle-excluder devices costing dlrs 75 causes the
death of 150,000 turtles a year worldwide.
	   A WTO appeals body last month upheld the findings of an expert
panel report that the U.S. rules amounted to ``arbitrary and
unjustifiable discrimination.''
	   Under WTO procedures, the report of its appellate body is final.
Hayes' announcement to the Dispute Settlement Body that Washington
would go along with the WTO findings was therefore a formality.
	   Significantly, although it faulted the United States for the way
its rules were carried out, the WTO appeals body said it recognized
the right of members to adopt conservation laws.
	   And, in a first, it accepted evidence from environmental groups
rather than just the governments directly concerned.
	   This may prove to be important in the future.
	   The WTO has frequently come under fire from environmental groups
for putting free trade before conservation. A fringe group of
environmentalists last week hit WTO director-general Renato
Ruggiero with cream pies, accusing him of being a turtle killer.
	   ``We welcome the appellate body statement that sovereign states
can and should adopt effective measures to protect endangered
species such as sea turtles,'' Hayes told journalists.
	   ``To the United States, these findings support our view that WTO
rules, when they are appropriately interpreted, provide broad scope
for members to protect the environment and preserve very precious
resources,'' she said.
	   The U.S. view that the appellate body at least partly vindicated
its policy on shrimp imports may cause problems ahead if it doesn't
change its laws to the satisfaction of India, Malaysia, Pakistan
and Thailand.
	   Thailand's representative, Krit Garnjana-Goonchorn, said the
appeal body's view might set an unwelcome precedent.
	   ``The decision may already have opened a floodgate foreshadowing
greater abusive use of trade-related environmental measures in the
future,'' he said.
	   The Thai statement said the appeals body should not have
accepted submissions from environmental groups as they were not a
direct party in the dispute.
	   Pakistan, India and Malaysia made similar comments.
	   Separately at Friday's meeting, Australia said it would accept a
WTO ruling that it must allow Canadian salmon into the country.
Australia had imposed a ban, saying it threatened to introduce
diseases into the local industry which are endemic in the northern
hemisphere.
	   Australia unsuccessfully appealed the panel's decision.

Massachusetts explorer finds wrecked 17th Century French fleet
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS AVES, Venezuela _ Explorers have found a fleet of rare
pirate ships and French warships that sank three centuries ago off
the coast of Venezuela, discovering a ``graveyard'' of rare bronze
cannons, a 5,000-pound (2,300-kilo) anchor, and cannonshot the size
of bowling balls.
	   During a two-week expedition that ended Thursday, the divers
found nine wrecks that include what appear to be only the second
and third pirate ships ever discovered, said mission leader Barry
Clifford.
	   They found remnants of the fleet's majestic 70-gun, 500-man
flagship, ``The Terrible,'' a 15-foot (5-meter) anchor with a ring
so large divers swam through it, and what appeared to be pistols,
swords and coins ``stacked up like poker chips,'' said Clifford, a
native of Cape Cod in the eastern U.S. state of Massachusetts.
	   ``I don't know of any place like this in the world where you
have so many untouched shipwrecks,'' he said.
	   The fleet of 35 ships carrying 6,000 men was on its way to
invade Dutch-held Curacao island the night of May 11, 1678 when it
crashed on coral reefs about a half-mile (kilometer) off Las Aves
(The Birds) islands.
	   Up to 18 ships sank, 500 men drowned and another 1,000 died of
starvation and disease while marooned on bug-infested Las Aves, 150
kilometers (90 miles) off Venezuela's coast. The French rescued
1,500 men three months later.
	   The disaster ``changed the course of history in the Caribbean,''
devastating the French Navy and creating a power vacuum that helped
usher in the 1680-1730 ``Golden Age'' of pirating, Clifford said.
	   He and pirate expert Kenneth Kinkor believe one of the survivors
was Laurens De Graaf, a former Dutch slave who became one of the
most successful pirates in history.
	   Another was a French nobleman-turned-pirate named Chevalier de
Grammont who became one the world's wealthiest and most notorious
buccaneers, Kinkor said.
	   Clifford and his divers relied partly on a map from Paris's
Naval Museum that was drawn by one of the French rescuers. At one
spot they found nine of the types of small cannons commonly used on
pirate ships and seven wood barrels that may have been aboard a
pirate supply ship.
	   ``I'm as sure as I can be that we found two pirate ships,'' said
Clifford, adding that the pirates were likely hired as mercenaries
to aid in the invasion of Curacao.
	   The explorers found about 120 bronze cannons from the French
ships that may be worth millions of dollars. Some are too thick for
a person to wrap his arms around. Near ``The Terrible'' about 40
cannons were stacked up like a cord of wood.
	   The ships' ``wood is gone, it's been eaten up by the worms, but
everything else is there,'' Clifford said.
	   Most of the objects were in three to 20 feet (one to seven
meters) of water, with some cannons sitting on coral reefs just
below the water's surface.
	   The ships were lured to the site by three Dutch vessels that
shot off cannons and provoked a chase that led the French onto the
reefs, which could not be seen at night, Kinkor said.
	   The vessels anchored to try to keep from being dragged across
the razor-sharp reefs but could not resist high winds and heavy
seas. They left swaths that are still visible.
	   The explorers first sighted some artifacts during a brief visit
to Las Aves in March, but confirmed their discovery on the latest
expedition.
	   The divers included Maxwell Kennedy, the son of the late Robert
F. Kennedy, and Venezuelan explorer Charles Brewer-Carias.
	   Some local fishermen and divers have seen bits of the wrecks
over the years, but this was the first extensive scientific effort
to locate and identify all the ships, said Brewer-Carias.
	   The explorers, who did not remove any of the artifacts, plan to
lobby Venezuela's government to declare the site a protected
underwater museum. They said at least one group of treasure hunters
from Florida already has obtained a permit from Venezuelan
authorities to extract and sell the artifacts.
	   ``To let treasure hunters in here to rip this place apart would
be a sin,'' said Clifford, adding that the fragile coral reef also
would be destroyed.
	   Clifford himself is controversial among marine archeologists who
believe only scientists should be allowed to research historic
shipwrecks. An archeologist was part of Clifford's team.
	   Clifford discovered the first pirate ship in the world in 1984
when he located the 1717 wreck of the Whydah off Cape Cod.
	   A joint BBC-Discovery Channel crew filmed part of the Las Aves
expedition and plans to air a one-hour program next year.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Katerina Yiatzoglou's smile and youthful
looks are her trademark. A television personality, she regularly
appears on magazine covers and graces the social columns.
	   But police at Athens International Airport were not impressed.
	   Yiatzoglou was arrested Friday for allegedly doctoring her
passport to appear two years younger, police said.
	   A special scanner detected the altered last digit on the
passport entry displaying her birth of date. Instead of writing
1960, the passport said 1962.
	   She was taken to a prosecutor and charged with forging a
government document, and missed her flight to London.
	   But the troubles may be just beginning for Yiatzoglou, with some
media reports hinting that she may in her 40's.
	   Yiatzoglou became a household name through her marriage and
subsequent breakup with former Greek American basketball player
Steve Yiatzoglou, who is currently a coach.

promising to help the neighboring nation's new prime minister in
his efforts.
	   Slovak Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda met with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima on his first foreign trip, arriving from
Brussels where he met with EU and NATO officials.
	   The two leaders' talks focused on what Slovakia needs to do to
strengthen its bid to join the EU, which was given new life when
Dzurinda's new government replaced the authoritarian regime of
Vladimir Meciar on Oct. 30.
	   Necessary changes, Klima said, involve shoring up democracy,
human and minority rights, as well as rights for the parliamentary
opposition.
	   Austria, which holds the rotating EU presidency, ``supports very
strongly Slovakia's integration into the EU ... (and) is ready to
hold the door open for concrete discussions on making this
happen,'' Klima said.
	   He offered to share information from Austria's experience in
joining the EU, which it entered only in 1995. The two countries
agreed to set up bilateral working groups to deal with economic and
employment issues.
	   Dzurinda said he sees Austria as Slovakia's No. 1 supporter for
joining the European body.
	   Noting the two countries' past disputes over Slovakia's nuclear
power stations at Mochovce and Jaslavske Bohunice, he assured Klima
that ``the major concern is for the safety of Slovak and
neighboring citizens.''
	   Dzurinda promised that Austria would be able to see all safety
records on the power plants.
	   Dzurinda's early foreign trip shows that the new government has
made it a top priority to improve its international image. Slovakia
has lagged behind its Central European neighbors in consideration
for possible EU membership because of Meciar's anti-democratic
practices.
	   The recent change of governments has been widely hailed.
President Vaclav Havel of the neighboring Czech Republic, whose
relations with Slovakia were chilly during the Meciar years, visits
the capital Bratislava on Saturday and will meet with Dzurinda and
other officials.

Parents file complaint in Swissair crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The parents of a Swiss teen-ager killed in the
crash of Swissair Flight 111 have lodged a complaint of negligent
homicide in hopes of learning what caused the accident, their
lawyer said Friday.
	   The names of the 19-year-old victim and his parents were not
disclosed.
	   Lawyer Christian Luescher stressed that the parents, a French
man and his Swiss wife, were not seeking damages but were using the
Swiss legal procedure that requires authorities to investigate.
	   All 229 passengers and crew members were killed when the MD-11
airliner flying from New York to Geneva went down off the coast of
Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Sept. 2.
	   The complaint was the first to be filed in Switzerland. American
lawyer Mitch Baumeister has filed three lawsuits in the United
States, each demanding dlrs 125 million in damages.
	   Authorities in Geneva, where the victim lived, have begun an
inquiry and sent an investigative commission to Halifax to obtain
information on the crash. Investigating judge Christine Junod told
The Associated Press that the commission was seeking information
from Canadian authorities and from Swissair.

Woman who posed as mother of kidnapped baby arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A woman who posed for seven years
as the mother of a girl who had vanished from her California home
was arrested Friday on weapons charges, police said. The arrest
came after what may have been an attempted suicide.
	   The incident occurred at the home of Nilza Gierbolini hours
after she discovered the body of the man who shared the house with
her, police said.
	   Officers said Gierbolini, 36, had arrived at her home in
Carolina, a suburb of San Juan, and found the body of Rafael Salort
Bello, 41.
	   Salort's body was bleeding from the nose and mouth but showed no
other signs of a struggle. The house appeared to have been
ransacked, police said.
	   Officers said Gierbolini took a gun and fired one shot in an
attempt to kill herself but that an official at the scene thwarted
her. Gierbolini was detained and the gun was seized, police said.
	   Gierbolini was given a six-year suspended sentence in April for
falsifying a birth certificate of Crystal Leann Anzaldi, who
disappeared from her home in San Diego in 1990 when she was 15
months old.
	   Gierbolini denied knowing that the girl had been reported as
kidnapped. She said she was told by an acquaintance that the girl's
parents had died and that she decided to return to Puerto Rico and
raise the girl as her own.
	   A grand jury in California investigated the case, but no further
charges have been filed.
	   The girl is now in the custody of her father. Her parents
divorced after her disappearance.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The United States and Russia signed an agreement
Friday for 3.1 million tons of U.S. food aid _ including wheat,
corn, pork and beef _ to help see Russia through the long winter.
	   The package is a ``win-win situation'' for Russia and American
farmers, Christopher Goldthwait, head of the U.S. delegation and
general sales manager for the USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service,
told a news conference in Moscow.
	   The agreement provides for 1.5 million tons of American wheat to
be given to Russia, along with a dlrs 600 million loan for the
purchase of an additional 1.5 million tons of assorted other U.S.
foodstuffs.
	   The United States will also send 100,000 tons of food directly
to needy Russian regions.
	   Russia's economic crisis, along with shrinking food imports and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years, has raised concerns about
possible food shortages.
	   ``Our common cause has been fulfilled,'' Deputy Prime Minister
Gennady Kulik said after the talks ended Friday, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Russian officials said the talks had stalled for a time over
American worries about possible corruption, and demands for strict
guidelines on how the food is distributed. Those concerns
forestalled an agreement Thursday and pushed the negotations into a
final, long day.
	   Some of the U.S. guidelines were ``utterly unacceptable to
Russia,'' Vladimir Scherbak, the first deputy agriculture minister,
told Interfax.
	   Goldthwait said Russia had agreed to U.S. demands that the food
aid be exempt from taxes and import duties. ``There will be no
taxation at all.''
	   Kulik, who headed the Russian delegation, was quoted by Interfax
as saying the issue of taxation within Russia would be worked out
later.
	   The Americans also insisted that profits from food aid sold by
the Russian government go to the country's Pension Fund, which is
chronically short of cash. As a result, many retirees have to wait
months to receive their pension money.
	   Goldthwait and Kulik said the sides agreed that Russia would
spend the money on the Pension Fund and other social programs to be
determined later.
	   With the loan, Russia will purchase 500,000 tons of corn,
300,000 tons of soybean meal, 200,000 tons of soybeans, 200,000
tons of wheat, 100,000 tons of rice, 120,000 tons of beef, 50,000
tons of pork and 30,000 tons of nonfat dry milk, U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said in Washington on Friday.
	   The United States also will pay dlrs 260 million to transport
the food, Glickman said.
	   In another development, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
discussed possible humanitarian aid with a European Commission
delegation. The talks were described as preliminary and no details
were announced.
	   The State Statistics Committee reported Friday that grain
production had been tentatively measured at 51.5 million tons this
year, down 45 percent from 1997, Interfax said. Previously, the
government had said 55 million tons had been harvested this year.
	   Store shelves remain well-stocked, but food prices have risen
sharply in recent months and poor Russians may not be able to
afford what's available.
	   This is the first time in years that the Russians have had to
look abroad for significant food aid. The United States provided
food aid in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Colombia's troop pullout inaugurates a bold gamble for peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In a bold gamble for peace, Colombia's
president on Saturday will complete the evacuation of all
government troops from a southern guerrilla stronghold the size of
Switzerland.
	   The 90-day pullout _ meant to facilitate peace talks with the
rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia _ is the boldest
government concession yet in efforts to end a 34-year armed
conflict that has bound this nation rich in talent and resources
like a straightjacket.
	   President Andres Pastrana hopes to build confidence and spark
serious negotiations, but critics say he is being naive, giving
away too much too soon to a dangerous opponent that has yet to
prove itself ready for reconciliation.
	   Those fears grew this week when the rebels, known by their
Spanish initials as the FARC, seized a remote state capital for
three days in one of their largest attacks ever. About 1,400
guerrillas overran Mitu, in southeastern Vaupes state, leveling its
police barracks, killing at least 50 people and taking as many as
70 police officers captive.
	   The attack dampened expectations raised in July when Pastrana
met with Manuel Marulanda, the FARC's 68-year-old commander, at a
jungle hideout.
	   ``All (the rebels) are doing is giving reasons and more
arguments to those who oppose peace,'' Pastrana said Thursday while
touring Mitu, 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of the withdrawal
zone.
	   While some feel the guerrillas are just flexing their muscles _
hoping to strengthen their hand in the talks set to begin by
December _ others fear the rebels are gathering pawns in a
real-life chess game for power.
	   ``I don't see any reasons to be optimistic,'' said political
analyst Rafael Nieto. ``It's an insurgency that's self-reliant,
very wealthy, militarily effective ... and popular in the regions
it controls. What does a guerrilla group like the FARC gain from
negotiating?''
	   Many observers believe the FARC's goal is to use its military
might to one day force the partitioning of the country, splitting
off the south as an independent, rebel-run republic. Pastrana has
said the government would never agree to such a demand.
	   ``The state is giving away everything in return for nothing,''
said former Gen. Harold Bedoya, who was fired as armed forces
commander in 1997 after openly criticizing concessions to the FARC
by former President Ernesto Samper.
	   Bedoya says the guerrillas, who tax peasant coca production and
protect cocaine traffickers' airstrips and laboratories, will use
the pullout to deepen those ties while strengthening their hold on
Colombia's south.
	   Government officials say they're willing to discuss a 10-point
plan drafted by the FARC in 1996 to clean up Colombia's politics
and redistribute wealth.
	   But Marulanda's main request is to swap 452 guerrillas in
government jails for the estimated 300 soldiers and police now held
by the FARC. Critics say Pastrana, who hasn't given an answer,
would be replenishing the rebels with hardened fighters and
talented political cadres.
	   The government did not press for a cease-fire as a condition for
negotiations, and Marulanda told the federal ombudsman last week
that the FARC will continue military action ``with all intensity''
outside the pullout zone.
	   Inside the 16,200-square-mile (42,000-square-kilometer) swath of
foothills and savannahs the army is quitting, residents have
already taken precautions.
	   Fearing pillaging by rebels who will soon be outright masters of
territory they long dominated quietly, ranchers have trucked out
cattle, depositors are closing bank accounts and some homeowners
are looking to sell.
	   In San Vicente de Caguan, the most strategic of five
municipalities to be cleared of government forces, the last of some
2,000 anti-guerrilla troops were airlifted to a base 30 miles (50
kilometers) away on Friday.
	   White flags hung over doorways, and officials planted ``peace''
trees in the town square.
	   ``This might be the last chance we have to find reconciliation
between Colombians,'' said the mayor, Omar Garcia.

Pele backs Africa as World Cup hosts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pele expressed support Friday for holding the 2006
World Cup in Africa, but only if an African candidate can provide
the necessary facilities.
	   The 58-year-old Brazilian legend said he would like to see the
event staged in Africa for the first time if a suitable host was
available.
	   South Africa is considered the leading candidate in a race that
also includes England and Germany.
	   ``The World Cup should be in a country with enough potential to
host the competition,'' Pele told reporters in London. ``Africa is
the only continent which has never had a World Cup and it will be
invited to try to host it...they have a lot of potential.
	   ``It would be good to see it there but we have to see if they
have the right conditions. When we talk about Africa we talk with
the heart. We cannot talk about the heart in business. This is a
big business now. It's no longer just about the game and this needs
to be considered by FIFA.''
	   Pele said FIFA's rotation policy could favor South American or
African bids.
	   ``The only problem I see for England and Germany is that they've
had it already and it will have been held in Europe just eight
years before (France '98).
	   ``I think the procedure of the World Cup always was to give more
time before coming back to Europe, to go to South America, Central
America, Asia and now possibly Africa.''
	   FIFA president Sepp Blatter also expressed support for an
African bid after a meeting last week with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and England bid officials.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air
market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. Last Thursday, an assailant
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
	   In a rare direct appeal to the Israeli people, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat appeared on Israel TV during the main Friday
evening news program and condemned the bombing as ``criminal.''
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,'' said
a grim-faced Arafat Arafat, adding that he would ``exert 100
percent effort'' to track down those involved in the attack.
	   Arafat also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express
his sorrow. The Israeli leader told Arafat that for the peace
process to continue, the Palestinians would have to significantly
step up their war against terrorists, a statement by Netanyahu's
office said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered a
lackluster Marcelo Rios in the quarterfinal of the dlrs 2.55
million Paris Open on Friday, easily beating the world No. 2, 6-3,
6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, took exactly one hour to beat Rios,
who was roundly booed off the court by spectators who felt he
hadn't made an effort.
	   The match turned in the eighth game of the first set.
	   Kafelnikov broke serve while leading 4-3 with a smart backhand
drop volley, and held serve to take the set.
	   The Russian blasted Rios off the court in the second set with a
display of blistering serves and powerful returns.
	   Rios could have ended the week as world No. 1 by winning the
Paris Open, if Pete Sampras were to lose in the quarterfinals. But
the Chilean never looked comfortable against the powerful Russian.
	   ``The first set was unbelievable but he let himself down in the
second with some loose play,'' Kafelnikov said. ``From that point
on he gave me a lot of extra confidence and I never looked back.''
	   ``Once you give the idea that you are a bit down, or not
satisfied with something, that gives your opponent extra
confidence,'' the Russian said.
	   Kafelnikov's win also improves his chances of qualifying for the
ATP World Championship in Hanover this month.
	   Rios still hopes to end the year as number one.
	   ``Hanover will decide it,'' he said.
	   Showing no signs of the back injury that plagued him earlier in
the tournament, Pete Sampras advanced to the semifinals by beating
Australia's Mark Philippoussis, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Sampras demonstrated his familiar array of winners against the
U.S. Open finalist.
	   Leading 2-1 in the second set, Sampras played a stunning
backhand winner at full stretch past a stunned Philippoussis to
break service and set up the victory.
	   Unseeded Philippoussis beat No. 7 seed Karol Kucera and No. 10
seed Petr Korda on his way to reaching the quarterfinals, but
always looked a class below the world number one.
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Kafelnikov will play Britain's Greg
Rusedski, the player that beat him in the first round of last
month's Vienna Open event.
	   Rusedski, who retains a small chance of qualifying for Hanover,
had little trouble beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-2 in another
quarterfinal contest.

Death toll rises to four dead, two missing in Swiss explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The death toll rose Friday to four from
an explosion that destroyed a car dealership and an apartment
building in the Swiss capital of Bern, police said.
	   Officials said two people were still missing and the death toll
could rise. Eighteen people, including two children, were injured
in the explosion Thursday.
	   The cause has not been determined. City police say there is no
evidence the basement explosion was deliberate.
	   A corner of the structure, which had a car-repair garage on the
ground floor and apartments above, was blown away and the rest was
in danger of collapse _ complicating rescue efforts, police said.
	   Only two bodies had been removed from the building by this
afternoon. One was identified as a client of the garage.

Russia gets dlrs 800 million loan from Japan, reaches deal with
</HEADLINE>
creditors &QL;

reached, background; CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-starved government scored three
successes Friday: a dlrs 800 million loan offer from Japan, an
agreement on U.S. food aid and a deal with foreign creditors on
treasury bill debt that Russia froze in August.
	   While Russia still has a long way to go to cure its economic
malaise, Friday's deals were welcome news after nearly three months
of uncertainty. Russia succumbed to the global economic crisis in
August, devaluing the ruble and defaulting on domestic treasury
debts _ which then sent wages and markets crashing and prompted
President Boris Yeltsin to fire the government.
	   The Japanese money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout
package arranged by the International Monetary Fund over the summer
but put on hold after the August devaluation and default.
	   The IMF provided only dlrs 4.8 billion and now says it wants to
see a sound economic program before resuming aid.
	   Japan, however, promised Friday _ a week before Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi is to visit Moscow _ to extend dlrs 800
million of the loan to Russia.
	   Obuchi made the offer during a telephone conversation with his
Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian government and
Japanese Foreign Ministry said.
	   In Moscow on Friday, U.S. and Russian officials signed an
agreement on a dlrs 625 million aid package for 3.1 million tons of
U.S. food _ including wheat, rice, pork and beef _ to help see
Russia through the winter.
	   The first shipments are expected to reach Russia next month.
About half the food is provided free, and the rest is being sold to
Russia under a 20-year loan.
	   The IMF and other lenders have also demanded that the Russian
government reach an agreement with foreign holders of its domestic
treasury bills, known as GKOs. Russia froze what was then dlrs 40
billion in ruble-denominated debt in August, saying it would resume
payments Nov. 17.
	   In talks with Russian officials in London on Friday, several of
the largest foreign creditors agreed to accept ruble-denominated
paper in compensation for the treasury bills, Deputy Finance
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said.
	   ``We have an agreement in principle,'' said Kasyanov, speaking
from his London hotel room to Dow Jones Newswires. ``All the
restructuring will only be in rubles.'' Kasyanov wouldn't elaborate
on terms of the deal.
	   Foreign investors, who hold nearly a third of the treasuries
debt, rejected initial restructuring terms that would have left
them holding rubles worth only a few cents on the dollar.
	   Western bankers in Moscow confirmed a deal Friday. They said
creditors had decided to accept ruble-denominated paper because the
Russian government's dollar offer was nearly worthless.
	   The IMF has demanded that Primakov's government provide a
detailed plan for combating the crisis and expressed
dissatisfaction with a blueprint the Cabinet finally delivered last
week. It said the plan is short on specifics and heavy with state
intervention into the economy _ something the IMF has staunchly
opposed.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn will stop in Russia for a
one-day visit next Thursday to get an idea about the government's
intentions, the bank's Moscow office said Friday. Like the IMF, the
World Bank has suspended its loan program when the crisis hit.
	   If Russia doesn't receive any foreign aid, the government said
it would have to print new money to cover a huge deficit. First
Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said this week that Russia
would also be forced to negotiate restructuring of its foreign
debt.

All England Club wants to trademark `Wimbledon' name
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CQ Carrollanne 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The All England Club wants to register
the word ``Wimbledon'' as a trademark. And residents of the village
carrying the same name aren't happy about it.
	   London's Evening Standard newspaper reported Friday that the
club had applied to the U.K. Trade Marks Registry for the name to
cover not only tennis-related equipment and clothing, but also
household linens, garden furniture, household utensils, luggage,
cosmetics and perfumes.
	   ``We believe such a sweeping monopoly of a name infringes
freedom of speech,'' said Carrollanne Lindley, a trademark lawyer
spearheading a campaign against the move being led by the chamber
of commerce.
	   ``Wimbledon is a geographical area, not a trademark,'' she said.
``If the club succeeds, it could sue or threaten to sue dozens of
Wimbledon businesses who legitimately use the neighborhood name to
label and sell their goods.''
	   The newspaper quoted a club spokesman saying the aim was ``to
stop illegitimate traders using the word.''
	   Roger Casale, the member of Parliament representing the village,
sided with the residents.
	   ``I have written to the club to ask them what they think they
are doing,'' he said. ``Wimbledon is a strong community and the
name does not belong exclusively to anyone. The idea is
unacceptable.''

Spanish government approves aid package for victims of Hurricane
</HEADLINE>
Mitch &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with temporary suspension of deportations of illegal
immigrants &QL; 
 &UR; with BC-Mitch &QL; 
 &UR; MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government on Friday approved 1.89
billion pesetas (dlrs 13.4 million) in emergency aid for victims of
Hurricane Mitch in Central America, and temporarily suspended
deportations of illegal immigrants from the affected countries.

<TEXT>
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said the aid would be disbursed
immediately. He said it showed ``complete solidarity'' with the
countries that are linked to Spain by historical, linguistic and
cultural ties.
	   Spanish humanitarian organizations also reported donations
pouring in for victims of the hurricane, which killed thousands and
caused widespread damage Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala _ already among the world's poorest countries.
	   The Spanish branch of the Red Cross said it has received 2.1
billion pesetas (dlrs 15 million) in donations so far this week.
	   Another major aid group, Caritas, said it had collected 600
million (dlrs 4.3 million) pesetas over the first three days and
expected the rate of donations to increase. A third group,
Intermon, said it had so far taken in 302 million pesetas (2.1
million dollars).

More than 100 settlements flooded in western Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Devastating rains in western Ukraine have
flooded more than 100 towns and villages, and more heavy rains were
forecast in the area over the weekend, officials said Friday.
	   A total of 109 small towns villages and two cities were
inundated in the Zakarpattia region, while at least 11 settlements
in the Lviv region were hit, the Emergency Situations Ministry
said.
	   Floods and landslides have damaged roads, railways and
electricity lines in the region, and several villages in remote
areas have become unreachable by road, the ministry said.
	   Television reports from Zakarpattia said two people were killed
in one of the flooded villages by collapsing walls of a building
that could not sustain the water pressure. Officials at the
Emergency Situations Ministry were not available to confirm the
reports.
	   The water started to retreat from some parts of the flooded
regions on Friday and several water dams and railroads have been
restored, but the Ukrainian Metereological Center said more heavy
rains are expected in the west of the country in the next two days.
	   The floods covered the territory populated by about 300,000
people, of which more than 2,000 people from the most heavily
flooded settlements were evacuated as of Friday.
	   President Leonid Kuchma visited the flooded city of Mukachevo in
Zakarpattia on Friday and promised assistance to the people made
homeless by the disaster.
	   He met with regional authorities to discuss raising funds to
compensate people for the losses.
	   More than 2,500 people supervised by Emergency Situations
Minister Valeriy Kalchenko were working in the flooded area to
repair the damages. They were joined by local army troops, who
brought machines and equipment to help evacuate people and organize
food supplies for them.
	   State emergency officials have been told to calculate losses
incurred by the floods so that the Cabinet can allocate money from
its reserve fund. The government has already allocated 1.2 million
hryvna (dlrs 350,000) for repair works.

AS Roma coach Zeman sues Vialli for libel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ AS Roma's coach Zdenek Zeman is suing star forward
Gianluca Vialli for libel after the player likened him to a
``terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world,'' news reports
said Friday.
	   The remarks by Vialli, now a player-coach with Chelsea in
England's Premier League, came after Zeman expressed his amazement
at the quick muscular growth of Vialli and Juventus star Alessandro
Del Piero.
	   Zeman, who said he was speaking for the good of soccer, never
mentioned drug substances directly in the interview published in
August. He referred to medicines.
	   ``I know that many doctors-pharmacologists have moved from
cycling to soccer,'' Zeman told Italian weekly magazine
``L'Espresso'' in an interview which sparked a doping scandal still
shaking Italy's soccer world.
	   ``One must avoid that the league turns out like the Tour de
France,'' said Zeman, who also sued for libel three Italian
journalists who reported Vialli's comments.
	   Both Vialli and Del Piero, the only two players singled out in
the interview, had previously taken legal action against Zeman.
	   Several anti-doping investigations grew out of the coach's
remarks. Most of them are still underway.
	   The fallout of the scandal also included the resignation of
Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) president Mario Pescante and the
firing of the chief of CONI's drug-testing laboratory.

FIFA boss gets first halt to sales of critical book, spokesman say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ FIFA President Sepp Blatter has won
an initial court ruling to block the sale in Switzerland of a book
that lays corruption accusations against him and the former chief
of world soccer, a spokesman said Friday.
	   At the center of the controversy is a book by English writer
David A. Yallop which been published by Econ Verlag in Dusseldorf,
Germany, under the title ``Wie das Spiel verlorenging'' (How the
game was lost). It has yet to appear in English, but is to be
titled ``How they stole the game,'' said FIFA spokesman Andreas
Herren.
	   Blatter won an initial round Oct. 26 in district court in the
Zurich suburb of Meilen, where he lives, said Herren. That blocked
the Swiss importer from further distribution of the book.
	   Herren said Blatter's lawyer intends to pursue a ban on the book
outside Switzerland with further legal steps.
	   In his suit Blatter cited 16 passages in the book that amount to
``character defamation,'' said Herren.
	   ``He's no longer prepared to have his reputation and that of
FIFA tarnished by false allegations,'' Herren said.
	   The book in general accuses Blatter of bribery and corruption,
he added. It claims he engaged in vote buying to win the election
as FIFA president last June.
	   Herren said he had no idea whether Blatter's predecessor, Joao
Havelange of Brazil, planned any legal moves against the book,
which focuses more on his rule over world soccer starting in 1974.
	   As secretary general, Blatter ran FIFA's day-to-day business
under Havelange for 17 years.
	   Yallop's 1984 book ''In God's Name'' alleged Pope John Paul I
was poisoned 33 days into his papacy in 1978 because he wanted to
crack down on corruption in the Vatican.
	   In 1993 he published a book about the then-fugitive Carlos,
subsequently imprisoned in France on terrorism charges.

In appeal to Israeli public, Arafat condemns attack harshly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, The West Bank (AP) _ In a rare direct appeal to the
Israeli public, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Friday
condemned a car bomb attack in a Jerusalem market and promised to
track down those responsible.
	   The blast in the Mahane Yehuda market killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   A somber-looking and straight-talking Arafat broke away from an
ongoing Cabinet meeting to speak to Israel Television.
	   ``First of all, it must be clear that we condemn this act - this
terrorist, criminal act whose intention was to hurt the peace
process,'' Arafat said. ``We must work together, (both) Israelis
and Palestinians to confront these terrorist acts that aim to
destroy the peace process.''
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago.
	   Arafat's condemnation was his strongest yet of such an attack,
and his appearance on Israel Television's popular Friday evening
newscast gave a sense of urgency to the feeling that the peace
process is in grave danger.
	   In an attempt to convince wary Israelis and their leaders that
the Palestinian Authority was doing its best to clamp down on
militants, Arafat said he was making an all-out effort to rein them
in. ``My security officers and I are exerting 100 percent effort
and I hope that we will reach 100 percent results,'' he said.
	   Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone
Friday evening. Netanyahu told Arafat he needed to intensify his
efforts to combat terrorism.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Arab states should strengthen their
financial institutions and monitoring of banks in order to avoid an
Asian-style crash, bankers said here Friday.
	   A two-day banking conference wound up by calling on Arab states
to learn from the Asian crisis and develop their financial markets
and institutions and improve their surveillance of banks.
	   The conference also recommended that Arab countries ``adopt a
cautious approach in opening up to the outside world,'' Lebanon's
official National News Agency reported.
	   ``The causes of the severe economic and financial crises which
have swept southeast Asian states, some Latin American states and
Russia recently, ranged from an imprudent openness to a weak
monitoring of banks,'' the conference said in its recommendations.

Irish minister wants for jail terms for sports drugs cheats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish Sports Minister John McDaid is
investigating the possibility of proposing laws to jail athletes
found guilty of using performance enhancing drugs.
	   McDaid, speaking Friday at a seminar in Blackrock, Dublin, said
he had already discussed the idea with Ireland's attorney general.
	   ``If I can find the means within Irish law, I will not hesitate
to apply criminal sanctions including jail terms to those who
contaminate sport with drugs,'' he said.
	   ``Drugs in sport is a political priority in Ireland and given
the opportunity, we will not hesitate to lead the way.
	   ``My political determination includes the willingness to take
unilateral action ahead of any future international consensus that
may occur.''
	   Drugs in sports became a major issue in Ireland in 1996 in the
aftermath of drug allegations against Ireland's triple Olympic gold
medal winning swimmer, Michelle Smith.
	   In August, FINA, swimming's world governing body, found Smith
guilty of tampering with a urine sample and she was subsequently
banned for four years.
	   She is currently appealing the ban.
	   The Irish Rugby Union was also embroiled in the drugs
controversy last month when three players tested positive in doping
tests.
	   McDaid said the laws should provide real punishments for people
who use or deal in prohibited substances.
	   He said drugs in sport was driven by greed and money.
	   ``These people to whom I am referring include not only athletes.
It would have been impossible for the drug culture to take root if
there were not collusion involving trainers, business mangers,
medical teams and, yes, those who administer sport,'' he said.
	   ``There is an increasingly widespread perception and concern
that the drug culture in sport may be abetted even at very high
levels in international sport.
	   ``In a world where events have become ever more elaborate and
expensive and the benefits for some of those involved become ever
more lavish, the integrity of sport has become secondary.''

Bacher, Lloyd travel to London for talks with Lara, Hooper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to seven players in 12th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of South African cricket said Friday that
a letter from President Nelson Mandela could help resolve a pay
dispute that is threatening to wipe out the West Indies' historic
tour of the republic.
	   Ali Bacher, managing director of the South Africa cricket board,
traveled to London Friday accompanied by Clive Lloyd, manager of
the the West Indies touring squad, and West Indies Cricket Board
member Joel Garner.
	   The three met informally Friday with disgruntled West Indies
players, who are locked in a pay dispute with the WICB. Formal
talks with Courtney Walsh, president of the West Indies Players
Association, were reported set for later Friday.
	   The WICB on Wednesday fired captain Brian Lara and vice-captain
Carl Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa. They want
better pay for players.
	   Bacher carried a letter from Mandela urging a resolution of the
impasse. Mandela stressed his hope that the West Indies can go
ahead with its first official tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid.
	   ``I'm sure the letter from the president will have a great
impression on the West Indies players,'' Bacher said. ``They know
him to be a man of great integrity and one of the great statesmen
of the century.''
	   ``One is confident of a result to the impasse,'' he added. ``I'm
sure the people in Caribbean and South Africa and world cricket in
general will see it as important that the tour goes ahead.''
	   The first match of the three-month tour is scheduled to begin
next Tuesday. The first Test is scheduled for Nov. 26.
	   The tour is considered crucial in promoting the game among South
African blacks in a country where whites run the sport.
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher said.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The WICB said it would fine the no-show players between 5 and 10
percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs 60,000
for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide player support. Only seven of the 16
members of the squad traveled to South Africa, and all seven have
since flown to London to rally around Lara.
	   On Friday, Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll joined calls for
the WICB to be fired. ``The members of the board should be fired,''
he declared. ``This is not simply a matter of cricket and the board
cannot be allowed to treat the players in such a manner.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, rated the world's best batsman, hinted Thursday the tour
might go on if a compromise can be reached.
	   ``What has resulted so far is a bit unfortunate and I hope it
can be resolved in the near future,'' he said. ``The main thing is
that the West Indies tour to South Africa should be on. The people
want the tour to be on and hopefully something positive will come
out of it (in the meeting).
	   ``I am not a member of the West Indies cricket team at the
moment, but I would love to be there. My life is playing cricket.
When it is possible you could be there and you are not there
because of circumstances _ as in this case _ it is very
unfortunate.''
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

	   A somber-looking and straight-talking Arafat broke away from a
Cabinet meeting to speak to Israel Television.
	   ``First of all, it must be clear that we condemn this act _ this
terrorist, criminal act whose intention was to hurt the peace
process,'' Arafat said. ``We must work together, (both) Israelis
and Palestinians to confront these terrorist acts that aim to
destroy the peace process.''
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago.
	   Arafat's condemnation was his strongest yet of such an attack,
and his appearance on Israel Television's popular Friday evening
newscast showed how precarious the peace process was.
	   In an attempt to convince wary Israelis and their leaders that
the Palestinian Authority was doing its best to clamp down on
militants, Arafat said he was making an all-out effort to rein them
in. ``My security officers and I are exerting 100 percent effort
and I hope that we will reach 100 percent results,'' he said.
	   Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone
Friday evening. Netanyahu told Arafat he needed to intensify his
efforts to combat terrorism.

	   ROME (AP) _ A former Communist, nicknamed ``the American'' for
his admiration of the Kennedy clan of politicians, was chosen on
Friday to lead Italy's largest leftist party.
	   Walter Veltroni, 43, was elected secretary, the top post, of the
Democrats of the Left, a party formed earlier this decade out of
the West's largest Communist party after the end of the Cold War.
	   Veltroni replaces Massimo D'Alema, who was sworn in last month
as Italian premier, the first former Communist to hold the top
government post in Rome.
	   Veltroni, a passionate booster of sports and cinema, served as
culture minister in the previous government of Romano Prodi. In the
past he was editor of L'Unita when it was the daily of the Italian
Communist Party.
	   D'Alema had served as party secretary since 1994 but gave up the
post to devote himself more fully to the premiership.

Death toll rises as Albanian rebels try to assert authority

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the worst violence in Kosovo
since a peace accord last month, five suspected ethnic Albanian
guerrillas died Friday in a shootout with Serb police, according to
a Serb media statement.
	   Details provided by the Serb Media Center, a mouthpiece for Serb
authorities, could not be immediately confirmed. But previous
statements about similar violence have accurately reported the
number of casualties.
	   The deaths raised the number of Albanians killed since Thursday
afternoon to seven and documented an upsurge in violence as the
United States and European nations try to push ahead with the Oct.
12 political agreement reached with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. Foreign observers in Kosovo say attacks by both Serb
forces and Albanian guerrillas have increased this week.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile, says Serb police
continue attacking Albanian villages to prevent refugees from
returning to their homes.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with KLA officials Friday in
Dragobilje, a village 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Albanian sources said he gave the rebels a draft
political agreement that will restore self-rule for the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo. Hill's office would only say that he
met with the rebels to discuss the peace process.
	   The rebels have rejected any political agreement that stops
short of full independence for Kosovo.
	   KLA representative Jakup Krasniqi confirmed the meeting and said
his side would comment on the document once it has had a chance to
review it.
	   Showing its dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process, the
KLA said Friday it intends to establish its own civilian rule in
territory it controls.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the guerrilla group said
its military command would form local government institutions,
disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanian political
leaders.
	   Such a move _ while difficult to achieve _ would widen a rift
among Albanians, most of whom support moderate leader Ibrahim
Rugova, and the minority that reject Rugova's nonviolent strategy
for the KLA.
	   Rugova has been elected Kosovo president in elections Serb
authorities consider invalid, and an Albanian assembly also exists,
though it is rarely convened and also is not recognized by Serbian
authorities.
	   At his weekly news conference Friday, Rugova said he hoped a
2,000-strong international monitoring mission led by the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe will provide
security for returning refugees. The mission is expected to be
launched later this month.
	   Milosevic stripped the majority Albanians of self-rule in 1989
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
That started a period of protests and increased violence that led
to his crackdown on Albanian separatists in February.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes against Serb and Yugoslav forces in Kosovo last month to
force Milosevic to agree to end his offensive, reduce forces to
pre-crackdown levels and allow refugees to return home.
	   The agreement also calls for reaching a political settlement,
and the proposal Hill gave the rebels on Friday was worked out with
moderate Albanian leaders who lack the support of the KLA.
	   Despite agreeing to troop pullback after being threatened by
NATO airstrikes, Milosevic is showing new defiance. The Serbian
government, which he controls, has rejected attempts by the U.N.
War crimes tribunal to investigate charges of war crimes and
atrocities against civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, but she was refused a visa allowing her
into Kosovo.
	   A U.S. State Department expert on war crimes said Friday the
move would hurt Milosevic.
	   David Scheffer told reporters in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
that blocking the war crimes tribunal from doing its work means
economic and other sanctions on Yugoslavia would remain locked in
place.
	   He also said the permitting the investigators into Kosovo was
part of the package agreed to by Milosevic to avert airstrikes,
saying NATO ``still has the authority'' to attack if the agreement
is not fully honored.
	   Reporting on Friday's attack, the Serb Media Center said a
police patrol in southern Kosovo came under fire from guerrillas
and police fired back, killing five of the attackers. No policemen
were injured, the statement said.
	   Two other Albanians were killed Thursday, according to Albanians
interviewed in central Kosovo. Police reported one Albanian
guerrilla died in a shootout near Klina.

South African official asks animal welfare groups to support
</HEADLINE>
relocation of elephant families &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Mindful of an international
outcry over alleged mistreatment of 30 baby elephants, South
Africa's Environmental Affairs Minister Pallo Jordan on Friday
proposed a program to save elephant families.
	   But he said such a program would require the support of
international wildlife welfare organizations and activists.
	   ``South Africa would be happy to cooperate with concerned
individuals, organizations and bodies who would be willing to
assist in such a project,'' Jordan said.
	   Jordan said elephant family units could be moved to areas in
Africa where herds have been depleted, and where they would be
protected. But he said such a project was too expensive for
cash-strapped African governments to pay for by themselves.
	   Southern African countries are confronted with a dilemma over
rising elephant populations that are protected under international
convention as an endangered species.
	   For the past two weeks, a judge in the small town of Brits near
Pretoria has been listening to a custody suit over 30 elephants,
which were captured in the drought-ridden Tuli area of Botswana in
August.
	   Their owner, Riccardo Ghiazza, plans to export the elephants to
zoos in Basel, Switzerland; to German zoos in Erfurt and Dresden;
and to a safari park in China.
	   The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
has filed animal cruelty charges against Ghiazza. The suit alleges
that he has chained and hobbled the elephants, allowed his
Indonesian trainers to puncture their hide with sharp hooks and
deprived them of water and food.
	   A ruling is expected next week in the case that has sparked
international outrage and calls for a tourism boycott by the animal
rights organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
	   Jordan said South Africans were distressed by the allegations of
cruelty to the elephants.
	   Ghiazza summoned reporters on Wednesday to show the animals were
in good condition, but acknowledged that mistakes had been made in
training them.
	   He defended his training program as a unique approach that will
save elephants from culling _ a practice that killed over 14,000
elephants in South Africa from 1967 to 1995.
	   An American animal welfare group, Performing Animal Welfare
Society of Galt, California, on Thursday said that a similar
training method had been tried in the 1980s in Florida with 70 baby
African elephants.
	   PAWS, as the group is known, traced their fate and found many
had either killed their trainers or died from neglect.
	   ``Even if you don't care about the elephant's welfare, the
public danger factor is incredible,'' said Pat Derby, director of
PAWS, in a telephone interview. ``They are creating killers.''
	   PAWS has submitted testimony backing the NSPCA in the custody
case.
	   South Africa's Minister for Agriculture Derek Hanekom, who is
responsible for wildlife welfare, backs Ghiazza's pilot project to
see if the ``training of elephants could be an alternative to
culling or death by starvation.''
	   The World Wide Fund for Nature South Africa also backs Ghiazza's
training program.

Moroccans celebrate 23rd anniversary of Green March
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABDELHAKIM YAMANI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAAYOUNE, Western Sahara (AP) _ With flags flying, Moroccans
celebrated the 23rd anniversary Friday of the ``Green March'' into
the desert hoping to win territory once ruled by Spain that is also
claimed by rebels.
	   Red flags with the five-pointed green star that is the Moroccan
national flag flew throughout the town of Laayoune in Western
Sahara, which is awaiting the visit of U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan on Sunday.
	   On Nov. 6, 1975, some 350,000 Moroccans poured into this
desolate stretch of desert along Africa's Atlantic coast to claim
land that was left when the Spanish colonizers departed.
	   But Morocco's claim to the territory, sandwiched between
Morocco, Mauritania and Algeria is bitterly contested by Western
Saharan rebels, known as the Polisario Front.
	   Backed mainly by Algeria, the Polisario Front has been fighting
for independence since the Spanish left, but neither Morocco nor
the rebels have been able to gain the upper hand in the conflict.
	   Morocco considers Western Sahara part of its territory.
	   A cease-fire was negotiated in 1991 under the auspices of the
United Nations.
	   Annan's visit aims to reach an agreement that will allow a
referendum on the future of the territory to take place in 1999.
	   A U.N. force has been trying to identify voters because of
disagreements about who is eligible to cast ballots. Each side has
accused the other of trying to pad voter rolls.

Russia gets loan from Japan, food aid, deal with creditors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES in new grafs 7-8 with background on food aid
deal. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-starved government scored three
successes Friday: a dlrs 800 million loan offer from Japan, an
agreement on U.S. food aid and a deal with foreign creditors on
treasury bill debt that Russia froze in August.
	   While Russia still has a long way to go to cure its economic
malaise, Friday's deals were welcome news after nearly three months
of uncertainty. Russia succumbed to the global economic crisis in
August, devaluing the ruble and defaulting on domestic treasury
debts _ which then sent wages and markets crashing and prompted
President Boris Yeltsin to fire the government.
	   The Japanese money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout
package arranged by the International Monetary Fund over the summer
but put on hold after the August devaluation and default.
	   The IMF provided only dlrs 4.8 billion and now says it wants to
see a sound economic program before resuming aid.
	   Japan, however, promised Friday _ a week before Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi is to visit Moscow _ to extend dlrs 800
million of the loan to Russia.
	   Obuchi made the offer during a telephone conversation with his
Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian government and
Japanese Foreign Ministry said.
	   The economic crisis, along with the worst grain harvest in 40
years, has raised concerns about possible food shortages and
prompted Russia to turn the United States and European Union for
food aid for the first time in years. While store shelves remain
fairly well-stocked, food prices have risen sharply and poor
Russians cannot always afford what's available.
	   In Moscow on Friday, U.S. and Russian officials signed an
agreement on a dlrs 625 million aid package for 3.1 million tons of
U.S. food _ including wheat, rice, pork and beef _ to help see
Russia through the winter.
	   The first shipments are expected to reach Russia next month.
About half the food is provided free, and the rest is being sold to
Russia under a 20-year loan.
	   The IMF and other lenders have also demanded that the Russian
government reach an agreement with foreign holders of its domestic
treasury bills, known as GKOs. Russia froze what was then dlrs 40
billion in ruble-denominated debt in August, saying it would resume
payments Nov. 17.
	   In talks with Russian officials in London on Friday, several of
the largest foreign creditors agreed to accept ruble-denominated
paper in compensation for the treasury bills, Deputy Finance
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said.
	   ``We have an agreement in principle,'' said Kasyanov, speaking
from his London hotel room to Dow Jones Newswires. ``All the
restructuring will only be in rubles.'' Kasyanov wouldn't elaborate
on terms of the deal.
	   Foreign investors, who hold nearly a third of the treasuries
debt, rejected initial restructuring terms that would have left
them holding rubles worth only a few cents on the dollar.
	   Western bankers in Moscow confirmed a deal Friday. They said
creditors had decided to accept ruble-denominated paper because the
Russian government's dollar offer was nearly worthless.
	   The IMF has demanded that Primakov's government provide a
detailed plan for combating the crisis and expressed
dissatisfaction with a blueprint the Cabinet finally delivered last
week. It said the plan is short on specifics and heavy with state
intervention into the economy _ something the IMF has staunchly
opposed.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn will stop in Russia for a
one-day visit next Thursday to review the government's plans, the
bank's Moscow office said Friday. Like the IMF, the World Bank has
suspended its loan program when the crisis hit.
	   If Russia doesn't receive any foreign aid, the government said
it would have to print new money to cover a huge deficit.

Italian media group unplans to give up television channel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS that Telepiu is partly owned Berlusconi empire &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Mediaset SpA, Italy's television and
advertising company, said Friday that it didn't plan to give up a
television channel as part of its plan to create a European
television venture with Germany's Kirch Media Group.
	   ``We're working on the creation of a European network, but we're
not considering the sale or conferring of a television channel (to
a joint venture),'' said a spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, for Mediaset, the media arm of Fininvest, former Premier
Silvio Berlusconi's sprawling empire.
	   A report in Milan's financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore Friday
suggested that Mediaset could turn over one of its three channels
-- likely Rete 4 -- into a joint media venture with Kirch.
	   The report also said Kirch would give over its channel SAT1
while both Kirch and Mediaset would each turn over their 25 percent
stake in Spanish television station Telecinco to the new company.
	   Mediaset and Kirch have been in negotiations for a number of
months, but talks had previously stalled on a variety of issues.
	   While the newspaper report said that a letter of intent could be
signed soon, Mediaset said that details about the possible timing
of an accord, as well as other factors, weren't available.
	   In other media developments, RAI, Italy's state television,
approved a plan to seek a 10 percent stake in Telepiu as it seeks
to form a partnership in digistal television, newspapers reported.
The stake might grow to 35 percent through partners which may
include Olivetti, Wind and Banca Commerciale Italiana, the reports
said.
	   Italian dailies said the RAI board gave the green light on
Thursday to the plan, which would mean RAI cohabiting with an
offshoot of its rival television broadcaster. Telepiu is partially
owned by Berlusconi's media empire.
	   There was no comment immediately available from RAI.
	   RAI was in heated negotiations wich Telecom Italia SpA until
recent management turmoil there drove RAI to consider other
alliances, namely the interest of France's Canal Plus AG, which
owns 90 percent of its Italian digital provider, Telepiu.
	   Telecom Italia chairman Gian Mario Rossignolo had been
spearheading negotiations with RAI, Rupert Murdoch's British Sky
Broadcasting Plc, and France's TF1, but was forced to resign last
month because of Telecom's management upheaval.

Death toll rises as Albanian rebels try to assert authority

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the worst violence in Kosovo
since a peace accord last month, five suspected ethnic Albanian
guerrillas died Friday in a shootout with Serb police, according to
a Serb media statement.
	   Details provided by the Serb Media Center, a mouthpiece for Serb
authorities, could not be immediately confirmed. But previous
statements about similar violence have accurately reported the
number of casualties.
	   The deaths raised the number of ethnic Albanians killed since
Thursday afternoon to seven and documented an upsurge in violence
as the United States and European nations try to push ahead with
the Oct. 12 agreement with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
Foreign observers in Kosovo say attacks by both Serb forces and
ethnic Albanian guerrillas have increased this week.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, meanwhile, says Serb police
continue attacking ethnic Albanian villages to prevent refugees
from returning to their homes.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with KLA officials Friday in
Dragobilje, a village 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Ethnic Albanian sources said he gave the rebels a draft
agreement that would restore self-rule for the ethnic Albanian
majority in Kosovo. Hill's office would only say that he met with
the rebels to discuss the peace process.
	   The rebels have rejected any political agreement that stops
short of full independence for Kosovo.
	   KLA representative Jakup Krasniqi confirmed the meeting and said
his side would comment on the document once it has reviewed it.
	   Showing its dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process, the
KLA said Friday it intends to establish its own civilian rule in
territory it controls.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the guerrilla group said
its military command would form local government institutions,
disregarding both Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanian political
leaders.
	   Such a move _ while difficult to achieve _ would widen a rift
among Kosovo Albanians, most of whom support moderate leader
Ibrahim Rugova, and the minority that reject Rugova's nonviolent
strategy for the KLA.
	   Rugova has been elected Kosovo president in elections Serb
authorities consider invalid, and an ethnic Albanian assembly also
exists, though it is rarely convened and also is not recognized by
Serbian authorities.
	   At his weekly news conference Friday, Rugova said he hoped a
2,000-strong international monitoring mission led by the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe would provide
security for returning refugees. The mission is expected to be
launched later this month.
	   Milosevic stripped the majority ethnic Albanians of self-rule in
1989 in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic. That started a period of protests and increased violence
that led to his crackdown on Albanian separatists in February.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes against Serb and Yugoslav forces in Kosovo last month to
force Milosevic to agree to end his offensive, reduce forces to
pre-crackdown levels and let refugees return home.
	   The agreement also calls for reaching a political settlement,
and the proposal Hill gave the rebels on Friday was worked out with
moderate Albanian leaders who lack the support of the KLA.
	   Despite agreeing to troop pullback after being threatened by
NATO airstrikes, Milosevic is showing new defiance. The Serbian
government, which he controls, has rejected attempts by the U.N.
War crimes tribunal to investigate charges of war crimes and
atrocities against civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, but were refused visas to investigate.	   A U.S. State Department expert on war crimes said Friday the
move would hurt Milosevic.
	   David Scheffer told reporters in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
that blocking the war crimes tribunal from doing its work means
economic and other sanctions on Yugoslavia would remain locked in
place.
	   He also said Milosevic agreed to permit the investigators in
Kosovo as part of the package to avert airstrikes, saying NATO
``still has the authority'' to attack if the agreement is not fully
honored.
	   Reporting on Friday's attack, the Serb Media Center said a
police patrol in southern Kosovo came under fire from guerrillas
and police fired back, killing five of the attackers. No policemen
were injured, the statement said.
	   Two other ethnic Albanians were killed Thursday, according to
ethnic Albanians interviewed in central Kosovo. Police reported one
guerrilla died in a shootout near Klina.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Magnus Larsson, a potential entry for
defending champion Sweden in the Davis Cup finals against Italy
next month, underwent successful surgery in his right wrist Friday
and will be sidelined at least three months.
	   Larsson, 28, a former top 10 player, will also miss next week's
Stockholm Open, one of the oldest indoor tournaments in the world,
and the Australian Open in January.
	   ``Three months is a long time, but I think Magnus will be hungry
to play competively again in February,'' said his coach Carl-Axel
Hageskog, who also is Sweden's Davis Cup coach.
	   Larsson, ranked 37th in the world, was injured in the
quarterfinals against Germany at Halle, Germany, in July.
	   A quarterfinalist in the U.S. Open this year, Larsson has been
plagued by injuries throughout his career. In 1995, after breaking
into the top 10 for the first time, he broke his right foot and
didn't return until late October.
	   Sweden shut out the United States 5-0 in last year's final in
Goteborg, Sweden. This year's final against Italy will be played in
Milan Dec. 4-6.

Japan confirms participation in South American championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Japan will become the first nation
outside the Americas to play in the Copa America, the South
American confederation announced Friday.
	   The Japanese confirmed their participation Friday for the
biennial South American championship, set for June 29-July 18, in
Paraguay.
	   ``Official communication from the Japanese federation has
arrived, accepting the invitation from our president, Nicolas
Leoz,'' CONMEBOL spokemsan Nestor Benitez said.
	   ``The confirmation was delayed because the Japanese officials
needed time to rearrange their schedule for 1999,'' he said.
	   Benitez said the draw for the 12-team tournament, which also
will include CONCACAF champion Mexico, will be staged Dec. 15 in
Asuncion.
	   Argentina already has been slated to play its first-round games
in the city of Luque, while Brazil will play its first-round
matches in Ciudad del Este, 390 kilometers (240 miles) from
Asuncion.
	   Japan becomes the first non-American team to play in the Copa
America. Mexico and the United States were the first teams from
outside South America to participate in 1993 when they were invited
in an arrangement between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL.
	   Mexico and the United States also played in 1995, and Mexico
also played in 1997. With the United States having launched Major
League Soccer with an April-October schedule in 1996, it declined
in 1997 and was replaced by Costa Rica.
	   The United States again has declined for the upcoming
championship, opening a place for Japan.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government on Friday approved
1.89 billion pesetas (dlrs 13.4 million) in emergency aid for
Central America's victims of Hurricane Mitch
	   The government also temporarily suspended deportations of
illegal immigrants from the four countries affected by the
hurricane, the state-owned news agency EFE reported.
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said the aid would be disbursed
immediately and showed Spain's ``complete solidarity'' with
countries that have a ``special connection'' based on linguistic
and cultural ties.
	   Spanish humanitarian organizations said donations were pouring
in for victims of the hurricane, which killed thousands and caused
widespread damage in what were already some of the world's poorest
countries.
	   The Spanish branch of the Red Cross said it has received 2.1
billion pesetas (dlrs 15 million) this week. The Roman Catholic aid
group, Caritas, said it had collected 600 million (dlrs 4.3
million) pesetas over three days. A third aid group, Intermon, said
it had so far taken in 302 million pesetas (2.1 million dollars).

U.N. torture expert invited to visit Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A top U.N. expert on torture has been invited for
a ten-day fact finding visit to Turkey, which has long been accused
of abusing prisoners and Kurdish sympathizers.
	   Special investigator Nigel Rodley plans to meet Turkish
government officials, non-governmental organizations and private
individuals during his trip there Nov. 9-19, a U.N. statement said
Friday.
	   He also hopes to visit prisons and other detention centers in
Ankara, Istanbul and the southeastern province of Diyarbakir _ one
of the bases of Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy from Turkey.
	   Rodley, a British law professor, will present his findings to
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights at its annual session next
March.
	   Human rights organizations like Amnesty International maintain
that torture is rife in Turkish prisons, which house some 9,000
prisoners linked to leftist or Kurdish groups. The government is
also frequently criticized for its violent suppression of the
Kurdish separatist movement.
	   Rodley has previously made visits to Russia, Rwanda, Colombia,
Chile, Pakistan and Mexico.

U.S. agrees to WTO report on shrimp import ban and turtle deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States on Friday formally accepted a
ruling by the World Trade Organization that its restrictions on
imported shrimp violate free trade _ but left open whether and how
it would change its laws.
	   U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said the U.S. administration
was consulting with Congress and other interested parties on what
to do and would advise the WTO within the required 30 days.
	   At issue is a U.S. embargo on shrimp imports from India,
Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand, which use trawling nets that trap
endangered sea turtles. Environmentalists say failure to equip
shrimp nets with turtle-excluder devices costing dlrs 75 causes the
death of 150,000 turtles a year worldwide.
	   A WTO appeals body last month upheld the findings of an expert
panel report that the U.S. rules amounted to ``arbitrary and
unjustifiable discrimination.''
	   Under WTO procedures, the report of its appellate body is final.
	   Although it faulted the United States for the way its rules were
carried out, the WTO appeals body said it recognized the right of
members to adopt conservation laws.
	   And, in a first, it accepted evidence from environmental groups
rather than just the governments directly concerned.
	   The WTO has frequently come under fire from environmental groups
for putting free trade before conservation. A fringe group of
environmentalists last week hit WTO director-general Renato
Ruggiero with cream pies, accusing him of being a turtle killer.
	   The U.S. view that the appellate body at least partly vindicated
its policy on shrimp imports may cause problems ahead if it doesn't
change its laws to the satisfaction of India, Malaysia, Pakistan
and Thailand.
	   Thailand's representative, Krit Garnjana-Goonchorn, said the
appeal body's view might set an unwelcome precedent.
	   ``The decision may already have opened a floodgate foreshadowing
greater abusive use of trade-related environmental measures in the
future,'' he said.
	   The Thai statement said the appeals body should not have
accepted submissions from environmental groups as they were not a
direct party in the dispute.
	   Pakistan, India and Malaysia made similar comments.

Russia snaps Swedes' unbeaten streak with 4-1 win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Alexander Barkov had one goal and one
assist as Russia snapped Sweden's 21-game unbeaten streak in
international hockey with a 4-1 victory in the Karjala Cup
tournament Friday.
	   The Swedes' streak started when they won the World Championships
in Switzerland in May. They tied the Czech Republic 2-2 in the
Karjala Cup opener Thursday.
	   Alexander Prokopiev, Vladimir Samylin and Pavel Agarkov scored
the other goals for Russia. Anders Huusko scored for Sweden, tying
the score 1-1 in the first period.
	   The Russians prevailed despite being outshot 32-15, including
17-1 in the final period.
	   The tournament is the second in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden
won the first tournament in the Czech Republic two months ago and
leads the overall standings with five points, one ahead of Finland.
	   Finland, which edged Russia 3-2 in Thursday's opener, face the
Czech Republic on Saturday.

Somalis mourn slain aid worker

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somali (AP) _ Hundreds of mourners on Friday
remembered a senior Somali aid worker who was killed by gunmen
while trying to rebuild roads destroyed by floods.
	   Hassan Mohamed Ga'al, an engineer in charge of a U.N.
Development Office in Somalia, was fatally shot Thursday in
Aliyaleh village, 15 kilometers (10 miles) north of Mogadishu.
	   Six of his colleagues were killed in the same attack, which
witnesses said was carried out by eight men armed with assault
rifles and hand grenades.
	   The reason for the attack and the identity of the gunmen
remained unknown, but some sources said there was a contract
dispute between Ga'al and the gunmen.
	   Witnesses also said the gunmen were seen stealing two sacks of
Somali shillings from Ga'al's vehicle.
	   Ga'al was oveseeing a project to repair roads in middle Shabelle
region, which were destroyed by floods last year.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since 1991 when the
country's longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted by clan
factions.

Japan confirms participation in South American championship

 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT category coding. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Japan will become the first nation
outside the Americas to play in the Copa America, the South
American confederation announced Friday.
	   The Japanese confirmed their participation Friday for the
biennial South American championship, set for June 29-July 18, in
Paraguay.
	   ``Official communication from the Japanese federation has
arrived, accepting the invitation from our president, Nicolas
Leoz,'' CONMEBOL spokemsan Nestor Benitez said.
	   ``The confirmation was delayed because the Japanese officials
needed time to rearrange their schedule for 1999,'' he said.
	   Benitez said the draw for the 12-team tournament, which also
will include CONCACAF champion Mexico, will be staged Dec. 15 in
Asuncion.
	   Argentina already has been slated to play its first-round games
in the city of Luque, while Brazil will play its first-round
matches in Ciudad del Este, 390 kilometers (240 miles) from
Asuncion.
	   Japan becomes the first non-American team to play in the Copa
America. Mexico and the United States were the first teams from
outside South America to participate in 1993 when they were invited
in an arrangement between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL.
	   Mexico and the United States also played in 1995, and Mexico
also played in 1997. With the United States having launched Major
League Soccer with an April-October schedule in 1996, it declined
in 1997 and was replaced by Costa Rica.
	   The United States again has declined for the upcoming
championship, opening a place for Japan.

Spanish government seeks Pinochet's extradition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Spanish gov't response to Chile recalling
ambassador; SUBS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain will ask Britain to extradite former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to face charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture, a government spokesman said Friday.
	   Chile responded by announcing it was recalling its ambassador,
Sergio Pizarro, from Madrid for consultations, prompting the
Spanish government to stress that its decision to seek extradition
was a legal obligation beyond its control.
	   The extradition request, approved at a weekly cabinet meeting,
had been sought by Judge Baltasar Garzon whose warrant led to the
arrest of 82-year-old Pinochet Oct. 16 in London as he recovered
from back surgery.
	   ``This was not a political decision, rather a legal
obligation,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued in
response to the Chilean protest.
	   Foreign Minister Abel Matutes had earlier told reporters that
the request would be before the British Home Office on Tuesday,
leaving Pinochet's fate in Britain's hands.
	   A five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords on Thursday
began hearing an appeal of a High Court ruling that Pinochet's
detention was illegal because he is entitled to immunity as a
former head of state.
	   The hearing was expected to continue next week.
	   If the panel rejects the High Court decision, Pinochet could be
handed over to Spanish authorities. Should it uphold the earlier
decision, the former dictator would likely be free to fly home.
	   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's administration had
previously frowned on Garzon's probe into human rights crimes
committed in Chile under Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule and in Argentina
under similar military regimes.
	   But the government had always said it would pass on an
extradition request if it received one.
	   ``We have to respect the law and the decisions of our judges,
whether it pleases the government or not,'' Matutes told reporters.
	   Spain's National Court ruled last week that the Spanish justice
system has jurisdiction to try crimes such as those allegedly
committed by Pinochet.
	   The court said there are grounds to try Pinochet for genocide
because he allegedly tried to eliminate an entire group of people _
his political opponents _ and that under Spanish law, Spanish
courts can prosecute genocide no matter where it occurred.
	   Matutes said ``obviously Chile does not feel the same...but it
understands that Spain must respect its laws,'' stressing that this
was a ``delicate matter that must be treated with prudence.''
	   An official Chilean government report says more than 3,000
people died or disappeared under Pinochet's rule as he tried to
crush a perceived communist threat.
	   Pinochet cannot be tried in Chile because he has immunity as a
senator for life, a job he created in a constitution he guided to
enactment before stepping down in 1990.
	   Matutes expressed confidence that the decision to transfer
Garzon's extradition request to the British authorities would not
hurt Spain's traditionally warm ties with Chile.
	   The later statement from his ministry said the government sought
to keep the ``excellent'' relations between the two countries
separate from ``decisions and initiatives out of its competence.''
	   The statement said the government hoped for ``a swift return to
normality.''
	   For some, the simple fact that Pinochet has been arrested and
his extradition sought is in itself an achievement.
	   ``Morally, Pinochet has already been condemned by all mankind,''
Isabel Allende, daughter of President Salvador Allende who was
killed during the Pinochet coup in 1973, said in Madrid earlier
Friday.
	   ``If he returns to Chile, he does so humiliated and knowing that
at least seven countries have extradition warrants against him,''
she said.
	   Allende was confident the British law lords would overturn the
immunity ruling and added that, although she would prefer a trial
to take place in Chile, she accepted that it could be held
anywhere.
	   ``There were no borders for the crimes he (Pinochet) committed.
We feel that in the same way there should be no borders for
justice,'' Allende said giving the example of Chilean Foreign
Minister Orlando Letelier who was killed in a car-bomb blast in
Washington in 1976.

Turkey protests Greek deputies' invitation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The foreign ministry on Friday protested
the invitation by 109 Greek deputies to a Kurdish rebel leader to
visit Greece.
	   In a statement, the ministry said that the invitation ``would
only encourage terrorist activities.''
	   ``We strongly protest the action of the Greek parliamentarians
and await the Greek government decision to clarify its position
toward this invitation,'' the statement read.
	   The open invitation to Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed
Kurdistan Worker's Party, was issued Thursday.
	   Turkey has in the past accused Greece of harboring and training
Kurdish rebels who have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984. Close to 37,000 people have died in the
conflict.
	   Greece denies the charges, though the group's political wing has
an office in Athens.
	   Turkey and Greece are at odds over numerous issues, including
the division of Cyprus and territorial disputes in the Aegean.
	   Turkish officials claim that Ocalan is currently hiding in
Russia.

newspaper &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Gov. Pedro Rossello spent a second
consecutive day Friday giving depositions in a lawsuit filed
against him and other government officials by the island's largest
newspaper.
	   ``The governor feels at peace and is confident in the end the
truth will prevail,'' said the governor's spokesman, Pedro Rosario
Urdaz, who is also named in the lawsuit.
	   Rosario, who spent three days giving depositions in the
discovery phase of the suit, said most of the defendants have
already completed their statements.
	   The newspaper and Puerto Rican Cement, both of which are
principally owned by the same family, accused Rossello and six
other officials of trying to punish the newspaper for critical
coverage by withdrawing government advertising.
	   The federal court lawsuit further accuses the defendants of
abusing government power to attack Puerto Rican Cement's business.
	   Rossello has denied all the charges.
	   The case drew international attention when the Inter-American
Press Association issued a resolution criticizing the government
and backing the newspaper's position.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air
market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. Last Thursday, an assailant
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
	   However, Palestinian security officials said that it was members
of the militant Islamic Jihad group which carried out the attack.
The officials identified one of the assailants as Yusef Ali
Mohammed Zughayar, 18, of Anata, a refugee camp north of Jerusalem.
	   Anata, which is under Israeli control, straddles the line
between the West Bank and Jerusalem.
	   Justice Minister Tshahi Hanegbi said that second assailant came
from the Palestinian controlled areas.
	   In a rare direct appeal to the Israeli people, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat appeared on Israel TV during the main Friday
evening news program and condemned the bombing as ``criminal.''
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,'' said
a grim-faced Arafat Arafat, adding that he would ``exert 100
percent effort'' to track down those involved in the attack.
	   Arafat also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express
his sorrow. The Israeli leader told Arafat that for the peace
process to continue, the Palestinians would have to significantly
step up their war against terrorists, a statement by Netanyahu's
office said.
	   The Palestinian cabinet also condemned the attack following
their meeting Friday night but added that Israel should not use it
as an excuse to halt the peace process.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. emergency relief coordinator will
travel through Central America next week to evaluate the U.N.
response to Hurricane Mitch and help determine what else the world
body can do to help.
	   Sergio Vieira de Mello, who is also undersecretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, will visit El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua
and Guatemala.
	   According to a U.N. statement, the storm has affected some 2.5
million people and the death toll, now some 9,000 people, is still
rising.
	   The United Nations said Vieira's trip, at the suggestion of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, is also meant to attract
international attention and support for emergency aid and
rehabilitation assistance to the battered region.
	   Vieira was scheduled to arrive in El Salvador on Monday, fly to
Honduras on Tuesday, to Nicaragua on Wednesday and then to
Guatemala on Thursday.

President of Comoros Islands dead of heart attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from U.N. Secretary General &QL; 
 &UR; By KAMAL EDDINE SAINDOU &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MORONI, Comoros (AP) _ The president of the Indian Ocean nation
of Comoros, which has been undergoing turbulence since one of its
islands declared independence last year, has died at the age of 62,
the country's religious leader announced Friday.
	   Mohamed Taki Abdulkarim died overnight, the religious leader,
Saed Mohamed Toihir, said on state radio. He provided no further
details, but French radio said the president had suffered a heart
attack.
	   Abdulkarim was the fourth president of the Comoros islands since
their independence from France in July 1975.
	   Elections were to be held within three months. Meanwhile, the
president of the High Council, Tadjidine Ben Said Massonde, will be
the interim president.
	   Paying tribute to Abdulkarim, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said that since his election on March 16, 1996 he had ``ceaselessly
worked towards the improvement of the economic, social and
political life of the people of his country,'' according to a
spokesman.
	   Annan expressed hope that the president's death ``will not be a
cause of discouragement or a motive to foster division, but rather
a catalyst for all Comorians to unite and seek a peaceful solution
to the country's political problems,'' the spokesman said.
	   Annan extended his ``heartfelt condolences'' to Comorians and
Abdulkarim's family, and his best wishes to interim president
Tadjiddine Said Massounde ``for a peaceful transition towards the
holding of new elections,'' the spokesman said.
	   Although the capital, Moroni, was calm on Friday, the army was
mobilized to keep order.
	   The three-island Federal Republic of the Comoros is in the
Indian Ocean north of Madagascar. It has been undergoing a bitter
secessionist conflict since August of last year, when the island of
Anjouan declared independence and asked to be reunited with France.
	   Paris rebuffed the request, saying the Comoros islands should
stick together. A month later the government sent in troops to
Anjouan in an abortive attempt to stop the rebellion.
	   The defeat of the government troops emboldened the
secessionists, but the move was rejected by all nations but Libya.
	   Moheli, the smallest of the three islands, joined the move for
secession but did not vote on it.
	   An international conference last December failed to resolve the
conflict, and in February, Mozambique's president was asked to help
mediate.
	   Anjouan was also reported calm Friday.
	   Comoros depends on the export of cloves and vanilla for its
foreign exchange earnings. The annual per capita income is less
than dlrs 200 a year.
	   Abdulkarim was elected president in 1996, replacing President
Said Mohamed Djohar.
	   An engineer, he entered politics in 1967 as a deputy in the
national assembly. When the Comoros gained independence in 1975, he
was accused of plotting to topple the first president, Ali Soilih.
He was imprisoned until a 1978 coup, when he became the assembly's
president under President Ahmed Abdallah.

Azharuddin leads India to three wicket win over Sri Lanka

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with India win. CHANGES headline to India win

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Captain Mohammed Azharuddin
broke the world record for the most number of one-day runs and Ajit
Agarkar hit 26 off 12 balls in deciding overs to help India beat
Sri Lanka by three wickets in the opening match of the Coca Cola
Cup Trophy.
	   India, chasing World Cup champion Sri Lanka's 245 for 7 in 50
overs, replied with 248 for 7 in 49.1 overs, including a superb 94
runs by Azharuddin.
	   Azharuddin, whose 302 matches are the highest in international
one-day cricket, hit four sixes _ two each off Thilan Samaraweera _
and three fours in his innings. He overtook West Indian Desmond
Hayne's record of 8,648 runs from 238 matches.
	   ``I am delighted to have reached a milestone today,'' said
Azharuddin of his huge 8,649 runs.
	   ``If i had done it in lesser matches than Haynes then I would
have called it a world record,'' he said.
	   ``Winning this match was more important for me,'' said
Azharuddin, who has made seven centuries and 53 half-centuries with
a highest score of 153 not out.
	   However, all-rounder Agarkar, who made 17 runs, managed to swing
the match back in India's favor as the run rate slumped after the
fall of Azharuddin's and Jadeja's wickets. He hit a six in the 48th
over off spinner Kumara Dharmasena,
	   Earlier in the Indian innings, wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia (51)
put India in a good position with a neat third-wicket stand with
Azharuddin of 114 runs in 23 overs.
	   Sachin Tendulkar and Sauruv Ganguly were caught behind in quick
succession, leaving the score 13 for 2 in the fourth over.
	   Mongia hit five boundaries in his 63-ball innings before being
caught by Roshan Mahanama off spinner Samaraweera.
	   Earlier, Avishka Gunuwardena and Marvan Atapattu both hit half
centuries to help Sri Lanka reach 245 for seven.
	   The World Cup champions jumped to 72 from 14 overs by an
unusually subdued Sanath Jayasuriya _ 27 of 42 balls _ and
Gunawardena _ 52 off 55 balls.
	   Gunawardena, playing his third one-day international, overcame a
tentative start to accelerate the scoring, hammering three
successive cover drives off the impressive paceman Javagal Srinath.
He hit eight boundaries in all.
	   However, the dismissals of Gunawardena and Aravinda de Silva,
who went for duck off leg spinner Anil Kumble's bowling, saw the
Lankans slump from 72 for no loss to 86 for three.
	   Captain Arjuna Ranatunga and Atapattu steadied the innings with
a watchful partnership of 89 in 21 overs. Ranatunga, who hit a
straight six, made 43 from 66 deliveries.
	   Atapattu, meanwhile, went on to lead all batsmen with 64 off 94
balls.
	   India needed an average five runs per over in the 50 over to
beat Sri Lanka on the opening day-night match at the Sharjah
stadium.
	   On Saturday, Sri Lanka play Zimbabwe, the third nation in the
dlrs 85,000 tournament which ends on Nov. 13.

	   Jupiter's Moon Puts on a Show
	   MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) _ Io may be only a moon of Jupiter, but
it puts on a planet-size energy show, with more than 30 volcanoes
spewing lava, fountains that spray streams of blue and a dynamo
that generates more electricity than all U.S. power plants
combined.
	   New photos from the Galileo satellite show lava glowing in red
pools, scattered like an angry rash across the face of Io.
Electricity sets gases aglow, and, in black space around the moon,
there is an arc of light generated by power surges of more than
400,000 volts.
	   Tidal forces from Jupiter twist and contort little Io, creating
frictional heat that erupts in at least 32 volcanoes, said Paul
Geissler of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
	   There is enough lava flowing every year on Io, said Geissler, to
cover the entire surface almost a half inch (1 centimeter) deep.
For this reason, the little moon is the only major body known in
the solar system to have no evidence of asteroid craters. The lava
erases impact marks, he said.
	   Pillon, a major Io volcano, spews lava that is about 2,600 F
(1,426 C), hundreds of degrees hotter than volcanoes now active on
Earth, said Geissler.
	   As it orbits Jupiter, Io intersects powerful magnetic field
lines from the giant planet and acts like an enormous electrical
generator.
	   The power causes Io to glow when it is in the shadow of Jupiter
and pictures from Galileo show the moon with a glimmering halo.
	   Near the surface, the combination of electricity and gases from
the volcanoes creates an even more unusual sight, said Geissler.
	   Sulfur dioxide venting from the volcanoes is energized by the
charged particles from the electrical fields. The gas then glows in
a brilliant blue.
	   Io also has fields of red and green, generated when charged
particles energize molecules of oxygen and hydrogen and other
gases.
	   ``This light show has been going on for a billion years,'' said
Geissler, ``and this is the first time it has ever been seen.''
	   Galileo, in orbit of Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will
continue to take photos of the planet and its satellites for at
least another year.
	   Io is 2,236 miles (3,598 kilometers) in diameter, slightly
larger than the Earth's moon. Io is one of four Jovian moons
discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, one of the first
astronomers to study the heavens with a telescope.
	   Jupiter's other major moons are Ganymede, Europa and Callisto.
Jupiter has at least a dozen smaller moons.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use the information from the story to answer the following true
and false questions:
	   _____ 1. Photographs taken by the Galileo spacecraft show that
Jupiter's moon Io is aglow with colorful light.
	   _____ 2. More than 30 volcanoes have been discovered on the
small moon.
	   _____ 3. Lava from Pillon, one of Io's volcanoes, is 2,600 F
(1,426 C) hotter than lava found on Earth.
	   _____ 4. No asteroid craters (holes) can be seen on the little
sphere because flowing lava continues to cover its surface.
	   _____ 5. Electricity is produced when Io crosses the magnetic
field lines of its mother planet, Jupiter.
	   _____ 6. It takes the small moon exactly 2 1/2 years to orbit
Jupiter.
	   _____ 7. When sulfur dioxide is energized, it appears bright
blue.
	   _____ 8. Scientists are hoping to find ways for U.S. power
plants to make use of Io's 400,000 volts of electricity.
	   _____ 9. The brilliant light show was first seen hundreds of
years ago by the astronomer Galileo Galilei.
	   _____ 10. Io has been glowing for a billion years.
	   _____ BONUS: It is likely that soon you will be able to travel
to Jupiter in order to get a closer look at its glimmering moon.

Jamaica to extradite two men wanted in the United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Two men wanted for a murder in New York
and drug smuggling in Florida will be sent to the United States by
Jamaican authorities, following court hearings this week.
	   Christopher Ashby, a Jamaican, will be sent to New York to face
charges of murder, attempted murder, robbery, burglary and assault.
He is accused of robbing a woman at gunpoint at her home in Valley
Stream, New York, on July 24, 1995, and then killing her son and
wounding her husband when they arrived home during the crime.
	   In a separate case, U.S. resident John Crawford, who was
convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute it
on May 19, 1981, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, waived extradition
and agreed to return to the United States.
	   Authorities said Crawford had fled to Jamaica after his
conviction while he was awaiting sentencing and was managing a
garment factory in Montego Bay when he was arrested.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of South African cricket said Friday that
a letter from President Nelson Mandela could help resolve a pay
dispute that is threatening to wipe out the West Indies' historic
tour of the republic.
	   Ali Bacher, managing director of the South Africa cricket board,
traveled to London Friday accompanied by Clive Lloyd, manager of
the the West Indies touring squad, and West Indies Cricket Board
member Joel Garner.
	   The three met informally Friday with disgruntled West Indies
players, who are locked in a pay dispute with the WICB. Formal
talks with Courtney Walsh, president of the West Indies Players
Association, were reported set for later Friday.
	   The WICB on Wednesday fired captain Brian Lara and vice-captain
Carl Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa. They want
better pay for players.
	   Bacher carried a letter from Mandela urging a resolution of the
impasse. Mandela stressed his hope that the West Indies can go
ahead with its first official tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid.
	   ``I'm sure the letter from the president will have a great
impression on the West Indies players,'' Bacher said. ``They know
him to be a man of great integrity and one of the great statesmen
of the century.''
	   ``One is confident of a result to the impasse,'' he added. ``I'm
sure the people in Caribbean and South Africa and world cricket in
general will see it as important that the tour goes ahead.''
	   The first match of the three-month tour is scheduled to begin
next Tuesday. The first Test is scheduled for Nov. 26.
	   The tour is considered crucial in promoting the game among South
African blacks in a country where whites run the sport.
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher said.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The WICB said it would fine the no-show players between 5 and 10
percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs 60,000
for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide player support. Only seven of the 16
members of the squad traveled to South Africa, and all seven have
since flown to London to rally around Lara.
	   On Friday, Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll joined calls for
the WICB to be fired. ``The members of the board should be fired,''
he declared. ``This is not simply a matter of cricket and the board
cannot be allowed to treat the players in such a manner.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''

	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Anger grew over the slow pace of
relief and survivors of Central America's worst disaster in memory
pleaded for help Friday in the devastated countryside, where
doctors rationed out slim medical supplies to sick and injured
refugees.
	   Though tons of aid was arriving from across the world for
victims of last week's Hurricane Mitch, the region's fractured road
system and limited air transportation forced many to continue
waiting.
	   Six-year-old Justa Pastora Povera Guillen, laid out on a cot at
a refugee center in Posoltega, shook with fever.
	   Dabbing the girl with a wet cloth, Dr. Rigoberto Sampson gave
her half a tablet of Tylenol and said her yellowish eyes suggested
malaria. There was little he could do.
	   ``We are lacking medicine. We can't give her blood tests to see
whether it's malaria but because of the situation here, I think it
is,'' he said.
	   The devastation has overwhelmed Central America, where officials
say more than 10,000 people died in flooding and mudslides.
Honduras said 569,000 were homeless and about 1 million others lost
loved ones or property. Nicaragua said more than 750,000 of its
people had been affected.
	   Scarcities were readily apparent in the Honduran capital,
Tegucigalpa, where many supermarket shelves were bare,
1-2-mile-long (0.8-kilometer-long) lines of cars formed at gasoline
stations and hundreds of people lined up at the few trucks with
potable water.
	   ``I need gas to drive around to find water for my family and my
neighbors,'' said an exasperated Boris Vermont, 35, who spent two
hours in line at a gas station where fuel ran out Friday.
	   CARE worker Pilar de Pastor sat helplessly in a jeep on a
Tegucigalpa street; there was no aid to deliver. ``We're hoping to
get two helicopters from Palmerola'' air base up north, she said.
``Maybe today they'll come.''
	   Nicaraguan victims have accused President Arnoldo Aleman of
being slow to help some of the worst-hit regions due to widespread
support of leftist Sandinistas, the former rebels who governed
through the 1980s.
	   ``The government has not sent anything. The only ones who are
helping us are the Sandinistas,'' Posoltega Mayor Felicita Zeledon
said.
	   Sixty-year-old refugee Elba Josefina Aguilera agreed. ``From the
government we haven't received anything,'' she said. ``The only
things we've received are from CARE. It seems to me it's political
because the mayor is Sandinista.''
	   Crowds of hungry flood victims had jeered Aleman, calling him a
murderer, when he visited nearby Leon on Tuesday.
	   A French military squadron reached Posoltega on Friday to
evaluate the refugees' needs. French Commander Bernard Demaret said
a plane carrying 90 tons of supplies would arrive later Friday and
its load would be split between Nicaragua and Honduras.
	   President Clinton has ordered dlrs 70 million of aid be sent
into the region. His wife, Hillary, and Vice President Al Gore's
wife, Tipper, planned separate trips to Central America in a show
of support.
	   Private relief groups in the United States said they were
flooded with calls volunteering private money and supplies.
	   Dean Owen, spokesman for World Vision, called it ``one of the
largest efforts we've seen in several years.'' The international
group hopes to raise dlrs 5 million in money and donations of
blankets, towels, soap and other personal care items.
	   Taiwan pledged dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras,
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The four countries are among
a dwindling number that recognize Taiwan, which China claims is a
breakaway province.
	   Brazil said it would send food, medicine and field tents, and
Central American embassies and consulates in Brazil opened special
bank accounts to collect monetary donations.
	   Spain approved an emergency aid package of dlrs 13.4 million.
	   The U.S. Navy said its Mobile Construction Battalion Seven was
ordered Friday to leave its station in Puerto Rico and head to
Honduras to help the rebuilding effort.
	   In Honduras, relief workers waited anxiously for promised aid _
and scrambled to find aircraft, trucks, gasoline and aviation fuel
to deliver it to hundreds of isolated towns.
	   ``One plane (from the United States) had to cancel yesterday,''
reportedly because pilots couldn't get landing clearance, said Tom
Turley of the Connecticut-based Americares. ``We put in a lot of
time and effort getting trucks and gas, and now we have to hold
back on it.''
	   CARE _ working with the U.S. Southern Command's Joint Task Force
Bravo in Honduras _ planned to move 60 tons of food a day, but
local food stocks are low. Local CARE reserves are nearly depleted,
and workers were told they likely won't get to the devastated
southern town of Choluteca by land for at least two months.
	   ``The situation there is grave,'' acknowledged Gloria Manzanares
Vaquero, CARE director for central and southern Honduras.
	   The government _ which already declared a state of siege and
overnight curfew to prevent lawlessness _ banned alcohol sales
indefinitely Friday. More than 2,000 people have been detained this
week for violating the curfew.
	   At the primary school turned into a shelter in Posoltega,
children and weary adults shared a moment of levity, laughing at
tricks performed by a juggler from the Spain-based Clowns Without
Borders.
	   Others had a hard time smiling. Susana Benevidas returned to the
shelter carrying a large empty bucket.
	   ``I went to look for water because my children are thirsty but
there isn't any,'' the mother of four said. ``A water truck has
shown up only twice _ but it runs out very quickly.''
	   On the mountainside above Posoltega, where some 2,000 people
were killed a week ago when the crater lake atop Casitas Volcano
broke open, military brigades continued to burn or bury the
victims' bodies.
	   Mayor Zeledon recalled that when she took office she had hoped
to help Posoltega develop from being one of Nicaragua's poorest
towns.
	   ``Now the misery is greater and my program has changed into
helping Posoltega survive, to go on living, although with a bitter
memory,'' she said.

Kafelnikov eliminates jaded Rios; Tired Sampras back to his best
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Sampras quotes &QL;

 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered a
lackluster Marcelo Rios in the quarterfinal of the dlrs 2.55
million Paris Open on Friday, easily beating the world No. 2, 6-3,
6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, took exactly one hour to beat Rios,
who was roundly booed off the court by spectators who felt he
hadn't made an effort.
	   The match turned in the eighth game of the first set.
	   Kafelnikov broke serve while leading 4-3 with a smart backhand
drop volley, and held serve to take the set.
	   ``The first set was unbelievable but he let himself down in the
second with some loose play,'' Kafelnikov said. ``From that point
on he gave me a lot of extra confidence and I never looked back.''
	   ``Once you give the idea that you are a bit down, or not
satisfied with something, that gives your opponent extra
confidence,'' the Russian said.
	   Kafelnikov's win also improves his chances of qualifying for the
ATP World Championship in Hanover this month.
	   Rios still hopes to end the year as number one.
	   ``Hanover will decide it,'' he said.
	   Showing no signs of the back injury that plagued him earlier in
the tournament, Pete Sampras advanced to the semifinals by beating
Australia's Mark Philippoussis, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Sampras demonstrated his familiar array of winners against the
U.S. Open finalist.
	   Leading 2-1 in the second set, Sampras played a stunning
backhand winner at full stretch past a stunned Philippoussis to
break service and set up the victory.
	   Unseeded Philippoussis beat No. 7 seed Karol Kucera and No. 10
seed Petr Korda on his way to reaching the quarterfinals, but
always looked a class below the world number one.
	   But after the match, a tired Sampras slammed the organization of
the professional tennis circuit, saying it was too busy and caused
injuries.
	   ``The more we play, the more chance there is of injury. One of
the problems is with the ranking system, which encourages too many
matches,'' he said.
	   ``If I want to play for many more years, which I want to do, I
need more of a break. I moan about this all the time but nothing
changes,'' he said.
	   Sampras said that Patrick Rafter's injury, which will keep the
Australian out of the World Championships, is an example of the
pressure put on players.
	   ``Rafter has been playing too much tennis and now he can't play
in Hanover,'' Sampras said. ``That cannot be good for the game.''
	   But when asked why players do not challenge the system, he said
``it is hard enough to get the top players in a room together at
the same time, let alone to agree on anything. Anyway, there is a
lot of bread to be made out there.''
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Kafelnikov will play Britain's Greg
Rusedski, the player that beat him in the first round of last
month's Vienna Open event.
	   Rusedski, who retains a small chance of qualifying for Hanover,
had little trouble beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-2 in another
quarterfinal contest.

Yeltsin slams Communists' anti-Semitic, anti-media comments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Friday
denounced Communist leaders for recent anti-Semitic statements and
verbal attacks on journalists.
	   ``Any attempt to insult ethnic feelings or limit the rights of
citizens for ethnic reasons will be cut short in conformity with
the Constitution,'' Yeltsin said in a statement released by his
office. He did not elaborate.
	   Earlier this week, Communists and their hard-line allies in the
Russian parliament's lower house joined ranks to defend a Communist
lawmaker who made anti-Semitic comments during public rallies last
month.
	   Several liberal lawmakers proposed a resolution condemning the
remarks by retired Gen. Albert Makashov, but Communists and
ultranationalists spoke out in Makashov's favor, and the resolution
failed.
	   Anti-Semitism is widespread in Russia, which has the
third-largest Jewish population in the world, after the United
States and Israel. Russia's history of discriminating against Jews
dates back to czarist times, and continued under the Communists,
particularly in the Josef Stalin era.
	   The parliament session Wednesday then turned into a round of
media-bashing, with Communist lawmakers accusing several
high-profile Russian journalists of stirring up hatred and
colluding with the government.
	   Some lawmakers called for forming a commission to track coverage
unacceptable to parliament and take ``appropriate measures''
against the offending media outlets. It wasn't clear what those
measures would be or what would be considered unacceptable.
	   In his statement Friday, Yeltsin said: ``Freedom of speech and
of the press, no matter how bitter it is for the authorities or for
the opposition, has been, is and will be one of the most valuable
achievements of the young Russian democracy.''

Afwerki ends visit to Yemen saying relations are special
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Eritrean-Yemeni relations are ``special,''
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki said here Friday at the end of a
visit designed to reconcile two states that fought a brief battle
in 1995.
	   Afwerki arrived in Yemen on Wednesday, three days after his
government withdrew forces from a Red Sea island it had seized in a
firefight with Yemeni troops in December 1995.
	   The World Court had ruled Oct. 9 that Greater Hanish and two
other islands belonged to Yemen and that its decision should be
implemented within 90 days.
	   During Afwerki's visit, Eritrean and Yemeni officials signed
agreements on trade and cultural and scientific cooperation, Yemeni
officials said.
	   Afwerki told reporters: ``Yemeni-Eritrean relations are special
now.''
	   Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said he and Afwerki had
agreed to use the World Court judgment to try to settle their
maritime border.
	   ``We are working on a friendly solution without resorting to
arbitration,'' Saleh told reporters.
	   The two states face each other across one of the world's major
shipping lanes. The disputed islands lie 160 kilometers (100 miles)
north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the mouth of the Red Sea.
	   In a statement before Afwerki's departure, the Yemeni government
said it was ready to contribute to efforts to resolve the border
crisis between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   Fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia broke out in May with
Ethiopia accusing Eritrean troops of invading its territory.
Eritrea has refused to withdraw, saying it is respecting the border
drawn on Italian colonial maps.

Blast kills 2 bombers, injures 16 others, delays action on accord

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air
market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the
attack, the second suicide bombing since the signing of the
land-for-security accord two weeks ago. Last Thursday, an assailant
tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying Jewish
schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
	   However, Palestinian security officials said members of the
militant Islamic Jihad group carried out the attack. The officials
identified one assailant as Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar, 18, of
Anata, a refugee camp north of Jerusalem. Anata, which is under
Israeli control, straddles the line between the West Bank and
Jerusalem.
	   Justice Minister Tshahi Hanegbi said that second assailant came
from the Palestinian controlled areas.
	   In a rare direct appeal to the Israeli people, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat appeared on Israel TV during the main Friday
evening news program and condemned the bombing as ``criminal.''
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,'' said
a grim-faced Arafat, adding that he would ``exert 100 percent
effort'' to track down those involved in the attack.
	   Arafat also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express
his sorrow. The Israeli leader told Arafat that for the peace
process to continue, the Palestinians would have to significantly
step up their war against terrorists, a statement by Netanyahu's
office said.
	   The Palestinian cabinet also condemned the attack following
their meeting Friday night but added that Israel should not use it
as an excuse to halt the peace process.
	   The Mahane Yehuda market _ several square blocks of narrow,
stone-walled lanes and wooden stalls heaped high with fruit,
vegetables and spices _ was packed with shoppers making last-minute
purchases before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   The blast sent a billowing cloud of black smoke pouring into the
air. Shoppers _ many of them Orthodox Jews clad in sweeping skirts
or long black frock coats _ fled in panic, some scattering their
purchases on the street.
	   At the market's entrance, the assailants' red Fiat was reduced
to a mass of twisted metal, with only the steering column left
intact. Next to it was a charred body cut nearly in half by the
force of the blast; a few feet (meters) away was a second body,
bare-legged and face down in a pool of blood.
	   Witnesses' accounts suggested the blast had gone off
prematurely. Onlookers said they saw smoke and flames coming from
the car and heard a series of popping explosions before a larger
blast shook the area. By then, people had already started running
away.
	   ``When the big explosion went, there were not that many people
nearby,'' said witness Yaakov Shlomo. ``That was a miracle from
heaven.''
	   Almost all the injuries were minor, from flying debris; by
nightfall seven people remained hospitalized.
	   Blasted-apart suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel
radio reported, suggesting that the attackers had perhaps intended
to carry parcels of explosives deep into the crowd. That method was
used to deadly effect in an attack at the market 16 months ago that
killed the two suicide bombers and 16 others.
	   Israeli officials acknowledged that the toll was remarkably
light for an attack surely meant to kill and maim many, but said it
still showed the daily danger Israelis face from Islamic militants.
	   ``We can't depend on miracles _ we need to fight the cycle of
terrorism,'' said Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. He and other
Cabinet ministers, who were in the midst of debate over ratifying
the agreement at the time of the attack, cut short their session
and did not schedule a date for resumption.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said he still expected
the accord to be ratified eventually. But the suspension of debate
will almost certainly bring delays in the tightly timed 12-week
schedule for implementation.
	   The Cabinet said it would take up the accord again only after
verifying ``that the Palestinian Authority is taking vigorous steps
for an all-out war against terrorist organizations.''
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat urged the United
States to step in and make sure Israel ratifies the accord.
	   ``I hope that at this critical period, we will concentrate on
the bigger picture,'' Erekat said. ``The answer to extremists on
both sides sworn to sabotage this process must be a big `No.'''
	   Immediately after the bombing, small but furious protests by
right-wing Israelis broke out. ``Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat!''
a dozen or more demonstrators shouted from behind police
barricades. Several were arrested.
	   In the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall, itself the scene of a suicide
bombing 14 months ago, people in open-air cafes clustered around
radios, listening, nodding and relaying the news. ``Bomb, Mahane
Yehuda,'' they told passersby.
	   Yair Cohen, 45, a bus-company worker who was shopping at the
market, said that moments before the blast he had given money to a
beggar on the street as a ``mitzvah'' _ a good deed that observant
Jews believe will help lead to their own salvation.
	   ``I said to myself, `Maybe this will save my life,''' he
recounted later at the hospital, his gray T-shirt stained with
blood where he was hit by flying shrapnel. ``And ten minutes later,
there was the explosion _ and I really did escape death.''

Wheat, soybeans gain on Russia aid package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Wheat and soybean futures prices advanced Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S. announced details of a
food aid package to Russia. Corn futures finished mixed.
	   Wheat and soybeans rose after the U.S. Agriculture Department
announced it would donate 1.5 million tons of wheat to Russia and
allow that economically depressed country to purchase other
foodstuffs with a 20-year loan.
	   With the loan, Russia will purchase 500,000 tons of corn,
300,000 tons of soybean meal, 200,000 tons of soybeans, 200,000
tons of wheat, 100,000 tons of rice, 120,000 tons of beef, 50,000
tons of pork and 30,000 tons of nonfat dry milk. Shipments are
expected to begin next months, with the United States paying the
transportation costs as well.
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic problems coupled with the
worst grain harvest in 40 years. Food prices have risen about 50
percent due to the country's financial crisis, prompting worries
that the poor won't be able to afford food. Food imports have
dramatically fallen off.
	   But corn futures did not benefit from the announcement as market
participants squared their positions ahead of the government's next
crop production estimate, due early Tuesday. Investors expect the
USDA to boost estimates for the bumper corn and soybean crops amid
farmer harvesting reports of good yields.
	   Wheat for December wheat delivery rose 2 1-2 cents to dlrs 2.90
a bushel; December corn fell 1-2 cent to dlrs 2.16 3-4 a bushel;
December oats were unchanged at dlrs 1.12 a bushel; January
soybeans rose 3 3-4 cents to dlrs 5.71 1-4 a bushel.

World economic crisis abating, IMF head says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Although calm is returning, the crisis in the
world financial system is not over yet, the head of the
International Monetary Fund said Friday.
	   Michel Camdessus praised Latin American countries for trying to
defend themselves against the turmoil in global financial markets
and said there were promising signs of recovery in Asia, where the
crisis began 16 months ago.
	   Camdessus urged countries to use the crisis to make fundamental
economic reforms and avert a recession. He spoke to the Council of
World Affairs in Philadelphia. A copy of his speech was made
available in Washington.
	   ``Even if, in the past few weeks, an air of calm has begun to
return to global markets, we could argue that the crisis in the
functioning of the global financial system is not over yet, and
that we now have a better opportunity to press ahead with
fundamental reform,'' he said.
	   Camdessus said the Latin American nations ``have signaled their
readiness to do whatever is necessary to maintain their access to
international capital markets,'' he said. ``This preemptive action
is helping to defuse potential crisis in the region.''
	   He said Brazil set a good example by ``not waiting until the
last moment to acknowledge its policy shortcomings and to take
strong action.'' This was a reference to President Fernando
Cardoso's dlrs 23.5 billion fiscal reform package announced last
week.
	   Brazil is expected to receive a dlrs 30 billion IMF-led rescue
package, possibly next week.
	   In Asia, Camdessus said ``Korea, Thailand and even Indonesia,
are continuing to show promising signs that recovery could be
around the corner.''
	   These three nations received IMF-led rescue packages totaling
more than dlrs 100 billion.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government on Friday announced
it would allow prosecutors to seek former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet's extradition from Britain. Chile immediately protested
the move by recalling its ambassador from Spain.
	   The approval by the Spanish Cabinet leaves Pinochet's fate in
the hands of Britain, where the former general was arrested on a
Spanish warrant Oct. 16.
	   The English High Court ruled that Pinochet's arrest was illegal
because he is entitled to immunity as a former head of state. A
five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords is hearing an
appeal.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, speaking after a Cabinet
meeting, said he expected the extradition request to reach the
British Interior Ministry on Tuesday.
	   In Santiago, the Chilean capital, Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza said Chilean ambassador to Spain Sergio Pizarro would be
withdrawn immediately. He said, however, that diplomatic ties would
not be broken or suspended.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose warrant led to the arrest in
London, has accused the 82-year-old Pinochet of genocide, terrorism
and torture.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government has criticized
Garzon's probe into human rights crimes committed in Chile under
Pinochet's 1973-90 rule and in Argentina, saying he lacks
jurisdiction.
	   But Aznar and other government officials had said that they
would pass on an extradition request to Britain if they received
one, calling the affair a matter for courts to decide.
	   ``We understand that this is a delicate matter which must be
treated with prudence,'' Matutes said Friday. ``But most
importantly, it is a judicial matter. We have to respect the law
and the decisions of our judges, whether it pleases the government
or not.''
	   If Britain's House of Lords rejects the High Court decision,
Pinochet could be handed over to Spanish authorities. Should it
uphold the earlier decision, the former dictator will most likely
be free to fly home.
	   The hearing continues Monday and is expected to last at least
through Tuesday. It was not clear how soon the judges would
announce their ruling.
	   Spain's National Court ruled last week that the Spanish justice
system does, in fact, have jurisdiction to try crimes like those
cited against Pinochet.
	   The court said there are grounds to try the former dictator for
genocide because he allegedly tried to eliminate an entire group of
people _ his political opponents _ and that under Spanish law,
courts can prosecute genocide no matter where it occurred.
	   An official Chilean government report says more than 3,000
people died or disappeared under Pinochet's rule as he tried to
crush a perceived communist threat.
	   Pinochet cannot be tried in Chile because he has immunity as a
senator-for-life, a job he created in a constitution he guided to
enactment before stepping down in 1990.

Russia relocates people from Arctic peninsula without food or heat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Emergency officials have evacuated more than 1,000
people from Russia's Arctic peninsula of Chukotka because it is too
expensive to supply them with food and electricity, Russian
television reported Friday.
	   Temperatures on Chukotka, just across the Bering Strait from
Alaska, have plunged to -25 C (-13 F), and are forecast to worsen.
	   The impoverished region about 7,500 kilometers (4,700 miles)
northeast of Moscow, has had trouble purchasing adequate fuel
supplies for years, and Russia's latest economic crisis has made
things even harder.
	   Authorities have moved 1,100 people out of the Cape Schmidt area
and are hoping to move at least 2,000 more to Chukotka's larger
towns, Alexander Tryapitsyn, deputy governor of the Chukotka
region, told ORT public television.
	   The region cannot afford to supply electricity or food to Cape
Schmidt, he said, though evacuating residents is also costly. Each
relocation costs about 50,000 rubles (dlrs 3,200), he said.
	   On Wednesday, the Russian government sent a tanker full of fuel
to help relieve an energy shortage on the Far Eastern peninsula of
Kamchatka, where residents have been receiving power for only a few
hours a day.

Azharuddin leads India to three wicket win over Sri Lanka

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Captain Mohammed Azharuddin
broke the world record for the most number of one-day runs and Ajit
Agarkar hit 26 off 12 balls in deciding overs to help India beat
Sri Lanka by three wickets in the opening match of the Coca Cola
Cup Trophy.
	   India, chasing World Cup champion Sri Lanka's 245 for 7 in 50
overs, replied with 248 for 7 in 49.1 overs, including a superb 94
runs by Azharuddin.
	   Azharuddin, whose 302 matches are the highest in international
one-day cricket, hit four sixes _ two each off Thilan Samaraweera _
and three fours in his innings. He overtook West Indian Desmond
Hayne's record of 8,648 runs from 238 matches.
	   ``I am delighted to have reached a milestone today,'' said
Azharuddin of his huge 8,649 runs.
	   ``If i had done it in lesser matches than Haynes then I would
have called it a world record,'' he said.
	   ``Winning this match was more important for me,'' said
Azharuddin, who has made seven centuries and 53 half-centuries with
a highest score of 153 not out.
	   However, all-rounder Agarkar, who made 17 runs, managed to swing
the match back in India's favor as the run rate slumped after the
fall of Azharuddin's and Jadeja's wickets. He hit a six in the 48th
over off spinner Kumara Dharmasena,
	   Earlier in the Indian innings, wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia (51)
put India in a good position with a neat third-wicket stand with
Azharuddin of 114 runs in 23 overs.
	   Sachin Tendulkar and Sauruv Ganguly were caught behind in quick
succession, leaving the score 13 for 2 in the fourth over.
	   Mongia hit five boundaries in his 63-ball innings before being
caught by Roshan Mahanama off spinner Samaraweera.
	   Earlier, Avishka Gunuwardena and Marvan Atapattu both hit half
centuries to help Sri Lanka reach 245 for seven.
	   The World Cup champions jumped to 72 from 14 overs by an
unusually subdued Sanath Jayasuriya _ 27 of 42 balls _ and
Gunawardena _ 52 off 55 balls.
	   Gunawardena, playing his third one-day international, overcame a
tentative start to accelerate the scoring, hammering three
successive cover drives off the impressive paceman Javagal Srinath.
He hit eight boundaries in all.
	   However, the dismissals of Gunawardena and Aravinda de Silva,
who went for duck off leg spinner Anil Kumble's bowling, saw the
Lankans slump from 72 for no loss to 86 for three.
	   Captain Arjuna Ranatunga and Atapattu steadied the innings with
a watchful partnership of 89 in 21 overs. Ranatunga, who hit a
straight six, made 43 from 66 deliveries.
	   Atapattu, meanwhile, went on to lead all batsmen with 64 off 94
balls.
	   India needed an average five runs per over in the 50 over to
beat Sri Lanka on the opening day-night match at the Sharjah
stadium.
	   On Saturday, Sri Lanka play Zimbabwe, the third nation in the
dlrs 85,000 tournament which ends on Nov. 13.

Arab League says Iraqi tension might be related to US elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The current standoff between Iraq and the
United Nations might be related to the U.S. elections, Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Friday.
	   Speaking on Egyptian television, Abdel-Meguid said that
Americans were capable of doing anything at election time.
	   ``I don't rule out that the latest escalation with Iraq is the
result of the elections in the United States,'' he added.
	   Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it would not allow U.N. weapons
monitors to work. It accused them of being spies and prolonging the
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council condemned the move Thursday and
demanded that Iraq restore cooperation with the commission that
oversees the destruction of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The U.S. House and Senate elections were held on Tuesday.
	   Abdel-Meguid said he had asked Iraq ``to avoid any crisis with
the United Nations.''
	   Asked about the Middle Eastern tour of U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen, Abdel-Meguid said ``the United States is talking
about the use of force against Iraq ... and we are against the use
of force against any Arab country.''
	   Cohen, who ended his four-day tour Friday, told reporters in
Ankara, Turkey, that Iraq had to reverse its decision on weapons
inspectors ``very soon.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Roman Catholic Church will give out about
1.5 million free tickets to see Pope John Paul II during his
four-day visit to Mexico in January, church officials said Friday.
	   Tickets will be distributed to bishops and faithful throughout
the Americas based on the number of requests sent to the organizing
committee in Mexico City, said Gerardo Lopez, church press
coordinator for the visit.
	   ``This is a continental event, and we want people from other
countries to have an opportunity to be here,'' Lopez said.
	   Tickets will be sent out shortly before the pope's Jan. 22-26
visit to reduce the chance of counterfeiting.
	   In his fourth visit to Mexico, the 78-year-old pope will address
bishops from North and South America, giving his responses to
questions raised by the prelates during a meeting at the Vatican
last fall on challenges to the Roman Catholic Church in the
Americas.
	   He is scheduled to address large crowds of faithful at Mexico
City's Basilica of Guadalupe, Aztec Stadium and the Hermanos
Rodriguez race track.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ The lush jungle vegetation that surrounded the
Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, Peru's top tourist attraction, has
returned more than a year after being destroyed by fire,
authorities said Friday.
	   The five-day fire in September 1997 burned 1,300 acres (500
hectares) of tropical mountain forests containing rare species of
birds, butterflies and orchids, a government report said.
	   It blackened surrounding mountain slopes, destroying the
stunning view from the stone ruins, which sit atop a craggy,
jungle-covered peak in the southern Andes. Many of the 1,000
tourists who visit Machu Picchu daily come for the view.
	   Local officials and volunteers planted thousands of trees and
sowed flower seeds over the blackened area to restore the site's
beauty. Biologists say that although much of the vegetation has
returned it will take far longer for the ecosystem to recover
completely.
	   The ruins are believed to have been a center of religious
ceremonies in the 15th and 16th centuries.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Dolphins may be smart and cute, but they've
been unable to wow Mexico City crowds the way the world's most
famous killer whale once did.
	   The amusement park that was home to Keiko the superstar whale
has seen its attendance drop by half since his 1996 departure, a
Mexico City newspaper reported Friday.
	   ``Economically speaking, we have lost 45 to 50 percent of our
ticket sales,'' park director Gerardo Roca said.
	   A team of dolphins that now is the main maritime attraction at
Reino Aventura has failed to capture the same level of public
interest, Roca said. The park, however, has no plans to buy another
whale.
	   Keiko, who shot to fame after playing the title role in the 1993
box-office hit ``Free Willy,'' had suffered health problems at his
cramped Mexico City pool, such as skin lesions and a droopy dorsal
fin.
	   The movie's popularity led to a campaign to free Keiko. The
park, which had bought Keiko for dlrs 350,000, yielded to public
pressure and allowed him to be taken to a specially constructed
aquarium in Newport, Oregon, in 1996.
	   School children then helped raise millions of dollars for the
Free Willy Keiko Foundation to return the 21-year-old whale to
Iceland. He now is in a holding pen off Iceland's Vestmann Islands,
preparing for a return to the wild.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered a
lackluster Marcelo Rios in the quarterfinal of the dlrs 2.55
million Paris Open on Friday, easily beating the world No. 2, 6-3,
6-2.
	   Kafelnikov, the No. 8 seed, took exactly one hour to beat Rios,
who was roundly booed off the court by spectators who felt he
hadn't made an effort.
	   The match turned in the eighth game of the first set.
	   Kafelnikov broke serve while leading 4-3 with a smart backhand
drop volley, and held serve to take the set.
	   ``The first set was unbelievable but he let himself down in the
second with some loose play,'' Kafelnikov said. ``From that point
on he gave me a lot of extra confidence and I never looked back.''
	   ``Once you give the idea that you are a bit down, or not
satisfied with something, that gives your opponent extra
confidence,'' the Russian said.
	   Kafelnikov's win also improves his chances of qualifying for the
ATP World Championship in Hanover this month.
	   Rios still hopes to end the year as number one.
	   ``Hanover will decide it,'' he said.
	   Showing no signs of the back injury that plagued him earlier in
the tournament, Pete Sampras advanced to the semifinals by beating
Australia's Mark Philippoussis, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Sampras, looking to end the season as No. 1 for a sixth
consecutive year, demonstrated his familiar array of winners
against the U.S. Open finalist.
	   Leading 2-1 in the second set, Sampras played a stunning
backhand winner at full stretch past a stunned Philippoussis to
break service and set up the victory.
	   Unseeded Philippoussis beat No. 7 seed Karol Kucera and No. 10
seed Petr Korda on his way to reaching the quarterfinals, but
always looked a class below the world number one.
	   But after the match, a tired Sampras slammed the organization of
the professional tennis circuit, saying it was too busy and caused
injuries.
	   ``The more we play, the more chance there is of injury. One of
the problems is with the ranking system, which encourages too many
matches,'' he said.
	   ``If I want to play for many more years, which I want to do, I
need more of a break. I moan about this all the time but nothing
changes,'' he said.
	   Sampras said that Patrick Rafter's injury, which will keep the
Australian out of the World Championships, is an example of the
pressure put on players.
	   ``Rafter has been playing too much tennis and now he can't play
in Hanover,'' Sampras said. ``That cannot be good for the game.''
	   But when asked why players do not challenge the system, he said
``it is hard enough to get the top players in a room together at
the same time, let alone to agree on anything. Anyway, there is a
lot of bread to be made out there.''
	   In Saturday's semifinals, Sampras will play Todd Martin, who
came back from 1-3 behind in the final set to beat No. 5 seed Andre
Agassi 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Agassi double-faulted with Martin on his second match point.
	   In the other semifinal, Kafelnikov will play Britain's Greg
Rusedski.
	   Rusedski, who retains a small chance of qualifying for Hanover,
had little trouble beating Magnus Gustafsson, 6-3, 6-2 in another
quarterfinal contest.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio worsened Friday in his fight to
recover from pneumonia and a lung infection.
	   ``I just got back from the hospital and he's very sick,'' said
Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's lawyer and friend.
	   The 83-year-old U.S. baseball Hall of Famer is on sedatives to
help him breathe and is using oxygen equipment.
	   Doctors at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida
blamed the setback on DiMaggio's attempt to do too much when he
began to feel better last week, according to Engelberg.
	   The New York Yankees' great had been getting out of bed to eat
his meals in his room, and last Saturday he walked on his own for
the first time in 18 days.
	   ``He likes to get out of bed to watch TV, but the doctors said
he overdid it. He aggravated his condition,'' Engelberg said.
``It's like if you keep rubbing a sore on your hand it gets worse.
That's what happened to Joe.''
	   But his days of leaving his bed are over for a while.
	   ``He will be sedated for four to six days so he can breathe
easier,'' said Engelberg. ``He needs rest and sleep.''
	   ``But the doctors have told him his life is not in danger,'' he
added. ``His heart is good, his kidneys are good, all his vital
signs are good. If it weren't for that pneumonia, he would be out
playing golf.''
	   The setback ended hopes that DiMaggio would be out in time for
his 84th birthday on Nov 25. He was hospitalized on Oct. 12, and
had been in a life-threatening situation before his brief recovery
last week.
	   ``He's going to be in the hospital, intensive care, for six to
eight weeks,'' Engelberg said. ``And then he will have to go into
rehabilitation just because he's been in bed for about 25 days
now.''
	   Engelberg said DiMaggio had been buoyed by visits from his
grandchildren, Paula, Cathy and Jim, and brother Dom, also a former
major league outfielder.
	   Relations between the brothers had been strained in recent
years, but Dom, who lives in the Boston area, has been a regular
visitor to the hospital room.
	   ``I had to tell Paula and Cathy to go back home this morning,''
Engelberg said. ``Joe was in no shape to see them.''
	   The lawyer said a team of seven doctors is treating DiMaggio,
headed by Dr. Earl Barron, a cardiologist.
	   As has been the case since DiMaggio was hospitalized, only his
family and one or two friends have been allowed to visit. Phone
calls to his room are blocked.
	   Hospital staffers have been barred from discussing his condition
and repeated callers are referred to Engelberg's office. DiMaggio
is in the same hospital where he has been instrumental in funding a
pediatric wing, The Joe DiMaggio's Children's Hospital.

Fishermen rescued by Royal Navy releif ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two Puerto Rican fishermen stranded at sea after
Hurricane Mitch blew their boat off course were rescued by a
passing Royal Navy ship Friday.
	   H.M.S Ocean, headed for Honduras to help with hurricane relief
efforts, picked up the fishermen in the Caribbean Sea between
British Virgin Islands and Honduras.
	   The fishermen, whose names were not immediatlely available, had
run out of fuel before they were able to get back to land and had
been adrift for eight days.
	   They were almost out of drinking water, but were in
``surprisingly good shape,'' said a spokesman for the Royal Navy,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The boat, which was lifted onto the Navy vessel, was spotted by
one of Ocean's helicopters at about 10:15 a.m. local time (1515
GMT).

Eritrean president says Eritrean-Yemini relations are ``special''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Eritrea and Yemen signed trade, cultural and
scientific agreements during the two-day presidential summit ending
Friday that was aimed at reconciling two nations that fought a
brief battle in 1995.
	   Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki said Yemeni-Eritrean relations
``are special now,'' and Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said
the two countries would work at resolving a remaining maritime
border dispute without resorting to arbitration.
	   Afwerki arrived in Yemen on Wednesday, three days after his
government withdrew forces from a Red Sea island it had seized in a
brief firefight with Yemeni troops in December 1995. The World
Court had ruled Oct. 9 that Greater Hanish belonged to Yemen and
that its decision must be implemented within 90 days.
	   The two states face each other across one of the world's major
shipping lanes. The disputed islands lie 160 kilometers (100 miles)
north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the mouth of the Red Sea.
	   In a statement before Afwerki's departure, the Yemeni government
said it was ready to contribute to efforts to resolve the border
crisis between Eritrea and Ethiopia.
	   Fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia broke out in May with
Ethiopia accusing Eritrean troops of invading its territory.
Eritrea has refused to withdraw, saying it is respecting the border
drawn on Italian colonial maps.

Marseille snatches injury-time winner to beat Monaco
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Florian Maurice scored a dramatic injury time
winner to give ten-man Marseille, the French league leader, a vital
1-0 win over title challenger Monaco on Friday
	   The goal came after Titi Camara collected a backheel from
Jocelyn Gourvennec and crossed to Maurice, who fired in from eight
yards (meters).
	   It was the big striker's sixth league goal of the season since
joining Marseille from Paris Saint-Germain.
	   The win leaves Marseille with 30 points, five points ahead of
Bordeaux and seven ahead of third-placed Rennes.
	   In a match between two teams that were on Friday drawn to play
each other in the third round of the UEFA Cup, Marseille midfielder
Peter Luccin was sent off for tackle Muhamed Konjic in the first
half.
	   Monaco's Robert Spehar was sent off two minutes from the end.
	   In Friday's other match Bastia beat Lorient 2-1.
	   Pascal Camadini put the away team ahead in the 4th minute, but
Bastia grabbed the three points with a 30th minute Pierre-Yves
Andre penalty and a second half strike from Frederic Nee.
	   In Saturday's games, league leader Bordeaux hosts struggling
Toulouse, while Rennes is at home to another struggler, Sochaux.

Swedish star sidelined at least three months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Magnus Larsson, a potential entry for
defending champion Sweden in the Davis Cup finals against Italy
next month, underwent successful surgery in his right wrist Friday
and will be sidelined at least three months.
	   Larsson, 28, a former top 10 player, will also miss next week's
Stockholm Open, one of the oldest indoor tournaments in the world,
and the Australian Open in January.
	   ``Three months is a long time, but I think Magnus will be hungry
to play competively again in February,'' said his coach Carl-Axel
Hageskog, who also is Sweden's Davis Cup coach.
	   Larsson, ranked 37th in the world, was injured in the
quarterfinals against Germany at Halle, Germany, in July.
	   A quarterfinalist in the U.S. Open this year, Larsson has been
plagued by injuries throughout his career. In 1995, after breaking
into the top 10 for the first time, he broke his right foot and
didn't return until late October.
	   Sweden shut out the United States 5-0 in last year's final in
Goteborg, Sweden. This year's final against Italy will be played in
Milan Dec. 4-6.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Alexander Barkov had one goal and one
assist as Russia snapped Sweden's 21-game unbeaten streak in
international hockey with a 4-1 victory in the Karjala Cup
tournament Friday.
	   The Swedes' streak started when they won the World Championships
in Switzerland in May. They tied the Czech Republic 2-2 in the
Karjala Cup opener Thursday.
	   Alexander Prokopiev, Vladimir Samylin and Pavel Agarkov scored
the other goals for Russia. Anders Huusko scored for Sweden, tying
the score 1-1 in the first period.
	   The Russians prevailed despite being outshot 32-15, including
17-1 in the final period.
	   The tournament is the second in the European Hockey Tour. Sweden
won the first tournament in the Czech Republic two months ago and
leads the overall standings with five points, one ahead of Finland.
	   Finland, which edged Russia 3-2 in Thursday's opener, face the
Czech Republic on Saturday.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Zapatista rebels in
the southern state of Chiapas called off a weekend talk with
congressional mediators on Friday, saying they couldn't attend
because of heightened military patrols near the planned meeting
site.
	   The congressional committee, known as Cocopa, had planned to
meet the rebels this weekend in La Realidad, a hamlet in the
Lacandon jungle where Zapatistas previously have made several
public appearances.
	   ``Great military columns have impeded the leadership of the
Zapatista National Liberation Army to come near the town, and it
will therefore be impossible to meet,'' Zapatista leader
Subcomandante Marcos said in a written statement.
	   Marcos suggested the legislators instead meet the rebels on Nov.
20 and 22 in San Cristobal de las Casas, where the Zapatistas
previously had scheduled a meeting ``with civic society.''
	   Since Oct. 25, Marcos said a column of 40 artillery vehicles had
been making two daily patrols in La Realidad.
	   He accused the army of looking for ways to extend military
activity in the state and claimed they received extra pay if they
``follow, harass and threaten indigenous people.''
	   The military had no immediate comment on Marcos' statements.
	   The Zapatista rebels rose briefly in arms in 1994, demanding
democracy and better conditions for the impoverished indigenous
population of Chiapas.
	   Peace talks between the government and the rebels have been
stalled since 1996, when President Ernesto Zedillo's administration
refused to honor a partial peace accord signed by government
representatives.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Yugoslav striker Rade Bogdanovic
scored his second goal in as many games to salvage a 1-1 draw for
Werder Bremen against Borussia Dortmund in a Bundesliga match
Friday.
	   In another game, Duisburg played to a 1-1 draw with Nuremberg at
home.
	   Bremen, still looking for its first home victory of the season,
fell behind in eighth minute when Dortmund's Lars Ricken picked up
a pass from Christian Nerlinger to score.
	   Bogdanovic got the equalizer in the 62nd.
	   In Duisburg, sweeper Thomas Vana scored in the 79th minute to
equalize for the home side after Heiko Gerber had used a mistake by
Duisburg goalkeeper Thomas Gill to put visiting Nuremberg in the
lead in the 24th minute.

10 years after dumping, noxious waste being returned to United
</HEADLINE>

	   GONAIVES, Haiti (AP) _ Bits of broken glass still glitter on the
wharf, more than 10 years after thousands of tons of noxious ash
and ground bottles from the United States were dumped on the
outskirts of this coastal city in Haiti.
	   Friday, after years of battling, Haiti started sending it back.
	   ``It's a victory for every developing country that developed
countries are tempted to use as a garbage dump,'' Gonaives Mayor
Edner Jean-Pierre said.
	   From 1986 to 1988, the cargo ship Khian Sea, loaded with glass
and ash from Philadelphia trash incinerators, went from port to
port in search of a dumping ground.
	   In December 1987, the Khian Sea unloaded 3,726 tons near
Gonaives port, 100 miles (170 kilometers) north of Port-au-Prince,
under an agreement paid to the military government.
	   The Haitian Collective for Environmental Protection and
Alternative Development claims the ash was highly toxic and killed
several handlers and much browsing livestock.
	   Greenpeace tested samples in 1995 and found the ash had
unusually high levels of cadmium, lead, copper and zinc that were
leaching into surrounding soil.
	   But tests by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1996
found no evidence of toxic substances. The United States had,
however, advised the government of Haiti not to accept the ash and
has disclaimed responsibility.
	   After years of negotiations, the city of Philadelphia agreed to
contribute dlrs 50,000 toward the dlrs 372,000 bill to finally
dispose of the ash. A U.S. company linked to the Khian Sea is
paying dlrs 100,000. The Haitian government is paying the rest.
	   The waste is supposed to be taken to Dorchester, in South
Carolina, but the state health department hasn't agreed to receive
it.
	   Nevertheless, workers clad in safety masks, gloves and jumpsuits
began Friday excavating the ash, which will be hauled away by a
ship in a few days.
	   Palmira Charles, who lives in the area, said dust from the ash
gave residents conjunctivitis and killed goats that grazed on grass
on the heaps. An uncle who helped unload the ash suffered from
respiratory problems for 10 years until he died last year, she
said.
	   Ministry of Environment representative Sener Daphinis said no
one who handled the waste ever died as a consequence.

Death toll rises to four dead, one missing in Swiss explosion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES that one of missing found safe, three bodies
recovered &QL; 
 &UR; By MARKUS BROTSCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The death toll rose Friday to four in
an explosion that destroyed a car dealership and an apartment
building in the Swiss capital of Bern, police said.
	   One other person was still unaccounted for and feared dead. But
another person reported as missing after the blast turned up safe
and sound, officials said. Some 18 people, including two children,
were injured.
	   City police said there was no evidence that the explosion
Thursday was deliberate.
	   The cause has yet to be determined, but it occured in the
basement, below the dealership's repair shop and gasoline pump,
said city prefect Sebastian Bentz. A tank with heating oil was in
the basement.
	   A corner of the building was blown away and the rest of the
structure was in danger of collapse, complicating rescue efforts,
police said.
	   Three of the bodies had been removed from the building late
Friday. At least one more was known to be inside. One of the
victims was identified as a client of the garage.
	   Eighty firefighters were hindered by clouds of dust as they
tried to recover the bodies.
	   The building will have to be demolished as soon as possible,
said Bentz.
	   The garage was owned by conservative Swiss lawmaker Walter Frey,
one of the country's biggest auto dealers.
	   Three years ago a a fire damaged another of his garages, with
suggestions at the time that it had been set by a political
opponent.
	   Insurance companies have estimated the cost of the damage at up
to 16 million francs (dlrs 11.5 million)

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain will ask Britain to extradite former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to face charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture, a government spokesman said Friday.
	   Chile responded by announcing it was recalling its ambassador,
Sergio Pizarro, from Madrid for consultations, prompting the
Spanish government to stress that its decision to seek extradition
was a legal obligation beyond its control.
	   The extradition request, approved at a weekly cabinet meeting,
had been sought by Judge Baltasar Garzon whose warrant led to the
arrest of 82-year-old Pinochet Oct. 16 in London as he recovered
from back surgery.
	   ``This was not a political decision, rather a legal
obligation,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued in
response to the Chilean protest.
	   Foreign Minister Abel Matutes had earlier told reporters that
the request would be before the British Home Office on Tuesday,
leaving Pinochet's fate in Britain's hands.
	   A five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords on Wednesday
began hearing an appeal of a High Court ruling that Pinochet's
detention was illegal because he is entitled to immunity as a
former head of state.
	   The hearing ... pick up 7th graf pvs.

Bidding starts on home run ball by Babe

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two years ago, a 9-year-old boy was astounded
when his great-grandmother mentioned she had a baseball signed by
Babe Ruth.
	   Two years later, that ball, believed to be the first home run
hit at Yankee Stadium 75 years ago, is for sale, after remaining in
a cardboard box in Viola Bevilacque's Irvington, New Jersey, attic
for nearly 50 years.
	   This is all very exciting to great-grandson Chris, now 11. Not
to mention his father, Mark Scala, who owns the ball and stands to
get most of the estimated dlrs 1 million it could fetch when it is
offered for sale Thursday.
	   The ball, which bears Ruth's signature and a dated inscription,
was all but forgotten until Chris dressed up as ``The Babe'' for a
school project. Mrs. Bevilaque told him she had a ball signed by
the Yankees slugger that was given to her late husband, Charles, as
a prize in 1927.
	   ``I loved going up in that attic,'' Mark Scala said at a news
conference Friday. ``I played there as a kid.''
	   The attic was full of clothes, lamps and furniture. And one very
important cardboard box that housed the Ruth-signed ball and three
other beat-up baseballs.
	   Scala did some research and eventually took the ball to his
lawyer. He later contacted Leland's, a sports memorabilia seller,
which used the ball's ``Reach'' logo, its alternating red and blue
stitching, and Ruth's own handwriting to determine its
authenticity.
	   Now Mark Scala, saying he has to think about his family's future
and the education of his two children, has put the ball up for sale
with Leland's.
	   Peter Clark, curator of collections at the Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, N.Y., said he had not seen the ball and could not
vouch for its authenticity.
	   ``We would have to do some investigation on our own,'' he said,
adding such a procedure normally is not done unless the memorabilia
is donated to the Hall of Fame.
	   Bidding on the Ruth ball is already open by telephone, fax and
e-mail, but the ball won't actually be sold to the highest bidder
until Thursday.

U.S. defeated for seat on key U.N. budget committee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States was defeated in its bid
for a seat on the powerful U.N. budget committee Friday, apparently
because Washington still owes the United Nations dlrs 1.3 billion
in back dues.
	   It was the second consecutive defeat for the United States,
which had been on the budget committee for nearly 50 years before
it was ousted in the last vote, in 1996.
	   ``We definitely thought we deserved to have a seat,'' said
deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh. ``Being the major
contributor to the United Nations ... we had hoped and expected
that we would be elected.''
	   But the United States and Germany lost to Britain and Italy in a
four-way contest for two seats on the Advisory Committee on
Administrative and Budgetary Questions, which sets policy for the
U.N. budget, expenditures and personnel.
	   The committee, known throughout the United Nations by its
initials ACABQ, also helps to set priorities for the whole U.N.
system as well as standards of administration and management.
	   Burleigh said other members told him ``that the fact of the
arrears was the major motivating factor in their vote.''
	   The United States paid an additional dlrs 197 million of its
regular 1998 dues on Wednesday, the minimum needed to avoid the
loss of its vote in the General Assembly.
	   The United States would not have lost its vote in the more
important U.N. Security Council, whose resolutions are legally
binding, unlike those in the assembly. But Washington has suffered
a loss of international prestige by its refusal to pay its arrears.
	   Burleigh said the United States campaigned for a seat on the
committee, arguing that it pays about dlrs 2 billion annually to
the U.N. system as a whole, the largest contribution of any
country.
	   But Washington is also the biggest delinquent.
	   The Republican-controlled U.S. Congress has balked at paying
arrears until the United Nations makes sweeping reforms that
include streamlining the organization. The United Nations contends
that those reforms have largely been implemented.
	   Burleigh wouldn't predict the reaction in Congress to Friday's
defeat.
	   ``I'm sorry about the result but we're here. The U.N. is an
important part of our foreign policy, so we'll keep plugging away
at this,'' he said.

	   The approval by the Spanish Cabinet leaves Pinochet's legal fate
in the hands of Britain, where the former general was arrested on a
Spanish warrant Oct. 16.
	   The English High Court ruled that Pinochet's arrest was illegal
because he is entitled to immunity as a former head of state. A
five-judge panel from Britain's House of Lords is hearing an
appeal.
	   Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, speaking after a Cabinet
meeting, said he expected the extradition request to reach British
Home Secretary Jack Straw on Tuesday.
	   In Santiago, the Chilean capital, Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza said Chile's ambassador to Spain, Sergio Pizarro, would be
withdrawn immediately. He added, however, that diplomatic ties with
Madrid would not be broken or suspended.
	   The Spanish government said politics played no role in its
decision to allow the extradition effort to proceed. ``This was not
a political decision, rather a legal obligation,'' the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement after Chile's announcement.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A woman who posed for seven years
as the mother of a girl who disappeared in California attempted
suicide Friday, hours after finding the lifeless body of the man
who lived with her, police said.
	   The series of events began when Nilza Gierbolini arrived at her
home in Carolina, a suburb of San Juan, and found the body of
Rafael Salort Bello, 41, who shared the residence with her. Police
said Salort was bleeding from the nose and mouth and the house
appeared ransacked, but the body showed no other signs of a
struggle.
	   Friday morning, police said Gierbolini produced a gun and fired
one shot in what police described as a suicide attempt thwarted by
a social worker who on the scene. Gierbolini was charged with
attempted suicide, police said.
	   Gierbolini was given a six-year suspended sentence in April for
falsifying a birth certificate of Crystal Leann Anzaldi, a girl who
disappeared from her home in San Diego in 1990 when she was 15
months old.
	   Gierbolini denied knowing that the girl had been reported
kidnapped. She said she was told by an acquaintance that the girl's
parents had died and she decided to return to Puerto Rico and raise
the girl as her own.
	   A grand jury in California investigated the case but no further
charges have been filed.
	   The girl is now in the custody of her father.

Unknown Edward Fryatt has two-stroke lead after second round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM SALADINO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASELTON, Georgia (AP) _ He was a no-name until this week. No
more. Suddenly, Edward Fryatt is the center of attention.
	   The 27-year-old Fryatt, who had a dozen people _ mostly friends
and family _ following him Friday, shot a second consecutive
5-under-par 67 for a 134 total after the second round of the
Sarazen World Open.
	   He had a two-stroke lead over first-round leader Bob Tway, who
shot a 70. Another stroke back was Ricardo Gonzalez of Argentina
and Scotland's Andrew Coltart. Both had 68s.
	   At 140 was a group that included PGA players Stewart Cink and
Bob Friend, Peter O'Malley of Australia, Greg Turner of New Zealand
and two-time Masters champion Bernard Langer of Germany. Cink had a
68, Friend a 66, O'Malley a 67 and Turner and Langer each had 72s.
	   John Huston and Craig Stadler led a large group at 141. Both
shot 71s.
	   ``Sure, it's a nice surprise, but it's not shocking. Golf is
still golf and if you're playing good, it doesn't matter who you're
playing against,'' Fryatt said of his bid for the dlrs 360,000
first prize in the dlrs 2 million tournament sponsored by Subaru.
	   Pressure?
	   ``None. The thing about it is nobody knows who I am,'' Fryatt
said following his round over the par-72 Legends course at Chateau
Elan in the northeast Atlanta suburb.
	   ``You guys didn't know who I was until this week. If there's any
pressure, it's on the (PGA) tour guys to do well,'' said Fryatt,
who has had some succcess in three years on the Asian tour, winning
five times.
	   There, too, he was not a household name.
	   ``My wife is my only following in Asia,'' Fryatt said.
	   The weekend, however, will find Fryatt in the spotlight with a
large gallery following his every move.
	   ``I don't think it will affect me. I'm just going to enjoy
myself,'' he said.
	   Defending champion Mark Calcavecchia shot a 74 and was far back
at 146, as was Payne Stewart after a 75.
	   Two-time winner Frank Nobilo (1995-96) barely made the cut of
148. He shot a 72 after an opening-round 76 in this event that
brings together the past two champions from open tourneys around
the world as well as several Sarazen selections.
	   Failing to make the cut was Tom Kite, who had a 75 for 149.
	   Fryatt, a graduate of UNLV who was born in England before moving
to Las Vegas 22 years ago with his family, has won twice this year
on the Asian tour _ the China Open and the Malaysian Open. In three
years in Asia, he has won about dlrs 500,000.
	   He recorded four birdies in his first five holes then made only
one more birdie _ on No. 14 _ without a bogey the rest of the way.
	   ``It's kind of nice to shoot two 67s and not really have hit it
great,'' Fryatt said. ``I've been fortunate that the putting has
been really hot.''
	   His goal, however, is to make it onto the PGA Tour, where he has
failed in four attempts at qualifying school. He did make it to the
Nike tour in 1995, but made only nine cuts and earned dlrs 23,347.
	   He'll get his fifth chance Nov. 17-23 at PGA West in Palm
Springs, California in the final round of the PGA Qualifying
school. He made it through the second round last week in Florence,
South Carolina to at least qualify for the Nike tour next season.

Holyfield-Lewis bout headed for Toronto or New York
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Canada is bidding dlrs 10 million to stage an
Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight title fight in the
SkyDome. The problem is that the money is in Canadian dollars.
	   Translated into American dollars, the Canadian offer is about
dlrs 6.5 million, about dlrs 1.5 million shy of what promoter Don
King is asking and well off the dlrs 8.3 million bid of New York's
Madison Square Garden.
	   Despite the dollar difference, the Toronto offer hasn't been
dismissed.
	   ``We've offered a good package, and now we're getting down to
the brass tacks of our negotiations,'' said Martin Porter, head of
marketing for Canadian Major Events.
	   Lewis and CME are to meet Monday with representatives for
Holyfield and HBO to discuss the offer.
	   Adrian Teodorescu, Lewis' former coach and a member of CME, says
Lewis is interested in fighting in Canada.
	   ``Lennox would definitely like to have a fight here in Canada
where he is loved and where he brought home the (1988 Olympic) gold
medal,'' he said. ``Lennox wants to revitalize boxing in Canada.''
	   Officials at Madison Square Garden refused to comment on
negotiations for the bout.
	   Las Vegas also was in the bidding for the fight, but dropped out
last week to concentrate on organizing Mike Tyson's comeback bout,
tentatively scheduled for Jan.16.
	   The Holyfield-Lewis bout would be staged March 13, with
organizers hoping to draw 67,000 at prices ranging from dlrs 55 to
dlrs 1,500 Canadian, or dlrs 36 to dlrs 975 American.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Congress has passed a bill erasing the
criminal records of more than 400 people who were deemed wrongly
convicted of terrorism and freed by presidential pardons.
	   The legislation was a longtime demand of human rights groups.
Though they are free, the former inmates in many cases have had
trouble securing jobs because of their criminal records.
	   The bill, approved late Thursday, also ends all legal
proceedings against the former prisoners, but does not offer them
financial compensation. President Alberto Fujimori was expected to
sign it into law.
	   Congressman Alva Orlandini said the measure did not go far
enough, and that the former prisoners deserved financial
compensation as well.
	   Since mid-1996, Fujimori has pardoned 438 innocent people
imprisoned for terrorism or treason upon the recommendation of a
government commission, which determined the people were convicted
on inadequate evidence and should be freed.
	   Many had spent more than five years in prison.
	   Human rights groups say there are 3,900 people convicted of
terrorism or treason in Peru's prisons, and that hundreds may be
innocent, unfairly convicted by secretive military courts formed by
Fujimori as a legal weapon to fight powerful guerrilla armies.
	   These summary military courts denied suspected rebels a fair
defense, human rights groups say.
	   Peru's war against leftist rebels has left 30,000 dead since
1980, but the level of political violence has fallen sharply in the
past six years following the capture of top rebel leaders.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A woman who posed for seven years
as the mother of a girl who disappeared in California was arrested
on weapons charges Friday after what may have been a suicide
attempt, police said.
	   The series of events began when Gierbolini arrived at her home
in Carolina, a suburb of San Juan, and found the body of Rafael
Salort Bello, 41, who shared the residence with her. Police said
Salort was bleeding from the nose and mouth and the house appeared
ransacked, but the body showed no other signs of a struggle.
	   Friday morning, police said Gierbolini produced a gun and fired
one shot in what police described as a suicide attempt thwarted by
an official who was on the scene. Gierbolini was detained and the
gun was seized, police said.
	   Gierbolini was given a six-year suspended sentence in April for
falsifying a birth certificate of Crystal Leann Anzaldi, a girl who
disappeared from her home in San Diego in 1990 when she was 15
months old.
	   The girl is now in the custody of her father.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil will send food, medicine and
field tents to survivors of the hurricane that has ravaged much of
Central America, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Central American embassies and consulates have opened
special bank accounts where Brazilians can donate money.
	   Hermano Ribeiro, head of the Foreign Ministry's Central American
Department said President Fernando Henrique Cardoso sent ``messages
of solidarity'' to his Central American colleagues ``offering as
much help as possible.''
	   ``The situation is dramatic and help will be sent as quickly as
possible,'' Ribeiro said.

Bacher, Lloyd meet informally with players; no settlement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with no settlement; talks to resume Saturday &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ There looks like no quick solution to the pay
dispute that threatens to wipe out the West Indies historic cricket
tour of South Africa.
	   Informal talks Friday with officials and players ended with no
indication of progress. Official talks with the disgruntled West
Indians was expected to begin Saturday at a London hotel near
Heathrow airport.
	   Ali Bacher, managing director of the South Africa cricket board,
traveled to London Friday accompanied by Clive Lloyd, manager of
the the West Indies touring squad, and West Indies Cricket Board
member Joel Garner.
	   Bacher said he was hopeful a letter he delivered from President
Nelson Mandela could break the deadlock. Mandela stressed his hope
that the West Indies can go ahead with its first official tour of
South Africa since the end of apartheid.
	   ``I can't see everything being resolved before Sunday,'' Bacher
told the South African Press Association. ``I'm hoping it will
be.''
	   The three met informally Friday with West Indies players, who
are battling with the WICB over pay and security on the three-month
tour.
	   The WICB on Wednesday fired captain Brian Lara and vice-captain
Carl Hooper after they refused to travel to South Africa.
	   ``I'm sure the letter from the president will have a great
impression on the West Indies players,'' Bacher said. ``They know
him to be a man of great integrity and one of the great statesmen
of the century.''
	   ``One is confident of a result to the impasse,'' he added. ``I'm
sure the people in Caribbean and South Africa and world cricket in
general will see it as important that the tour goes ahead.''
	   The first match of the tour is scheduled to begin next Tuesday.
The first Test is scheduled for Nov. 26.
	   The tour is considered crucial in promoting the game among South
African blacks in a country where whites run the sport.
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher said.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   The WICB said it would fine the no-show players between 5 and 10
percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs 60,000
for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide player support. Only seven of the 16
members of the squad traveled to South Africa, and all seven have
since flown to London to rally around Lara.
	   On Friday, Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll joined calls for
the WICB to be fired. ``The members of the board should be fired,''
he declared. ``This is not simply a matter of cricket and the board
cannot be allowed to treat the players in such a manner.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, rated the world's best batsman, hinted Thursday the tour
might go on if a compromise can be reached.
	   ``What has resulted so far is a bit unfortunate and I hope it
can be resolved in the near future,'' he said. ``The main thing is
that the West Indies tour to South Africa should be on. The people
want the tour to be on and hopefully something positive will come
out of it (in the meeting).
	   ``I am not a member of the West Indies cricket team at the
moment, but I would love to be there. My life is playing cricket.
When it is possible you could be there and you are not there
because of circumstances _ as in this case _ it is very
unfortunate.''
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

Irwin stumbles a bit, Floyd rises in Senior Tour Championship
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina (AP) _ Hale Irwin's troubles in the
Senior Tour Championships continued Friday as he shot a 73 and fell
two strokes behind Ray Floyd midway through the season-ending
event.
	   Floyd, the 1994 champion, birdied the last three holes for a 68
and a two-day total of 7-under-par 137. Jim Albus, who lost to
Floyd in a five-hole playoff four years ago, also shot 68 to tie
Irwin at 139.
	   Irwin, the Senior PGA Tour's runaway star since joining in 1995,
has led at The Dunes Golf and Beach Club the past three
tournaments, including this one with an opening 66. But something
always dropped him back in virtually the only major senior event
he's never won.
	   ``Boy, the way I played today, it could have been just about any
big score,'' he said.
	   And Irwin always seems to post a few here. In 1995, it was a
third-round 75. A year later, he followed a first-round 67 with a
75. Last year, Irwin was two behind eventual champion Gil Morgan in
the final round, but struggled to a 71.
	   This time, Irwin's shaky putter cost him. He had increased his
lead to three shots with a birdie on No. 8, but made bogeys on
three of the next four holes.
	   He slid a 10-footer (3 meters) by on the ninth hole and missed
an 8-foot (2.4-meter) par putt on No. 11. By the time Irwin botched
a 10-foot (3-meter) par try on the 11th, Floyd and Albus had moved
past.
	   ``You're going to have these rounds,'' Irwin said. ``It just
seems like they are glaring after so many good rounds. The lesser
ones just stand out so strongly that it's kind of hard to forget
that it's just a round of golf.''
	   Floyd used a 5-wood to roll in a birdie on the 16th, then closed
with two birdie putts on Nos. 17 and 18. ``I haven't put two rounds
in the 60s back-to-back in a while, but in my defense, I don't
recall much anymore,'' the 56-year-old Floyd said.
	   He took August and September off and felt rejuvenated coming
into what he considers the best course on the Senior PGA Tour.
``The routine got to be so monotonous, you forget what you have to
do to be a good player,'' he said.
	   He spent his time in Southampton, New York where he played dlrs
5 Nassaus with friends and sometimes didn't even pick up a club.
``It was wonderful,'' he said. ``I feel like my attitude in here
was really good.''
	   Albus missed the past two Senior Tour Championships as he
recovered from neck surgery and elbow injuries since 1996. Now he
feels more confident his game is close to its 1994 level, when he
won twice and earned more than dlrs 1.2 million. ``When I was doing
well, it just seemed so easy,'' said Albus, whose round included an
eagle at the par-5 fourth hole. ``Now, maybe I can appreciate it
because I'm not here so often.''
	   Morgan had his second straight 70 and was three shots behind
Floyd.

	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Mark O'Meara put on a green jacket and
took home a claret jug. David Duval won four times and more money
than anyone, while Tiger Woods hardly won at all. Seven players in
their 40s won on the PGA Tour this year and 26 players won over
dlrs 1 million.
	   Strangely, Greg Norman wasn't part of any of it.
	   He had won at least once each season since 1992, the longest
streak on tour, but played only eight rounds in three tournaments
this year and finished 235th on the money list.
	   He had been a factor _ or at least a favorite _ in the major
championships for the past 15 years. That ended the day he decided
to have shoulder surgery and sit out the rest of the season,
including the last three majors.
	   He went 147 days without touching a club, and it will be seven
months between tournaments when Norman returns in his own Shark
Shootout on Thursday. Given his impact on golf the past two
decades, it seems much longer.
	   ``Have things changed since he's been gone? I don't think they
have,'' Woods said. ``It's not like he's been out of golf for five
to 10 years, and we went from wood to metal.''
	   Indeed, golf survived just fine without Norman. But it hasn't
seen the last of the Great White Shark.
	   For the first time since his final putt fell in the Masters,
Norman will tee it up in the Franklin Templeton Shark Shootout, a
three-day team event in Thousand Oaks, California that embodies the
silly season _ everyone has a good time, no one remembers a week
later who won.
	   But it won't be all fun and games for Norman.
	   Instead, it will be the first step toward finding out whether
his left shoulder _ and his desire _ will allow him to return to
the top of his game.
	   ``To go back and be No. 1? If I don't, I'm not going to be
bothered about it,'' Norman said. ``As long as I go back and start
winning, and playing at the level I want, I'll be a happy camper.''
	   But Norman is rarely satisfied with anything but No. 1, a
position he held in the world rankings longer than any other player
of his generation. From 1983 until his shoulder surgery on April
22, Norman was never ranked lower than No. 7, including a record 96
consecutive weeks at the top. Seven months off has dropped him to
No. 13.
	   His record is defined as much by victories as the number of
times he put himself into contention: two wins at the British Open,
eight times a runner-up and the only man to lose all four majors in
a playoff. He has 18 victories on the PGA Tour and has been in the
top 10 an amazing 51 percent of the time since he joined the tour
in 1984.
	   At 43, Norman believes he still has another major or more left
in him. Much of that will depend on how well his left shoulder
responds. He said it's definitely stronger now: ``It's my
25-year-old shoulder, and my right is my 43-year-old shoulder.''
	   Norman says he didn't miss the game during his longest hiatus
from golf since he was a teen-ager. For the first time since his
children were born, he didn't drag them across the world during his
summer pursuit of victory, but followed them on vacations.
	   ``I got my life back in terms of sheer privacy, and I really
enjoyed that,'' he said. ``I enjoyed being away from the grind I
had been stuck in for 20 years.''
	   Norman did manage to win this year, his own Greg Norman Holden
International in Australia in February, giving him at least one
victory every year since 1976, except in 1991.
	   But he missed the cut at Doral, then withdrew from The Players
Championship when the pain in his shoulder intensified. He gave it
one last try at the Masters but struggled and missed the cut. He
had surgery 12 days later.
	   What kind of Norman will emerge is unclear. The last time he was
off the map was in 1991.
	   ``It's two totally different approaches,'' Norman said. ``Seven
years ago, I was burned out mentally and physically. This is an
injury period. I know I'm going to come back physically stronger.
I've gotten myself into a position I haven't been in since the
early '80s.''
	   And Norman is nothing if not resilient.
	   ``I would never expect Norman to play poorly,'' Jack Nicklaus
said. ``Greg is a hard worker.''
	   Norman will be paired with fellow Aussie Steve Elkington in the
Shark Shootout. He'll also play in the Skins Game on Thanksgiving
weekend before going over for the Australian Open, the tune-up for
his first major test _ the Presidents Cup.
	   ``I think he'll come back with a bang,'' said two-time U.S. Open
champion Ernie Els. ``Who knows? That injury might have been good
in a way. When you play at that level for 20-odd years, maybe your
body needs a break.''
	   The break is over. Norman gets back to work on Thursday.

	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The death toll rose Friday to four from
an explosion that destroyed a car dealership and an apartment
building in the Swiss capital of Bern, police said.
	   One person was missing and feared dead. Eighteen people,
including two children, were injured in the explosion Thursday. One
person originally reported missing turned up safe, officials said.
	   The cause has not been determined. City police say there is no
evidence the basement explosion was deliberate.
	   A corner of the structure, which had a car-repair garage on the
ground floor and apartments above, was blown away and the rest was
in danger of collapse _ complicating rescue efforts, police said.
	   Only two bodies had been removed from the building by this
afternoon. One was identified as a client of the garage.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two years ago, a 9-year-old boy was astounded
when his great-grandmother mentioned she had a baseball signed by
Babe Ruth.
	   But that wasn't all _ she said it was the first home run ever
hit at Yankee Stadium. So, it was researched, authenticated and is
now up for sale.
	   It could fetch an estimated dlrs 1 million when auctioned
Thursday. Not bad for 5.4 ounces of horsehide and twine that's been
in a cardboard box in Viola Bevilacque's Irvington, New Jersey,
attic for nearly 50 years.
	   This is all very exciting to great-grandson Chris, now 11. Not
to mention his father, Mark Scala, who owns the ball and stands to
get most of the money.
	   The ball, which bears Ruth's signature and the inscription
``First Home Run Hit At Yankee Stadium April 18, 1923,'' was all
but forgotten until Chris dressed up as ``The Babe'' for a school
project.
	   Mrs. Bevilaque told him she had a ball signed by the Yankees
slugger that was given to her late husband, Charles, as a prize in
1927. No one knows for sure who caught the ball.
	   ``I loved going up in that attic,'' Mark Scala said at a news
conference Friday. ``I played there as a kid.''
	   The attic was full of clothes, lamps and furniture. And one very
important cardboard box that housed the Ruth-signed ball and three
other beat-up baseballs.
	   Scala did some research and eventually took the ball to his
lawyer. He later contacted Leland's, a sports memorabilia seller,
which used the ball's ``Reach'' logo, its alternating red and blue
stitching, and Ruth's own handwriting to determine its
authenticity.
	   Now Mark Scala, saying he has to think about his family's future
and the education of his two children, has put the ball up for sale
with Leland's.
	   Peter Clark, curator of collections at the Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, New York said he had not seen the ball and could
not vouch for its authenticity.
	   ``We would have to do some investigation on our own,'' he said,
adding such a procedure normally is not done unless the memorabilia
is donated to the Hall of Fame.
	   Bidding on the Ruth ball is already open by telephone, fax and
e-mail, but the ball won't actually be sold to the highest bidder
until Thursday.

Stern and Hunter meet

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ National Basketball Association commissioner
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter held an unexpected 1
1/2-hour meeting today on the 129th day of the lockout.
	   With progress moving at a glacial pace and the sides apparently
dug in for the long haul, there were more questions than answers:
	   Among the mysteries:
	   _ Is Stern bluffing when he says he'll cancel the season?
	   _ Is Hunter being held back by David Falk?
	   _ When is the ``drop-date'' date for saving the 1998-99 season?
	   _ When will it end?
	   ``We're just worlds apart, and National Basketball Association
players are losing on average dlrs 14 million per game,'' Stern
said Thursday.
	   ``When the owners show some willingness to engage in compromise
... we'll be glad to recommend the deal to our players,'' Hunter
said.
	   There was no immediate word on the subject of today's meeting or
when Stern and Hunter will meet again.
	   The sides remain far apart on both the framework for a deal and
the percentage of revenue owners will be devoting to salaries. The
players, who received 57 percent last season, are asking for 60
percent. The owners, who wanted to pay no more than 51.8 percent
last season, want the percentage scaled back to 50 percent.
	   The compromise would seem to be 55 percent, yet Stern
practically recoiled in disgust when it was suggested that the
sides simply meet in the middle.
	   Pointing out that the old deal didn't work for the owners at 52
percent, Stern said it will be hard to get him to budge.
	   ``If the question is whether to close things out the players
could squeeze me to pay a little more than 50 percent, first get me
to the close-out of the negotiations,'' he said. ``But we're
nowhere near that.''
	   Hunter had no answer when asked what was wrong with 55 percent,
but he has said in the past that the players shouldn't accept less
than what they are currently getting, especially in light of the
other concessions the union has made _ lengthened rookie scale,
possible decrease in cap growth, luxury tax and escrow tax.
	   Stern is threatening to cancel the season, but Hunter and
several agents think the commissioner is bluffing and will do a
deal at the last possible moment, whenever that is.
	   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik have refused to give
an exact ``drop dead'' date, but Granik said recently that it would
be somewhere in mid-December.
	   So if an agreement was reached Dec. 20, for example, the season
could start Jan. 14. Each team would have only 50 games left, but
an additional six could be squeezed in if the All-Star game was
canceled and an extra week was added on to the end of the regular
season. That would allow for a 56-game schedule in which each team
played every other team twice.
	   Stern has charged agents like Falk, who represent the
highest-salaried players, with slowing the process. Hunter
responded by saying Stern was trying to divide the union and
insisting that himself and union president Patrick Ewing have been
in charge of the negotiations since Day 1.

Colombia's troop pullout inaugurates a bold gamble for peace

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In a bold gamble for peace, Colombia's
president on Saturday will complete the evacuation of all
government troops from a southern guerrilla stronghold the size of
Switzerland.
	   The 90-day pullout _ meant to facilitate peace talks with the
rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia _ is the boldest
government concession yet in efforts to end a 34-year armed
conflict that has bound this nation rich in talent and resources
like a straightjacket.
	   President Andres Pastrana hopes to build confidence and spark
serious negotiations, but critics say he is being naive, giving
away too much too soon to a dangerous opponent that has yet to
prove itself ready for reconciliation.
	   Those fears grew this week when the rebels, known by their
Spanish initials as the FARC, seized a remote state capital for
three days in one of their largest attacks ever. About 1,400
guerrillas overran Mitu, in southeastern Vaupes state, leveling its
police barracks, killing at least 50 people and taking as many as
70 police officers captive.
	   The attack dampened expectations raised in July when Pastrana
met with Manuel Marulanda, the FARC's 68-year-old commander, at a
jungle hideout.
	   ``All (the rebels) are doing is giving reasons and more
arguments to those who oppose peace,'' Pastrana said Thursday while
touring Mitu, 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of the withdrawal
zone.
	   While some feel the guerrillas are just flexing their muscles _
hoping to strengthen their hand in the talks set to begin by
December _ others fear the rebels are gathering pawns in a
real-life chess game for power.
	   ``I don't see any reasons to be optimistic,'' said political
analyst Rafael Nieto. ``It's an insurgency that's self-reliant,
very wealthy, militarily effective ... and popular in the regions
it controls. What does a guerrilla group like the FARC gain from
negotiating?''
	   Many observers believe the FARC's goal is to use its military
might to one day force the partitioning of the country, splitting
off the south as an independent, rebel-run republic. Pastrana has
said the government would never agree to such a demand.
	   ``The state is giving away everything in return for nothing,''
said former Gen. Harold Bedoya, who was fired as armed forces
commander in 1997 after openly criticizing concessions to the FARC
by former President Ernesto Samper.
	   Bedoya says the guerrillas, who tax peasant coca production and
protect cocaine traffickers' airstrips and laboratories, will use
the pullout to deepen those ties while strengthening their hold on
Colombia's south.
	   Government officials say they're willing to discuss a 10-point
plan drafted by the FARC in 1996 to clean up Colombia's politics
and redistribute wealth.
	   But Marulanda's main request is to swap 452 guerrillas in
government jails for the estimated 300 soldiers and police now held
by the FARC. Critics say Pastrana, who hasn't given an answer,
would be replenishing the rebels with hardened fighters and
talented political cadres.
	   The government did not press for a cease-fire as a condition for
negotiations, and Marulanda told the federal ombudsman last week
that the FARC will continue military action ``with all intensity''
outside the pullout zone.
	   ``Peace has a cost,'' presidential peace commissioner Victor G.
Ricardo told a news conference Friday at which the envoy announced
a comission of respected Colombian and international observers will
help monitor both sides' actions.
	   Inside the 16,200 square-mile (42,000-square-kilometer) swath of
foothills and savannahs the army is quitting, residents have
already taken precautions.
	   Fearing pillaging by rebels who will soon be outright masters of
territory they long dominated quietly, ranchers have trucked out
cattle, depositors are closing bank accounts and some homeowners
are looking to sell.
	   The envoy, Ricardo, said local residents will be deputized as
temporary police, although he did not say whether they would carry
arms.
	   In San Vicente de Caguan, the most strategic of five
municipalities to be cleared of government forces, the last of some
2,000 anti-guerrilla troops were airlifted to a base 30 miles away
on Friday.
	   White flags hung over doorways, and officials planted ``peace''
trees in the town square.
	   ``This might be the last chance we have to find reconciliation
between Colombians, '' said the mayor, Omar Garcia.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Suicide bombers targeted a crowded open-air
market Friday, setting off blasts that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 shoppers and passersby and prompted the Israeli Cabinet
to put off action on the new peace accord. The radical Islamic
group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, the second
suicide bombing since the signing of the land-for-security accord
two weeks ago. But Palestinian security officials said members of
the militant Islamic Jihad group carried out the attack. The
officials identified one assailant as Yusef Ali Mohammed Zughayar,
18, of a refugee camp under Israeli control. Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat appeared on Israel TV to condemn the bombing as
``criminal,'' and pledged full efforts to track down those
responsible. (ISRAEL-EXPLOSION)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The top lawmaker in the House of
Representatives, Newt Gingrich, told associates that he intends to
give up his bid for a third term as House speaker in the wake of
Republican losses in this week's elections, a Republican source
said Friday. Rep. Bob Livingston, chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, launched a bid to topple Gingrich earlier
in the day. Other Republicans were considering whether to declare
their own candidacies. Gingrich has flirted with resigning as
speaker in the past when he has been buffeted by political setbacks
and crises, including the politically disastrous government
shutdown in 1995, when President Clinton and the conservative-led
Congress could not agree on a federal budget. (US-REPUBLICAN
TURMOIL)
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain announced Friday it would allow
prosecutors to seek former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet's
extradition from Britain. Chile immediately protested the move by
recalling its ambassador from Spain. The approval by the Spanish
Cabinet leaves Pinochet's legal fate in the hands of Britain, where
the former general was arrested on a Spanish warrant Oct. 16. The
English High Court ruled that Pinochet's arrest was illegal because
he is entitled to immunity as a former head of state. A five-judge
panel from Britain's House of Lords is hearing an appeal. Spanish
Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, speaking after a Cabinet meeting,
said he expected the extradition request to reach British Home
Secretary Jack Straw on Tuesday. (SPAIN-PINOCHET)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In the worst violence in Kosovo
since a peace accord was reached last month, five suspected ethnic
Albanian guerrillas died Friday in a shootout with Serb police,
according to a Serb media statement. Details provided by the Serb
Media Center, a mouthpiece for Serb authorities, could not be
immediately confirmed. But previous statements about similar
violence have accurately reported the number of casualties. The
deaths raised the number of ethnic Albanians killed since Thursday
afternoon to seven and reflected a surge in violence as the United
States and European nations try to push ahead with the Oct. 12
political agreement reached with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. Foreign observers in Kosovo say attacks by both Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas have increased this week.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Anger grew over the slow pace of
relief and survivors of Central America's worst disaster in memory
pleaded for help Friday in the devastated countryside, where
doctors rationed out slim medical supplies to sick and injured
refugees. Though tons of aid was arriving from across the world for
victims of last week's Hurricane Mitch, the region's fractured road
system and limited air transportation forced many to continue
waiting. The devastation has overwhelmed Central America, where
officials say more than 10,000 people died in flooding and
mudslides. Honduras said 569,000 were homeless and about 1 million
others lost loved ones or property. Nicaragua said more than
750,000 of its people had been affected. (MITCH)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks ended higher Friday, withstanding
pressures to take profits from a rally that's lifted the Dow back
toward 9,000 and a potential run at record highs. According to
preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
59.999, or 0.67 percent, to 8,975.46, about 362 points from the
all-time best close of 9,337.97 set on July 17. The Dow came within
10 points of 9,000 before backing down Broader stock indicators
also moved toward the highest levels since before the market began
its rapid retreat in late July. Stocks have now endured eight
sessions without a loss. The renewed confidence in stocks was
evident as investors pulled money out of the bond market Friday.
The new benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 7/16 point, or dlrs 14.38 per
dlrs 1,000 invested. Its yield rose to 5.38 percent. (US-CLOSING
STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's cash-starved government scored three
successes Friday: a dlrs 800 million loan offer from Japan, an
agreement on U.S. food aid and a deal with foreign creditors on
treasury bill debt that Russia froze in August. While Russia still
has a long way to go to cure its economic malaise, Friday's deals
were welcome news after nearly three months of uncertainty. The
Japanese money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund over the summer but put
on hold after the August devaluation and default. Also Friday, U.S.
and Russian officials signed an agreement on a dlrs 625 million aid
package for 3.1 million tons of U.S. food. And in talks in London,
several of the largest foreign creditors agreed to accept
ruble-denominated paper in compensation for the treasury bills,
Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United States on Friday formally accepted a
ruling by the World Trade Organization that its restrictions on
imported shrimp violate free trade _ but left open whether and how
it would change its laws. U.S. trade ambassador Rita Hayes said the
U.S. administration would advise the WTO what it will do within the
required 30 days. At issue is a U.S. embargo on shrimp imports from
India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand, which use trawling nets
that trap endangered sea turtles. Environmentalists say failure to
equip shrimp nets with turtle-excluder devices costing dlrs 75
causes the death of 150,000 turtles a year worldwide. A WTO appeals
body last month upheld the findings of an expert panel report that
the U.S. rules amounted to ``arbitrary and unjustifiable
discrimination.'' (WTO-TURTLE RULING)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Although calm is returning, the crisis in the
world financial system is not over yet, the head of the
International Monetary Fund said Friday. Michel Camdessus praised
Latin American countries for trying to defend themselves against
the turmoil in global financial markets and said there were
promising signs of recovery in Asia, where the crisis began 16
months ago. Camdessus urged countries to use the crisis to make
fundamental economic reforms and avert a recession. He said, ``Even
if, in the past few weeks, an air of calm has begun to return to
global markets, we could argue that the crisis in the functioning
of the global financial system is not over yet, and that we now
have a better opportunity to press ahead with fundamental reform.''
(IMF-CAMDESSUS)
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Arab states should strengthen their
financial institutions and monitor their banks in order to avoid an
Asian-style crash, bankers said here Friday. A two-day banking
conference wound up by calling on Arab states to learn from the
Asian crisis and to develop their financial markets and
institutions and improve their surveillance of banks. The
conference also recommended that Arab countries ``adopt a cautious
approach in opening up to the outside world,'' Lebanon's official
National News Agency reported. (LEBANON-BANKING CONFERENCE)
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norsk Hydro ASA concern announced plans
Friday to build a hydrogen-burning power plant that it says will
produce electricity with virtually no climate-damaging emissions.
The 51-percent state-owned company notified the Norwegian Water
Resources and Energy Directorate of plans to build the plant, to be
called HydroKraft, pending approval by government agencies. The
company said that if it receives the proper approvals in 1999,
construction of the plant would be completed during 2002 and
production startup would occur in early 2003. (NORWAY-CLEAN POWER)

Samba superstar Chico Buarque releases first album in five years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Chico Buarque de Holanda, one of
Brazil's most popular singer-composers, is releasing his first
album in five years with new songs stressing the daily grind of
urban life.
	   ``Every time I return (to record), it's like learning all over
again,'' Buarque told reporters Friday.
	   Entitled ``As Cidades'' (The Cities), the CD includes 11 sambas
about ``ideal cities, ideal love affairs and an ideal and just
world,'' wrote Mauro Dias, music critic for the daily newspaper, O
Estado De Sao Paulo.
	   The 54-year-old Buarque has always championed social issues and
the downtrodden to the dismay of Brazilian leaders.
	   During the military dictatorship (1964-1985), his songs were
routinely censored and his records confiscated from stores. When
the military began rejecting two of every three songs the prolific
songwriter submitted to federal censors for public performances,
Buarque opted for exile in Italy.
	   Most recently, Buarque became embroiled in a public rift with
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso after the singer publicly
supported Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a rival socialist candidate,
in this year's general election. In response, Cardoso, who easily
won reelection, said he preferred the music of samba superstar
Caetano Veloso.
	   Yet Buarque remains a national idol.
	   His rare concert appearances are typically sold out and his
albums are bestsellers. At this year's carnival, Mangueira, Rio's
most traditional samba school, won first place after wowing Rio
crowds with an homage to Buarque.

Dodgers sign Devon White to three-year deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Devon White, a seven-time Gold Glove winner
and member of three World Series-winning teams, agreed Friday to a
dlrs 12.4 million, three-year contact with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   White, 35, became the first free agent to switch teams this
offseason and solved the Dodgers center fielder problem.
	   A switch-hitter, White played in 146 games for the Arizona
Diamondbacks this season and hit .279 with 84 runs, 32 doubles, one
triple, 22 homers, 85 RBIs and 22 stolen bases.
	   White, an All-Star this season, previously played for the
Anaheim Angels, Toronto Blue Jays and Florida Marlins. He played on
two World Series titlists with Toronto and on Florida's 1997
championship team.
	   White is currently in Japan with the major league all-stars, who
opened their exhibition tour Friday.
	   The signing of White came on the first day teams were allowed to
speak with free agents from other teams.
	   Barring further deals, White will be teamed with Gary Sheffield
and Raul Mondesi in the Los Angeles outfield next season. As part
of the contract, the Dodgers have an option for 2002 with a dlrs
400,000 buyout.

Militants pull out all stops to halt accord that targets militants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Explosion &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Islamic militants are pulling out all the stops
to keep the new U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace accord from
becoming reality.
	   In recent days, suicide-bombers have attacked an Israeli school
bus in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's outdoor market. Grenades were
hurled at a bus stop in the southern city of Beersheba.
	   But the failure of those attacks and others to inflict major
casualties marks a change from past terrorist spectacles and is an
indication that Israeli and Palestinian efforts may have already
weakened the militants.
	   In Friday's market attack, which was claimed by the largest
militant group Hamas, Israel radio quoted police as describing the
explosives as an ``amateur bomb'' contained in a suitcase. It
killed the two bombers and injured 21 Israelis.
	   Yaakov Perry, former head of the Israeli Shin Bet, told The
Associated Press that raids by Israeli agents and, in recent weeks,
by Palestinian security forces as well have led to the arrest of
key leaders and the killing of expert bomb makers.
	   ``There is a weakness both in the explosives used and the
engineers, the experts who can put together the bomb, and there is
also a problem in the quality of the terrorist themselves,'' he
said, adding recent attackers appeared poorly trained.
	   Abdel-Satter Qassem, a professor at An Najah University in the
West Bank town of Nablus who is familiar with the thinking of the
Islamic leadership, said Friday's attack came in response to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's recent crackdown on Hamas. As
part of that campaign, Hamas founder and spiritual leader, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, was placed under house arrest last week.
	   ``It is a message (to Arafat) that if you are going to keep your
promises to the Israelis and hit hard on Islamists there will be a
response that will curb your efforts to reach agreement with
Israel,'' Qassem said.
	   He said last week's Gaza car bomb that narrowly missed a school
bus with 40 children aboard was in response to Israel's killing of
two Hamas leaders, Adel and Imad Awadallah in September, and the
death of master bomb maker Mohiyedine Sharif in March.
	   Perry and another former Shin Bet chief, Carmi Gilon, said the
Israeli Cabinet decision to suspend consideration of the Mideast
peace deal reached at the Wye summit in Maryland was a mistake that
only encouraged Hamas and other groups.
	   Gilon said the aim of the militants was to ``ruin the whole
process. I'm just sorry our Cabinet made such a decision which is
exactly the aim of Hamas _ to stop Wye.''
	   In 1995 and 1996, a series of suicide-bombings by Islamic
militants claimed scores of Israeli lives and halted the peace
process, bringing to power the hard-line government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Arafat's police rounded up the
militants then, but the activists were later released from jail.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said it was impossible
to continue the troop withdrawal process because Arafat's forces
were doing so little.
	   He predicted that the militants would keep attacking until
Arafat's police uprooted the sources of support _ including
charities that collected money, teachers that recruited the youth
and clergy who encouraged attacks. He said Israel was merely lucky
that recent attacks hadn't claimed more casualties.
	   ``We can't rely any longer on miracles. We have to have some
action on the part of the Palestinian Authority,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   At a rally in the Gaza Strip several hours after Friday's market
bombing, a former Hamas activist who is now in Arafat's Cabinet
said Netanyahu's policies, such as building Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, were to blame for the attacks.
	   ``We want to tell him that if you put pressure on the
Palestinian people and against the Palestinian organizations, those
groups will point their arrows against you,'' Communications
Minister Imad Falouji told the crowd.
	   Falouji shared a platform with Abdallah Shami, leader of the
Islamic Jihad, a militant group sponsored by Iran, who affirmed
``our right to fight the occupiers as our religion and laws
dictate.''
	   Many in the crowd cheered.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The smell of sweet braided challah bread draws
Jews from all over the holy city to the Mahane Yehuda market on
Fridays. Shoppers swarm through the maze of stalls to fill their
baskets before the Sabbath descends.
	   For many years, though, the market has also attracted bombs.
	   Dozens have been killed at the market since the 1960s.
Palestinian militants with explosives strapped to their bodies have
blown themselves up in the narrow, cobblestone lanes or detonated
car bombs on the larger streets.
	   The market, spread over several blocks of a predominantly
religious neighborhood, is a choice target for those trying to
sabotage peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
	   ``This is the heart of Jerusalem, the most sensitive place in
the city, the most crowded place, '' Mayor Ehud Olmert said Friday.
``Whenever we express our fears about a terrorist action, this is
precisely the place we are concerned about.''
	   Attackers struck again Friday, setting off a car bomb at the
market entrance near a bakery. The blast killed the two assailants
and injured 21 passers-by.
	   ``All we want is an end to it all, to all this violence,'' said
bakery manager Yitzhak Davidovich. ``It was a miracle that so few
people were hurt.''
	   Friday's explosion was only the most recent in a long history of
attacks. There have been bombings in 1968, in 1990 and 1997 in
which a total of 31 Israelis were killed. In between, there have
been dozens of stabbings in which Israelis were wounded.
	   Some people have changed their shopping habits. It took several
months after last year's market bombing for shoppers to come back
in force for the fresh fish, mangoes and dried fruit.
	   Yet, there is a prevailing sentiment here that it would be
admitting defeat to let fear alter daily habits.
	   Some also feel they have little choice: Many of the people who
shop at Yehuda are poor, and are attracted by the city's most
affordable prices.
	   On Fridays, in the hours before the onset of the Jewish Sabbath,
the market is jammed with ultra-Orthodox Jewish men in their black
coats, housewives who barter over the price of oranges and
chickens, American students lunching at falafel stands.
	   Jerusalem residents say danger will not keep them away.
	   ``We always shopped here,'' said Shlomo Aviran, 58, as he waited
for his loaf of rye bread to be sliced at the Habah Bakery. ``And
we always will, come what may.''

	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Survivors of Central America's worst
disaster in memory are pleading for help as anger grows over the
slow pace of relief in the devastated countryside.
	   Doctors rationed out slim medical supplies Friday to sick and
injured refugees. Though tons of aid has poured in from across the
world for victims of Hurricane Mitch, the region's fractured road
system and limited air transportation forced many desperate
survivors to continue waiting.
	   Six-year-old Justa Pastora Povera Guillen, laid out on a cot at
a refugee center in Posoltega, shook with fever.
	   Dabbing the girl with a wet cloth, Dr. Rigoberto Sampson gave
her half a tablet of Tylenol and said her yellowish eyes suggested
malaria. There was little he could do.
	   ``We are lacking medicine. We can't give her blood tests to see
whether it's malaria but because of the situation here, I think it
is,'' he said.
	   Twenty-five case of cholera have been reported in Guatemala, the
Public Health Ministry said Friday. The government has increased
water-treatment efforts to prevent the disease from spreading.
	   The devastation has overwhelmed Central America, where officials
say more than 10,000 people died in flooding and mudslides.
Honduras said 569,000 were homeless and about 1 million others lost
loved ones or property. Nicaragua said more than 750,000 of its
people were affected.
	   Scarcities were readily apparent in the Honduran capital,
Tegucigalpa, where many supermarket shelves were bare,
1-2-mile-long (0.8-kilometer-long) lines of cars formed at gasoline
stations and hundreds of people lined up at the few trucks with
potable water.
	   ``I need gas to drive around to find water for my family and my
neighbors,'' said an exasperated Boris Vermont, 35, who spent two
hours in line at a gas station where fuel ran out Friday.
	   CARE worker Pilar de Pastor sat helplessly in a jeep on a
Tegucigalpa street; there was no aid to deliver. ``We're hoping to
get two helicopters from Palmerola'' air base up north, she said.
``Maybe today they'll come.''
	   Nicaraguan victims of last week's storm have accused President
Arnoldo Aleman of being slow to help some of the worst-hit regions
because inhabitants overwhelmingly support leftist Sandinistas, the
former rebels who governed through the 1980s.
	   ``The government has not sent anything. The only ones who are
helping us are the Sandinistas,'' Posoltega Mayor Felicita Zeledon
said.
	   Crowds of hungry flood victims jeered Aleman, calling him a
murderer, when he visited nearby Leon on Tuesday.
	   A French military squadron reached Posoltega on Friday to
evaluate the refugees' needs. French commander Bernard Demaret said
a plane carrying 90 tons of supplies would arrive later Friday and
its load would be split between Nicaragua and Honduras.
	   President Clinton has ordered dlrs 70 million of aid into the
region. His wife, Hillary, and Vice President Al Gore's wife,
Tipper, planned separate trips to Central America in a show of
support.
	   Private relief groups in the United States said they were
flooded with calls volunteering private money and supplies.
	   Dean Owen, spokesman for World Vision, called it ``one of the
largest efforts we've seen in several years.'' The international
group hopes to raise dlrs 5 million in money and donations of
blankets, towels, soap and other personal care items.
	   Taiwan pledged relief to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala; Brazil said it would send food, medicine and field
tents, and Central American embassies and consulates in Brazil
opened special bank accounts to collect monetary donations.
	   Spain approved an emergency aid package.
	   The U.S. Navy said its Mobile Construction Battalion Seven was
ordered Friday to leave its station in Puerto Rico and head to
Honduras to help the rebuilding effort.
	   In Honduras, relief workers waited anxiously for promised aid _
and scrambled to find aircraft, trucks, gasoline and aviation fuel
to deliver it to hundreds of isolated towns.
	   ``One plane (from the United States) had to cancel yesterday,''
reportedly because pilots couldn't get landing clearance, said Tom
Turley of the Connecticut-based Americares. ``We put in a lot of
time and effort getting trucks and gas, and now we have to hold
back on it.''
	   CARE _ working with the U.S. Southern Command's Joint Task Force
Bravo in Honduras _ planned to move 60 tons of food a day, but
local food stocks are low. Local CARE reserves are nearly depleted,
and workers were told they likely won't get to the devastated
southern town of Choluteca by land for at least two months.
	   ``The situation there is grave,'' acknowledged Gloria Manzanares
Vaquero, CARE director for central and southern Honduras.
	   The government _ which already declared a state of siege and
overnight curfew to prevent lawlessness _ banned alcohol sales
indefinitely Friday. More than 2,000 people were detained in the
past week for violating the curfew.
	   At the primary school turned into a shelter in Posoltega,
children and weary adults shared a moment of levity, laughing at
tricks performed by a juggler from the Spain-based Clowns Without
Borders.
	   Others had a hard time smiling. Susana Benevidas returned to the
shelter carrying a large empty bucket.
	   ``I went to look for water because my children are thirsty but
there isn't any,'' the mother of four said. ``A water truck has
shown up only twice _ but it runs out very quickly.''
	   On the mountainside above Posoltega, where some 2,000 people
were killed a week ago when the crater lake atop Casitas Volcano
broke open, military brigades continued to burn or bury the
victims' bodies.
	   Mayor Zeledon recalled that when she took office she had hoped
to help Posoltega develop from being one of Nicaragua's poorest
towns.
	   ``Now the misery is greater and my program has changed into
helping Posoltega survive, to go on living, although with a bitter
memory,'' she said.

Colombia's troop pullout inaugurates a bold gamble for peace

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In a bold gamble for peace, Colombia's
president will complete the evacuation Saturday of all government
troops from a southern guerrilla stronghold the size of
Switzerland.
	   The 90-day pullout _ meant to facilitate peace talks with the
rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia _ is the boldest
government concession yet in efforts to end a 34-year armed
conflict that has bound this nation rich in talent and resources
like a straightjacket.
	   President Andres Pastrana hopes to build confidence and spark
serious negotiations, but critics say he is being naive, giving
away too much too soon to a dangerous opponent that has yet to
prove itself ready for reconciliation.
	   Those fears grew this week when the rebels, known by their
Spanish initials as the FARC, seized a remote state capital for
three days in one of their largest attacks ever. About 1,400
guerrillas overran Mitu, in southeastern Vaupes state, leveling its
police barracks, killing at least 50 people and taking as many as
70 police officers captive.
	   The attack dampened expectations raised in July when Pastrana
met with Manuel Marulanda, the FARC's 68-year-old commander, at a
jungle hideout.
	   ``All (the rebels) are doing is giving reasons and more
arguments to those who oppose peace,'' Pastrana said Thursday while
touring Mitu, 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of the withdrawal
zone.
	   While some feel the guerrillas are just flexing their muscles _
hoping to strengthen their hand in the talks set to begin by
December _ others fear the rebels are gathering pawns in a
real-life chess game for power.
	   ``I don't see any reasons to be optimistic,'' said political
analyst Rafael Nieto. ``It's an insurgency that's self-reliant,
very wealthy, militarily effective ... and popular in the regions
it controls. What does a guerrilla group like the FARC gain from
negotiating?''
	   Many observers believe the FARC's goal is to use its military
might to one day force the partitioning of the country, splitting
off the south as an independent, rebel-run republic. Pastrana has
said the government would never agree to such a demand.
	   ``The state is giving away everything in return for nothing,''
said former Gen. Harold Bedoya, who was fired as armed forces
commander in 1997 after openly criticizing concessions to the FARC
by former President Ernesto Samper.
	   Bedoya says the guerrillas, who tax peasant coca production and
protect cocaine traffickers' airstrips and laboratories, will use
the pullout to deepen those ties while strengthening their hold on
Colombia's south.
	   Government officials say they're willing to discuss a 10-point
plan drafted by the FARC in 1996 to clean up Colombia's politics
and redistribute wealth.
	   But Marulanda's main request is to swap 452 guerrillas in
government jails for the estimated 300 soldiers and police now held
by the FARC. Critics say Pastrana, who hasn't given an answer,
would be replenishing the rebels with hardened fighters and
talented political cadres.
	   The government did not press for a cease-fire as a condition for
negotiations, and Marulanda told the federal ombudsman last week
that the FARC will continue military action ``with all intensity''
outside the pullout zone.
	   ``Peace has a cost,'' presidential peace commissioner Victor G.
Ricardo told a news conference Friday at which the envoy announced
a comission of respected Colombian and international observers will
help monitor both sides' actions.
	   Inside the 16,200 square-mile (42,000-square-kilometer) swath of
foothills and savannahs the army is quitting, residents have
already taken precautions.
	   Fearing pillaging by rebels who will soon be outright masters of
territory they long dominated quietly, ranchers have trucked out
cattle, depositors are closing bank accounts and some homeowners
are looking to sell.
	   The envoy, Ricardo, said local residents will be deputized as
unarmed, temporary police.
	   In San Vicente de Caguan, the most strategic of five
municipalities to be cleared of government forces, the last of some
2,000 anti-guerrilla troops were airlifted to a base 30 miles away
on Friday.
	   White flags hung over doorways, and officials planted ``peace''
trees in the town square.
	   ``This might be the last chance we have to find reconciliation
between Colombians, '' said the mayor, Omar Garcia.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Public anger over declining living
standards despite Venezuela's vast oil wealth will probably drive
this weekend's elections for state governors and members of
congress.
	   The established political order is expected to pay a heavy price
when voters cast ballots on Sunday, and the results could boost the
fortunes of a former coup leader running for president.
	   The biggest winner is predicted to be the coalition led by
former Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez, who became a folk hero after trying to
overthrow the government six years ago. He leads all polls to
become president in Dec. 6 elections.
	   ``The people want a radical change in the political system, even
if this means there will be severe social turbulence,'' said Heinz
Sonntag, a political scientist at the Central University in
Caracas.
	   Chavez's left-of-center Patriotic Pole coalition is expected to
win a plurality in the new Congress. The legislature is now
dominated by the country's two oldest parties _ the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the conservative Copei Party.
	   Unlike the congressional balloting, the gubernatorial races are
expected to have little impact on December's presidential
elections.
	   Venezuela has more known oil reserves than any country outside
the Middle East, yet more than half its population of 20 million
lives in poverty. Many people blame Democratic Action and Copei for
squandering the nation's vast oil wealth.
	   Those parties still boast political machines that could help
them when Venezuelans choose 23 governors, 48 senators, 189 members
of congress and 391 state assembly members.
	   But national politics have taken on overtones of class warfare,
with the poor flocking to support Chavez on the one hand and on the
other, dire predictions that he will confiscate private property
and expel foreigners.
	   ``The stakes are much too high for people to just let go, and
that could lead to some sort of violent expression,'' said
political consultant Eric Ekvall.
	   Such violence would not be new to Venezuela, which suffered two
bloody coup attempts in 1992 and price riots in 1989 that killed
hundreds.
	   Electoral tensions increased recently after the army chief
implied that the armed forces would seek to block Chavez's rise to
power.
	   President Rafael Caldera, 82, tried to calm the waters by
announcing on national television that the voters' will would be
honored.
	   Chavez, considered left of center, is calling for a version of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Third Way, some sort of
compromise between unfettered capitalism and socialism. He wants to
restructure foreign debt, slow down privatization and invest
heavily in housing and education. He's also been trying to calm
investor fears by calling for fiscal discipline and saying that he
welcomes foreign investors.
	   The one presidential candidate who seems to be able to channel
the anti-Chavez feeling is Henrique Salas, a Yale-educated
businessman seen as pro business and pro markets.
	   Salas doesn't seem to have the passionate popular support
enjoyed by Chavez, and he does not have much political machinery to
bring out the vote for his center-right Project Venezuela Party on
Sunday. The best he can hope for, it seems, would be to cement the
divided anti-Chavez vote.
	   In one senate race, meanwhile, is Carlos Andres Perez, the
76-year-old former president whom Chavez tried to overthrow in
1992.
	   Perez is campaigning while under house arrest in his home state
of Tachira on charges of illegal enrichment. If he wins on Sunday,
which polls say he will do easily, he will get parliamentary
immunity and be freed.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ In another blow to a Honduran
economy reeling from Hurricane Mitch, Chiquita Brands
International's subsidiary said it was suspending all of its nearly
7,800 workers in the country.
	   Tela Railroad Co., one of the nation's largest private
employers, made the decision Friday after Mitch destroyed or
seriously damaged practically all of its banana plantations in
Honduras, causing at least dlrs 200 million in damage.
	   Effective immediately, some 7,782 workers were being laid off
for at least a year, said Tela vice president Fernando Sanchez.
Some may be rehired to help in construction or other relief
efforts, he said.
	   Tela's 1997 payroll totaled dlrs 18 million.
	   Under the best of conditions, Chiquita won't be able to reach
pre-storm production levels until at least 2001, Sanchez said. He
called Mitch the biggest disaster to befall the company in its
100-year history in Honduras.
	   ``We are starting from ground zero,'' Sanchez said.
	   Government officials estimate that 70 percent of Honduras'
agricultural production was lost in the hurricane, which ravaged
the country for nearly a week and killed more than 6,000.
	   Mitch destroyed countless bridges across Honduras, paved over
fields with tons of mud and debris and choked innumerable drainage
and irrigation ditches. Chiquita was still evaluating how much lost
land can be recovered and restored to production, Sanchez said.
	   ``You can't plant in a field that has no bridges'' for access,
he said, adding that several plantations ``were completely
leveled'' by flooding.
	   Several factors figure in deciding how much the company will
invest to restore its Honduran operations, including Honduran laws
that Sanchez said restrict land transfers.
	   ``I don't want to discard any of the possibilities,'' he said.
``A lot of people depend on us.''
	   Of a total 20,000 hectares (49,400 acres) of banana plantations
in Honduras, Chiquita operated 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) and
had contracts with independent growers cultivating another 3,000
hectares (7,400 acres) .
	   Chiquita will provide suspended workers compensation of 560
lempiras (dlrs 43) every two weeks. Workers and dependents will
continue to receive housing, medical and other benefits as well as
food, drinking water and storm relief. Workers also will be offered
no-interest loans.
	   While effective immediately, the layoffs are officially subject
to government approval.
	   Chiquita's participation in a national search and rescue effort
for storm victims will continue, Sanchez said. The company has
provided helicopters to help deliver food and airlift aid workers
to inaccessible towns and has sent shiploads of supplies to
Honduras.
	   At Chiquita's urging, the U.S. government successfully
challenged European preferences for Caribbean-produced bananas in
the World Trade Organization. Washington has threatened sanctions
against European countries that don't abide by a WTO ruling that
found the preferences violate free-trade rules.

WYETH HOUSE: Adobe hacienda sparkles as bed and breakfast

<TEXT>
	   SAN PATRICIO, New Mexico (AP) _ The ``noisy river'' murmurs
through Sentinel Ranch, past the rustic 150-year-old adobe hacienda
where artists Henriette Wyeth and Peter Hurd once lived.
	   Hurd, a lanky Lincoln County lad steeped in the lore of Billy
the Kid, brought Wyeth to the banks of the Rio Ruidoso _ literally
noisy river _ on their honeymoon in 1929.
	   ``We drove in the moonlight to this place,'' Wyeth, daughter of
American master N.C. Wyeth and a sister of Andrew Wyeth, recalled
in a 1989 interview. They decided then that it would be their home.
	   Now, their tile-roofed, white stucco hacienda, with two
courtyards, apple, pear, peach and plum orchards, gardens and
gazebo, is part of a bed-and-breakfast run by the adjacent Hurd La
Rinconada Gallery.
	   ``People come in and say, `Wow, look at this place' _ and that's
just so great,'' says their son, artist Michael Hurd.
	   Wyeth died last year at the age of 89. Peter Hurd, once N.C.
Wyeth's student at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, died in 1984.
	   They met on a train near Philadelphia in 1923. When Hurd asked
directions to N.C. Wyeth's house, the conductor suggested he
consult the young woman sitting beside him _ Henriette. They moved
to San Patricio in the 1930s when the renovated adobe, circa 1850,
was ready.
	   The two painted and raised three children _ Peter Jr., Carol
Rogers and Michael. They gave parties, organized polo matches and
entertained famous guests, including dance master George Balanchine
and actresses Helen Hayes and Linda Darnell.
	   Hurd painted President Lyndon Johnson, Wyeth painted Patricia
Nixon. The Darnell portrait hangs in the gallery beside the B and
B, along with numerous other paintings, prints and posters by the
family of artists.
	   ``Our primary business is displaying and selling our work,''
Michael Hurd says.
	   San Patricio lies in a green valley below Sentinel Mountain,
once a lookout for marauding Apaches and bandits. Michael Hurd
recalls the day his father took him aside in his studio and said:
``It's going to be up to you to run this place.''
	   He got some valuable experience working for a Chicago company
handling industrial real estate in the 1970s. Now he spends most
days painting. A traveler in southern New Mexico is apt to see Hurd
at his easel along its rural roads.
	   And the traveler may stay in Henriette Wyeth's home, complete
with kitchen, sitting room, dressing room, bedroom and sun porch.
The B and B also includes one other apartment at the hacienda and
six casitas, or adobe cottages. The gallery plans to add two
apartments to the south wing of the hacienda next year.
	   ``It's all very well to get swept up in the aesthetics of
things, but there has to be an economic backbone,'' Hurd says. ``We
always had guests, and we always rented out little houses here.''
	   There is more than a mile (1 1-2 kilometers) of river front on
the 2,400-acre ranch and several miles (kilometers) of trails on
and around Sentinel Mountain, which is six miles (9 1-2 kilometers)
north of the Mescalero Apache reservation. Lincoln, where Billy the
Kid fought the Lincoln County War, is a few miles (kilometers)
northwest. The horse-racing mecca of Ruidoso is 20 miles (30
kilometers) west.
	   Someday, Hurd hopes to rebuild his parents' studios.
	   ``There's an intimacy to those studios that you have to
preserve,'' he says, recalling one definition he read of art as
``deepening the mystery of life.''
	   ``I think being in those studios has the effect of deepening the
mystery.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; IF YOU GO: Sentinel Ranch is in the village of San Patricio.
Follow the signs off U.S. 70 at mile marker 281. Rooms range from
dlrs 125 to dlrs 200 per person per night, double occupancy. For
reservations, call (800) 658-6912.

	   ABOARD THE VISION OF THE SEAS (AP) _ For years I resisted taking
a cruise vacation. The idea of visiting scenic cities with rich
cultures and having just enough time to visit tourist traps and
take snapshots didn't appeal to me.
	   But when I got the opportunity to travel to some of the most
beautiful and historic locations in Europe aboard a brand-new
Titanic-size cruise ship, I succumbed.
	   I signed up for Royal Caribbean International's seven-day
Mediterranean cruise that in August departed from Barcelona, Spain,
the site of the 1992 Summer Olympics.
	   The megaship Vision of the Seas, as long as three football
fields end to end, was the newest of the Royal Caribbean fleet. The
11-deck ship, which debuted in May, boasts a two-story dining room
that will seat 1,200 people, a disco, a casino, a theater, a salon
and spa, and numerous other attractions. It can accommodate up to
2,400 passengers in 1,000 cabins.
	   At 915 feet (279 meters) long and 106 feet (32 feet) wide, it is
larger than the Titanic, which measured 882 feet (269 meters) by
92.5 feet (28 meters).
	   But the main lures to me were the exotic ports-of-call. From
Barcelona, we were bound for Villefranche, France, where passengers
can sample life on the French Riviera; Ajaccio, Corsica, the French
island home of Napoleon; Civitaveccia, the gateway to the Eternal
City of Rome; the old city of Messina, Italy, and the visually
spectacular city of Valletta in Malta.
	   I was traveling with my aunt and a cousin and four of their
friends. Like a few others, we wisely chose to spend two days in
Barcelona before the ship left port.
	   While two days is hardly enough to enjoy the wonderful sights of
Barcelona _ the Picasso Museum, the majestic cathedral, the Old
World charm of Catalunya or the modern pizzazz of the Olympic
Village _ it gave us a taste of the city.
	   Once on board the ship, with about 2,000 others, I was impressed
by its size and beauty _ the wood encased-bars, the sleek and
luxurious public lounges, the majestic dining room, the gleaming
staircases and the views. The ship gets its name from the profusion
of windows, balconies and walls of glass, offering spectacular
panoramas.
	   The view got smaller once we got to our rooms, however, since we
chose the lesser-expensive deck. It was a step above the windowless
cabins below but not nearly as roomy as the suites on the higher
floors.
	   Still, it was comfortable enough for three people. (It had two
bunk beds for extra lodging.) The bathroom was adequate, though
those of wider girths might feel a little claustrophobic in the
small, standup shower.
	   Except for one full day at sea with no stops, each day promised
potentially exhausting onshore excursions. At the first stop,
Villefranche, the ship stood stationary at sea while passengers
took a tender, or a small boat, to shore.
	   We shunned the cruise-sponsored tours and struck out on our own,
knowing that trains could take us anywhere along the Riviera on a
one-day pass that cost less than dlrs 30.
	   With 13 hours to spare, we headed to Cannes, famous for its
frolicking beaches, the Cannes film festival, and the rich
celebrities who vacation there. But when we arrived, it was Sunday,
most of the stores were closed, and there were few people on the
streets.
	   Since the trains didn't run that frequently, we bypassed Nice
and went on to Monaco so we could see the palace of Prince Rainer
and his late wife Princess Grace before it closed for the day.
	   Luckily, we were able to view the royal palace, shop for garish
tourist items and visit other landmarks in this tiny city before
heading to the Monte Carlo casino that evening. And we made it back
to the ship in time for dinner. (Actually dinnertime was over, but
our waiters kindly fetched us our meal anyway.)
	   Because of its potential for a frenzied pace and because the
port at Civitavecchia is so far from Rome, we joined an organized
tour to see the Italian city. (We later learned we could have
caught a local train and seen Rome on our own.)
	   With just eight hours to spend in the city, we did our best to
check out the highlights. First stop was the Vatican Museum and St.
Peter's Basilica, the largest church in the world. We saw only a
little of the museum, but what we did see was breathtaking,
including the Michelangelo's famed Sistine Chapel.
	   But on the tour, we realized what delays could cost us. We were
late getting to our scheduled lunch, so we only spent a few minutes
outside the Trevi Fountain later and didn't get a chance to go
inside the Coliseum. We caught a glimpse of other sites from the
tour bus heading back to the ship.
	   In Ajaccio, Corsica, with its beautiful beaches, a more
leisurely stroll was called for. I toured the birthplace of
Napoleon in less than a half-hour, walked the streets of the city,
then spent the rest of the day on the beach and looking at the many
gift shops.
	   In Messina, we again took the tour, bypassing the city to view
the stone Greek Theater, which dates back to 3 B.C, along the
cobble-stoned streets of Taormina, about a 45-minute drive away.
After that there was time for shopping, but some of the more
upscale shops stories were closed for siesta, the two or three
hours after lunch when stores shut down in much of Europe. (If we
learned any lesson in Europe, it was to get your shopping done
before noon.)

	   On the last excursion, Valletta, I again ventured out on my own.
But with the August heat and the high cost of the taxis, I just
ventured to the main strip, which is lined with dozens of jewelry
and souvenir shops. Perhaps because I didn't venture far I left
with the feeling that the city had little to offer except some
interesting architecture. I was looking forward to getting back to
the ship and actually headed back three hours before we set sail
for Barcelona.
	   I was pleasantly surprised by the ship's other attractions. The
theater offered entertainers who performed two shows a night; the
casino enticed me to lose some of my money. I played bingo, I
danced in the disco (which was open until at least 2 a.m. most
nights) and soothed my sore muscles in one of the ship's Jacuzzis.
	   After the several days of walking and lugging one too many
packages, I was ready for some relaxation. One of the most enticing
was the Vision's spa and salon. From massages to manicures, it
offered a wide array of pampering.
	   Unfortunately, a lot of my shipmates also found the services
enticing. I found that getting an appointment for a massage,
manicure or some other treatment was almost impossible if you
didn't book it during the first couple of days. The salon was
working on a cancellation-only basis for its most popular services.
	   The only time I could get a massage was when someone canceled on
a day when we were at Messina, and who wants to spend an hour on
the ship when you have only six hours to spend in one of the
world's most interesting ancient cities?
	   I tried something totally weird and new at the spa. I stepped
into a futuristic-looking chamber that massaged my body for 30
minutes. With closed eyes, I wore sunglasses that emitted a
flashing red light to simulate relaxing sleep patterns and listened
to relaxing music on my headphones.
	   After indulging in that, I was ready to head back to my cabin
and bypass those onshore excursions.

As council waits for Iraqi response, U.N. cuts inspection team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ As the U.N. Security Council waits to see
if Iraq resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, officials
said they are cutting the weapons inspection team based in Baghdad
by about 20 percent.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said Friday it decided to
withdraw 26 of about 120 permanent staff starting Saturday because
Iraq has banned all spot inspections and monitoring.
	   ``It makes no sense to keep high-powered people sitting there
doing nothing when presumably they all have jobs to do in their own
countries,'' said Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM.
	   The decision to pull back part of the permanent staff was
disclosed less than 24 hours after the Security Council demanded
that Iraq reverse its decision to cut all dealings with the weapons
inspectors.
	   Buchanan said the ``partial paring back'' would not affect
UNSCOM's ability ``to be up and running if and when Iraq decides to
rescind its decision.''
	   While the council was united in condeming Iraq and demanding
that it resume cooperation with weapons inspectors, it remains
deeply divided on whether current and past resolutions authorize
military force to make Iraq comply.
	   Britain and the United States _ who have repeatedly threatened
military force _ claimed Thursday's resolution reaffirmed their
right to act.
	   But Russia, China and France _ the other permanent council
members _ insisted that only the council can authorize military
strikes and it had not done so. They called for a peaceful solution
and urged Iraq to resume dealings with UNSCOM.
	   Iraq's Foreign Ministry warned in a statement Friday that any
armed actions against the country are ``fraught with most
unpredictable consequences for peace and stability in the region
and in the Middle East as a whole.''
	   Iraq said Thursday it would reject any Security Council
resolution unless it calls for the end of sanctions, imposed after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
	   The resolution reaffirms the council's readiness to hold ``a
comprehensive review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions,
which could lead to the lifting of the oil embargo if UNSCOM
declare Iraq is disarmed.
	   But the proposed ``comprehensive review'' does not include a
timetable for lifting sanctions _ as Iraq has demanded _ and it is
contingent on Iraq resuming cooperation with weapons inspectors.
	   Acting U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the current council
president, said Friday that members were waiting for Iraq's
official response.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who played a key role in
defusing the last crisis with Iraq over weapons inspections in
February, flew to Paris en route to north Africa where he begins a
10 day tour on Saturday. Because of the standoff with Iraq, he left
behind his chief spokesman, Fred Eckhard.
	   Russia and China have urged the secretary-general to play a more
active role in trying to resolve the current crisis, but the United
States and Britain have not. U.N. officials said Annan will not
become more involved unless there is a consensus on the Security
Council that he should.

	   Today's gigantic cruise liners are no longer comparable to
floating hotels. They're more like floating resorts.
	   The ships now offer so many activities that travelers may be
tempted to bypass ports to spend more time on board.
	   ``The cruise industry is much like the destination resort
business,'' says cruise industry analyst Bruce Turner of Solomon
Smith Barney. ``The ships are attractions themselves. Certainly
ships have gotten larger, more glamorous, more expensive to
build.''
	   Princess Cruises now holds the title for the world's largest
cruise ship. The dlrs 450 million Grand Princess, which was
christened in New York in September, is 951 feet (290 meters long),
has 18 decks, three main showroom lounges, a virtual reality center
and even a wedding chapel for those looking to get hitched at sea.
	   Royal Caribbean is planning to best Princess by November 1999
with an updated Voyager of the Seas, which will boast an
ice-skating rink, roller blading, rock climbing, even a promenade
featuring daily parades a la Disney World.
	   ``In some cases, the ship is really the destination,'' says
Royal Caribbean Ltd. spokeswoman Gloria Jacaruso.
	   Still, most of the 5 million people who will take a cruise this
year will go for the destinations, which are being expanded beyond
the typical winter voyage to the Caribbean or the summer cruise to
Alaska.
	   ``Starting in fall of '99, we'll have a ship that does royal
journeys, trips to different areas that we haven't been to before,
including the Middle East,'' Jacaruso says. ``I think the whole
European market is something that we're expanding.''
	   Passengers can also take trips to Asia, South America, even
Africa on some lines.

<TEXT>
	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   PRICE RANGE: The cost of cruises varies widely, but a general
rule of thumb is to expect to shell out more money the more exotic
the itinerary. For example, Caribbean cruises can be less than dlrs
1,000 per person, including airfare, while a Southeast Asian trek
on Princess Cruises may cost a minimum of dlrs 3,000 per person.
	   ATTIRE: Remember those beaded gowns and tuxedos they used to
wear for dinners on TV's ``The Love Boat?'' Well, they really do
dress like that for the ship's main dining rooms, but usually only
on formal or captain's night. Otherwise, you can get away with a
tasteful, simple outfit. But if you want to sloth around in jeans
and flip flops, saunter over to the casual diner, or order room
service.
	   DINING: Many cruise lines offer a choice between first and
second seating. It seems best to choose the later seating so you
can stay out longer on shore excursions. You can always go to one
of the casual dining rooms instead of the formal seating. Expect to
be wowed with five-course meals exquisitely presented and waiters
who dote on your every need.
	   However, some cruise lines are scaling back on the traditional
midnight buffets or dropping them because passengers are becoming
more health conscious about overeating.
	   ONSHORE EXCURSIONS: Do it on your own or see the sights on the
ship's organized tour? It's always a quandary, but the best way to
decide is to do some research on the ports before you go, to find
out the availability and cost of transportation at the port, among
other things.
	   SEASICKNESS: If you are prone to seasickness, don't pick a cabin
towards the front of the ship; that's the rockiest area. Select a
cabin towards the middle. Best bet: nausea pills or those patches
available by prescription that are designed to be discreetly placed
right below your ear.
	   HIDDEN COSTS: Besides the shore excursions, there are other
little extra costs. These include drinks, the services at the salon
and the spa (where a 50-minute massage can cost dlrs 90), trips to
the casino and the bottles of water and soda left in your cabin.
And those waiters don't smile and pamper you for nothing; you are
expected to leave them a tip at the end of your stay, along with
something for your cabin steward.

caribbean.com.

	   PANMUNJOM, South Korea (AP) _ The tour guide carries a side arm
and asks laughingly if anyone on the bus is a North Korean spy.
	   ``No photos allowed on this road,'' he says as the bus moves
along. ``... On your left and right are live mine fields running
from coast to coast.''
	   In rain or shine, several times a day, six days a week, tour
buses drive into the Demilitarized Zone separating communist North
Korea from democratic South Korea _ the world's last Cold War flash
point and a travel destination unique in international tourism.
	   A side trip can be arranged to one of several infiltration
tunnels _ passageways blasted through rock under the DMZ by the
North Koreans.
	   With or without the tunnel excursion, the DMZ tour is an
otherworldly mix of barbed wire, rare wildlife, communist
propaganda, and souvenir golf hats.
	   ``Wonderful tour!'' a woman from Iowa wrote in the guest book.
	   ``If tours come here,'' writes a more cynical man from
California, ``this so-called 'tense' border must be anything but.''
	   But the combined U.S. and U.N. military forces _ charged with
maintaining a 45-year-old armistice on the peninsula _ say they
allow the tours to illustrate how perilous and hostile the
situation remains between the rival Koreas.
	   The DMZ is a 4-kilometer-wide (2.5-mile-wide) buffer and runs
across the peninsula, roughly along the 38th parallel. It is about
an hour's drive north of Seoul.
	   The zone was created when the 1950-53 Korean War ended not with
a full peace treaty but a fragile armistice. The North-South
face-off continues today with an estimated 2 million soldiers,
including some 37,000 Americans, at the ready on both sides of the
border.
	   Highlights of the tour include:
	   _ A 15-minute historical slide show at Camp Bonifas, a few
hundred yards (meters) outside the DMZ.
	   _ The Military Armistice Commission meeting room, a one-room
building straddling the border. Half of the conference table lies
in North Korea and half in the South. Visitors can step to the
other side of the table and be photographed in ``the North,'' and
sometimes can photograph a North Korean guard, looking at them
through the window.
	   _ Checkpoint No. 3. Visitors stand on a hill overlooking mostly
brushy landscape where North Koreans have put up Hollywood-style
signs and loudspeakers that blast propaganda across the DMZ.
	   _ The Bridge of No Return. Prisoners were exchanged across it
after the war.
	   _ Wildlife. Largely untouched since the war, the DMZ is a
sanctuary for half the world's remaining black-faced spoonbill
wading birds, environmentalists say. A third of the world's
Manchurian cranes winter there.
	   _ Bar and souvenir shop. The tour ends back at Camp Bonifas,
where visitors can sign the guest book and buy Korean jewelry or
crafts, or DMZ T-shirts, coffee mugs, golf hats, etc.
	   _ The separate tunnel trip is about a 20-minute drive away, and
it takes about a half-hour to walk into and out of the tunnel.
	   Though North Koreans have said the passageways are only
abandoned coal mines, the South says there are as many as 20 _
designed as attack corridors _ and that one is large enough to
allow passage of small vehicles and 30,000 fully armed troops per
hour.
	   About 150,000 people, approximately half of them South Koreans,
take the tour into the DMZ from the South each year. Many are U.S.
soldiers assigned elsewhere in South Korea, American and other
veterans of the war and just plain tourists.
	   Up to half that number are believed to tour the northern side
every year, though no figures are available from the secretive
Stalinist country.
	   ``Our worst-case scenario, short of all-out war, is that one of
their tourists will defect while our tour group is there,'' said
U.S. Army Spc. Christian White of Scranton, Pa., the tour guide on
a recent day.
	   ``They have to get their tourist back, and they'll kill anyone
who gets in the way.''
	   Such a tragedy occurred in 1984. A Soviet tour guide defected
over the military demarcation line in a section called the Joint
Security Area. A 20-minute firefight left one South Korean and
three North Korean soldiers dead.
	   Officials say there have been no other major incidents related
to tourism at the DMZ and that the opposing militaries now have an
unwritten agreement not to take tour groups to the site at the same
time.
	   Still, tour guides carry pistols and the bus is escorted through
part of the tour by a camouflaged Humvee all-purpose military
vehicle, flying a small U.N. flag.
	   Visitors are warned not to point or make other gestures toward
North Korean border guards.
	   Visitors also sign a waiver releasing the military from
responsibility in case of death or injury. Children under 10 are
not allowed.
	   Even among adults, the DMZ trip is not for everyone.
	   Lawrence Younger, a Scottish veteran who served in Korea in
1953, said the visit made him so sad he wouldn't recommend it to
fellow veterans.
	   ``For anybody who's not been here before, yes, it's
educational,'' said Younger. ``But for someone who was here then,
no.''
	   Tears welled in his eyes as he looked over the area where he'd
served as a 19-year-old soldier.
	   ``Bad memories,'' he said softly.

	   WEST BADEN SPRINGS, Indiana (AP) _ The West Baden Springs Hotel,
once an exclusive resort for the rich and famous, was nearly in
ruins when it got a second chance a couple of years ago.
	   Vacant since 1983, part of the six-story building's outside wall
had caved in and more collapses appeared imminent. Badly corroded
steel support beams rested in crumbling blocks of concrete, and the
soil below the structure's foundation was becoming increasingly
unstable.
	   The grounds, which in years past had been beautifully landscaped
and carefully maintained, had also fallen into disarray. Weeds and
thickets had overrun the formal garden and the tree-lined brick
driveway.
	   But the 708-room hotel, billed at one time as ``the eighth
wonder of the world'' for its 200-foot-wide (61-meter-wide) dome of
steel, canvas and glass perched 100 feet (30 meters) above the
floor of its cavernous atrium, has undergone a rebirth. It was the
largest clear-span dome in the world until the completion of the
Astrodome in Houston in the mid-1960s.
	   The building's exterior, now a creamy yellow color with white
trim, has been returned to its original splendor.
	   The sprawling, intricately designed mosaic tile floor of the
neoclassical atrium and lobby has been painstakingly restored. And
the garden now boasts an array of 50 plant varieties, including
mums, hyacinths, boxwoods and foxtail grass.
	   ``It's just an unbelievably awesome project,'' said George
Ridgway, an architect in charge of the restoration. ``Nobody alive
_ including me _ will ever do another project like this one.''
	   The Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana decided to save the
hotel, located about two miles (3.2 kilometers) from the famous
French Lick Springs resort in southern Indiana, to make it
attractive to potential buyers.
	   In early 1996, representatives of the nonprofit organization
approached Bloomington millionaire Bill Cook, a preservationist who
has restored other buildings around the state, and asked for dlrs 1
million to shore up the building.
	   The foundation's officials were stunned when they left the
meeting with a commitment of up to dlrs 10 million for repairs and
restoration work. One of Cook's businesses, Cook Group Inc., has
spent nearly three times that amount so far: about dlrs 28 million.
	   From the basement to the top floor, more than 3.5 million pounds
of steel beams have been installed to stabilize the building.
Workers have used 13,000 gallons of paint, installed 140 miles (225
kilometers) of new electrical wiring and replaced 7,900 light
bulbs.
	   One of the biggest undertakings involved removing a portion of
the atrium floor, digging up thousands of cubic feet (meters) of
earth and replacing it with tons of limestone gravel to stabilize
the ground.
	   When the resort opened in 1902, advertisements touted the
hotel's mineral baths and drinking water, which came from sulfur
springs on the grounds.
	   Hotel guests could also enjoy a variety of activities, including
golf, fine dining, nightly theater performances and gambling, which
was illegal but ignored by local authorities.
	   Architect Ridgway's final responsibility will be supervising the
replacement of four domed towers atop the building's east- and
south-facing facades. The towers are 50-foot (15-meter) replicas of
the originals, which were earlier removed and discarded.
	   Each steel-and-aluminum tower weighs 19,000 pounds and will be
airlifted in two sections by a giant Sikorsky helicopter.
	   The 255-acre (103-hectare) property _ an adjacent 434 acres (176
hectares) is also available _ is being marketed as a potential
hotel, corporate headquarters or mixed-use building of shops and
residences.
	   The advertised asking price is dlrs 29.5 million, the amount
invested so far in the partial restoration, which should be
completed by the end of the year. At least another dlrs 20 million
to dlrs 30 million will be required to complete the work, depending
upon the building's final use, Ridgway said.
	   It may take several years to find a buyer, said Tina Connor, the
foundation's marketing director and restoration supervisor.
	   ``The Cook Group says they will maintain the building until it's
sold,'' she said.

Brosius gets dlrs 15.75 million, three-year deal from Yankees

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ They may not know who'll play center field, but
the New York Yankees can count on Scott Brosius to play third base
next season.
	   The World Series MVP agreed Friday to remain with the Yankees,
who gave him a dlrs 15.75 million, three-year contract. The deal
wasn't announced, but the terms were confirmed by several sources
who spoke on the condition they not be identified.
	   ``Tony Attanasio (Brosius' agent) and I have talked several
times,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. ``At this
time, the only thing I'll say is we're talking.''
	   Brosius, obtained from Oakland after the 1997 season for Kenny
Rogers, hit .300 this year with 19 homers and 98 RBIs. He then
batted .383 in the postseason, leading New York in hits (18), home
runs (4) and RBIs (15). He was 8-for-17 (.471) against San Diego in
the World Series with two homers and six RBIs.
	   Cashman said the Yankees still hadn't formulated an offer to
center fielder Bernie Williams, who could start listening to offers
from other teams on Friday.
	   ``Our priority is keeping Bernie,'' Cashman said.
	   There's no reason for the Yankees to act quickly. Williams'
agent, Scott Boras, does not expect to make a deal for several
weeks, probably not until next month. Two of his potential suitors
_ Colorado and Los Angeles _ signed center fielders Friday, with
Devon White getting a dlrs 12.4 million, three-year contract with
the Dodgers and Darryl Hamilton re-signing with Colorado for dlrs
10.5 million over three years.
	   New York also must decide by next Wednesday whether to exercise
Darryl Strawberry's dlrs 2.5 million option. The Yankees aren't
likely to exercise the option on the outfielder, undergoing
chemotherapy following colon cancer surgery last month, but want to
instead restructure his contract.
	   Cashman said he is talking daily with Strawberry's agent, Eric
Grossman, and with Steve Fehr, the agent of pitcher David Cone, who
must decide by Wednesday whether to exercise a dlrs 5.5 million
option.

World War II through Russian eyes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEMPHIS, Tennessee (AP) _ Adolf Hitler's ever-present banner and
standard are part of a traveling exhibition of Russian artifacts
that help tell the story of World War II on the Eastern Front.
	   The show, ``World War II Through Russian Eyes,'' opened Nov. 5
at The Memphis Pyramid with some 700 items, most from the Central
Armed Forces Museum in Moscow.
	   The exhibit includes personal belongings of Hitler and Josef
Stalin as well as weapons and uniforms used by Russian soldiers and
partisans, maps, paintings of battle scenes and wartime
photographs.
	   Among the items is a globe taken from Hitler's desk inscribed in
German, ``I came, I saw, I conquered.''
	   A piece of the Reichstag wall carries an inscription apparently
written by a Russian soldier, ``I made it to Berlin.''
	   The banner and standard which stood by Hitler's desk were seized
by Russian soldiers from the Berlin bunker where the Nazi dictator
committed suicide. They have been held in storage by the Russians
ever since.
	   ``Wherever Hitler went and whatever terrible things he spewed
from his mouth, that standard was next to him,'' says Mark
Talisman, exhibit director and founding vice president of the
Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.
	   The exhibit was organized by Historical Achievements Museum LLC,
a private company, and the Moscow museum.
	   After leaving Memphis on Jan. 31, the exhibit is to move to San
Diego. It also is expected to travel to New York, Chicago, Miami
and Houston.
	   The exhibit, then with about 500 artifacts, began its U.S. tour
in Washington, D.C., in August. More than 50,000 visitors saw it
during its one-month stay.

 &UR; Laid-back Arapahoe ski area seems to be going to the dogs
	   DILLON, Colorado (AP) _ The Arapahoe Basin ski area is known for
its laid-back, jeans and grunge informality in a sport in which
jackets can cost as much as a house payment.
	   Now it seems to be going to the dogs. Too many skiers are
bringing their pooches and letting them run loose, officials say.
	   Noting a rise in the number of dog bites, with packs of pups
marauding around picnickers and generally creating nuisances, chief
operating officer Jim Gentling has asked the Summit County
commissioners to require all dogs be on leashes.
	   ``It's a skier- and dog-safety issue,'' Gentling says. ``When we
get dogs running around skiers in the mazes and around lift
equipment, it creates a real hazard, not to mention the number of
dogs injured when they're hit by skiers.''
	   Last spring, animal-control officers were called to Arapahoe
Basin at least a dozen times, as dogs and people and hamburger
grills mixed in the area at the base of the mountain known as ``The
Beach.''
	   ``There's just this melee of dogs,'' says Nancy Ring, director
of county animal control.
	   But what about the Basin's laid-back image that draws many to
the area?
	   ``It's part of the legend,'' Ring acknowledges. ``But animal
bites there have been increasing. When you put a dog on a leash and
have it attached to a person, there's more accountability.''

 &UR; Dry forests in Virginia lead to campfire and smoking ban
	   ROANOKE, Virginia (AP) _ Hikers in Virginia's national forests
who want to warm their hands by a campfire and hunters who like to
smoke cigarettes while stalking game can forget about it.
	   Campfires have been banned in the George Washington and
Jefferson national forests because extremely dry weather has
increased the danger of forest fires. Smoking is banned in the
woods unless people are in a vehicle or a building.
	   Stoves, grills and lanterns that use liquid fuel will be
allowed.
	   ``Due to the upcoming hunting seasons, we want to provide an
early alert so people can be prepared,'' said Forest Service
spokesman David Olson.
	   There have been 21 fires in the George Washington and Jefferson
national forests since late August, including some that started
because campfires were not properly extinguished, Olson said.
During the past three years, the number of fires during the same
period ranged from one to six.
	   The restrictions will remain in place until there is a heavy
rain.

 &UR; Don't look for a guitar on Branson's new logo
	   BRANSON, Missouri (AP) _ With more than three dozen theaters and
nearly 80 shows, this is the little town that country music put on
the map.
	   But don't look for a guitar on the town's new logo.
	   The city had considered that, Branson spokesman Jerry Adams
says, but it was felt it would give people the idea that Branson is
only a country music town, an image it is trying to shed.
	   The Board of Aldermen last week unanimously agreed to a design
showing the area's mountains and lakes underneath a field of
musical notes and stars.
	   Within weeks it should be flying on a flag over City Hall, Adams
says.
	   The city of 3,700, incorporated in 1912, got the first of its
dozens of shows in 1969 when the Baldknobbers Jamboree began
offering comedy and country music.
	   ``Our music now extends the spectrum,'' Adams says. ``We are a
lot more than just a country music town.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ National Basketball Association players and
owners apparently on one issue: They are far apart.
	   Claiming owners were making a ``ludicrous'' attempt to influence
individual players, union director Billy Hunter said Friday after a
1 1/2-hour bargaining session that he didn't see the sides getting
back together for at least a week.
	   Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing, who also attended the
negotiating meeting, are angry commissioner David Stern has general
managers and coaches starting to lobby players to accept
management's proposal.
	   ``We're miles apart,'' Hunter said. ``They're trying to
manipulate our players into thinking the proposal they have on the
table is a good proposal and the players should put some leverage
on Patrick and me and the negotiating committee.''
	   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik agreed that nothing
was accomplished.
	   ``The union informed us they were unable to give us a new
proposal, as they had indicated earlier this week,'' Granik said in
a statement. ``We agreed that we are very far apart with no
solution in sight.''
	   On the 129th day of the lockout, Hunter said Stern had directed
GMs and coaches to drive a rift into the union.
	   ``Bad-faith bargaining. No question about it,'' Hunter said.
``Maybe it's just an act of desperation.''
	   With the start of the season pushed back to mid-December at the
earliest, the sides essentially have given up bargaining for now,
making it unlikely games will be played until 1999. Earlier this
week, Stern charged the union leadership cow-towed to high-profile
agents such as David Falk, who represents Michael Jordan and Ewing.
	   ``Their idea is clearly to sweat out players,'' Hunter said.
``He wants to test my resolve and the players' resolve.''
	   Hunter claimed efforts were under way in Boston, Cleveland,
Miami and Milwaukee to get players to support the NBA's latest
plan.
	   ``Until we see some movement from them, there's not going to be
any movement from us,'' Hunter said. ``I don't think they'll be
inclined to negotiate until they're done taking their poll.''
	   In response to management's actions, Hunter said the union will
meet with members next week.
	   ``We're not going to permit the owners unfettered access to our
players in an attempt to manipulate them and then not attempt to
clean the record up,'' he said.
	   Players, who received 57 percent of revenue last season, are
asking for 60 percent. The owners, who wanted to pay no more than
51.8 percent last season, want the percentage scaled back to 50
percent.
	   Hunter said he intends to turn management's tactic around on the
owners.
	   ``I am going to send our proposal with a full explanation to
every GM and we'll send their proposal along so they can compare
the two,'' he said.
	   In the first regular-season work stoppage in NBA history, nine
more games were lost Friday, increasing the total to 34. That's
about the only thing added to the equation.
	   ``This,'' Hunter said, ``wasn't the time to talk about putting
anything else on the table.''

Japanese whaling fleet headed for sanctuary: Greenpeace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A Japanese fleet was on its way
to kill hundreds of whales in a southern oceans whale sanctuary,
environmental group Greenpeace said Saturday.
	   Greenpeace said the whaling fleet would use the excuse of
``scientific research'' to justify its work in the area, which
includes New Zealand's Ross Sea.
	   ``To describe this commercial whaling operation as scientific
research is an insult to science,'' Greenpeace spokeswoman Di Paton
said. ``Japan is catching whales in a whale sanctuary, intending to
open that sanctuary for full scale commercial whaling. This is
straight commercial gain _ not science.''
	   Paton said whalers would slaughter ``hundreds'' of whales in and
around the Ross Sea, move through New Zealand's exclusive economic
zone and refuel in the country.
	   She said the fleet included the Yushin Maru, the first new
whaler built by Japan in 26 years, and referred to by Japanese
media as ``a symbol for the reopening of whaling.''
	   The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) also accused Japan of
defying international opinion by boosting its catch of whales from
recognized sanctuary areas while claiming it was doing so for
scientific research.
	   In a statement the WWF said the recent launch of the
multi-million dollar Yushin Maru showed the country's ``research
whaling'' had become more aggressive.
	   Japan has sent a fleet to the southern ocean for the 12th year
in a row, despite calls by the International Whaling Commission
(IWC) for Japan to stop its whaling there.
	   The southern ocean was in 1994 declared a sanctuary area by the
IWC, to which Japan belongs.
	   In April, the Japanese fleet returned from the Antarctic with
438 minke whales, bringing the total caught in the name of science
since then to 3,767, the WWF said.
	   The IWC has ruled that ``lethal research'' on this scale is
unnecessary.

Death toll rises as Albanian rebels try to assert authority

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Violence in Kosovo is growing
despite a de-facto peace treaty designed to end bloodshed in the
turbulent Serbian province and set the stage for a political
agreement between Serb authorities and Kosovo's majority Albanians.
	   Five suspected ethnic Albanian guerrillas died Friday in a
shootout with Serb police, according to a Serb media statement.
	   The deaths raised the number of Albanians killed since Thursday
afternoon to seven. Foreign observers say attacks by both Serb
forces and Albanian guerrillas have increased this week, as the
United States and European nations try to push ahead with the Oct.
12 agreement reached with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with KLA officials Friday in
Dragobilje, a village 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of
Pristina. Albanian sources said he gave the rebels a draft
political agreement that will restore self-rule for the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo. Hill's office would only say that he
met with the rebels to discuss the peace process.
	   The rebels have rejected any political agreement that stops
short of full independence for Kosovo, although they have
grudgingly agreed to stop fighting if not attacked. Both sides
blame each other for the newest violence.
	   KLA representative Jakup Krasniqi confirmed the meeting with
Hill and said his side would comment on the document once it has
had a chance to review it.
	   Showing its dissatisfaction with the Kosovo peace process, the
KLA said Friday it intends to establish its own civilian rule in
territory it controls.
	   In a statement carried by local media, the guerrilla group said
its military command would form local government institutions,
disregarding both Serbian authorities and established ethnic
Albanian political leaders.
	   Such a move would widen a rift among the majority of Albanians
who support moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, and the minority that
rejects Rugova's nonviolent strategy.
	   Rugova has been elected Kosovo president in elections Serb
authorities consider invalid, and an Albanian assembly also exists,
though it is rarely convened and also is not recognized by Serbian
authorities.
	   At his weekly news conference Friday, Rugova said he hoped a
2,000-strong international monitoring mission led by the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe will provide
security for returning refugees. The mission is expected to be
launched later this month.
	   Milosevic stripped the majority Albanians of self-rule in 1989
in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
That started a period of protests and increased violence that led
to his crackdown on Albanian separatists in February.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes against Serb and Yugoslav forces in Kosovo last month to
force Milosevic to agree to end his offensive, reduce forces to
pre-crackdown levels and allow refugees to return home.
	   The agreement also calls for reaching a political settlement,
and the proposal Hill gave the rebels on Friday was worked out with
moderate Albanian leaders who lack the support of the KLA.
	   Milosevic is showing new defiance. The Serbian government, which
he controls, has rejected attempts by the U.N. War crimes tribunal
to investigate charges of war crimes and atrocities against
civilians in Kosovo.
	   The team was supposed to be headed by the tribunal's chief
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, but she was refused a visa allowing her
into Kosovo.
	   A U.S. State Department expert on war crimes said Friday that
blocking the war crimes tribunal from doing its work means economic
and other sanctions on Yugoslavia would remain locked in place.
	   The expert, David Scheffer, also said the permitting the
investigators into Kosovo was part of the package agreed to by
Milosevic to avert airstrikes, saying NATO ``still has the
authority'' to attack if the agreement is not fully honored.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Hoping to end a six-month
border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea that has flared
repeatedly into combat, African leaders were gathering in this West
African capital to find peace between the two neighbors.
	   The two-day meeting starting Saturday, led by the Organization
of African Unity's mediation committee, follows several failed
efforts by the OAU as well as U.S. and Rwandan officials.
	   The mediation committee, comprised of Burkina Faso President
Blaise Compaore, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and
Djibouti's President Hassan Ghouled Aptidon, was to work out
details of a peace plan Saturday.
	   On Sunday, the group was expected to present the plan _ in
separate meetings _ to Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and
Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki, according to Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary-general of the Organization of Africa Unity.
	   Salim said the two leaders were not expected to meet directly
during the talks.
	   Mohammed Sahnoun, the U.N. special representative to the Great
Lakes region, also was expected to attend, Burkinabe officials said
Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Isaias, speaking Thursday before departing for the talks, said
the only way to end the conflict was to demarcate the common
border.
	   ``We have suggested _ from day one of the conflict _ that we
expedite the process of demarcation, as this is the only solution
to the border dispute,'' Isaias said. ``In the meantime, we have
called for a cease-fire and the cessation of all hostilities. We
have stated repeatedly that we are ready for a mutual disengagement
in as much as this is necessary to prevent the eruption of a
conflict and to facilitate the technical work of demarcation.''
	   Selome Tadesse, the Ethiopian government spokesman, says
Ethiopia remains committed a U.S.-Rwanda peace proposal forwarded
earlier this year, which requires that both sides withdraw to
positions held before hostilities broke out in May.
	   Eritrea, however, rejected that proposal.
	   After a lull in fighting between the two Horn of Africa nations,
sporadic fighting erupted over the past two weeks. On Tuesday,
Eritrean gunners pummeled Shiraro, 1,000 kilometers (625 miles)
northwest of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, killing at least
nine people.
	   On Wednesday, Adigrat, Ethiopia, 600 kilometers (370 miles)
north of Addis Ababa, reportedly was shelled by long-range
artillery, killing one person and wounding an unknown number.
	   Several hundred people have been killed during the six months of
the dispute.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993, but the border between the two countries has
never been officially demarcated.

Island dispute looms large over Japan-Russia summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ They are two giants in international affairs.
Russia spans two continents, stretching from Europe to East Asia.
Japan is home to the world's second largest economy.
	   But for decades the key to their relations has been a few specks
on the map: disputed islands north of Japan once held by Tokyo but
controlled by Moscow since the end of World War II. The dispute is
the main reason the two haven't signed a formal peace treaty for
the war.
	   The fate of the Kuril Islands _ known as the Northern
Territories in Japan _ will loom large when Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi heads to Moscow on Tuesday for a summit with President
Boris Yeltsin.
	   In the balance is a plan mapped out by the two countries at a
summit last year to finally conclude a peace treaty by 2000 and put
firmly behind them wartime hostilities and decades of Cold War
animosity.
	   ``Japan has long considered Russia an enemy because of the
U.S.-Japan alliance,'' said Kiyokazu Koshida, secretary-general of
the Asia-Pacific Research Center, an independent think tank in
Tokyo. ``So it's important to sign a peace treaty.''
	   But few think a treaty is possible so soon _ and the island
dispute is a major reason.
	   Tokyo got legal control of the islands now in dispute _ Etorofu,
Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty with
Russia in 1875. The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days
of World War II, a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal.
	   The islands total only about 4,000 square miles (10,350 square
kilometers), slightly larger than the Caribbean island of Puerto
Rico. The waters around them, however, are rich fishing grounds.
	   The islands were a favorite rallying issue for Japanese
rightists during the Soviet period, and eventual resumption of
Japanese sovereignty over the territory is still a major national
goal.
	   During Obuchi's visit, Yeltsin's government is expected to give
its response to a Japanese proposal offered when the Russian
president came to Japan last April.
	   As a measure of the passions on both sides, Japan has not
released details of its plan, and Russian leaders say their
response will also be kept quiet.
	   But newspaper reports in Japan say Tokyo has proposed drawing a
border with Russia that would run through the middle of one of four
disputed islands. The proposal would leave the question of
possession of that island to further negotiations after the signing
of a peace treaty.
	   As Russia's economic prospects nosedive, a factor besides
national pride has emerged as a key player in the dispute: money.
	   The 17,000 Russian residents of the impoverished islands
reportedly back a petition that calls for leasing the disputed
territory to wealthy Japan for 99 years.
	   And with warming of Tokyo-Moscow relations have come greater
contacts between the islands' inhabitants _ predominantly Russian _
and the Japanese.
	   Japan has agreed to build a dlrs 3.8 million pier on Kunashiri
Island and may also provide diesel generators to some of the
impoverished islands. A Japanese Cabinet minister visited the
islands earlier this year, and the two countries are increasing
military cooperation.
	   Still, despite the heightened contacts, the people of the Kurils
say they would not embrace Japanese rule.
	   A survey by Russia's Vox Populi polling service and Japan's
Asahi newspaper released in late October reported that half of the
island residents questioned said they would move to mainland Russia
if Tokyo took over.

Report: Japanese government to freeze fiscal stringency law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan plans to freeze a law that limits government
spending in an effort to facilitate efforts to spur economic
growth, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The measure will be included in an economic stimulus package
expected to exceed 10 trillion yen (dlrs 85 billion) that is
scheduled to be announced Nov. 16, the mass-circulation Asahi
Shimbun reported.
	   The fiscal reform law law, designed to slash Japan's ballooning
budget deficit to under 3 percent of GDP by 2005, would be frozen
for two years, the Asahi said.
	   The law has been a major stumbling block to further efforts to
lift Japan out of recession with tax cuts and public works
projects.
	   Japan has been mired in a prolonged economic slump, and the
government has vowed drastic measures to prevent the economy from
shrinking in fiscal 1999 for a third consecutive year.

Growing frustration among victims of Hurricane Mitch

	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Survivors of Central America's worst
disaster in memory are pleaded for help as anger grows over the
slow pace of relief in the devastated countryside.
	   Doctors rationed out slim medical supplies Friday to sick and
injured refugees. Though tons of aid poured in from across the
world for victims of Hurricane Mitch, the region's fractured road
system and limited air transportation forced many desperate
survivors to continue waiting.
	   Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter flew over the disaster zones,
and said afterward it could take Nicaragua and Honduras as long as
15 years to recover.
	   He urged the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to
forgive the two countries' vexing foreign debts _ Honduras owes
dlrs 4.2 billion and Nicaragua dlrs 6 billion. Groups in both
countries have called in recent days for cancellation of the debt
in face of the crisis.
	   ``Seen from the air, it is very clear that this disaster is
worse than the earthquake of 1972,'' Carter said, referring to the
magnitude-6.2 quake that killed 5,000 people in Nicaragua. ``I have
known other cases of disaster, and I know the worse is yet to come:
cholera and dengue.''
	   Cholera already has struck, with 25 cases reported in Guatemala,
that country's Public Health Ministry said Friday. The government
increased water-treatment efforts to try to prevent the disease
from spreading.
	   In Posoltega, near where about 2,000 were killed last week in
massive mudslides, six-year-old Justa Pastora Povera Guillen laid
on a cot at a refugee center and shook with fever.
	   Dabbing the girl with a wet cloth, Dr. Rigoberto Sampson gave
her half a tablet of Tylenol and said her yellowish eyes suggested
malaria. There was little he could do.
	   ``We are lacking medicine. We can't give her blood tests to see
whether it's malaria but because of the situation here, I think it
is,'' he said.
	   The devastation ... picks up 7th grf pvs

U.N. experts to decide whether to bring Khmer Rouge to justice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After many years of silence, the United
Nations is sending three experts to Cambodia next week to determine
whether to bring Khmer Rouge leaders to justice for the 1970s
genocide that left an estimated 1.3 million people dead.
	   ``Nothing has been done so far on the horrendous crimes
committed between 1975-79 by the Khmer Rouge. No one has been
arrested for these crimes. There hasn't even been an apology,''
Thomas Hammarberg, the secretary-general's special representative
on human rights in Cambodia, told a news conference Friday.
	   The experts will evaluate the evidence against the Khmer Rouge,
see how it would stand up in any international proceedings, and
consult with Cambodians to assess the desire and feasibility of
bringing Khmer Rouge leaders before a court, he said.
	   ``The end result will hopefully be a proposal from these experts
to the secretary-general and to the Cambodian government ... on how
the international community and the Cambodian society begin to move
on this,'' Hammarberg said.
	   ``It may not end up in anything. It may be just too, too
difficult,'' but Hammarberg said he was hopeful _ ``I think
something will happen.''
	   If there is enough evidence _ and Hammerberg noted that like the
Nazis in World War II the Khmer Rouge left substantial
documentation of their activities _ he expects the experts to
recommend how to proceed.
	   Hammarberg said he envisioned two options: for the Cambodians
themselves to start a trial with international assistance, or for
the international community to set up a tribunal at The Hague in
the Netherlands similar to the one for Yugoslavia.
	   ``For the sake of the Cambodians, it would be interesting if it
could take place there, or very close, because it's a question of
catharsis _ for them to see justice is made,'' he said.
	   The experts will determine if prosecutions should be under the
genocide convention, for crimes against humanity, or under some
other statute, he said.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced the appointment of the
three experts in July: former Australian Governor General Sir
Ninian Stephen, who served on the Yugoslav tribunal and was named
chairman; Rajsoomer Lallah, the U.N.'s human rights investigator
for Myanmar; and Stephen Ratner, a professor at the University of
Texas Law School.
	   The trio have been at the United Nations reading documentation
and attending briefings, and will arrive in Phnom Penh on Nov. 14,
Hammarberg said. They are expected to submit their recommendations
by the end of January, he said.
	   During a meeting last week, Hammarberg said King Sihanouk told
him, ``I want this to happen.'' He said Hun Sen, the de facto
leader of Cambodia, is also very much in favor of bringing the
Khmer Rouge leaders to justice _ as are opposition leaders
including Sam Rainsy and Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   The experts will also consult civic and religious leaders as
well as former politicians, he said.
	   Many of the former Maoist-inspired Khmer Rouge guerrillas ended
years of civil war in 1996. Their chief, Ieng Sary, received a
pardon in exchange for halting the fighting and leading his men out
of the jungle. Amnesty has also been granted to other top
guerrillas to make peace.
	   But three high-ranking holdouts are still roaming the Thai
border with a few hundred guerrillas and remain wanted. Longtime
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in April of a purported heart
attack.

Gingrich's career: A walk on the wild side
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By DONALD M. ROTHBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Newt Gingrich's meteoric career has always
been a walk on the wild side.
	   He arrived at the U.S. Capitol in January 1979, a brash
Republican freshman from a traditionally Democratic state who told
all who would listen that the Democrats were in decline, a
vulnerable party that had lost touch with the American people.
	   Democrats laughed him off. So did the Republican establishment.
	   But 16 years later, no one was laughing when Gingrich accepted
the speaker's gavel, the first Republican to wield it in 40 years.
The leader of a successful political revolution had his chance to
govern.
	   What followed was a period of wild highs and lows.
	   ``Following Newt has been like watching a roller coaster,'' said
Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute. ``He's had more highs that are high and more lows that
are low than anyone other than Bill Clinton.''
	   When the Republicans took control of Congress, Clinton was at
one of his low points, speculating aloud about his own relevance.
Gingrich was riding high, pushing House enactment of the Republican
Contract With America, a conservative manifesto the speaker was
convinced represented the will of the American people.
	   Through most of 1995, the political battle was defined as a
struggle between the Democratic president and the Republican
speaker.
	   But the speaker made a major blunder in a budget battle with the
president when Gingrich refused to yield ground and the government
shut down.
	   To make matters worse, Gingrich suggested at one point in the
budget battle that he acted out of anger after Clinton didn't
invite him to the front of Air Force One on a flight to Israel and
back for the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin.
	   ``It reinforced the notion of a mean-spirited Republican
leadership,'' said Ornstein.
	   Clinton rebounded from his 1994 and 1995 low point and was
re-elected in 1996. But Republicans still controlled Congress and
the struggle between the president and the speaker was not over.
	   Clinton's presidency was endangered again, this time by a sex
scandal that brought calls for his resignation and initiated an
impeachment inquiry.
	   Even prominent Democrats harshly criticized the president for
his relationahip with Monica Lewinsky.
	   Gingrich orchestrated the push for impeachment, apparently
giving little weight to opinion polls that suggested a wide
majority of Americans, while critical of the president's behavior,
opposed any effort to remove him.
	   As the 1998 election drew closer, what seemed like a disaster
for Democrats turned into a political problem for Republicans.
	   Gingrich persevered and approved a multi-million-dollar
advertising campaign that focused on Clinton's personal problems.
	   On Election Day, voters spoke. Their verdict was a Democratic
victory, a stunning defeat for Republicans. For the first time
since 1934, the president's party won House seats in a mid-term
election.
	   In the wake of the election, Gingrich was under seige within his
own party. Rep. Bob Livingston, chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, announced he would challenge Gingrich for
speaker. Others were also considering running against him.

German conservatives look to renewal after election defeat

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Faced with their worst showing in a
national election in nearly a half-century, Germany's conservative
Christian Democrats are plotting a future without Helmut Kohl.
	   About 1,000 party delegates meet Saturday to discuss their new
role as the German opposition following the party's Sept. 27 loss
in national elections that unseated the chancellor after a record
16 years in office.
	   The party is expected to elect Kohl's hand-picked successor,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, as its chairman, with the former chancellor
relinquishing the post he held a quarter century.
	   The meeting is also a part of the nation's farewell to its
longest-serving chancellor this century, whose bulky presence
defined German politics from Oct. 1, 1982 until his defeat by
Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder six weeks ago.
	   Schaeuble, as Kohl's protege is the point man for rejuvenating
and modernizing the party after its worst showing in a national
election in 49 years.
	   ``One should not have any illusions about the enormity of the
challenge,'' Schaeuble said recently.
	   With Kohl gone, the gates have been opened for a group of young
dissenters who lay the party's election defeat at his feet, saying
he lost touch with the national mood by pushing historic goals such
as German unification and a single European Union currency.
	   Known as the ``Wild Youth,'' many in their 40s, they chafed
under the 68-year-old Kohl's iron-fisted hold on the party and now
want a piece of the leadership pie.
	   One of them, the party chief in Lower Saxony, 39-year-old
Christian Wulff, is expected to be elected to one of the four
deputy chairmanships. Most other top leadership posts are also
being cleared for fresher faces.
	   With Kohl's uniting force gone, the Christian Democrats are
struggling for direction as they move to the role of opposition for
the next four years.
	   Many of the new leaders say the Christian Democrats must reach
out more to intellectuals, environmentalists and labor unions.
	   But the ecology-minded Greens, the junior partner in Schroeder's
government, scoffed at a recent Schaeuble suggestion they could
possibly join up with Christian Democrats to govern Germany in the
future.

Survival of the fittest as United States wins Nations Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARGARET LILLARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a competition that looked more like a
demonstration of survival of the fittest than a show jumping class,
the United States won the Nations Cup on Friday in the 115th annual
National Horse Show.
	   The long, narrow confines of the Madison Square Garden arena
have always made the National's courses difficult, and the
tradition was upheld when only one rider went clear in each of the
two rounds.
	   The USET's Eric Hasbrouck, riding Miss Fio in the second round,
had the only faultless ride as he led the United States to a
comeback victory with 32 total faults over the two rounds.
	   ``Any time indoors, especially here, it's small,'' Hasbrouck
said. ``You're in a pinball machine, bouncing off the walls. Things
come up very quick. It's fine if you're going well, but if
something particular goes wrong, the whole thing goes wrong.''
	   Tani Tops-Zeidler had put Canada ahead in the first round with a
clear ride, though she and Sarvos had one fault for going over the
time allowed. The Canadians ended up with 68 faults total.
	   France fell out of competition when Philippe Leoni's Easyboy
proved anything but, refusing his way to elimination in both
rounds, and Patrice Delaveau withdrew when Athos du Vallot proved
balky in the second round.
	   Each team had similar war stories. Canadian novice Frankie
Chesler ran through nearly as many jumps than she cleared with
Ravenna Z, collecting 28.5 faults in the first round and 28 in the
second.
	   The USET's Margie Golstein-Engle was thrown from Hidden Creek's
Alvaretto in the first round when he popped over a jump in the
middle of what was otherwise a good run.
	   ``Aside from the one jump, he jumped beautifully _ and that was
the smallest jump out there,'' she said. ``I think there was
someone standing on the other side, and ... he just got up in the
air and kind of got distracted.''
	   She didn't have to ride in the second round when Alison
Firestone, aboard Major, and Leslie Burr-Howard, on After Eight,
had only four faults each to go with Hasbrouck's zero.
	   Course designer Jose ``Pepe'' Gamara of Bolivia said he tried to
keep the course fair for each team without making it too easy.
	   ``When you are in New York at a (Nations Cup), you've got to
keep a certain standard,'' he said. ``I thought I was going to have
more clear rounds. ... I hope I can get out of here alive on
Sunday.''
	   International and open riders were competing late Friday in the
dlrs 10,000 Lexus Accumulator, in which riders accumulate points by
clearing increasingly difficult jumps.
	   The National ends Sunday with the dlrs 50,000 Budweiser Grand
Prix of New York.

Blast kills 2 bombers, injures 21 others, peace accord put on hold

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has condemned
as ``criminal'' a suicide bombing that killed the two assailants,
injured 21 people at an open-air market and prompted the Israeli
Cabinet to put off action on the new peace accord.
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,''
Arafat said after Friday's attack in a rare direct appeal to the
Israeli people on Israel TV.
	   He added that he would ``exert 100-percent effort'' to track
down those involved.
	   The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for
Friday's attack, the second suicide-bombing since the signing of
the land-for-security accord two weeks ago. A week ago Thursday, an
assailant tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus carrying
Jewish schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip.
	   However, Palestinian security officials said that it was members
of the militant Islamic Jihad group that carried out the attack.
The officials identified one of the assailants as Yusef Ali
Mohammed Zughayar, 18, of Anata, a refugee camp north of Jerusalem.
Justice Minister Tshahi Hanegbi said the second assailant came from
the Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton denounced the attack as an
``outrageous and cowardly act by enemies of peace'' and expressed
hope it would not derail the accord.
	   Arafat also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express
his sorrow.
	   But the Israeli leader told Arafat that for the peace process to
continue, the Palestinians would have to significantly step up
their war against terrorists, a statement by Netanyahu's office
said.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet also condemned the attack following its
meeting Friday night but added that Israel should not use it as an
excuse to halt the peace process.
	   The Mahane Yehuda market _ several square blocks of narrow,
stone-walled lanes and wooden stalls heaped high with fruit,
vegetables and spices _ was packed with shoppers making last-minute
purchases before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   The blast sent a billowing cloud of black smoke pouring into the
air. Shoppers _ many of them Orthodox Jews clad in sweeping skirts
or long black frock coats _ fled in panic, some scattering their
purchases on the street.
	   At the market's entrance, the assailants' red Fiat was reduced
to a mass of twisted metal, with only the steering column left
intact. Next to it was a charred body cut nearly in half by the
force of the blast; a few feet (meters) away was a second body,
barelegged and face down in a pool of blood.
	   Witnesses' accounts suggested the blast had gone off
prematurely, perhaps averting a much larger loss of life.
	   Onlookers said they saw smoke and flames coming from the car and
heard a series of popping explosions before a larger blast shook
the area. By then, people had already started running away.
	   ``When the big explosion went, there were not that many people
nearby,'' said witness Yaakov Shlomo. ``That was a miracle from
heaven.''
	   Almost all the injuries were minor, from flying debris; by
nightfall seven people remained hospitalized.
	   Blasted-apart suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel
radio reported, suggesting that the attackers had perhaps intended
to carry parcels of explosives deep into the crowd. That method was
used to deadly effect in an attack at the market 16 months ago that
killed the two suicide-bombers and 16 others.
	   Israeli officials acknowledged the toll was remarkably light for
an attack surely meant to kill and maim many, but said it still
showed the daily danger Israelis face from Islamic militants.
	   ``We can't depend on miracles _ we need to fight the cycle of
terrorism,'' said Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai. He and other
Cabinet ministers, who were in the midst of debate over ratifying
the agreement at the time of the attack, cut short their session
and did not schedule a date for resumption.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said he still expected
the accord to be ratified eventually. But the suspension of debate
will almost certainly bring delays in the tightly timed 12-week
schedule for implementation.
	   The Cabinet said it would take up the accord again only after
verifying ``that the Palestinian Authority is taking vigorous steps
for an all-out war against terrorist organizations.''
	   Immediately after the bombing, small but furious protests by
right-wing Israelis broke out. ``Death to Arabs! Death to Arafat!''
a dozen or more demonstrators shouted from behind the police
barricades. Several were arrested.

Militants pull out all stops to halt accord that targets militants

 &UR; RETRANSMITS to conform to digest &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Islamic militants are pulling out all the stops
to keep the new U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace accord from
becoming reality.
	   In recent days, suicide-bombers have attacked an Israeli school
bus in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's outdoor market. Grenades were
hurled at a bus stop in the southern city of Beersheba.
	   But the failure of those attacks and others to inflict major
casualties marks a change from past terrorist spectacles and is an
indication that Israeli and Palestinian efforts may have already
weakened the militants.
	   In Friday's market attack, which was claimed by the largest
militant group Hamas, Israel radio quoted police as describing the
explosives as an ``amateur bomb'' contained in a suitcase. It
killed the two bombers and inju and, in recent weeks,
by Palestinian security forces as well have led to the arrest of
key leaders and the killing of expert bomb makers.
	   ``There is a weakness both in the explosives used and the
engineers, the experts who can put together the bomb, and there is
also a problem in the quality of the terrorist themselves,'' he
said, adding recent attackers appeared poorly trained.
	   Abdel-Satter Qassem, a professor at An Najah University in the
West Bank town of Nablus who is familiar with the thinking of the
Islamic leadership, said Friday's attack came in response to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's recent crackdown on Hamas. As
part of that campaign, Hamas founder and spiritual leader, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, was placed under house arrest last week.
	   ``It is a message (to Arafat) that if you are going to keep your
promises to the Israelis and hit hard on Islamists there will be a
response that will curb your efforts to reach agreement with
Israel,'' Qassem said.
	   He said last week's Gaza car bomb that narrowly missed a school
bus with 40 children aboard was in response to Israel's killing of
two Hamas leaders, Adel and Imad Awadallah in September, and the
death of master bomb maker Mohiyedine Sharif in March.
	   Perry and another former Shin Bet chief, Carmi Gilon, said the
Israeli Cabinet decision to suspend consideration of the Mideast
peace deal reached at the Wye summit in Maryland was a mistake that
only encouraged Hamas and other groups.
	   Gilon said the aim of the militants was to ``ruin the whole
process. I'm just sorry our Cabinet made such a decision which is
exactly the aim of Hamas _ to stop Wye.''
	   In 1995 and 1996, a series of suicide-bombings by Islamic
militants claimed scores of Israeli lives and halted the peace
process, bringing to power the hard-line government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Arafat's police rounded up the
militants then, but the activists were later released from jail.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said it was impossible
to continue the troop withdrawal process because Arafat's forces
were doing so little.
	   He predicted tha Palestinian Authority,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   At a rally in the Gaza Strip several hours after Friday's market
bombing, a former Hamas activist who is now in Arafat's Cabinet
said Netanyahu's policies, such as building Jewish settlements in
the West Bank, were to blame for the attacks.
	   ``We want to tell him that if you put pressure on the
Palestinian people and against the Palestinian organizations, those
groups will point their arrows against you,'' Communications
Minister Imad Falouji told the crowd.
	   Falouji shared a platform with Abdallah Shami, leader of the
Islamic Jihad, a militant group sponsored by Iran, who affirmed
``our right to fight the occupiers as our religion and laws
dictate.''
	   Many in the crowd cheered.

	   KAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) _ Fumie Suguri of Japan, in her
first senior meet outside her homeland, surprised by getting the
top marks in the Skate Canada women's singles short program Friday
night.
	   ``Yes, really, really,'' the 17-year-old skater replied when
asked if she was surprised to be ahead of more experienced
competitors. ``I can't believe it.''
	   Elena Liashenko of Ukraine was second and Irina Slutskaya of
Russia third.
	   With two-thirds of the total mark still available in the
free-skate final, any one of the top three can win the gold and the
dlrs 30,000 first prize by getting top marks Saturday night.
	   Besides the women's final, the men's singles and pairs events
conclude Saturday night. Ice dancing's free dances and the parade
of champions are Sunday.
	   Suguri and Liashenko skated clean 2 1/2-minute programs, which
included the best triple Lutz-double toe loop jump combinations.
Six judges had Suguri first and the other three opted for
Liashenko.
	   ``This is the first time I can do in the competition what I do
in practice,'' she said. ``In junior, I missed a lot (of jumps). I
could do them in practice, but not in competitions.''
	   Suguri, 17, is competing in her second senior meet. She was
fifth in the NHK Trophy meet in Japan last fall.
	   Her choreographer is Lori Nichol of Canada, who designed the
short program to classical music by Liszt. Suguri's coaches
approached Nichol three years ago because Suguri's favorite skater
is another Nichol skater, Michelle Kwan. Suguri worked in Toronto
with Nichol last summer.
	   Liashenko, 22, was ninth in the Olympics and seventh in the
world championships last season.
	   Slutskaya, 19, has been among the sport's more consistent
competitors. The 1995 world junior champion has finished fifth or
better in her last 16 senior meets, winning medals in 12. She was
third in the 1996 world championships, fourth in 1997 and second to
Kwan in 1998 after a fifth-place Olympics.
	   Her chance of winning this event took a dive when she two-footed
a jump landing and fell on another. She got mostly 5.0s on the top
line, and even artistic marks of 5.5 to 5.8 could not rescue her.
	   Total prize money is dlrs 264,000 in the second of six events in
the International Skating Union's Grand Prix series. Skaters can
accumulate points from two of the meets to qualify for the series
final in St. Petersburg, Russia, in March.

	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Chris Chelios scored a power-play goal
with 16:05 left in the third period as the Chicago Blackhawks tied
the Tampa Bay Lightning 2-2 Friday night.
	   Vincent Lecavalier, the top pick in the 1998 draft, and veteran
defenseman Kjell Samuelsson each scored a goal to give the
Lightning a 2-0 lead. It was Samuelsson's first goal since Jan. 7,
1997.
	   The Blackhawks snapped an 0-for-16 road power-play drought on
Tony Amonte's eighth goal at 16:44 of the second period to pull
Chicago within a goal. Chelios then ruined a sparkling performance
by Lightning goaltender Bill Ranford, blasting home a slap shot
from the high slot.
	   The Lightning are 5-2-1 over the last eight games. Chicago,
which stopped a four-game losing streak, is winless in the past
seven games against Tampa Bay (0-5-2).
 &UR; Hurricanes 3, Capitals 2
	   In Washington, Mark Tinordi deflected the puck into his own net
with 8:32 to play, lifting the Carolina Hurricanes over the
Capitals.
	   Backing up while fending off Martin Gelinas, Tinordi
accidentally moved his right skate into the path of Sami Kapanen's
centering pass, sending the puck just inside the right post.
	   The victory kept the surprising Hurricanes, who beat the New
York Islanders on the road the night before, in first place in the
Southeast Division, while the injury-riddled and preseason division
favorite Capitals stayed in the cellar with a six-game winless
streak.
	   The victory broke a seven-game road winless streak for the
Hurricanes against the Capitals, who hadn't won in Washington since
March 26, 1995, when they were the Hartford Whalers.

Sale of Marlins complete _ Henry signs papers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Commodities trader John Henry completed his dlrs
150 million purchase of the Florida Marlins on Friday, less than 48
hours after he said the deal was dead.
	   Following two days of public feuding over stalled negotiations,
Henry and Marlins owner Wayne Huizenga put aside their differences
and closed the sale soon after resuming talks.
	   ``I signed documents tonight, so the deal is done,'' Henry said
while attending a team banquet. ``The process is over with. This
has been a dream I've had for a long time. I'm just a little
overcome by the whole thing.''
	   The 49-year-old Henry, a multimillionaire commodities trader
from Boca Raton, Florida bought the troubled professional baseball
franchise for dlrs 150 million cash and also agreed to pay dlrs 8
million for renovations at Pro Player Stadium.
	   Henry, weary of Huizenga's gamesmanship in negotiations, this
week said the deal was off and scheduled a news conference for
Saturday, presumably to announce he was withdrawing his offer. That
news conference was canceled late Friday.
	   ``Wayne and I met a couple of hours ago in his office,'' Henry
said. ``We hugged each other, and we had some laughs.''
	   For weeks, the contentious negotiations were played out in
public, creating a new spectator sport in South Florida. During a
news conference Thursday, Huizenga accused Henry of negotiating

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two years ago, a 9-year-old boy was astounded
when his great-grandmother mentioned she had a baseball signed by
Babe Ruth.
	   But that wasn't all _ she said it was the first home run ever
hit at Yankee Stadium. So, it was researched, authenticated and is
now up for sale.
	   It could fetch an estimated dlrs 100,000 when auctioned
Thursday. Not bad for 5.4 ounces of horsehide and twine that's been
in a cardboard box in Viola Bevilacque's Irvington, New Jersey
attic for nearly 50 years.
	   This is all very exciting to great-grandson Chris, now 11. Not
to mention his father, Mark Scala, who owns the ball and stands to
get most of the money.
	   The ball, which bears Ruth's signature and the inscription
``First Home Run Hit At Yankee Stadium April 18, 1923,'' was all
but forgotten until Chris dressed up as ``The Babe'' for a school
project.
	   Mrs. Bevilaque told him she had a ball signed by the Yankees
slugger that was given to her late husband, Charles, as a prize in
1927. No one knows for sure who caught the ball.
	   ``I loved going up in that attic,'' Mark Scala said at a news
conference Friday. ``I played there as a kid.''
	   The attic was full of clothes, lamps and furniture. And one very
important cardboard box that housed the Ruth-signed ball and three
other beat-up baseballs.
	   Scala did some research and eventually took the ball to his
lawyer. He later contacted Leland's, a sports memorabilia seller,
which used the ball's ``Reach'' logo, its alternating red and blue
stitching, and Ruth's own handwriting to determine its
authenticity.
	   Now Mark Scala, saying he has to think about his family's future
and the education of his two children, has put the ball up for sale
with Leland's.
	   Peter Clark, curator of collections at the Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, New York said he had not seen the ball and could
not vouch for its authenticity.
	   ``We would have to do some investigation on our own,'' he said,
adding such a procedure normally is not done unless the memorabilia
is donated to the Hall of Fame.
	   Bidding on the Ruth ball is already open by telephone, fax and
e-mail, but the ball won't actually be sold to the highest bidder
until Thursday.

China's tobacco regulator sentenced to death for corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese court has sentenced to death a senior
government official in charge of the tobacco industry for taking 1
million yuan (dlrs 120,000) from a cigarette maker, state-run media
reported Saturday.
	   The Beijing Intermediate People's Court issued the death
sentence for Deng Chengshan on Friday but suspended the punishment
for two years. The reprieve is to allow Deng to show repentance and
have his sentence commuted to a prison term.
	   Deng pleaded not guilty and vowed to appeal his conviction, the
China Daily reported.
	   Deng is one of the most senior central government officials
caught in a fitful campaign the ruling Communist Party launched
against corruption over five years ago.
	   As director of the State Planning Commission office that granted
quotas to cigarette makers, Deng wielded tremendous influence over
a hugely profitable industry. China is the world's largest
cigarette market, with an estimated 320 million smokers.
	   Prosecutors argued that Deng asked the Yuxi Hongta Tobacco Co.
Ltd., one of China's largest, for money, claiming the commission
was short of funds to decorate its offices, state media reports
said.
	   Deng returned the money to the company when he learned he was
under investigation in May 1997. In court he claimed that he only
borrowed the money to help a friend's ailing business, China Daily
said.

<TEXT>
	   KAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) _ Fumie Suguri of Japan
surprised by getting the top marks in the Skate Canada women's
singles short program Friday night.
	   ``Yes, really, really,'' the 17-year-old skater replied when
asked if she was surprised to be ahead of more experienced
competitors. ``I can't believe it.''
	   Elena Liashenko of Ukraine was second and Irina Slutskaya of
Russia third.
	   With two-thirds of the total mark still available in the
free-skate final, any one of the top three can win the gold and the
dlrs 30,000 first prize by getting top marks Saturday night.
	   Besides the women's final, the men's singles and pairs events
conclude Saturday night. Ice dancing's free dances and the parade
of champions are Sunday.
	   Suguri and Liashenko skated clean 2 1/2-minute programs, which
included the best triple Lutz-double toe loop jump combinations.
Six judges had Suguri first and the other three opted for
Liashenko.
	   ``This is the first time I can do in the competition what I do
in practice,'' she said. ``In junior, I missed a lot (of jumps). I
could do them in practice, but not in competitions.''
	   Suguri, 17, is competing in her second senior meet. She was
fifth in the NHK Trophy meet in Japan last fall.
	   Her choreographer is Lori Nichol of Canada, who designed the
short program to classical music by Liszt. Suguri's coaches
approached Nichol three years ago because Suguri's favourite skater
is another Nichol skater, Michelle Kwan. Suguri worked in Toronto
with Nichol last summer.
	   Liashenko, 22, was ninth in the Olympics and seventh in the
world championships last season.
	   Slutskaya, 19, has been among the sport's more consistent
competitors. The 1995 world junior champion has finished fifth or
better in her last 16 senior meets, winning medals in 12. She was
third in the 1996 world championships, fourth in 1997 and second to
Kwan in 1998 after a fifth-place Olympics.
	   Her chance of winning this event took a dive when she two-footed
a jump landing and fell on another. She got mostly 5.0s on the top
line, and even artistic marks of 5.5 to 5.8 could not rescue her.
	   Total prize money is dlrs 264,000 in the second of six events in
the International Skating Union's Grand Prix series. Skaters can
accumulate points from two of the meets to qualify for the series
final in St. Petersburg, Russia, in March.
	   In ice dance competition Friday night, top-seeded Shae-Lynn
Bourne and Victor Kraatz of Canada strengthened their hold on first
place by earning top original dance marks.

Hearns begins comeback with win at age 40
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Thomas Hearns, at the age of 40, still looked
like the Hit Man of old Friday night.
	   Hearns (58-4-1), attempting a comeback as a cruiserweight,
needed just 88 seconds to knock out Jay Snyder in front of about
7,000 adoring fans at Joe Louis Arena.
	   It was the third time this year the 37-year-old Snyder has been
knocked out in the first round.
	   There were few punches thrown in the first minute. Then it was
show time.
	   Hearns unleashed a three-punch combination that rocked Snyder.
He finished him off with a looping overhand right that caused
Hearns to slip _ leaving both boxers on the canvas for a moment.
	   The difference was that Hearns bounced right back up. Snyder was
flat on his back for about two minutes. Handlers finally got him up
on a stool in the middle of the ring where he sat for over five
minutes in the middle of a mob of Hearns well-wishers who rushed
the ring to celebrate.
	   It was the first fight for Hearns since Nov. 29, 1996, when he
stopped Karl Willis in five rounds.
	   ``I'm really disappointed because I really thought I had a
chance to take him out,'' Snyder said. ``That was no slip. I hit
him with a left hand on the chin, and the left isn't even my power.
I knew I had to jump right on him, because if I stayed outside,
he'd kill me with his reach.
	   ``But, as it is, he broke my nose. And then he knocked me out
with a punch, it looked like it was on the temple.''
	   The bout had been scheduled for 10 rounds.
	   Snyder (19-6), who picked up the nickname ``Swamp Man'' during a
Toughman contest about 10 years ago, was at a decided height and
reach disadvantage to the 6-foot-1 Hearns. At 5-8, Snyder only came
up to the Hit Man's chin.
	   Hearns, who weighed 147 points when he made his professional
debut in 1977, carried close to 195 pounds into the ring against
Snyder, who works as a maintenance supervisor at a manufacturing
plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina.
	   His goal during this comeback is to fight four times and
eventually earn the cruiserweight championship. If he succeeds, it
would be the eighth world title for Hearns in welterweight,
middleweight, light heavyweight and upper-middleweight divisions.
	   Hearns won his last crown in 1995 with a first-round knockout of
Lenny Lapaglia for the World Boxing Union cruiserweight
championship. This time, he would like to win either the WBA or WBC
cruiserweight titles.
	   Hearns, who weighed about 200 pounds (90 kilos) when he began
working out about two months ago, wasn't the puncher he used to be.
But it didn't matter in this bout.
