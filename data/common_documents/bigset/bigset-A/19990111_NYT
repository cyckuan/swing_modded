   LOS ANGELES _ Everything you wanted to know about the NFL's
Final Four and didn't have the time or interest to ask:
</P>
<P>
   So, will a team that plays in a dome win a Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   It's too cloudy to tell right now. But a dome team will finally
play in one. The Vikings and Falcons both play indoors. Frankly,
this might be a bogus stat. After all, seven teams that normally
play on grass have won the seven indoor Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   How much of an advantage is there for teams hosting NFC and AFC
title games?
</P>
<P>
   It's money, with an asterisk. Since 1970, the home team has won
39 of 56 title games. But last year, both home teams lost, Denver
upsetting Pittsburgh and Green Bay winning in San Francisco. Over
the same period, teams favored in title games have won 39 of 55
games, and Minnesota and Denver are favored.
</P>
<P>
   Will the games be competitive?
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope _ more so than Denver-Miami and Minnesota-Arizona. If
history repeats itself, the NFC game will be a rout and the AFC
game will be a war. The winning margin in the last seven NFC title
games, and 13 of the last 14, has been 10 points or more. The only
exception since 1984 was the Giants' 15-13 upset of the 49ers in
1990. Three of the last four AFC games were decided by four points
or less.
</P>
<P>
   How much of a shock is it to see the Vikings and Falcons in the
NFC title game?
</P>
<P>
   It's like the sun rising in the West. Dating back to the 1981
season, 29 of the 34 available berths in the NFC title game went to
just six teams _ San Francisco (10), Dallas (6), Washington (5),
Green Bay (3), Chicago (3) and the New York Giants (2). Those six
teams also accounted for all but two of the last 17 Super Bowl
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Teams earning the other five berths all lost, too _ Carolina,
Detroit, Minnesota and the Rams (twice).
</P>
<P>
   What's the most shocking stat about these four teams?
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Rich Kotite, the Jets went 1-15 in 1996.
Two years later, with 17 players remaining from that team, they're
13-4, AFC East champs, and playing Denver in the AFC title game.
This, of course, has nothing to do with the coaching of Kotite and
Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   How do Cinderfellas perform in January?
</P>
<P>
   Few teams go from pumpkins to princes. Three of the four teams
remaining didn't make the playoffs last year, but only one was
under .500.
</P>
<P>
   Three teams went from sub-.500 seasons in 1995 to the 1996
season's Final Four: New England (6-10), Jacksonville (4-12) and
Carolina (7-9). In 1991, Denver (5-11) and Detroit (6-10) both made
the title games (and lost) after poor 1990 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Only one team has gone from sub-.500 to Super Bowl champ _ the
1981 49ers. They went from 6-10 in 1980 to 13-3. The Bengals, the
team the 49ers beat in the Super Bowl, also was 6-10 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Which coach has the postseason mojo?
</P>
<P>
   That would be Mr. Tuna. Parcells' 11-5 record in postseason play
is fourth best among all coaches with 10 or more postseason
appearances, trailing Vince Lombardi (9-1), Joe Gibbs (16-5) and
Bill Walsh (10-4). Parcells is the only coach in Jets history over
.500. Parcells has 22 wins in two seasons. In the previous seven
seasons (1990-96) before his arrival, the Jets were 36-77.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a crowded field. Mike Shanahan won a Super Bowl last
year and is making his ninth appearance in an NFC or AFC title
game. Since becoming the Broncos' coach, he is 52-18, which has to
make Al Davis wonder how life might have changed if he hadn't
gassed Shanahan after 20 games (he was 8-12 as the Raiders head
coach).
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves won 117 games as the Broncos coach and got the mules
to three Super Bowls during his 12 years (losing all three). He's
taking his third team to the postseason, and the Falcons are a
stunning 20-3 in their last 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have perhaps the most audaciously bad coaching
history in the league. Their former leaders include Norb Hecker
(four wins in 31 games), Norm Van Brocklin (seven years, 37 wins,
no playoff games), Marion Campbell (17-51 in two separate stints),
Pat Peppler (3-6), Leeman Bennett (47-44 and one of the Falcons'
three franchise playoff wins), Dan Henning (22-41), Jim Hanifan
(0-4), Jerry Glanville (28-38, 1-1 in the postseason) and June
Jones (19-30).
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Green is the short straw here. He's 2-5 in the playoffs,
and those wins came against the Giants last season and Cardinals
this.
</P>
<P>
   What position did these coaches play in college?
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was a quarterback at South Carolina, Green a running back
at Iowa, Parcells a linebacker at Wichita State, and Shanahan a
wishbone quarterback/defensibe back at Eastern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any particular trend to look for?
</P>
<P>
   It's more likely that a trend will be broken. Since they began
playing Super Bowls, there's never been a suspicious quarterback
winner. The closest you could find would be Mark Rypien and Jeff
Hostetler.
</P>
<P>
   This year's quarterbacks include Chris Chandler, who was 35-49
as a starter coming into 1998; Vinny Testaverde, 48-83-1 prior to
'98; and Randall Cunningham, 64-45-1 as a starter but the owner of
a 1-4 playoff record before Sunday. If you're betting this trend,
then you unload on Denver and John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Super Bowl be decided by a kicker?
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely. Only two have come down to a field goal. Jim
O'Brien's field goal in overtime won Super Bowl V for Baltimore,
and Scott Norwood's miss cost Buffalo in Super Bowl XXV. The
Vikings and Broncos have the best kicking units. This area is the
Jets' biggest deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Which Super Bowl record is most likely to fall?
</P>
<P>
   If the Vikings and Broncos meet, it could be the record of 75
points in a game by both teams, set by the 49ers and Chargers. Or
so we hope. &QL;

WEST SAYS NBA PLAN IS A MODEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The way Lakers vice president Jerry West sees it,
the NBA's new labor agreement could serve as a framework for any
future pact between owners and players in other professional
leagues, especially baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's Board of Governors Thursday voted 29-0 in favor of an
agreement that essentially sets a cap on what individual players
can earn annually. The agreement is a first among professional
leagues in that it limits player earnings, not team spending.
</P>
<P>
   West believes the agreement will bolster competition in the NBA
because teams in New York and Los Angeles can't simply use higher
salaries to lure quality players from cities in less glamorous
locations like Washington, D.C., and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   A similar agreement may be needed to increase competition in
Major League Baseball, where players like the Dodgers' Kevin Brown
earn more in one season than the entire roster of teams in smaller
markets like Montreal and Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the NBA has done better than any of the other
leagues,'' West said. ``If I were (a baseball fan) I would really
be concerned about how some of these other teams are going to
compete with some of the huge market teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be concerned about the quality of the product when you
have one player on one team making more than the whole roster on
another team,'' he continued. ``I think basketball has addressed
that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, which survived an ugly strike in 1994 that forced the
cancellation of the World Series, will have to enter labor
negotiations earlier than the other major sports. The current
contract between owners and players expires in 2000. The players'
union has an option to extend the contract through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball isn't likely to impose NBA-like salary caps -- in
spite of the disparity that exists among teams in the league today,
officials on both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry West didn't become one of the greatest basketball
players in the history of the sport by spending time studying the
inner workings of the baseball industry,'' said Gene Orza, an
official with the Major League Baseball Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that there might be one or two baseball owners
that might like to have this deal, that places a limit on what a
player can earn irrespective of their worth,'' Orza said. ``But I
wouldn't hold my breath on it happening in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, officials with Major League Baseball will scrutinize
the NBA deal once it is finalized, said MLB spokesman Richard
Levin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every league keeps an eye on the other leagues,'' Levin said.
``But what applies to one league doesn't necessarily apply to
another. I just wouldn't want to discuss possibilities for
baseball's future right now.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with the National Hockey League expressed similar
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the NBA agreement isn't even on paper, it's
entirely too premature to make any expressions regarding its
impact,'' NHL vice president Frank Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the National Football League's labor agreement,
originally ratified in 1993, is a lot like the one the NBA is about
to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The pact, which extends past the spring 2004 college draft,
includes among its provisions a hard salary cap that is strictly
enforced. Also helping the league is the fact that all 30 teams
share network television revenues. In baseball, each team is free
to negotiate its own television package.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a system that has supported competitive balance and
allowed all the teams to have an equal opportunity,'' NFL spokesman
Greg Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   As for West's comments:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's talking about the NFL,'' Aiello said.
``(The NBA) did some things just like we have already done: They
increased minimum salaries; they strengthened their drug program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate to have this kind of structure. It's not
perfect, but probably better off than some other professional
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the impact of the recently agreed upon NBA settlement,
baseball is going to have to consider the impact of the widening
gap between its rich teams and its poor ones. There's no doubt that
disparity will be an issue when the bargaining begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any secret to anybody in professional
athletics that there's certain disparities that have to be
considered,'' said Angels spokesman Tim Mead. ``I think everybody
is acutely aware of the problem, I just don't know how many
individuals have the correct solution for baseball. That remains to
be seen.''

<P>
   COLOMBIA-VILLAGE (San Vicente Del Caguan) _ In the streets, the
campesinos of San Vicente del Caguan dared a quiet pride and even
hope, seeing luminaries from the nation's capital and around Latin
America descend on their town for a giant party to begin talks with
leftist rebels this week. ``Laboratory for peace,'' said banners
strung across the airport and around the square, where the
government and leftist rebels have opened talks toward peace. The
signs did not refer so much to the national feelers to end the

way to the United States. Gonzalez, who proudly calls himself a
recovering alcoholic, directs a small drug rehabilitation center in
the downtrodden neighborhood that surrounds the city's Basilica de

exploded, from about 35,000 full-time sales representatives and
supervisors in the top 40 pharmaceutical companies in 1994 to more
than 56,000 this year, according to the Scott-Levin consulting firm
in Pennsylvania. Pharmaceutical companies spent $5.3 billion in the
first 11 months of last year sending representatives into doctors'
offices and hospitals. But the relationship between the
pharmaceutical sales force and the doctors they ply with
information has been fraught with tension for many years, and many
physicians feel that it is only getting worse. By Abigail Zuger.

   AIRPORT-SECURITY (Washington) _ How good is airport security?
Good enough, the Federal Aviation Administration has said
repeatedly. Even so, efforts by outsiders to assess security at
America's airports are all but fruitless, because the FAA says it
cannot provide details without giving away information that could
help terrorists. But FAA reports of violations by one airline show
that agents masquerading as passengers were able to smuggle guns,
hand grenades and bombs past security guards and their scanners, or
send the weapons in through exits. By Mathew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS _ The question now is whether Congress and the
Clinton administration can work together to deal with the full
plate of issues facing the country. Both parties have powerful
motivations to prove that they have not been consumed by
impeachment. But the challenge of getting on with the people's
business will be complicated not just by impeachment-induced
bitterness and distrust, but by the host of differing agendas in
play, from Gephardt and Gore to the conservative right. By Richard
W. Stevenson and John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SENATE _ In setting a detailed schedule to resume the

attorney general of this century, breaking a record held by Homer
Cummings, an attorney general in the Roosevelt administration who
held the post from March 4, 1933, to Jan. 2, 1939. Reno, who took
over in 1993, is highly unlikely to break the all-time service
record held by William Wirt, who served for 11 years from November
1817 to March 1829. By David Johnston.

   SEATTLE _ If I were casting the next Hollywood movie about a
hijacking, I know who would play the female-villain lead: Barbara
Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't look the part. But jeez, does she have a feel for
the role.
</P>
<P>
   Stealthy, clever, bold, reckless, borderline suicidal and
unfazed by ethical consequences, the University of Washington
athletic director lacks only a black ski mask and a rappelling
rope.
</P>
<P>
   Her purloining of Rick Neuheisel from the University of Colorado
was 007-ish in its amusing craftiness. She didn't need a gun. Money
and guts are always much more effective weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom of the deed remains to be seen. She has hired a good
coach who also brings baggage. And she spent as if she had a
limitless Nordstrom credit card at a 3-for-1 sale.
</P>
<P>
   As Neuheisel said, it was a blockbuster deal. If it doesn't
work, Hedges' block is busted.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know she was this desperate.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the choices of either Gary Pinkel or Chris
Tormey, former UW assistants who were the safe, familiar
candidates, Neuheisel is high-risk, high-reward. Hedges interviewed
Pinkel and Tormey early, and figuratively tucked the eager Don
James clones in her back pocket. If her gamble with big names
didn't work, they were the undynamic choices that at least wouldn't
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   But to appease boosters and keep up with the Seahawk miracle of
Mike Holmgren, Hedges felt she needed more _ a well-known name with
Division I success who also was skilled in sucking up, which is as
much a part of college football as scripting two-deep zone
coverages.
</P>
<P>
   She found that in Neuheisel, as well as a back-door exit for him
to Seattle _ Colorado's state law that prevents employees from
having contracts longer than one year. Although colleges usually
find a way around such rules to offer security to coaches,
apparently the only cash that Hedges has to pay to extricate
Neuheisel is the balance of a mortgage on his $850,000 home in
Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   But then she had to pay dearly to persuade Neuheisel that moving
from one school of similar rank and prestige to another wasn't a
trade unworthy of the grief. She bought him off with the kind of
contract that is normally reserved for Florida's Steve Spurrier and
Florida State's Bobby Bowden _ seven figures annually to stay in
the top 10 and win the occasional national title.
</P>
<P>
   The contract not only is astonishing for Washington and the
Pac-10 _ even though it isn't tax money, we're still talking about
a major research university that is supposed to be a symbol of
judgment, rectitude and sobriety _ it is flabbergasting for a coach
who, at 37, is only four years into a head coaching career. That
career has not included so much as a conference championship, and
is being outstripped by former Big 12 doormats Kansas State and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   His 33-14 record at Colorado is impressive, as were his three
wins in as many bowls. But like Jim Lambright's 44-25-1 mark in his
six seasons at Washington, numbers are deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having big-game shortcomings, Neuheisel created an
impression of insincerity among many in Boulder. His youth and
ambition led many to believe, accurately as it turned out, that his
oft-repeated desire for a lifelong career in Colorado was
dishonest. As recently as Colorado's Aloha Bowl victory over
Oregon, Neuheisel reconfirmed to reporters in Honolulu that he was
staying in Boulder ``for the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, for someone who has a law degree as well as a father
who is a politician, Neuheisel is well trained in the forked-tongue
arts. All we need to find out next is that he once was a
journalist, and he will have the three most unsavory professional
pedigrees in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the Husky job, too, is a way station for Neuheisel.
Which is OK, this being America and all. The problem is that the
athletic department will spend $267,000 next year so that Lambright
won't coach, and perhaps as much as $700,000 for Neuheisel to get
out from under his Colorado mortgage. So that's around a million
bucks, separate from salary, just to make the coaching switch.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the money comes from athletic department revenues
and not the state, it will be hard to amortize that expense in the
mind of a part-time prof on upper campus making $18,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Husky athletic department is supposedly awash in
its own cash surpluses, when the extensive facilities campaign now
under way is added to the two buyouts and Neuheisel's whopper
contract, Hedges is about one pair of pumps away from an Imelda
Marcos shoe binge.
</P>
<P>
   To undertake this controversial spree, Hedges had to feel that
the football program, and by extension the entire athletic
department, was near a cliff and needed an abrupt turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Her evidence is slowly coming out. In the two weeks since
Lambright's firing, it's clear that most current players are not
only not upset, most are happy. Even though few are willing to go
on the record for obvious reasons, player contempt for Lambright's
approach and techniques was high.
</P>
<P>
   Said one former athletic department employee: ``When he got the
head coaching job, he changed, and it wasn't for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that relatively few players were willing to
recommend the program to potential recruits. That is devastating.
So the change had to come, even if many in the public and the
legions of Lambright backers were confused, angry or both.
</P>
<P>
   But the program's appearance of disarray mitigated against
getting an established, high-profile replacement. Pinkel and
Tormey, from smaller schools, were there, but only until Hedges
threw big money at a candidate increasingly vulnerable in his own
job did a deal for a more glamorous figure come together.
</P>
<P>
   She and Neuheisel have created some serious resentment in
Boulder, where the athletic department is furious, the players feel
betrayed and the recruits are bewildered. Neuheisel, who never
quite won over many Colorado boosters and media, is being blasted
from Pike's Peak on down.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the money will create resentment, too. Hedges paid a
huge premium to resolve what amounted to an athletic department
emergency, and will have to account for how matters became so dire
on her watch.
</P>
<P>
   If Neuheisel bolts again in the next few years, if he fails to
reverse the program's decay, well, it will be a return to
jock-factory crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges won't get a second chance to fix it.

HUSKY RECRUITS REACT POSITIVELY TO HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Forgive Kevin Ware if he's feeling he just can't get
it right. The 6-foot-4, 252-pound tight end from Houston has
experienced a weird slice of college-football recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Ware, from Klein Oak Spring, Texas, a Houston suburb, was the
first recruit to give University of Washington coaches a verbal
commitment in September.
</P>
<P>
   But then startling events began to happen around the Huskies.
They fired Jim Lambright Dec. 30, leading Ware to scrub his campus
visit that was supposed to start Jan. 8 in favor of his second
choice, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Then it got crazy in Boulder Saturday night at a dinner that
included players and recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all sitting down, watching little highlight films,''
he said. ``And then here comes Coach (Rick) Neuheisel.''
</P>
<P>
   Here came coach Neuheisel telling the group, Ware says, that he
had turned down overtures twice from Washington, but the third one
was too good to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were crying, his staff was crying,'' Ware said last
night upon his return to Texas. ``We were kind of shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Ware was grinning. He says he's certain to attend
Washington now that Neuheisel has changed addresses to Seattle, to
the place he wanted at the start.
</P>
<P>
   With a slight kicker, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a couple of more trips,'' he said, referring to
Oklahoma and Miami. ``I gave my word, and I'm a man of my word.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, reaction to Neuheisel's hire was generally positive
among UW recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arnold, the All-America running back from Kennedy High,
returned last night from a visit to UCLA and, said coach Bob
Bourgette, might yet visit the Huskies as his fifth trip. Notre
Dame will be No. 4 in two weeks, and Arnold has already been to
Michigan and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the University of Washington as well as anybody,''
Bourgette said.
</P>
<P>
   John Anderson, the All-America kicker from Boca Raton, Calif.,
who had committed earlier to the UW, said, ``I'm just going to stay
with Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted, however, ``I'm confused. Everyone for a whole week
and a half told me there was a guy from Toledo (head coach Gary
Pinkel) and then a guy from Iowa _ or Idaho (Chris Tormey). It's
more of a shock than anything, but I guess it's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Although stability has returned to the UW in the eyes of most
recruits, it remains to be seen whether Neuheisel and his staff
will honor all the verbal commitments made by Husky recruits. They
are non-binding and it isn't uncommon for new coaches not to follow
through.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last night at an impromptu news conference about them,
Neuheisel was vague.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to pre-Neuheisel conversations with UW officials,
Tyler Krambrink, a linebacker from Eatonville, said, ``They (UW
officials) pretty much told me my scholarship was going to be
honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Krambrink said that after the firing of Lambright, he was called
by UW senior associate director Ralph Bayard and UW athletic
director Barbara Hedges, attempting to smooth the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope something happens soon,'' said committed
quarterback Cody Pickett of Caldwell (Idaho), referring to interest
by Neuheisel and a new staff. ``I've got the Arizona State coaches
on hold, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington was my favorite, but if something happens, I'll go
in a different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Adis Davtyan, a 6-foot-3, 295-pound offensive lineman from
Glendale (Calif.) Community College, said Neuheisel's hiring
``doesn't matter. I'm still going there.'' He was also recruited by
Kansas State, Texas A&AMP;M, Alabama and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Irony is stalking Denver recruit Terrell Bailey, a 6-8,
285-pound lineman who committed last month to Washington. But his
father, Irvin Bailey, said Sunday Bailey will stay with the Huskies
provided the interest remains mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell never considered Colorado,'' said Irvin Bailey. ``They
don't recruit very much in Denver. They seemed to cater to the
California athlete and the Texas athlete. They're somewhat
estranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that CU hasn't tried. My son was partial to
Washington. The football program would send out information about
the Seattle area, the business school, life after football. The
University of Washington seemed to be interested in our son as a
human being rather than a piece of meat.''

PREPARATION STRESSED, NOT QUAKE PREDICTIONS IN TEMBLOR'S AFTERMATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When the Northridge Earthquake struck along a
previously unknown fault on Jan. 17, 1994, it demolished
scientists' longtime hopes of predicting the Big One.
</P>
<P>
   Within just seconds, the most costly temblor to strike an
American city had forced seismologists to re-examine their goals
and assumptions. Yet today, as Los Angeles approaches the quake's
five-year anniversary, seismologists report there is good news.
</P>
<P>
   Information gleaned from the quake is helping shape crude
forecasts of impending trouble, useful in preparing structures for
an eventual strike.
</P>
<P>
   And the temblor's abruptness prompted government and scientists
to spend nearly $30 million lacing Southern California with sensors
that can instantly pinpoint quakes and eventually will issue alerts
to outlying communities that a shock wave is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists say that despite billions of dollars spent, that
is the best they can do with existing technology -- fortifying the
scientific school of thought that learning how to prepare for
disaster is more prudent than trying to predict one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predictions are not in our near future,'' said Tom Henyey,
director of the University of Southern California Earthquake
Center. ``The Northridge Earthquake gave us our first extensive set
of ground motion readings in the L.A. Basin -- possibly the
all-time best readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This enables us to predict what ground motion might be like in
a certain area. We can plan for these things. This will save lots
of money, and it's not going to cause panic like a prediction,''
Henyey said.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude 6.7 Northridge Earthquake struck at 4:31 a.m.,
killing 57 people as it destroyed more than 114,000 buildings and
wrought havoc as far away as coastal Santa Monica. The quake caused
an estimated $13 billion to $20 billion in damage, making it the
most expensive temblor to hit an American city, according to the
Insurance Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists later determined it occurred on a fault 12 miles
beneath suburban Reseda in the San Fernando Valley, despite the
Northridge designation bestowed in the days after the quake.
Although the information gathered in the 30 seconds of shaking was
the best ever recorded in centuries of earthquake study, the
Northridge Quake still invited more questions than answers about
how earthquakes work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually made things more complicated. Everyone would like
to predict an earthquake, and many people are working in that area,
but it's very difficult,'' said Paul Davis, a University of
California, Los Angeles, professor of geophysics. ``If anything,
Northridge sort of reinforced that belief because it happened in a
place where we didn't expect a big earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many tidbits of progress science can claim: In
October, seismologists found that wedges of rock buried beneath
Santa Monica may help explain why the city suffered so much damage
during the Northridge Earthquake, despite its distance from the
epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   The report stated that the immense rock structures separating
the Santa Monica Mountains from the Los Angeles Basin amplified
shaking and battered buildings more than scientists could easily
explain.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1994, scientists studying data from the Northridge Quake
arrived at an unprecedented consensus that a temblor at least the
size of the Northridge Quake will occur once every 40 years -- but
no one could say yet when or where.
</P>
<P>
   If Lucy Jones has her way, Southern California won't be caught
entirely off-guard, largely because of a new, massive web of ground
motion-mapping sensors and sophisticated computer equipment that
was installed after the Northridge Quake.
</P>
<P>
   It took the quake to refine the technology and prompt the
purchase of better computers, triggering a fundamental shift in the
philosophy of funding earthquake studies, said Jones, scientist in
charge of the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Before Northridge, quake-study funds came out of research
grants. But after the quake and its unprecedented cost, the
California Institute of Technology convinced Federal Emergency
Management officials that some disaster-relief money would be
well-spent building a network that can pinpoint vulnerable areas
and better direct rescue efforts in the next major quake.
</P>
<P>
   When the Northridge Quake hit, it overwhelmed the aging U.S.
Geological Survey computer network, which mistook the main shock
for a massive microwave burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so much information, so rapidly, it confused our
systems,'' Jones said. ``We couldn't talk to the computer. It was
so busy recording the aftershocks, it took us half an hour to get
the information.''
</P>
<P>
   The glitch delayed rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: TriNet, a $20.75 million ground motion-mapping
system uses a network of 600 sensor stations that monitor Los
Angeles' daily rumblings -- most too small to be felt by humans.
TriNet will also enable emergency officials to pinpoint the
hardest-hit areas within five minutes of the disaster. Installation
of the network began in 1997 and should continue through 2004. It
will be maintained by the USGS, California Polytechnic State
University, the state Office of Emergency Services and the state
Division of Mines and Geology.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said TriNet should eventually be able to provide a warning
of a major quake if the fault lies outside the city. A quake at the
San Andreas Fault, for instance, would be felt in downtown Los
Angeles within about 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things you can do in 30 seconds, if you
have already planned what you're going to do,'' Jones said. ``You
could stop nuclear reactions, stop trains and stop the handling of
hazardous waste. You could move people away from open windows.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside: The closer the quake, the less warning. There
would have been no warning of Northridge, but rescuers would at
least have known where to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this was there when Northridge happened,'' Jones said.
``If we were to have Northridge today, we would be able to have
information available for emergency responders within five minutes
-- if the Internet stays up. Five years from now, we'll be more
reliable. We'll be able to get rid of the ifs.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Jones added, one big question lingers: Will all this
knowledge be used wisely?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the buildings destroyed in the Northridge Quake -- and
in the temblor in Kobe, Japan, exactly a year later -- did not meet
current earthquake safety codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were surprises in the Northridge Earthquake, of course,
but 95 percent of the damage was, we told you so,'' Jones said.
``Just understanding the problem doesn't make it disappear. No
building code in the world is retroactive. That's the lesson
learned from the earthquake, but I'm not sure how far the learning
has gone.''

UW FACULTY LEADERS DECRY NEUHEISEL'S SALARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Not everyone at Montlake was rejoicing Sunday about
the hiring of Rick Neuheisel as the University of Washington
football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty members say Neuheisel's salary package, reported to
be worth about $1 million a year, is a slap in the face for the
university's teachers, who are paid an average salary of about
$60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty leaders called Neuheisel's salary ``obscene'' and
``insane,'' particularly because it comes at a time when the
Legislature and regents are considering tuition increases to boost
faculty pay, which is ranked 16th in comparison to 24 other similar
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the faculty is underpaid and we're so much behind
our peers, but this is the football coach. ... It is sort of
obscene,'' said Galya Diment, president of the UW chapter of the
American Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Kaltsounis, chairman of the UW Faculty Senate, said the
salary sends the wrong message to the public as well as faculty and
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle, it's going the wrong way,'' Kaltsounis said.
``We're moving in the direction of professional sports, it looks
like, which I think is an insane direction. As a university, we
should be leading away from insane direction.''
</P>
<P>
   UW president Richard McCormick noted that the athletic
department operates on a budget independent from the university's
general fund and that the football program pays for more than two
dozen athletic programs that don't make money.
</P>
<P>
   No tax or general fund money will be used to pay Neuheisel,
McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the dollars are generated by the football program.
There's not one penny of state funds or tax appropriations or any
other university money in the (salary) program,'' McCormick said.
``It comes from filling Husky Stadium six times a year, going on
the radio and television with those games, and the commercial
endorsements that accompany it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the athletic department supports itself still
doesn't make Neuheisel's salary any easier for faculty members to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a separate department and you can argue that they have to
do what they have to do,'' said Kaltsounis. ``But it is unfortunate
that the public is willing to support a football coach at that
salary and the athletic department to the extent that they do. When
it comes to supporting the quality of the university, we seem to
have difficulty getting through to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaltsounis said he hopes that the same boosters who support the
football program will show their support for faculty pay increases
when the Legislature considers them in the coming session.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we have been saying that we are hurting the quality
of education because we are losing faculty (because of low pay),
but unfortunately we don't get the same kind of excited support for
that aspect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diment, a professor of Slavic languages and literature, sees no
justification for paying the football coach so much money. She
noted that some associate professors in the humanities department
make less than $40,000 a year with 20 years of teaching experience.
</P>
<P>
   Kaltsounis would like to see some of the money generated by
football be returned to the entire university. But McCormick said
there was a ``thick wall'' keeping academic programs and the
athletic department apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, that's a good thing,'' McCormick said, adding his
endorsement to how athletic director Barbara Hedges conducted the
hiring process. ``The argument that we make on behalf of faculty
salaries is the same one that Barbara makes on behalf of the
coach's salary: If you want to recruit and retain the best _
whether you're talking about an English department program or a
football program _ you've got to pay for the best,'' McCormick
said.

BOOSTER PRAISES HIRING OF `BIG-TIME' COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ University of Washington boosters who supported former
coach Jim Lambright and those who were glad he was fired agreed on
one thing Sunday: that hiring Colorado's Rick Neuheisel was a good
move.
</P>
<P>
   They believe he will salvage Washington's recruiting efforts
before the Feb. 3 letter of intent signing date and energize a
program that failed to record its first winning season in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime booster Doug Glant, a staunch Lambright supporter,
praised athletic director Barbara Hedges for netting Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a worse record than Jim the last two years (13-10
compared to Lambright's 14-10), and that's without sanctions and
with an easier schedule, but the fact of the matter is I think
Barbara Hedges went out and hired a big-time guy,'' Glant said.
``She did that brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Glant has been openly critical of fellow boosters who pressured
Hedges to fire Lambright. But he also credited them with working
behind the scenes to make it possible to hire Neuheisel at such a
high salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys stake their careers and their reputations on what
they did last week to Jim,'' Glant said. ``Now, given that, they
did exactly what they should have done, and that's hire the best
guy you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those who wasn't surprised at Neuheisel's hiring was Ron
Crockett, a member of the Tyee Club's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably as good a recruiter as we could ever find, and
he's got a very proven track record on that,'' Crockett said.
``He's offensive minded and comes from the offensive side of the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Crockett believes that the best football programs often are run
by coaches whose speciality is crafting innovative offenses, and he
credited Hedges with finding one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she did a great job,'' Crockett said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the role boosters might have played in brokering the
deal for Neuheisel _ reported to be in excess of $1 million a year
_ Crockett said he knew of no direct involvement. One newspaper
account had boosters helping to buy out Neuheisel's mortgage for
his university-paid $850,000 home in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what boosters are doing that,'' he said. ``I know
I have never been approached on anything like that. There are
implications that (Hedges) had sat down with boosters and tried to
put together money from outside sources, and that really has not
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Glant said the salary paid to Neuheisel and the $4 million a
year paid to the Seahawks' new coach, Mike Holmgren, proves that
Seattle is willing to be a major player in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from being a small town in the Pacific Northwest that
tries to get guys like Jim Owens early and cheap ... to going out
and paying the second-most in the country for a coach,'' Glant
said. ``It's just a different world than I'm used to. I'm from a
different era.''
</P>
<P>
   Another booster from that era, Herb Mead, believes the UW
program now has a secure future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess on the wish list of all boosters is to get somebody
like him. The more credibility, the better,'' Mead said.
``Everybody I've heard from or been associated with thinks it's a
very positive move.''

CHARISMATIC NEUHEISEL HAS COME LONG WAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For Rick Neuheisel, big-time college football wasn't
always about a supposed $1 million-plus salary, mortgage buyout and
red carpet rolled from Husky Stadium to the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, he showed up at UCLA without a scholarship or
reputation. He was a walk-on quarterback and was treated that way,
forced to wear No. 24 _ the same as record-breaking Bruin tailback
Freeman McNeil _ and dress without a locker.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, Neuheisel ran the scout team, played special
teams and held for extra points. Mostly, he sat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when it came time for a breakthrough, his first start
on national television against Georgia, he was referred to as
``Rickheisel'' by ABC's folksy Frank Broyles for much of the
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   None of this seemed to point to him becoming the next Washington
football coach, apparently Division I's second-highest-paid leader
or a familiar face on SportsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he'd be a lawyer,'' said Neuheisel's mother, Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the boyish-looking one chose to argue his case on the
playing field, doing so successfully as a player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel capped his playing career in a big way, leading UCLA
to a Rose Bowl victory and accepting the game's Most Valuable
Player award. He had a spotty pro football experience. As a coach,
he has won 70 percent of his games, including all three of his bowl
outings.
</P>
<P>
   Cocky. Pass happy. Great golfer. Big wallet. All of it easily
could describe another college football heavyweight down in
Gatorville.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done some remarkable things to be just 37 years old,''
said David Norrie, Fox-TV college football analyst and former Bruin
quarterback and Neuheisel teammate. ``I'd call him a young Steve
Spurrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The Florida coach and Neuheisel, if all accounts are
accurate, now rank 1-2 in earnings among the nation's college
football coaches.
</P>
<P>
   An astronomical payday for the new Husky coach has been a source
of consternation for some in the community. But for the Huskies to
clone Spurrier, it apparently became a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told them, `I've got a good job and if you want to be
Florida or Florida State of the West, you're not only going to have
to pay me a big-time salary but also my assistants and make a total
commitment to be the best,''' said Neuheisel's father, Dick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the difference between Washington and what (athletic
director) Barbara Hedges was doing, and Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel would seem a natural for making persuasive closing
statement. Law runs in the family. His father is an attorney, as
are two of his three sisters. He has a law degree and passed two
bar exams himself.
</P>
<P>
   When torts and briefs weren't being tossed around the family
home in Tempe, Ariz., Neuheisel was playing football, basketball
and baseball with equal aplomb at McClintock High. The fall sport
became his passion when, as a junior, Neuheisel led McClintock to a
4A state title and 14-0 season.
</P>
<P>
   On the frail side, he wouldn't become a Division I recruit. But
he was bright and funny. He could talk his way into any situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dated my daughter, and I played golf with him,'' said Karl
Kiefer, his high school football coach. ``I'm not amazed at
anything he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel considered attending Princeton or accepting an
appointment from the Naval Academy. Hometown Arizona State offered
him an academic scholarship. He got hung up on UCLA while watching
the Pac-10 team prepare for the 1979 Fiesta Bowl against Arkansas.
Then-coach Terry Donahue took an instant liking to the kid, told
him he was once a Bruin walk-on himself.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Neuheisel showed up dragging a guitar behind
him. He was a born entertainer. He didn't play much football at
first, but school officials used to take him to a booster breakfast
club to sing and mesmerize the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved him down there,'' said Jerry Long, former Bruin
assistant football coach and director of athletic promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to get out his guitar for dates,'' said Norrie, also a
frat brother. ``He doesn't have a shy bone in his body.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun-loving side of Neuheisel comes from his mother. While
others in the family spend their days in court or a coach's office,
she manages 42 employees on a nine-hole Tempe golf course that she
and her husband have owned since 1984. They live on the third hole.
</P>
<P>
   Originally from Wisconsin, the Neuheisels moved to Tempe's
warmer climate when their only son was 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I talk like this,'' Jane Neuheisel said, doing her
best ``Fargo'' impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel lost and regained his starting job as a UCLA senior.
He set an NCAA record that stood until this year by completing 25
of 27 passes, including 18 in a row, in a 27-24 victory over the
Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   He played briefly in the NFL for San Diego and Tampa Bay, a
little longer in the USFL with the San Antonio Gunslingers. He's
still waiting on paychecks from the latter.
</P>
<P>
   He would return to UCLA as a graduate assistant under Donahue
solely to tutor Troy Aikman, then a redshirt. Promoted to a
fulltime job, he showed his creativity, making another walk-on,
John Barnes, into a productive quarterback. He left when Bob Toledo
became head coach and chose someone else as offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   After one year as as an assistant at Colorado, Neuheisel
succeeded Bill McCartney as head coach, even though he still hadn't
been an offensive coordinator. He blew away all other applicants
with a charismatic interview.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel hasn't been perfect. His third Colorado team finished
5-6, and the five wins that season were forfeited because of an
ineligible player. He has been criticized for his running game, for
not beating Nebraska, for his glibness.
</P>
<P>
   But he brought fun to the Buffaloes, taking players skiing,
rafting and partying. Before the recent Aloha Bowl, he rented a
Denver sports bar and threw a Hawaiian luau for his team, complete
with singers and hula dancers. Hours earlier at the same place, he
entertained about 30 recruits.
</P>
<P>
   People have wondered why some of this state's top prospect would
shun the Huskies in recent years. Ty Gregorak, a linebacker from
Spokane, has good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Neuheisel showed up at Gregorak's home carrying
the Butkus Award, given days earlier to Colorado linebacker Matt
Russell for being the nation's best at that position. The coach sat
the trophy on a kitchen table and dared Gregorak to win one
himself. Where do I sign?
</P>
<P>
   Gregorak had been a diehard Husky fan. His parents were alums.
Now Neuheisel is a Husky and Gregorak is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't lie to you,'' the linebacker said. ``I've thought,
`What would have happened if (the hiring) had happened a few years
ago?' ''

UW'S NEW COACH HITS TOWN WITH HEFTY TO-DO LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Like a sudden winter storm over the Rockies he had
just left behind, Rick Neuheisel blew into Seattle on Sunday. He
said he was exhausted, but managed not to look like it.
</P>
<P>
   If he's tired now, his fatigue likely will spike in the next
couple of days. Hired Saturday to be the next football coach at the
University of Washington, Neuheisel has a plate that's overflowing,
including a news conference this morning to introduce him.
</P>
<P>
   In an impromptu media gathering at Hec Edmundson Pavilion on his
way to sell himself to Husky players, Neuheisel made it clear he
has a full plate. It includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Staff selection. Neuheisel said, ``There are certainly guys
in Colorado I'm interested in,'' referring to his last employer.
``I anticipate a lot of them joining us.''
</P>
<P>
   One apparently on the way is special teams and secondary coach
Bob Hauck, who told Bob Bourgette, the coach for hotly recruited
Kennedy High running back Paul Arnold, that he will be courting him
for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Colorado assistants _ A.J. Christoff, Karl Dorrell
and Jon Embree _ are seeking the job Neuheisel vacated but are
considered outside shots. Another aide, offensive-line coach Tom
Cable of Snohomish, is a likely addition here.
</P>
<P>
   -- Recruiting. A so-called ``dead period,'' per NCAA rules, is
in effect through Wednesday, and effectively freezes recruiting.
But Neuheisel and his staff will have three weekends to hurry
recruits in for campus visits before the national letter-of-intent
day Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Unclear is how Neuheisel will handle the roughly 10 UW recruits
who have made verbal commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would honor those commitments, Neuheisel said,
``There's a lot going on right now. Recruiting is certainly a major
issue. We're going to get busy immediately with recruiting. I'll
look at all the commits that are currently here; some I'll be
familiar with, some I won't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get in a phone call to John Mackovic, who heads
the ethics committee (of the American Football Coaches
Association), of which I'm a member. I need to just make sure I'm
doing the right thing with respect to recruiting when you leave
from one school to another.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Deflection of public concentration on his salary. Neuheisel
and UW officials refused Sunday to discuss his contract terms,
expected to be outlined Monday. But he is reported to have been
attracted for $1 million to $1.5 million per year for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   If his contract calls for much above $1 million annually, he
would be second to Florida coach Steve Spurrier's roughly $2
million package. Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer, fresh from a national
title, had his contract redone for slightly more than $1 million,
while Florida State coach Bobby Bowden is at about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Barbara (Hedges, UW athletic director) I'm flattered
with the commitment she's made to me and my family,'' Neuheisel
said, calling his decision ``gut-wrenching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not talking money. It's not about money. It's a
decision based on a platform here at the University of Washington,
which I think can be a beacon university in the West and the entire
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salary is just not an issue with me. Obviously, security for
my family and seven years is a wonderful thing, but I'm about going
to work and seeing if we can't win 'em all.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some academicians at Washington are upset at the
reported terms of the contract, which will be significantly more
than the $566,000 package earned by ex-coach Jim Lambright or any
other coach in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the reactions I've heard have been positive,'' UW
president Richard McCormick said Sunday, lauding Hedges' 10-day
search as ``stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed as to what values the contract represents, Neuheisel
said, ``I don't pretend to make any judgments on what market value
is. I think that's determined by the market. I'm just interested in
achieving the goals anybody in my profession wants to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Neuheisel was off to meet for the first time with his
players, whom he delighted with the news he was reinstituting their
favored gold helmets, part of the UW uniform before Lambright made
a switch in 1995.

DUCKS TAKE ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ ``Upon review, the play stands'' _ a magical phrase
from the replay era of the NFL. Sunday night, words to that effect
were magical for the Mighty Ducks in a 6-4 victory over Edmonton
before 17,174.
</P>
<P>
   It was a victory doused with a generous amount of pixie dust.
The Ducks scored three times with a two-man advantage, had a goal
deflect in off a Oilers defenseman, and most importantly benefited
from a ruling that denied Edmonton from taking a two-goal lead
early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say we got a break or whatever, but as the year goes
along I'm sure things will even up,'' said Ducks coach Craig
Hartsburg, referring to Ryan Smyth's shot that was ruled no goal by
referee Rob Shick and the video goal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth had a wide open net to shoot at in the first minute of the
second period and he appeared to have given the Oilers a 4-2 lead
when the red light went on behind Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hebert somehow got the knob of his stick on the
shot, the Oilers were convinced that the shot bounced just inside
the post, and the netting did appear to move on the replays. But
Shick quickly waved the goal off before consulting with the video
goal judge.
</P>
<P>
   The news would not be good for Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Director of officials Jim Gregory said none of the replay angles
showed the puck crossing the goal line and that it didn't matter if
the net moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't guess,'' said Gregory. ``We've got to see it go over
and we did not see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who stopped 33 of 34 shots in relief of Dominic Roussel,
joked ``that I have to agree with the video judge and ``if it did
go in it didn't go in very far.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a more serious note, the Anaheim goalie said the ruling
was the turning point in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time those things go against you,'' said Hebert,
who explained that his stick may have caused the netting to move.
``As soon as that happened I knew we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Ducks, who had already benefited from a shot by Paul
Kariya that Edmonton defenseman Tom Poti accidentally poked into
his own net with 23.3 seconds left in the first period, tied the
game 3-3 on Travis Green's goal just over a minute after the ruling
on Smyth's shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers then went into self-destruct mode _ giving up two
five-on-three goals to Teemu Selanne in less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Too many penalties, said disgusted Edmonton coach Ron Lowe, who
watched his Oilers give the Ducks their second and third two-man
advantages of the game when Poti pulled down Steve Rucchin from
behind on a Edmonton two-on-one at 7:15 and when goalie Mikhail
Shtalenkov shot the puck over the net, drawing a delay-of
game-penalty at 8:35.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne quickly scored goals 20 and 21 from the his new position
in the slot and the Ducks had taken a 5-3 lead with 11:25 left in
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play was great,'' said Hartsburg. ``It won us the
game, that and Guy stoning them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things you have to do well if you want to win,''
said Selanne of the three five-on-three goals, which included
Fredrik Olausson's goal in the first period. ``But it's not that
easy to score five-on-three, no goals are easy in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks put a stranglehold on the game when Matt Cullen scored
a shorthanded goal at 15:26 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton outshot Anaheim 23-6 in the third period and the Ducks
allowed a season-high 49 shots, but nobody was willing to give the
two points back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many situations where luck was on our side,''
admitted Rucchin. ``It was ugly, but we will definitely take it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &UR;  &LR; -- &UR;  &LR; Bill Cosby, Elton John and Harrison Ford
were named all-time favorite television, music and movie
performers, ``Titanic'' had one last hurrah and the stars of
several shows nearing their end were given warm send-offs in the
25th annual People's Choice Awards held Sunday night at the
Pasadena Civic Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees and winners were selected through telephone surveys
conducted by the Gallup Organization. The winners of the all-time
favorites category were chosen through Internet balloting from
nominees identified in those polls.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the performers said they were glad to receive
People's Choice Awards because they were given by fans, rather than
colleagues or members of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting. Whatever we do, we do for the fans so it's
very touching,'' said singer Celine Dion, who won for favorite
female musical performer. ``This is really wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion's win made for a sort of a third award for ``Titanic,'' the
movie blockbuster that steamed through last year's Academy Awards.
Dion sang the movie's theme song, ``My Heart Will Go On.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' was honored as both the favorite dramatic motion
picture and favorite motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just saying that we hope this is closure, and (star)
Gloria (Stewart) said, No, we want the party to go on,'' said
director and co-producer James Cameron. ``The film was chosen by
people globally in such a resounding fashion last year, it would be
silly to call it a surprise that we won.''
</P>
<P>
   It even led to jokes from other winners such as Tom Hanks, who
was honored for favorite motion picture actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's never too late in the year to give a trophy to
`Titanic,' that's my philosophy,'' Hanks quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse,'' starring Christina Applegate, tied with ``Will and
Grace'' for favorite new television comedy series. Applegate was
tabbed as the favorite female performer in a new TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nerve-racking, scary,'' Applegate said about being
nominated. ``It's been amazing to work with these people on the
show. For the hard work we do this (award) is an added bonus. It
feels really, really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the three all-time performers -- comedian Cosby, actor
Ford or singer John -- was present to receive his reward, though
John taped a duet for the show with country singer LeAnn Rimes, and
the others appeared by videotape as well.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks, who also performed in the show, picked up his
seventh straight award as favorite male musical performer. The
voters honored several shows that are off the air or about to shoot
their last episode, leading host Ray Romano to joke that ``
`Seinfeld' finally went off the air and we thought, great, we'll
finally get nominated for a People's Choice Award. Then look what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld'' tied with ``Frasier'' for favorite television
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Hunt won for favorite female television performer, beating
out Calista Flockhart of ``Ally McBeal'' and Oprah Winfrey among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thrilling after seven years, and competing this year with
people like Calista Flockhart, who's shown up and created a
compelling character, and Oprah Winfrey, to be recognized,'' Hunt
said. ``It's really incredible. Some people are drawn to this
simple story of this marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt said she probably won't do another TV series after ``Mad
About You'' ends this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine finding anybody I work with quite the way I
work with Paul (Reiser),'' Hunt said. ``The only topic that remains
interesting for seven years is a relationship and how it changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen, whose equally durable ``Home Improvement'' is also in
its last season as he prepares to spend more time making movies,
won for favorite male television performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do both of these anymore,'' Allen said. ``Perform, to
do TV the way I want to do it, and executive produce -- I can't do
both. I've let the movies slip. But I really like doing this TV
show and I really like being in this industry. It's a bunch of
really good friends coming up on single digits (in the number of
shows remaining to shoot) and it's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Lane won for favorite male performer in a new TV series
--``Encore! Encore!'' -- but it was bittersweet given the NBC
show's cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked up irony in the dictionary it would be a picture
of me holding up this award,'' Lane said. ``It's been sort of an
odd experience, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Every decade
I do 13 episodes for NBC. I'm sure in 2005 I'll be playing a wacky
proctologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ``ER,'' which shows no signs of slowing or going as it
picked up the award for favorite television drama, is marking the
imminent departure of George Clooney who is shooting his last
episode on the show this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some fine actors will come on the show, but I don't
think George will ever be replaced,'' said co-star Noah Wyle. ``We
should just retire his number.''
</P>
<P>
   The yuppies hung in with ``LA Doctors,'' beating out teen faves
``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Felicity'' for favorite new dramatic
television series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally in the past six weeks we figured out the best way to
tell our stories,'' said star and co-producer Ken Olin.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Bullock was honored as favorite motion picture actress
and ``Something About Mary'' was named favorite movie comedy.

CHARISMATIC NEUHEISEL HAS COME LONG WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For Rick Neuheisel, big-time college football wasn't
always about a supposed $1 million-plus salary, mortgage buyout and
red carpet rolled from Husky Stadium to the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, he showed up at UCLA without a scholarship or
reputation. He was a walk-on quarterback and was treated that way,
forced to wear No. 24 _ the same as record-breaking Bruin tailback
Freeman McNeil _ and dress without a locker.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, Neuheisel ran the scout team, played special
teams and held for extra points. Mostly, he sat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when it came time for a breakthrough, his first start
on national television against Georgia, he was referred to as
``Rickheisel'' by ABC's folksy Frank Broyles for much of the
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   None of this seemed to point to him becoming the next Washington
football coach, apparently Division I's second-highest-paid leader
or a familiar face on SportsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he'd be a lawyer,'' said Neuheisel's mother, Jane.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the boyish-looking one chose to argue his case on the
playing field, doing so successfully as a player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel capped his playing career in a big way, leading UCLA
to a Rose Bowl victory and accepting the game's Most Valuable
Player award. He had a spotty pro football experience. As a coach,
he has won 70 percent of his games, including all three of his bowl
outings.
</P>
<P>
   Cocky. Pass happy. Great golfer. Big wallet. All of it easily
could describe another college football heavyweight down in
Gatorville.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done some remarkable things to be just 37 years old,''
said David Norrie, Fox-TV college football analyst and former Bruin
quarterback and Neuheisel teammate. ``I'd call him a young Steve
Spurrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The Florida coach and Neuheisel, if all accounts are
accurate, now rank 1-2 in earnings among the nation's college
football coaches.
</P>
<P>
   An astronomical payday for the new Husky coach has been a source
of consternation for some in the community. But for the Huskies to
clone Spurrier, it apparently became a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told them, `I've got a good job and if you want to be
Florida or Florida State of the West, you're not only going to have
to pay me a big-time salary but also my assistants and make a total
commitment to be the best,''' said Neuheisel's father, Dick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the difference between Washington and what (athletic
director) Barbara Hedges was doing, and Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel would seem a natural for making persuasive closing
statements. Law runs in the family. His father is an attorney, as
are two of his three sisters. He has a law degree and passed two
bar exams himself.
</P>
<P>
   When torts and briefs weren't being tossed around the family
home in Tempe, Ariz., Neuheisel was playing football, basketball
and baseball with equal aplomb at McClintock High. The fall sport
became his passion when, as a junior, Neuheisel led McClintock to a
4A state title and 14-0 season.
</P>
<P>
   On the frail side, he wouldn't become a Division I recruit. But
he was bright and funny. He could talk his way into any situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dated my daughter, and I played golf with him,'' said Karl
Kiefer, his high school football coach. ``I'm not amazed at
anything he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel considered attending Princeton or accepting an
appointment from the Naval Academy. Hometown Arizona State offered
him an academic scholarship. He got hung up on UCLA while watching
the Pac-10 team prepare for the 1979 Fiesta Bowl against Arkansas.
Then-coach Terry Donahue took an instant liking to the kid, told
him he was once a Bruin walk-on himself.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Neuheisel showed up dragging a guitar behind
him. He was a born entertainer. He didn't play much football at
first, but school officials used to take him to a booster breakfast
club to sing and mesmerize the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved him down there,'' said Jerry Long, former Bruin
assistant football coach and director of athletic promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to get out his guitar for dates,'' said Norrie, also a
frat brother. ``He doesn't have a shy bone in his body.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun-loving side of Neuheisel comes from his mother. While
others in the family spend their days in court or a coach's office,
she manages 42 employees on a nine-hole Tempe golf course that she
and her husband have owned since 1984. They live on the third hole.
</P>
<P>
   Originally from Wisconsin, the Neuheisels moved to Tempe's
warmer climate when their only son was 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I talk like this,'' Jane Neuheisel said, doing her
best ``Fargo'' impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel lost and regained his starting job as a UCLA senior.
He set an NCAA record that stood until this year by completing 25
of 27 passes, including 18 in a row, in a 27-24 victory over the
Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   He played briefly in the NFL for San Diego and Tampa Bay, a
little longer in the USFL with the San Antonio Gunslingers. He's
still waiting on paychecks from the latter.
</P>
<P>
   He would return to UCLA as a graduate assistant under Donahue
solely to tutor Troy Aikman, then a redshirt. Promoted to a
fulltime job, he showed his creativity, making another walk-on,
John Barnes, into a productive quarterback. He left when Bob Toledo
became head coach and chose someone else as offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   After one year as as an assistant at Colorado, Neuheisel
succeeded Bill McCartney as head coach, even though he still hadn't
been an offensive coordinator. He blew away all other applicants
with a charismatic interview.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel hasn't been perfect. His third Colorado team finished
5-6, and the five wins that season were forfeited because of an
ineligible player. He has been criticized for his running game, for
not beating Nebraska, for his glibness.
</P>
<P>
   But he brought fun to the Buffaloes, taking players skiing,
rafting and partying. Before the recent Aloha Bowl, he rented a
Denver sports bar and threw a Hawaiian luau for his team, complete
with singers and hula dancers. Hours earlier at the same place, he
entertained about 30 recruits.
</P>
<P>
   People have wondered why some of this state's top prospects
would shun the Huskies in recent years. Ty Gregorak, a linebacker
from Spokane, has good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Neuheisel showed up at Gregorak's home carrying
the Butkus Award, given days earlier to Colorado linebacker Matt
Russell for being the nation's best at that position. The coach sat
the trophy on a kitchen table and dared Gregorak to win one
himself. Where do I sign?
</P>
<P>
   Gregorak had been a diehard Husky fan. His parents were alums.
Now Neuheisel is a Husky and Gregorak is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't lie to you,'' the linebacker said. ``I've thought,
`What would have happened if (the hiring) had happened a few years
ago?' ''

BOOSTER PRAISES HIRING OF `BIG-TIME' COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ University of Washington boosters who supported former
coach Jim Lambright and those who were glad he was fired agreed on
one thing Sunday: that hiring Colorado's Rick Neuheisel was a good
move.
</P>
<P>
   They believe he will salvage Washington's recruiting efforts
before the Feb. 3 letter of intent signing date and energize a
program that failed to record its first winning season in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime booster Doug Glant, a staunch Lambright supporter,
praised athletic director Barbara Hedges for netting Neuheisel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a worse record than Jim the last two years (13-10
compared to Lambright's 14-10), and that's without sanctions and
with an easier schedule, but the fact of the matter is I think
Barbara Hedges went out and hired a big-time guy,'' Glant said.
``She did that brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Glant has been openly critical of fellow boosters who pressured
Hedges to fire Lambright. But he also credited them with working
behind the scenes to make it possible to hire Neuheisel at such a
high salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys stake their careers and their reputations on what
they did last week to Jim,'' Glant said. ``Now, given that, they
did exactly what they should have done, and that's hire the best
guy you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those who wasn't surprised at Neuheisel's hiring was Ron
Crockett, a member of the Tyee Club's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably as good a recruiter as we could ever find, and
he's got a very proven track record on that,'' Crockett said.
``He's offensive minded and comes from the offensive side of the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Crockett believes that the best football programs often are run
by coaches whose speciality is crafting innovative offenses, and he
credited Hedges with finding one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she did a great job,'' Crockett said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the role boosters might have played in brokering the
deal for Neuheisel _ reported to be in excess of $1 million a year
_ Crockett said he knew of no direct involvement. One newspaper
account had boosters helping to buy out Neuheisel's mortgage for
his university-paid $850,000 home in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what boosters are doing that,'' he said. ``I know
I have never been approached on anything like that. There are
implications that (Hedges) had sat down with boosters and tried to
put together money from outside sources, and that really has not
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Glant said the salary paid to Neuheisel and the $4 million a
year paid to the Seahawks' new coach, Mike Holmgren, proves that
Seattle is willing to be a major player in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from being a small town in the Pacific Northwest that
tries to get guys like Jim Owens early and cheap ... to going out
and paying the second-most in the country for a coach,'' Glant
said. ``It's just a different world than I'm used to. I'm from a
different era.''
</P>
<P>
   Another booster from that era, Herb Mead, believes the UW
program now has a secure future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess on the wish list of all boosters is to get somebody
like him. The more credibility, the better,'' Mead said.
``Everybody I've heard from or been associated with thinks it's a
very positive move.''

UW FACULTY LEADERS DECRY NEUHEISEL'S SALARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Not everyone at Montlake was rejoicing Sunday about
the hiring of Rick Neuheisel as the University of Washington
football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty members say Neuheisel's salary package, reported to
be worth about $1 million a year, is a slap in the face for the
university's teachers, who are paid an average salary of about
$60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty leaders called Neuheisel's salary ``obscene'' and
``insane,'' particularly because it comes at a time when the
Legislature and regents are considering tuition increases to boost
faculty pay, which is ranked 16th in comparison to 24 other similar
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of the faculty is underpaid and we're so much behind
our peers, but this is the football coach. ... It is sort of
obscene,'' said Galya Diment, president of the UW chapter of the
American Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Kaltsounis, chairman of the UW Faculty Senate, said the
salary sends the wrong message to the public as well as faculty and
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle, it's going the wrong way,'' Kaltsounis said.
``We're moving in the direction of professional sports, it looks
like, which I think is an insane direction. As a university, we
should be leading away from insane direction.''
</P>
<P>
   UW president Richard McCormick noted that the athletic
department operates on a budget independent from the university's
general fund and that the football program pays for more than two
dozen athletic programs that don't make money.
</P>
<P>
   No tax or general fund money will be used to pay Neuheisel,
McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the dollars are generated by the football program.
There's not one penny of state funds or tax appropriations or any
other university money in the (salary) program,'' McCormick said.
``It comes from filling Husky Stadium six times a year, going on
the radio and television with those games, and the commercial
endorsements that accompany it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the athletic department supports itself still
doesn't make Neuheisel's salary any easier for faculty members to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a separate department and you can argue that they have to
do what they have to do,'' said Kaltsounis. ``But it is unfortunate
that the public is willing to support a football coach at that
salary and the athletic department to the extent that they do. When
it comes to supporting the quality of the university, we seem to
have difficulty getting through to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaltsounis said he hopes that the same boosters who support the
football program will show their support for faculty pay increases
when the Legislature considers them in the coming session.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we have been saying that we are hurting the quality
of education because we are losing faculty (because of low pay),
but unfortunately we don't get the same kind of excited support for
that aspect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diment, a professor of Slavic languages and literature, sees no
justification for paying the football coach so much money. She
noted that some associate professors in the humanities department
make less than $40,000 a year with 20 years of teaching experience.
</P>
<P>
   Kaltsounis would like to see some of the money generated by
football be returned to the entire university. But McCormick said
there was a ``thick wall'' keeping academic programs and the
athletic department apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, that's a good thing,'' McCormick said, adding his
endorsement to how athletic director Barbara Hedges conducted the
hiring process. ``The argument that we make on behalf of faculty
salaries is the same one that Barbara makes on behalf of the
coach's salary: If you want to recruit and retain the best _
whether you're talking about an English department program or a
football program _ you've got to pay for the best,'' McCormick
said.

HUSKY RECRUITS REACT POSITIVELY TO HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Forgive Kevin Ware if he's feeling he just can't get
it right. The 6-foot-4, 252-pound tight end from Houston has
experienced a weird slice of college-football recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Ware, from Klein Oak Spring, Texas, a Houston suburb, was the
first recruit to give University of Washington coaches a verbal
commitment in September.
</P>
<P>
   But then startling events began to happen around the Huskies.
They fired Jim Lambright Dec. 30, leading Ware to scrub his campus
visit that was supposed to start Jan. 8 in favor of his second
choice, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Then it got crazy in Boulder Saturday night at a dinner that
included players and recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all sitting down, watching little highlight films,''
he said. ``And then here comes Coach (Rick) Neuheisel.''
</P>
<P>
   Here came coach Neuheisel telling the group, Ware says, that he
had turned down overtures twice from Washington, but the third one
was too good to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were crying, his staff was crying,'' Ware said last
night upon his return to Texas. ``We were kind of shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Ware was grinning. He says he's certain to attend
Washington now that Neuheisel has changed addresses to Seattle, to
the place he wanted at the start.
</P>
<P>
   With a slight kicker, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a couple of more trips,'' he said, referring to
Oklahoma and Miami. ``I gave my word, and I'm a man of my word.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, reaction to Neuheisel's hire was generally positive
among UW recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arnold, the All-America running back from Kennedy High,
returned last night from a visit to UCLA and, said coach Bob
Bourgette, might yet visit the Huskies as his fifth trip. Notre
Dame will be No. 4 in two weeks, and Arnold has already been to
Michigan and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the University of Washington as well as anybody,''
Bourgette said.
</P>
<P>
   John Anderson, the All-America kicker from Boca Raton, Calif.,
who had committed earlier to the UW, said, ``I'm just going to stay
with Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted, however, ``I'm confused. Everyone for a whole week
and a half told me there was a guy from Toledo (head coach Gary
Pinkel) and then a guy from Iowa _ or Idaho (Chris Tormey). It's
more of a shock than anything, but I guess it's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Although stability has returned to the UW in the eyes of most
recruits, it remains to be seen whether Neuheisel and his staff
will honor all the verbal commitments made by Husky recruits. They
are non-binding and it isn't uncommon for new coaches not to follow
through.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last night at an impromptu news conference about them,
Neuheisel was vague.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to pre-Neuheisel conversations with UW officials,
Tyler Krambrink, a linebacker from Eatonville, said, ``They (UW
officials) pretty much told me my scholarship was going to be
honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Krambrink said that after the firing of Lambright, he was called
by UW senior associate director Ralph Bayard and UW athletic
director Barbara Hedges, attempting to smooth the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope something happens soon,'' said committed
quarterback Cody Pickett of Caldwell (Idaho), referring to interest
by Neuheisel and a new staff. ``I've got the Arizona State coaches
on hold, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington was my favorite, but if something happens, I'll go
in a different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Adis Davtyan, a 6-foot-3, 295-pound offensive lineman from
Glendale (Calif.) Community College, said Neuheisel's hiring
``doesn't matter. I'm still going there.'' He was also recruited by
Kansas State, Texas A&AMP;M, Alabama and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Irony is stalking Denver recruit Terrell Bailey, a 6-8,
285-pound lineman who committed last month to Washington. But his
father, Irvin Bailey, said Sunday Bailey will stay with the Huskies
provided the interest remains mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell never considered Colorado,'' said Irvin Bailey. ``They
don't recruit very much in Denver. They seemed to cater to the
California athlete and the Texas athlete. They're somewhat
estranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that CU hasn't tried. My son was partial to
Washington. The football program would send out information about
the Seattle area, the business school, life after football. The
University of Washington seemed to be interested in our son as a
human being rather than a piece of meat.''

HEDGES PUTS CAREER ON LINE TO GET NEUHEISEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If I were casting the next Hollywood movie about a
hijacking, I know who would play the female-villain lead: Barbara
Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't look the part. But jeez, does she have a feel for
the role.
</P>
<P>
   Stealthy, clever, bold, reckless, borderline suicidal and
unfazed by ethical consequences, the University of Washington
athletic director lacks only a black ski mask and a rappelling
rope.
</P>
<P>
   Her purloining of Rick Neuheisel from the University of Colorado
was 007-ish in its amusing craftiness. She didn't need a gun. Money
and guts are always much more effective weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom of the deed remains to be seen. She has hired a good
coach who also brings baggage. And she spent as if she had a
limitless Nordstrom credit card at a 3-for-1 sale.
</P>
<P>
   As Neuheisel said, it was a blockbuster deal. If it doesn't
work, Hedges' block is busted.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know she was this desperate.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the choices of either Gary Pinkel or Chris
Tormey, former UW assistants who were the safe, familiar
candidates, Neuheisel is high-risk, high-reward. Hedges interviewed
Pinkel and Tormey early, and figuratively tucked the eager Don
James clones in her back pocket. If her gamble with big names
didn't work, they were the undynamic choices that at least wouldn't
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   But to appease boosters and keep up with the Seahawk miracle of
Mike Holmgren, Hedges felt she needed more _ a well-known name with
Division I success who also was skilled in sucking up, which is as
much a part of college football as scripting two-deep zone
coverages.
</P>
<P>
   She found that in Neuheisel, as well as a back-door exit for him
to Seattle _ Colorado's state law that prevents employees from
having contracts longer than one year. Although colleges usually
find a way around such rules to offer security to coaches,
apparently the only cash that Hedges has to pay to extricate
Neuheisel is the balance of a mortgage on his $850,000 home in
Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   But then she had to pay dearly to persuade Neuheisel that moving
from one school of similar rank and prestige to another wasn't a
trade unworthy of the grief. She bought him off with the kind of
contract that is normally reserved for Florida's Steve Spurrier and
Florida State's Bobby Bowden _ seven figures annually to stay in
the top 10 and win the occasional national title.
</P>
<P>
   The contract not only is astonishing for Washington and the
Pac-10 _ even though it isn't tax money, we're still talking about
a major research university that is supposed to be a symbol of
judgment, rectitude and sobriety _ it is flabbergasting for a coach
who, at 37, is only four years into a head coaching career. That
career has not included so much as a conference championship, and
is being outstripped by former Big 12 doormats Kansas State and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   His 33-14 record at Colorado is impressive, as were his three
wins in as many bowls. But like Jim Lambright's 44-25-1 mark in his
six seasons at Washington, numbers are deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having big-game shortcomings, Neuheisel created an
impression of insincerity among many in Boulder. His youth and
ambition led many to believe, accurately as it turned out, that his
oft-repeated desire for a lifelong career in Colorado was
dishonest. As recently as Colorado's Aloha Bowl victory over
Oregon, Neuheisel reconfirmed to reporters in Honolulu that he was
staying in Boulder ``for the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, for someone who has a law degree as well as a father
who is a politician, Neuheisel is well trained in the forked-tongue
arts. All we need to find out next is that he once was a
journalist, and he will have the three most unsavory professional
pedigrees in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the Husky job, too, is a way station for Neuheisel.
Which is OK, this being America and all. The problem is that the
athletic department will spend $267,000 next year so that Lambright
won't coach, and perhaps as much as $700,000 for Neuheisel to get
out from under his Colorado mortgage. So that's around a million
bucks, separate from salary, just to make the coaching switch.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the money comes from athletic department revenues
and not the state, it will be hard to amortize that expense in the
mind of a part-time prof on upper campus making $18,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Husky athletic department is supposedly awash in
its own cash surpluses, when the extensive facilities campaign now
under way is added to the two buyouts and Neuheisel's whopper
contract, Hedges is about one pair of pumps away from an Imelda
Marcos shoe binge.
</P>
<P>
   To undertake this controversial spree, Hedges had to feel that
the football program, and by extension the entire athletic
department, was near a cliff and needed an abrupt turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Her evidence is slowly coming out. In the two weeks since
Lambright's firing, it's clear that most current players are not
only not upset, most are happy. Even though few are willing to go
on the record for obvious reasons, player contempt for Lambright's
approach and techniques was high.
</P>
<P>
   Said one former athletic department employee: ``When he got the
head coaching job, he changed, and it wasn't for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that relatively few players were willing to
recommend the program to potential recruits. That is devastating.
So the change had to come, even if many in the public and the
legions of Lambright backers were confused, angry or both.
</P>
<P>
   But the program's appearance of disarray mitigated against
getting an established, high-profile replacement. Pinkel and
Tormey, from smaller schools, were there, but only until Hedges
threw big money at a candidate increasingly vulnerable in his own
job did a deal for a more glamorous figure come together.
</P>
<P>
   She and Neuheisel have created some serious resentment in
Boulder, where the athletic department is furious, the players feel
betrayed and the recruits are bewildered. Neuheisel, who never
quite won over many Colorado boosters and media, is being blasted
from Pike's Peak on down.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the money will create resentment, too. Hedges paid a
huge premium to resolve what amounted to an athletic department
emergency, and will have to account for how matters became so dire
on her watch.
</P>
<P>
   If Neuheisel bolts again in the next few years, if he fails to
reverse the program's decay, well, it will be a return to
jock-factory crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges won't get a second chance to fix it.

PURPLE REIGNS: JITTERS, TURNOVERS DIG HOLE FOR CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Bobby McFerrin was on the Metrodome field for 2
minutes and 1 second on Sunday, hitting some incredibly high notes
while belting out our national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1 minute and 7 seconds longer than the Cardinals
offense was out there in the first quarter. With quarterback Jake
Plummer hitting mostly low notes, the Cardinals quickly were in the
position they knew they couldn't afford to be in _ 17 points behind
the NFL's most explosive team, the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jake rattled and rolled, throwing wildly and serving up
two early interceptions that helped dig the hole, and then fumbling
away a snap in the third quarter when the Cardinals had a chance to
cut the margin to six points.
</P>
<P>
   When the turnovers were combined with a defense that couldn't
stop the Vikings, the Cardinals' dream ride ended in the second
round of the playoffs. The NFC Central champion Vikings thumped the
Cards, 41-21, to move on to the NFC Championship game against
Atlanta here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' was a McFerrin classic, and it could
have been the mantra of a young team that exceeded all projections.
But the Cardinals were singing a different tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're mad,'' said Plummer, who completed 23 of 41
passes for 242 yards, no touchdowns and the two interceptions. ``We
should be mad for a while and let this sting. We had a great
opportunity, and we did not take advantage of it. Maybe a month
from now when I'm teeing off, I'll look back and think we did have
a great season.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Vikings, with a league-leading 15-1 regular-season
record, are having an even greater one, showing why they were
unsurpassed as a scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   With three All-Pros leading the way on their line, an explosive
running back, the league's best trio of wide receivers and a
veteran quarterback, who at age 35 still has plenty of mobility,
the Vikings scored on seven of their 10 possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're awfully good,'' said Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin.
``I'm not sure I know what a juggernaut is, but they looked pretty
good to me. They have great skill people.''
</P>
<P>
   That started with Vikings running back Robert Smith rushing for
124 yards, 6.5 a carry. Leroy Hoard added 44 hard-fought yards up
the middle, 4.0 a carry, and scored three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed they were able to run the ball like that,''
Tobin said. ``That's where defense has to start, no matter the
skill of the receivers. We tried everything in our defensive
arsenal, and nothing was particularly effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by a rushing game, Vikings quarterback Randall
Cunningham was free to pass for 236 yards and three touchdowns.
Cris Carter caught five of them for 82 yards. Randy Moss grabbed
four for 73.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trying to force the ball, I've got Robert Smith to
hand off to,'' said Cunningham, who was coaxed out of retirement
last year to sign with the Vikings. ``When you know you've got
second-and-three, that makes a difference in my game preparation. I
don't have to scramble around anymore and try to make things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With 416 total yards, the Vikings had 100 more than the
Cardinals. The Vikings punted only once. Five of their kickoffs
were touchbacks, leaving the Cardinals a long field when playing
catchup. The Cardinals had 13 penalties, many caused by the crowd
noise. But the crusher was the three turnovers that gave Minnesota
17 easy points.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals defense, which had surrendered only five
touchdowns in its previous four games, yielded five touchdowns to a
team that set an NFL scoring record this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up short today, but we've laid the foundation for good
teams in the future,'' Tobin said. ``This is still a very young
team, and Minnesota is a very veteran team in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play this game to win the Super Bowl. You have to go in
increments to get there, and we made giant strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, around whom the future of the franchise revolves,
acknowledged that on this afternoon he played more like a wide-eyed
24-year-old neophyte than a $29.7 million superstar that the team
believes he will be one day. After his first five throws, he had no
completions and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was loud, a different situation,'' Plummer said of the
crowd of 63,760 in the Metrodome. ``We hadn't been any place like
this. The first interception was just me being hyped up wanting to
make a big play. The next one, I just didn't get my feet set and I
threw the ball high.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer settled down and positioned the Cardinals to get back
into the game in the third quarter. Then, he made the killer play.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cardinals trailing, 27-13, and in possession of the
ball at their 32, Plummer, fumbled a snap from center Aaron Graham.
Minnesota's Antonio Banks recovered at the Cardinals 19, and the
Vikings scored in three plays to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had just shifted to a defensive front where we had to
audible into a better protection,'' Plummer said. ``We were going
on a silent count because of the crowd noise, and that process
takes about 4 seconds. There were 3 seconds on the play clock.
That's something you can't have happen in a critical situation.'' &QL;

CARDS MUST FEEL THIS PAIN AT CAMP TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ You can be happy. They can not.
</P>
<P>
   They must remember what it felt like to trip over their own awe.
How embarrassing it felt to hold the ball for 54 seconds in the
first quarter. How awful it is to lose a winnable game.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Cardinals have a wonderful future. But it can't sprout
from assumptions, that a 41-21 loss to the Vikings proves a Super
Bowl is just around the corner. They must remember that consolation
is for losers, and somehow the humiliation must linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll take from this game a few weeks from now is a lot
different than what we feel now,'' tight end Chris Gedney said.
`This was a big loss. And right now, it stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult after a breakthrough season. There will be
pats on the back, fuzzy memories of a playoff win in Dallas, tales
of resiliency about a team that defied the odds and its ugly past.
But the odor from Sunday still must be in the air when they arrive
in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, there will be a whirlwind of optimism swirling
around this football team,'' Larry Centers said. ``Next time we get
to camp, we're preparing to go to the NFC Championship Game, and
ultimately, the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Of corse, there is a learning curve for every team. Nine days
ago, they whipped Dallas, the hint of future glory. This was
supposed to be the game that illustrated the rest of the journey,
except the expected 20-point loss was not a blow-out, but a gift.
</P>
<P>
   When Jake the Snake-bit calmed down, it was too late. His first
two completed passes were to the Vikings, and the nightmare was on.
The temperature was below zero, and after 15 minutes, so was the
total yardage. And then came frustrating moments when the game was
really lost, the windows that kept opening and closing before the
Cardinals could climb into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, the secondary did fine against a lethal
trio of receivers, particularly Aeneas Williams. But it should be
disturbing that the defense couldn't stop the run, an overall
performance that might cost Dave McGinnis a job in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the opportunity to finish them off and get the ball
back to our offense in the fourth quarter,'' Williams said. ``And
we didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they weren't ready. Certainly not for the noise,
which borders on ridiculous in Minnesota. Somehow, the NFL allows
speakers to be placed behind the visitors' bench. Allows music to
be played at dangerous decibel levels while the guests try to
huddle. For all the good maneuvers near the end of the season,
Vince Tobin was wrong in not piping in simulated noise during
practice.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, they simply weren't ready to win this game.
Which is OK. As long as they don't take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to realize that we could've won that football
game,'' Centers said. ``And that we match up pretty well with that
team.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Cardinal-mania reached a new level. An
overflow crowd in a hotel bar chanted Cardinal chants. Michael
Bidwill walked in and was stopped for autographs. One man even
wanted his picture taken with the owner's son, except when his wife
pushed the button, oops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of film, honey,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect metaphor for the old Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, an unknowing media attendant handed a Vikings' towel
to owner Bill Bidwill. He shot back with a message: ``Tell them
thanks for the shoeshine cloth.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect metaphor for tomorrow, and all its promise.
</P>
<P>
   Except the new Cardinals must remember that in many ways, they
gave a game away on Sunday, and it must hurt. All the way to
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   There is danger in being satisfied with what you didn't
accomplish. In feeling good because you could've done better,
could've stunned the world. There is danger in realizing you're
closer than you thought.
</P>
<P>
   They exceeded expectations. They won a playoff game. They turned
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But the season ended with a nauseating loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, we lost by 20,'' Corey Chavous said. ``Who can be
happy about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. &QL;

COMEBACK CARDINALS WILL HAVE THEIR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When prizefighter Stanley Ketchel died, a friend said in
tribute, ``Start counting _ he'll get up at nine.''
</P>
<P>
   These were the 1998 Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Comebacks were routine. Late heroics defined them. Time after
time they picked themselves up and fought back and won games in the
darnedest ways when it appeared they no longer had a prayer, or a
pulse.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cards the clock didn't matter. You never could count
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This joy ride of a season ended against the Minnesota Vikings, a
team as explosive and relentless as the Metrodome's ear-splitting
noise. The Wild Cards ran three offensive plays in the first
quarter. ``Three.'' They fell 17 points behind before a nervous
Jake Plummer completed his first pass to the right-colored jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer called it ``a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cards felt as if they had fallen through an ink-black circle
cut in a frozen lake by a fisherman or tumbled headlong into a hole
from which there seemed no escape.
</P>
<P>
   How do you come back, on the road, against the Vikings, who
scored more points this year than any team in NFL history?
</P>
<P>
   You don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we threw a shovel of dirt out,`` Lomas Brown said
after the 41-21 loss, ``two more came back on top of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals couldn't contain Randall Cunningham and Cris
Carter and Randy Moss _ although Pro Bowl cornerback Aeneas
Williams did his best. Shaky all season against the run, the
defensive line couldn't stop Vikings running back Robert Smith, a
human snowplow.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings should come with a warning label, like a box of
dynamite. They kept running and passing and scoring. They showed
off their superior talent. They flashed their superior smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McGinnis, the Cards' defensive coordinator, felt like a
fire chief battling a four-alarm blaze. He didn't have nearly
enough help. The Cards couldn't make a third-down stop. When it
finally was over, it wasn't what McGinnis said that told the story.
It was his expression. As he walked off the field, McGinnis _ a
leading candidate to become the Chicago Bears' next head coach _
rolled his eyes and heaved a weary sigh.
</P>
<P>
   This was Minnesota's game, its place, its fans. The home field
proved to be a big advantage. The cheering crowd, in symphony with
music cranked to full volume, was so loud Plummer covered the ear
holes of his helmet with his hands. He couldn't hear radio
instructions from the sideline. His offensive linemen couldn't hear
Jake when he called signals. The Cardinals tried using a ``silent
count,'' but one snafu led to a fumbled snap, and a killer
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, the Cardinals sat in companionable silence.
The players expressed mixed feelings. So did the owner. Asked
whether this wildly exciting season made him feel younger or older
than his 67 years, Bill Bidwill thought a moment then said,
quietly, ``I guess a little bit of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The close games (the Cards won seven by three points or less)
turned Bidwill's beard a little grayer. The strides this team made
also heartened everyone who cares about the Cardinals, the most
overdue team in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards went 9-7 during the regular season, their first
winning record since 1984. They beat the Cowboys in the playoffs.
They won over doubting fans, skeptics who said the Cardinals can't
win. Cynics who said this franchise never will do anything under
the Bidwill family ownership.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been fashionable being a Cardinal, or a fan. Veteran
players who suffered through one losing season after another can
appreciate the old line by former big league catcher Bob Uecker:
``The cops once picked me up on the street at 3 a.m. and fined me
$500 for being drunk, and $100 for being with the Phillies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cards are no longer a joke. The players who dressed in
silence were upset. ``Ridiculous,'' Ronald McKinnon said of the
defense's inability to stop the run. But the Cardinals, who had won
four in a row coming into this game, know they have something here.
They look at the Vikings as a measuring stick. They see Sunday as
not an ending but a step in a new beginning. Growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards have two first-round draft choices. Rob Moore and
Jamir Miller must be re-signed. But the building blocks are in
place, and the most important one is the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jake Plummer went to New York as a Heisman Trophy
finalist. The morning of the big announcement the ASU senior, who
didn't win, was in the souvenir shop of the Downtown Athletic Club.
He bought several items, some for himself, others as gifts for
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll ever be back here again,'' Jake said at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   He could have said the same thing about the playoffs. But he
didn't. This kid knows he has a future, and so does his football
team. &QL;

team as explosive and relentless as the Metrodome's ear-splitting
noise. The Wild Cards ran three offensive plays in the first
quarter. ``Three.'' They fell 17 points behind before a nervous
Jake Plummer completed his first pass to the right-colored jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer called it ``a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cards felt as if they had fallen through an ink-black circle
cut in a frozen lake by a fisherman or tumbled headlong into a hole
from which there seemed no escape.
</P>
<P>
   How do you come back, on the road, against the Vikings, who
scored more points this year than any team in NFL history?
</P>
<P>
   You don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we threw a shovel of dirt out,`` Lomas Brown said
after the 41-21 loss, ``two more came back on top of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals couldn't contain Randall Cunningham and Cris
Carter and Randy Moss _ although Pro Bowl cornerback Aeneas
Williams did his best. Shaky all season against the run, the
defensive line couldn't stop Vikings running back Robert Smith, a
human snowplow.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings should come with a warning label, like a box of
dynamite. They kept running and passing and scoring. They showed
off their superior talent. They flashed their superior smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McGinnis, the Cards' defensive coordinator, felt like a
fire chief battling a four-alarm blaze. He didn't have nearly
enough help. The Cards couldn't make a third-down stop. When it
finally was over, it wasn't what McGinnis said that told the story.
It was his expression. As he walked off the field, McGinnis _ a
leading candidate to become the Chicago Bears' next head coach _
rolled his eyes and heaved a weary sigh.
</P>
<P>
   This was Minnesota's game, its place, its fans. The home field
proved to be a big advantage. The cheering crowd, in symphony with
music cranked to full volume, was so loud Plummer covered the ear
holes of his helmet with his hands. He couldn't hear radio
instructions from the sideline. His offensive linemen couldn't hear
Jake when he called signals. The Cardinals tried using a ``silent
count,'' but one snafu led to a fumbled snap, and a killer
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, the Cardinals sat in companionable silence.
The players expressed mixed feelings. So did the owner. Asked
whether this wildly exciting season made him feel younger or older
than his 67 years, Bill Bidwill thought a moment then said,
quietly, ``I guess a little bit of both.''
</P>
<P>
   The close games (the Cards won seven by three points or less)
turned Bidwill's beard a little grayer. The strides this team made
also heartened everyone who cares about the Cardinals, the most
overdue team in sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards went 9-7 during the regular season, their first
winning record since 1984. They beat the Cowboys in the playoffs.
They won over doubting fans, skeptics who said the Cardinals can't
win. Cynics who said this franchise never will do anything under
the Bidwill family ownership.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been fashionable being a Cardinal, or a fan. Veteran
players who suffered through one losing season after another can
appreciate the old line by former big league catcher Bob Uecker:
``The cops once picked me up on the street at 3 a.m. and fined me
$500 for being drunk, and $100 for being with the Phillies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cards are no longer a joke. The players who dressed in
silence were upset. ``Ridiculous,'' Ronald McKinnon said of the
defense's inability to stop the run. But the Cardinals, who had won
four in a row coming into this game, know they have something here.
They look at the Vikings as a measuring stick. They see Sunday as
not an ending but a step in a new beginning. Growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards have two first-round draft choices. Rob Moore and
Jamir Miller must be re-signed. But the building blocks are in
place, and the most important one is the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jake Plummer went to New York as a Heisman Trophy
finalist. The morning of the big announcement the ASU senior, who
didn't win, was in the souvenir shop of the Downtown Athletic Club.
He bought several items, some for himself, others as gifts for
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll ever be back here again,'' Jake said at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   He could have said the same thing about the playoffs. But he
didn't. This kid knows he has a future, and so does his football
team. &QL;

CARDS MUST FEEL THIS PAIN AT CAMP TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ You can be happy. They can not.
</P>
<P>
   They must remember what it felt like to trip over their own awe.
How embarrassing it felt to hold the ball for 54 seconds in the
first quarter. How awful it is to lose a winnable game.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Cardinals have a wonderful future. But it can't sprout
from assumptions, that a 41-21 loss to the Vikings proves a Super
Bowl is just around the corner. They must remember that consolation
is for losers, and somehow the humiliation must linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll take from this game a few weeks from now is a lot
different than what we feel now,'' tight end Chris Gedney said.
`This was a big loss. And right now, it stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult after a breakthrough season. There will be
pats on the back, fuzzy memories of a playoff win in Dallas, tales
of resiliency about a team that defied the odds and its ugly past.
But the odor from Sunday still must be in the air when they arrive
in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, there will be a whirlwind of optimism swirling
around this football team,'' Larry Centers said. ``Next time we get
to camp, we're preparing to go to the NFC Championship Game, and
ultimately, the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a learning curve for every team. Nine days
ago, they whipped Dallas, the hint of future glory. This was
supposed to be the game that illustrated the rest of the journey,
except the expected 20-point loss was not a blow-out, but a gift.
</P>
<P>
   When Jake the Snake-bit calmed down, it was too late. His first
two completed passes were to the Vikings, and the nightmare was on.
The temperature was below zero, and after 15 minutes, so was the
total yardage. And then came frustrating moments when the game was
really lost, the windows that kept opening and closing before the
Cardinals could climb into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, the secondary did fine against a lethal
trio of receivers, particularly Aeneas Williams. But it should be
disturbing that the defense couldn't stop the run, an overall
performance that might cost Dave McGinnis a job in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the opportunity to finish them off and get the ball
back to our offense in the fourth quarter,'' Williams said. ``And
we didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they weren't ready. Certainly not for the noise,
which borders on ridiculous in Minnesota. Somehow, the NFL allows
speakers to be placed behind the visitors' bench. Allows music to
be played at dangerous decibel levels while the guests try to
huddle. For all the good maneuvers near the end of the season,
Vince Tobin was wrong in not piping in simulated noise during
practice.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, they simply weren't ready to win this game.
Which is OK. As long as they don't take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to realize that we could've won that football
game,'' Centers said. ``And that we match up pretty well with that
team.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Cardinal-mania reached a new level. An
overflow crowd in a hotel bar chanted Cardinal chants. Michael
Bidwill walked in and was stopped for autographs. One man even
wanted his picture taken with the owner's son, except when his wife
pushed the button, oops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of film, honey,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect metaphor for the old Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, an unknowing media attendant handed a Vikings' towel
to owner Bill Bidwill. He shot back with a message: ``Tell them
thanks for the shoeshine cloth.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect metaphor for tomorrow, and all its promise.
</P>
<P>
   Except the new Cardinals must remember that in many ways, they
gave a game away on Sunday, and it must hurt. All the way to
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   There is danger in being satisfied with what you didn't
accomplish. In feeling good because you could've done better,
could've stunned the world. There is danger in realizing you're
closer than you thought.
</P>
<P>
   They exceeded expectations. They won a playoff game. They turned
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But the season ended with a nauseating loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, we lost by 20,'' Corey Chavous said. ``Who can be
happy about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. &QL;

PURPLE REIGNS: JITTERS, TURNOVERS DIG HOLE FOR CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Bobby McFerrin was on the Metrodome field for 2
minutes and 1 second on Sunday, hitting some incredibly high notes
while belting out our national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1 minute and 7 seconds longer than the Cardinals
offense was out there in the first quarter. With quarterback Jake
Plummer hitting mostly low notes, the Cardinals quickly were in the
position they knew they couldn't afford to be in _ 17 points behind
the NFL's most explosive team, the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jake rattled and rolled, throwing wildly and serving up
two early interceptions that helped dig the hole, and then fumbling
away a snap in the third quarter when the Cardinals had a chance to
cut the margin to six points.
</P>
<P>
   When the turnovers were combined with a defense that couldn't
stop the Vikings, the Cardinals' dream ride ended in the second
round of the playoffs. The NFC Central champion Vikings thumped the
Cards, 41-21, to move on to the NFC Championship game against
Atlanta here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' was a McFerrin classic, and it could
have been the mantra of a young team that exceeded all projections.
But the Cardinals were singing a different tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're mad,'' said Plummer, who completed 23 of 41
passes for 242 yards, no touchdowns and the two interceptions. ``We
should be mad for a while and let this sting. We had a great
opportunity, and we did not take advantage of it. Maybe a month
from now when I'm teeing off, I'll look back and think we did have
a great season.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Vikings, with a league-leading 15-1 regular-season
record, are having an even greater one, showing why they were
unsurpassed as a scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   With three All-Pros leading the way on their line, an explosive
running back, the league's best trio of wide receivers and a
veteran quarterback, who at age 35 still has plenty of mobility,
the Vikings scored on seven of their 10 possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're awfully good,'' said Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin.
``I'm not sure I know what a juggernaut is, but they looked pretty
good to me. They have great skill people.''
</P>
<P>
   That started with Vikings running back Robert Smith rushing for
124 yards, 6.5 a carry. Leroy Hoard added 44 hard-fought yards up
the middle, 4.0 a carry, and scored three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed they were able to run the ball like that,''
Tobin said. ``That's where defense has to start, no matter the
skill of the receivers. We tried everything in our defensive
arsenal, and nothing was particularly effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by a rushing game, Vikings quarterback Randall
Cunningham was free to pass for 236 yards and three touchdowns.
Cris Carter caught five of them for 82 yards. Randy Moss grabbed
four for 73.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of trying to force the ball, I've got Robert Smith to
hand off to,'' said Cunningham, who was coaxed out of retirement
last year to sign with the Vikings. ``When you know you've got
second-and-three, that makes a difference in my game preparation. I
don't have to scramble around anymore and try to make things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With 416 total yards, the Vikings had 100 more than the
Cardinals. The Vikings punted only once. Five of their kickoffs
were touchbacks, leaving the Cardinals a long field when playing
catchup. The Cardinals had 13 penalties, many caused by the crowd
noise. But the crusher was the three turnovers that gave Minnesota
17 easy points.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals defense, which had surrendered only five
touchdowns in its previous four games, yielded five touchdowns to a
team that set an NFL scoring record this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up short today, but we've laid the foundation for good
teams in the future,'' Tobin said. ``This is still a very young
team, and Minnesota is a very veteran team in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play this game to win the Super Bowl. You have to go in
increments to get there, and we made giant strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, around whom the future of the franchise revolves,
acknowledged that on this afternoon he played more like a wide-eyed
24-year-old neophyte than a $29.7 million superstar that the team
believes he will be one day. After his first five throws, he had no
completions and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was loud, a different situation,'' Plummer said of the
crowd of 63,760 in the Metrodome. ``We hadn't been any place like
this. The first interception was just me being hyped up wanting to
make a big play. The next one, I just didn't get my feet set and I
threw the ball high.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer settled down and positioned the Cardinals to get back
into the game in the third quarter. Then, he made the killer play.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cardinals trailing, 27-13, and in possession of the
ball at their 32, Plummer, fumbled a snap from center Aaron Graham.
Minnesota's Antonio Banks recovered at the Cardinals 19, and the
Vikings scored in three plays to seal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had just shifted to a defensive front where we had to
audible into a better protection,'' Plummer said. ``We were going
on a silent count because of the crowd noise, and that process
takes about 4 seconds. There were 3 seconds on the play clock.
That's something you can't have happen in a critical situation.'' &QL;

 BLEAK FORECAST FOR FUTURE OF HEALTH CARE  &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a turbulent decade in American medicine
begins its final spin, crystal ball- &LR;  gazers are peering into the
future of health care, and they are not finding a pretty picture.
</P>
<P>
   In 2010, millions of Americans will still be living without
health insurance, whether or not HMOs are able to tame health care
inflation. Medicine will come in distinctly different flavors for
rich and poor, and Americans of all backgrounds will have to dig
deeper to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   This rather bleak assessment comes from the Institute for the
Future, a top national forecaster of health care trends based in
Menlo Park, Calif., that will offer its latest predictions at a
conference Monday in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the tea leaves are read, the institute will
report, &LR;  that the future of health care in America is fatefully
intertwined with the prospects of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   If, as in the rosiest scenario, HMOs fulfill their promise of
efficient, market-driven medicine, only one in 10 Americans will
lack health insurance by 2010, and the size of the nation's medical
bill will track the course of general inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic that, even in the best scenario, we will still
have 30 million uninsured,'' said Wendy Everett, the study's lead
author and director of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   But if HMOs lose their grip on health care spending _ succumbing
to backlash from angry consumers and doctors alike _ health
spending a decade hence will consume 19 percent of the nation's
output, compared with 13.5 percent today, and one in five Americans
will be without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   A third scenario, which envisions the next decade as maintaining
the status quo, forecasts modest growth in health care costs, &LR;  and
a nation with 47 million uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   While laboratories continue to churn out breathtaking
discoveries in molecular biology, the day-to-day business of
finding a way to pay for modern medical miracles only gets more
muddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American health care system is at once the most expensive
and the most inadequate system in the developed world, and it is
uniquely complicated,'' wrote Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of the New
England Journal of Medicine, in the first article of a gloomy new
series on American health policy trends.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for the Future's forecast sees no revival of
political will to win universal health care for Americans. That
notion was smothered with the demise of the Clinton
administration's Health Security Act in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the rhetoric, we haven't seen any significant
innovation in social programs in this country since Medicare in the
1960s,'' Everett said. ``For all the talk of patient's rights, I
don't think we'll see anything significant through 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   What she does see is a health care system whose tenuous grip on
runaway costs rests in the hands of HMOs and other managed-care
entities. Despite public disdain for the cost-conscious health
plans, Everett predicts working people will flock to them.
Employers are shifting health care costs to their employees, and
employees will react by picking the lowest-cost alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be 120 million people in HMOs by 2010,'' Everett
said. That's about a 70 percent increase from the 70 million
enrolled in HMOs today.
</P>
<P>
   Like them or not, Everett credits HMOs with engineering an
extraordinary slowdown of soaring health care costs during the the
past five years. Since the 1960s, the average annual growth in
health care spending was 11 percent. In the past five years, the
average growth rate was 6.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the institute's different scenarios for health care
inflation and the number of uninsured are tied to the ability of
managed care to continue its work.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics of HMOs acknowledge that managed care has played a
key role in containing health care costs, but they question the
price consumers have had to pay in terms of quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be tremendously foolhardy to rely on for-profit
managed care to save us,'' said Jamie Court, of Consumers for
Quality Care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to block management of care,'' said Court,
whose Santa Monica group has sponsored an array of legislation
intended to rein in the power of health plans. ``We're trying to
create it. The system today has never managed care. It just manages
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's worst-case scenario, which forecasts 65 million
uninsured Americans by 2010, assumes that managed care buckles
under pressure from angry consumers and doctors and from its own
internal greed. Instead of effectively maintaining cost and
quality, the HMOs resort to hassling doctors and offering coverage
only to the healthiest consumers. Backlash prompts restrictions
that hamstring cost-control techniques. Employers drop insurance
coverage rather than pay higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   A more optimistic scenario foresees a continuation of
consolidation in the health care industry, leading to more
efficient hospitals and doctor organizations. Among the premises:
`` &LR; Younger physicians enter the market with lower income
expectations and more of an employee mentality than their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to electronic medical records goes smoothly, and the
development of new medical technologies is steered toward those
that reduce costs as well as save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Everett is not optimistic that American society can control its
craving for costly new medical technologies. But current trends are
not sustainable. ``We can't continue to demand more, &LR;  and refuse to
pay for it,'' she said.

 VIEW CLINTON AS CHILD OF GOD, MINISTER PLEADS  &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ On a snowy Sunday morning in March 1993, the
Rev. J. Philip Wogaman got a phone call from the White House,
informing him that President Clinton and his wife were on their way
over to Washington's Foundry United Methodist Church to attend the
regular weekly worship service.
<P>
   Wogaman, who had never met the Clintons, didn't even have time
to get nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as one of three spiritual advisers to the shamed and
embattled president, Wogaman finds himself at the center of an
ethical and political crisis of historic dimensions, the fallout
from a sexual affair that is both intensely personal and
embarrassingly public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so distressed that this period of weakness in that area of
his life has been used so relentlessly to destroy him,'' Wogaman
said in a weekend interview. ``I wish there was more respect for
him as a human being, as a child of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman was in San Francisco over the weekend to attend the
convention of the Society of Christian Ethics and to talk about his
new book, ``From the Eye of the Storm _ A Pastor to the President
Speaks Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Americans, Wogaman had heard the stories about
Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones. Last year, when the nation
learned all the lurid details of the president's affair with Monica
Lewinsky, Wogaman was more disappointed than surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pastor is never surprised about anything. Everybody is a
sinner. Everybody is flawed. So, to be a good pastor is not to be
too easily shocked,'' he said. ``But I was deeply disappointed by
the confirmation of many of the allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman, who served for many years as a professor of Christian
ethics at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, said he
considers Clinton's affair to be more ethically troubling than the
president's attempts to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is opposed to all sin, but in a way, the sex part was more
disappointing because it represented a violation of a covenant _ a
vow he had made,'' the president's preacher said. ``The rest of it
was attempting to cover up an embarrassment in an area where he
could argue that it wasn't something that should have been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``His repentance for it began well before any of this was
exposed,'' Wogaman added.
</P>
<P>
   While Christian ethics requires that information from pastoral
counseling sessions be kept in strict confidence, Wogaman says he
was able to write a book about the crisis without violating that
sacred trust. He is donating proceeds of the 139-page book,
published by Westminster John Knox Press, to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president didn't ask me to write it, and I didn't seek
permission to do it,'' said Wogaman. ``When you are serving as a
pastor, those relations are private. But I am also an advocate, a
preacher.''
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Interfaith Alliance, Wogaman is one of the
leading liberal religious voices in the nation's capital, and an
outspoken critic of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, he has opposed the impeachment effort,
favoring a C &LR; congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   Wogaman was asked about recent comments from the Rev. Robert
Schuller that Clinton might suffer from sex addiction and that he
should explore that possibility with a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to psychologize it. I wouldn't use the word
addiction,'' Wogaman said. But he said that if Clinton ``is dealt
with vindictively and destroyed politically by this,'' it would
send a message to people that they will not find healing and
acceptance if they reveal their addictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a tragedy,'' the presidential pastor said. ``And
that is why the path of repentance and forgiveness and moving ahead
is the only way we are going to find healing around this as a
society. To stone the sinner is not the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a member of the Southern Baptist church, and Hillary
Rodham Clinton, a Methodist, frequently attend services at
Wogaman's church, although they retain formal membership in
separate churches in Little Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House prayer breakfast last September, on the same
day the Starr report was released, Clinton announced that he had
selected three spiritual advisers to guide him down the path of
redemption after his affair with Lewinsky. The other two are the
Rev. Tony Campolo, a liberal evangelical from Pennsylvania; and the
Rev. Gordon MacDonald of Grace Chapel in Lexington, Mass., who
wrote a book about his own extramarital affair and quest for
forgiveness.

WHAT'S THAT CLAMOR IN THE COSMOS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you had to name a complaint about life that's high on the
list of most people over, say, age 40, it would be (no, not that;
clean up your mind) noise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our world, quite simply, is overdecibeled, overshrill, overover.
From TVs and CD players to stadia full of half-drunken football
fans to airplanes and cars and trucks and motorcycles and live rock
bands practicing in your basement (well, maybe not your basement,
but certainly mine), noise is the all-too-jarring atmosphere of our
lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not talking about high-crime neighborhoods full of
crackling gunfire or war zones exploding with deadly mortar fire
but, rather, ordinary American life. Now, compare all that noise
with the impression you have of outer space. Ah, silence. Deep,
wonderful, amazing quiet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, we're about to find out if your impression is right. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration has launched an
experiment that I'm pretty sure we'll all regret some day. We're
sending a microphone to Mars to help us hear whatever noise is
going on there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently NASA isn't content to add to the national noise level
by blasting rockets into space now and then. It wants to find more
noise out in the cosmos and bring it back to Earth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As I say, this strikes me as a bozo notion, but I'm nearly
always willing for science to work its way through the rubble of
bad ideas on the chance it will serendipitously find something
wonderful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Polar Lander took off recently from Cape Canaveral,
which I think used to be Cape Kennedy, which used to be Cape
Canaveral, unless I've got it all mixed up with Hyannisport, which
used to be Hyannisport. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Polar Lander will take the entire upcoming baseball season
and most of the next football season to get where it's going. It is
expected to land on Mars on Dec. 3, by which time we'll be sick of
1999, no doubt, and eager for the chaos, turmoil and higher taxes
promised by 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I haven't figured out why NASA's wizards picked the 181st
anniversary of Illinois (my native state) joining the union for the
Mars landing. Maybe they wished to avoid conflicting with former
Saint Barbara's Day, the next day, Dec. 4. I don't know what _
besides ``former'' _ you call someone who, in 1970, was dropped
from the Roman Catholic Calendar of Saints, though when something
similar happened to St. Christopher all those dashboard statues
became known as Mr. Christopher medals. Whatever the thinking, the
Mars Microphone is to listen for the sounds of, well, no one knows
what. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mike was provided to NASA at no cost by the Planetary
Society of the University of California's Berkeley Space Sciences
Lab, an outfit known to its friends as OSUCBSSL, or oh-suck-bustle.
Or, anyway, known as that to me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OSUCBSSL says the mike is ``the first scientific instrument
funded by a public-interest organization to fly aboard a planetary
mission.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That makes it different from the scientific instrument funded by
a public-interest organization that flew aboard the space shuttle
last year, John Glenn, though there are those who would argue that
the U.S. Senate may not actually be a public-interest group. But
let it go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Planetary Society, in an officially launched press release,
quotes Louis Friedman, its executive director, as saying, ``Placing
a microphone to listen in on another world is a real opportunity
for discovery.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But I bet we discover one more thing at which to
shout: ``Please turn that darn thing down!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Communism seeks out religion
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, Jan. 13, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The visit of Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema, a communist and
atheist, to Pope John Paul II last Friday was just another example
of the socialist world recognizing the fact that, despite its
personal dislike for religion _ a competitor _ it is impossible to
rule without it.
</P>
<P>
   And that's because the people the communists rule will not
abandon their religions. This has little to do with whether the
fundamentalist tenets of religion are true and more to do with the
fact that the people believe them to be.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro finally recognized that when he invited the pope to
Cuba, then followed up by reinstating Christmas as a holiday. To
say he used the pope's visit to strengthen his grip on a decaying
Cuba would be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   He found the formula: Give the people back their religion and
they'll become acquiescent about most other problems.
</P>
<P>
   This would be the case in Italy, where the communists have made
strong inroads since the end of World War II but at the expense of
provoking the papacy, inasmuch as atheism is a stated canon of
communist belief. By amending relationships with the Vatican _ by
going to the pope _ D'Alema has recognized the strongest emotional
link held by the Italian people: religion. He, like Castro, seems
to be saying that communism and religion can co-exist.
</P>
<P>
   While this pope's lifetime experiences, often heroic, ordinarily
would generate another opinion, the Polish-born and -raised pontiff
accepts these gestures and sees them as inroads to strengthen the
church within communist nations.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Mao Tse-Tung, China's founding communist ruler,
spoke often of God and of heaven. The newly released transcripts of
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's visits with Mao contain
many references to God, including this one in 1973 when Kissinger
was visiting the physically declining Mao and the conversation
turned to a possible attack by the U.S.S.R. on China: ``I'm not
afraid of anything. Anyway, God has sent me an invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything has succeeded in post-communist Russia, it has been
religion. It's been a constant, thousands of years older than
atheistic communism. Russians didn't just become Christians,
Muslims or Jews when the U.S.S.R. collapsed in 1991. Most of the
proletariat had remained faithful to a god through the 74 years of
Bolshevism, that faith passed down from generation to generation.
What happened in 1991 simply was an outing; it had been there all
along.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an essay that claims the beliefs of all religions
are valid or even rational; to each his own. What I am saying is
that most of the people of the world, from the U.S. to China and
everywhere in between, cling to some sort of faith. Call it
religion, call it mumbo-jumbo, call it superstition, call it
whatever you want, but to those people it is a faith.
</P>
<P>
   By instituting a form of government that maintains faith is
merely a delusion and, thus, cannot be practiced is to run against
the grain of human nature. You can force them to work longer on
behalf of the state, deny them foods and medicines, and most of
their rights, but you cannot separate people from their faith. It
is a battle the communists never could win. Only now are they
recognizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Italy never was in danger of losing its deep faith to communism.
The Vatican always has maintained a strong hand there, including
excommunicating communists in the immediate post-World War II years
when communism was growing rapidly in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, few, if any, of its premiers were anything but Roman
Catholic. But D'Alema is not. He is a pronounced atheist who sees
in Pope John Paul II a man he needs to create political stability
in an unstable but heavily Roman Catholic Italy.
</P>
<P>
   How the pope uses that to a religious advantage is anyone's
guess, but the Castro visit would indicate he knows what he's
doing.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gun industry has made itself a target
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With megabuck settlements won from the tobacco mongers as
inspiration, a growing number of individuals and cities are filing
lawsuits against gun makers in hopes of similar manna _ and, for
the well-intentioned among the plaintiffs, in hopes of forcing a
little sanity on the nation's lunatic gun trade.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco-equals-guns formula is rickety at best. In its
intended use, tobacco sickens and kills. Firearms maim and kill
mainly in their misuse. Tobacco, as a product, is pure liability.
Guns serve hunting, sport shooting, collecting and, although poorly
and with outsized risks, personal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits dodge that awkward comparison by arguing,
variously, that the industry has been negligent in failing to adopt
easy safety features, winks at sales practices that all but openly
serve criminal buyers and produces far more weapons than legitimate
trade needs, knowing the excess must go to the under-age and the
underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Fair arguments, worth court time, but the industry feels it is
just a target of opportunity, and opportunists. Perhaps that's so
in some cases, but the industry has got it coming anyway. Its own
fierce opposition to a comprehensive national firearms policy has
forced the issues out of the political arena, where they really
belong, and into the courts as a backup venue.
</P>
<P>
   Polls since the 1930s have tracked steady public support for gun
control at 65 percent, give or take a bit. But the inert support
has been no match for its passionate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobby _ manufacturers, sellers and companion interest
groups like the National Rifle Association _ has used scare tactics
and lavish campaign contributions to run off or buy out Congress
and state legislatures. The result is a hopeless hodgepodge of laws
that are easily evaded and a mish-mash of muddled accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Other industrial countries have national firearms policies,
ranging from fairly accommodating to dauntingly prohibitive but in
any event with clear payoffs in public safety. It is not hard to
imagine a policy for us that would both respect private ownership
and serve public interests _ something like the familiar
car-and-driver model of registration and periodic licensing, with
the cheap handguns that are made for the thug and kid clienteles
banned.
</P>
<P>
   If there was ever a poster child for gun violence, we're it.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 200 million guns floating around this
country, 65 million of them handguns. Gun deaths, not counting
justifiable homicides, were running at about 33,500 annually at
last count. The huge jump in juvenile and young-adult murders in
the late '80s and early '90s was entirely the nasty work of gun
violence, as the firearms glut reached new hands.
</P>
<P>
   The public has a manifest interest in setting out reasonable
rules for firearms manufacture, sales and ownership. By
successfully closing off political deliberation and compromise, the
industry and the lobby have left public policy to be improvised by
the vagaries of litigation. They may come to regret their success.

   A Boston Globe column by Adrian Walker stated incorrectly that
former Senate President William M. Bulger was among a number of
legislators fined in 1992 by the Massachusetts Ethics Commission,
and that the commission's budget was then promptly cut. Bulger has
never been fined by the Commission. Fourteen past and present
legislators were fined as a result of activities in 1992, but the
fines were imposed in 1994 and 1995. Although the House attempted
to cut the commission's budget in 1995, the Senate, then headed by
Bulger, resisted the cut. The funding was restored by a
House-Senate conference committee.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Clear picture, in hindsight
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the year 2025, which way will it read?
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade of the 20th century, American turned back to
basic moral values _ a movement epitomized in the U.S. House of
Representatives by the bringing of articles of impeachment against
President William Jefferson Clinton, subsequently tried by the
Senate, but not convicted, for lying under oath about a sexual
relationship with a White House intern. Clinton was viewed in the
years following as unfit for the presidency. The new public
spotlight on moral character was a major factor in the election of
the first woman president, Republican Elizabeth Hanford Dole.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade of the 20th century, Americans endured an era
of political and media meddling in the sex lives of its political
leaders. The so-called Moral Majority, never really in the
majority, was such a vocal minority within the GOP that it turned
voters away from the conservative economic agenda that brought the
GOP to majority power in the 1994 congressional election. A fiery
and strategic-thinking Georgia Republican, Newt Gingrich, elected
speaker of the House, stepped down when the GOP made a poor showing
in the 1998 election. Gingrich was never seen on the political
stage again, but he was often seen entering and exiting the front
doors of corporate jets.
</P>
<P>
   America, the powerful victor in the Cold War against communism,
entered the 21st century with money as its highest value.
End-of-the-century highlights included billion-dollar fights
between greedy power brokers in the sports world and a stock market
mentality that ignored all values except profits. The era of
economic success and budget surpluses, rightly or wrongly, was
credited to the Democratic administration of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Surrealism gripped the American capital at the onset of the
millennium year. It was, in hindsight, the climax of a backlash
against the baby boomer generation and a young president who
represented it. In the opening days of 1999, a 96-year-old Southern
senator swore in the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court to
preside over the impeachment trial of one of the most popular
presidents in United States history. Senators considered removing
Clinton from office on dubious charges of perjury and obstruction
of justice, all relating to an embarrassing sexual relationship,
while opinion polls showed Clinton to be more admired than the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans lost popular support for a dozen years thereafter,
leaving Democrats in the presidency and in the majority in
Congress. New York voters sent former first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who had stood loyally by the husband who betrayed her, to
the U.S. Senate, where she rose to chair the powerful Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-millennium era of prying into people's private lives was
brought on mostly by 24-hour news, which entered into a
``celebritization'' of politicians, comparable with that of sports
figures and rock stars. One of the primary figures in the movement
to disregard privacy was Ken Starr, named to investigate the
alleged financial misdeeds of President Clinton. Starr was unable
to find any illegal conduct in his Whitewater finance probe, so he
convinced the attorney general and a three-judge panel to allow him
to pursue the president's reckless sexual encounters in the Oval
Office with an intern.
</P>
<P>
   To prove Starr's perjury charges, tawdry sexual details had to
be laid out in a Senate trial. Americans were so turned off by such
a thing that they approved an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to
guarantee explicitly a right to privacy, one assumed previously to
be part of the liberty right.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The most successful businesses get old by staying
new
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, that Tara _
that land doesn't mean anything to you? Why ... it's the only thing
that lasts.'' _ ``Gone With the Wind''
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett's daddy may have believed that only the land would last
in the South, but humidity and thirst are awfully enduring
features, too. That may help explain why two old Atlanta companies,
one big and one small, have a shot at celebrating the dawn of 2100.
</P>
<P>
   The Coca-Coca Co., incorporated in 1892, is secure among that
elite group of U.S. companies that have weathered a century of
fantastic social and technological change. Though Americans have
dramatically altered many of their tastes in the past century, they
still reach for a cold Coke when they're thirsty.
</P>
<P>
   And when Atlantans want to adjust their indoor climate, they
still hire Moncrief Heating and Air Conditioning Inc. In 1898, when
The Moncrief Furnace Co. was founded, Southerners controlled their
comfort by throwing another log on the fire or opening the door to
catch a breeze. So few furnaces existed in the 1890s that Moncrief
had to build the devices before they could install and repair them.
When air conditioning began to transform the South after 1950,
Moncrief starting building and installing those contraptions, too.
Today, with about 50 employees in Atlanta, the company is thriving.
</P>
<P>
   But how do these companies do it? Can they last another hundred
years?
</P>
<P>
   At least in the case of Coca-Cola, most Americans believe the
future looks promising. A recent national poll sponsored by the
Shell Oil Co. found that 89 percent of adults think the beverage
company will be around to toast 2100.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such optimism, the chances of pulling through a century
are fairly remote. ``In any industry, there are always far, far
more firms that enter and exit quickly than survive over a long
period,'' said David Hounshell, professor of technology and social
change at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ``The companies
that do survive are very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hounshell said survivors typically have two things in common:
No. 1, they entered their industry on the ground floor, and No. 2,
they hired smart people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helps to be an early entrant in your industry,'' he
said. So it's no surprise that pioneers such as Ford, Western
Union, General Electric and AT&AMP;T are survivors. And, ``It's very
important to have people who work harder and have better analytical
skills'' than competitors, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But being a trailblazer is no guarantee of success. Just ask
investors in the Hayes Corp. Once one of metro Atlanta's
highest-flying start-ups, Hayes collapsed into a heap of bills and
burnout last week. On its 21st birthday, the modem maker moved to
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a small company survive? By being aggressive in
adopting new technologies, says Moncrief chairman Frank Mutz. Even
a business as mundane as installing air conditioners requires heavy
doses of technology. ``The changes we are facing are
mind-boggling,'' Mutz said. ``It's unbelievable what we're doing
with computers.'' The company has just started using the Internet
to expand its heating and cooling business.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet for air conditioning? Yes, by using networked
computers, Moncrief is branching into distant cities, hiring
repairmen in Lexington, Ky., St. Louis, Indianapolis and elsewhere
while keeping the accounting, paging, billing, monitoring,
scheduling and so forth in the home office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   So can even a small business survive a second century? ``I see
no reason not to,'' Mutz said. ``We're actually excited about the
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's not the humidity, it's the heat of
competition that keeps companies sizzling.
</P>

Marilyn Geewax on issues raised by the coming of 2000.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Swallowing a dog, choking on a flea
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fl.a _ Much has been made of the almost
unanimous support among blacks for President Clinton. The most
pious critics suggest that such support is an acceptance of lower
moral standards and a disregard for the level of decency and
integrity set forth in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that such critics consider another possibility:
government-sanctioned social conditioning. The history of black
people in this country has taught most of us that, in governing,
Americans condone selective morality, the kind that can swallow a
dog but choke on a flea to preserve power.
</P>
<P>
   Even when discriminatory practices by our government are
confirmed beyond any doubt, the public demands no official
admission of guilt to declare that past actions will not be
tolerated in the future. Nor in such cases of abuse of power is
there public outrage that a moral message must be sent to America's
children. We have only to look at recent events to confirm this
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Department of Agriculture settled a
discrimination suit brought by black farmers. This case was filed
in 1997 after many years of futile protests and public
demonstrations. Farmers argued that since 1983, the department
systematically had denied them loans and subsidies routinely given
to white farmers. Many black farmers lost part or all of their land
as they sank deeper and deeper into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Even after discrimination had been documented, records show that
department officials lied and used every legal maneuver to obstruct
justice. That caused little public concern, then or now, with this
suit being expediently settled by consent decree to avoid giving
wider exposure to blatant discriminatory practices. The $375
million settlement cannot compensate fully what the farmers lost,
nor can it make up for the loss to America's farm culture of
countless black people who wanted just to earn a living through
sweat and toil on their own land.
</P>
<P>
   Probably, many black youths who have taken up careers in the
drug trade or otherwise abandoned efforts to remain within the
system are amused that the government is offering the black farmers
chump change by today's standards: a minimum of $50,000 tax free
and forgiveness of their debts to the Agriculture Department. Money
as a moral salve is not a remedy that can heal the debilitating
wounds of official bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The cynicism of those who have lost all respect for law,
however, warrants less concern than the settlement's provision that
the department does not admit it discriminated against the farmers.
The department agrees only that its procedures in handling bias
cases were ``flawed,'' says civil rights director Rosalind Gray.
And, may I add, tolerance of little flaws to serve the ends of
power is the American way.
</P>
<P>
   Such tolerance of ethical compromise emboldens other officials,
without regard to the Constitution, to routinely apply selective
morality as it suits their purpose. Evidence can be found
throughout this country's history _ from treatment of Native
Americans to discrimination against peoples of color. Indeed,
tolerance of immorality to perpetuate power among those
traditionally in power has become so pervasive that our intrinsic
perceptions of right and wrong are skewed by our politics more than
by any other principles.
</P>
<P>
   Lying under oath, sworn or implied by the responsibilities of
office, and obstruction of legal justice are grievous offenses.
Unfortunately, our government never has declared them punishable
behavior worthy of expulsion from office. Our children know that.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial
resulting from his reprehensible sexual behavior, children will
ultimately conclude, as most blacks have already concluded, that
our government demands adherence to a strict moral code _ but only
when that standard serves the purposes of those in power. National
integrity should be made of sterner stuff.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Cherish the moments
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Every so often, our senses awaken to the absolute
splendor of a given moment in time.
</P>
<P>
   I experienced such a moment recently. The scent of banana bread
baking filled the house. The boys and I were playing a board game
at the living room table. Music hummed softly in the background.
The dogs curled in slumber at our feet. Candles glowed warmly. It
was a moment awash in the goodness of life.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, most of our days are flooded with such moments.
The sweet, clean smell of your child's hair as he nuzzles in your
arms. The adoring brown eyes of your dog as she sits at your feet
showering your hand with dog kisses. Grandma's crocheted afghan
lovingly tucked around you by your husband as you drowse on the
couch. The heady aroma of hot, buttered popcorn. The page-turning
thrill of a well-written book.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeting moments all, often taken wholly for granted. Very few
are appreciated, especially in this day of gross sensationalism and
overstimulation.
</P>
<P>
   The news that bombards us daily is outrageous and confusing and
numbing. Special effects litter the media at every turn. It's a
deluge of sensory titillation that overwhelms. If it's not
exploding or morphing, or it doesn't come in the form of a
confession or an apology, it hardly registers on our awareness
scale. We live in a time when we can honestly say, ``I've seen it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that we get to a point where we don't see
anything. Too much is too much. For self-preservation, we have to
filter out a great deal of what assaults our senses.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, I swore off any movie that consisted
primarily of special effects. The other night, at the urging of our
sons, I relented and watched ``Amageddon'' with them. Halfway
through it, I was overloaded. Explosions and hurling meteors had
made a full frontal assault. Too much. Too much.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true with what passes for media coverage these days.
Do I really need to know about a growing list of politicians'
infidelities? It isn't new, but these days it is the news. Do I
really want to know about the cigar or the blue dress? Too much.
Too much.
</P>
<P>
   We have lost the art of subtlety, of clever nuance, of a finely
turned phrase or a delicate bon mot. Why are the movies based on
Jane Austen's books such a breath of fresh air? Because they allow
us to breathe. These carefully crafted movies return us to the
understated, where the most sensuous sexual expression is the touch
of hands and a fervent glance across the spinet piano.
</P>
<P>
   We now have seen and heard visions we could not have imagined.
So, of what use is our imagination? We have stripped it of its
possibility. What is left to dream?
</P>
<P>
   A telling moment for me occurred a few years ago. I was driving
our younger sons to the medical center for a doctor's appointment
when we saw a medivac helicopter landing on the medical center
roof. It hovered directly over us, the noise of its engine and
blades reverberating in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderstruck, one son, who was 5 at the time, whispered
reverently: ``Awesome graphics!''
</P>
<P>
   Reality had been reduced to a video game.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, those fragile moments of beauty and fulfillment are all
around us. We have to learn to readjust our antenna, to put a
V-chip block on the outrageous and the overdone. Life is more than
a never-ending assault on the senses.
</P>
<P>
   When we've reached our limit, we need to limit ourselves . . .
to the tiny, the inconspicuous, the delicate, the exquisite
ordinariness of the moments of our lives. It is where great meaning
is found.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Stammer at the sound of the tone
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Nobody sounds good on an answering
machine. No, not even Barry White.
</P>
<P>
   But become too aware of this fact, and you risk the heartbreak
of voice-mail freeze. And because every day increases the chances
that any telephone call you make will hook up to a machine,
voice-mail freeze can mess up your life. It can earn you the
contempt of superiors and the ridicule of subordinates. It can make
your romantic interest think twice and three times.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-mail freeze is a lot like stage fright. It happens when a
recording takes your message over the phone and you suddenly
realize you don't know what to say or what you said already didn't
come out right.
</P>
<P>
   Some people recover right away. Maybe most do. But many of us
get caught in a paralyzing spiral of embarrassment. If you back up
and explain yourself again, you will sound stupid. If you hang up,
you will be rude and mysterious. Perhaps a stalker and a candidate
for call-blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the seconds tick away and you don't know how much
time is left for more explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Your mind reels. You freeze. But wait, the lengthening silence
will sound even dumber on the phone than anything you'd say. Too
late. You can't do another take. You can't take it back. The tape
is still moving. The chip is still memorizing this pitiful
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This makes you freeze more. Remember: Two-minute message limits
are the norm. With time running out, you might try spitting out a
time you called and add a lame request to call back _ as though
someone would return a call from a voice-mail freezer _ or you
might wait out the clock and listen to the recording stop midway
through your last, pathetic ``uh.''
</P>
<P>
   You hang up the phone, sweating and trying to hide your
embarrassment. But to no avail. It's all on tape. It's all on the
memory chip. Recorded for the ages. A completed performance. The
person receiving the message might save it, might play it back a
few times, might let friends listen to it, might post it on a Web
site, or might add it to a CD compilation entitled the ``The 100
Dumbest Taped Messages of Western Man.'' (Call now, this CD is not
available in stores anywhere!) You don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Out of such uncertainty, voice-mail freeze spreads.
</P>
<P>
   The worst instances of voice-mail freeze aren't pitiable efforts
to recover from mistakes. They kick in when a recorded greeting
ends abruptly and you can't remember your lines. Maybe you wing it
by stammering out your name and number, but the words are hardly
off your lips before you need to figure out something else to say.
</P>
<P>
   These are the freeziest and most baffling of nonmessages for the
recipient. And they often take the entire time allotted in
unaccountable silences and stammering of monosyllables: ``uhm,
muhmf, uh, blheh, eh ...''
</P>
<P>
   One desperate way around voice mail freeze is to wonder aloud if
the person you're calling can hear the incoming call and is only
using the machine to screen messages. This comes from the vain hope
that maybe, just maybe, a live person is lurking somewhere close
by. It is a cry for help. It leaves you sounding like a desperate
member of a search-and-rescue team. ``Are you there? Can anyone
hear me? Shout if you can hear my voice ...''
</P>
<P>
   There is no graceful recovery if you're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For the very frustrated who are willing to brazen it out,
there's always the old switcheroo. You can pretend you are the
voice on the answering machine and demand the answering machine
leave you a message. ``I can't make it to the phone right now ...''
you state officiously.
</P>
<P>
   It's just confusing enough to your listener to cover a hasty
retreat, but it depends on you being able to make a convincing beep
at the end. Trying this more than once per answering machine is not
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   But these are mere palliatives. There ain't no cure for
voice-mail freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Until our technology can filter ``uhs'' from our phone voices,
listeners should discretely skip past the verbal thrashing about of
the voice-mail challenged. They should be understanding toward
those who just aren't meant for the recording business.
</P>
<P>
   And that's ... well, ... uh, ... really all I called to say.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Students speak out on school discipline
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A group of juniors at Campbell County High
School in northern Kentucky have responded to a column I wrote last
fall expressing my
</P>
<P>
   irritation with the parents of eight teens in Chelsea, Mich.,
who complained the school had no business suspending their kids
from school sports for 30 days for breaking into a local club. I
suggested the parents (and kids) quit whining and thank the school
for picking up the slack on a job the parents should have done
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the students had to say: Kevin Seiter, fearing
pessimism is taking over the world, chastises me for not mentioning
good students' parents and the great job they've done. ``I myself
am an A student with a clean record,'' he writes, ``and it's all
because of my parents. I thank GOD every day that I have two
wonderful, caring parents to be there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Alesha Caracecilia Chinn wonders if I'm not being too critical.
She reminds me that kids will be kids and even though their parents
might watch their children very closely they still might ``learn
things they shouldn't at school or from peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Harmon says things have changed since I was in school
in the '40s and '50s and asks me to `` ... just try to put yourself
in the shoes of a teen in today's world. Everyone is already
judging you and trying to find something to accuse you of. We don't
need it from the school too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Hale agrees about the importance of parents caring but
suggests that
</P>
<P>
   schools keep their noses out of their students' business.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Scott believes that the way students act in school
depends on their home life. ``I strongly believe discipline must
come from home before kids begin
</P>
<P>
   to have self-discipline.'' She also raises the possibility that
parents don't want to admit that their child's behavior is based on
how the child was raised. ``I know that my parents' strict behavior
will one day benefit me,'' she writes, ``and I hope others realize
that too.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela (AJ) Klette says I am WRONG! WRONG! and WRONG! and that
every day of
</P>
<P>
   her life her mom has ``installed (sic) a deep sense of values'
into her head and heart. ``It hurts me,'' she adds, ``to think that
most people think the way you've
</P>
<P>
   written.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Wells says her parents have strict rules. ``If I broke a
rule at school, I would be punished at school and at home. You do
the crime, you do the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Lynn Childers agrees that parents should take
responsibility for their children. ``If as high school students
they are breaking into clubs, I would hate to see what they are
doing as adults in the real world. For what the parents don't take
care of now, they are going to be extremely sorry on down the road.
If I were to do what these kids have done, I would be feeling the
generations of discipline in both parents' history behind that
whack!''
</P>
<P>
   Hoepe Bowen does not believe that students should be disciplined
by schools for things they do out of school. ``Most kids do get
discipline from their parents but teenagers do not always listen.
It is not the parents' fault when kids screw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua McKenzie agrees. Schools, he writes are there to teach,
not to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Penrod suggests schools should butt out and wants to know
where I got the ``guts to go out on a limb and write a piece like
that.'' He's asked me to explain where I got the courage. That's an
easy one, Kyle. The courage came from 64 years of living, 31 years
of being a parent, and 10 years of being a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Terena Ziegler took a tough position. ``The parents need to
realize that maybe if they lived up to their responsibilities ...
then the school wouldn't have been
</P>
<P>
   involved. I'm a teenager myself and when I get into trouble my
parents punish

   me. I learn my lesson and know better than to do it again. I
know how the life

the way to go.

   Those parents are to blame along with their children.''

   Terena poses a few questions of her own: ``How do you discipline
your

would you

   like to see the discipline code among schools in the United

   I'll answer the questions in order, Terena:

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Not much of a change in weather, airlines, or makeup
of Congress
 &HT;    By Ana Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ When someone asked what I got for Christmas, I
ticked off a list of things that came in boxes and sat under the
tree. However, other ``gifts'' which I received may be more
noteworthy and certainly shared by many others: weather and airline
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Texans adapt to most kinds of weather well. We have no choice.
At most, weather has caused me temporary inconvenience, some worry
and maybe a several hour stretch without water or power.
</P>
<P>
   So a late-night wait for a flight three days before Christmas
wondering if my firstborn made it out of a frozen New Orleans
airport was a frightening and frustrating experience. After an
airline delay caused her to miss her original connection, the same
idiots, uh, airline did not show her on a later flight to
Shreveport, La., the last to get out that night after many delays
caused by icy weather. Neither did she answer a 20-minute page at
the New Orleans terminal.
</P>
<P>
   All her father, brother and I could do was sit, wait, pray and
stare into the darkness to see if she got off that last flight. She
did.
</P>
<P>
   Putting her back on a plane brought me another sort of Christmas
package, a rather disheveled one. In our third year of transporting
her back and forth from college in Massachusetts, we apparently
have gotten a little slack.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at the terminal, we discovered she did not have
her overcoat. Not good when she would be greeted by wind chills of
10 degrees below zero. A quick call to her sister resulted in the
coat and a pair of tennis shoes she didn't remember she had
forgotten being quickly transported to the airport. Meanwhile, the
very courteous clerk informed us LeighAna's bag was six pounds over
the weight limit. That means it weighed 76 pounds. Yes, it's a big
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Ever had to unpack in the middle of an airport?
</P>
<P>
   After unloading a Scrabble game, a couple of sweatshirts, a
bottle of cocoa mix, some sheets and the world's largest crossword
puzzle, the bag was five pounds under the limit. She asked for the
bag back and put the Scrabble game back in. ``Oops, 73 pounds,''
said the clerk, laughing when he saw our stricken faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   I waved goodbye to her, clutching her discarded articles and
hoping like heck her sister picks a college within easy driving
distance.
</P>
<P>
   On another topic: As I watched the ceremonial beginnings of
President Clinton's impeachment trial, the march of the 13
congressman-managers from the House to the Senate chambers, I was
struck by how little has changed in the 200-plus years since those
bodies were established.
</P>
<P>
   Our government is still run by folks who look a lot alike:
graying, balding, white men.
</P>
<P>
   It is still a strong government and it will survive this ordeal
and future
</P>
<P>
   ones as well.
</P>
<P>
   But when will it truly represent all the people?
</P>
<P>
   Only when we the people decide it will.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Internet without a net
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Internet is: (a) the ultimate encylopedia; (b)
Pandora's box via modem.
</P>
<P>
   People across the country, and in Waco this week, are arguing
whether the answer is (a) or (b).
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is: (c) all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   And the question of the moment is what to do when you have this
wondrous, mischievous resource in a public library.
</P>
<P>
   What you do, a federal court in Virginia has ruled, is that you
let the people open the encyclopedia/box, without choosing for them
what they can or cannot view.
</P>
<P>
   If you avail the Internet at a public library, ruled a judge in
a case involving the Loudoun County public library, installing
pornography-blocking software without patrons' consent violates the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court likely will rule on this in due time. But
people who want libraries to porn-block the Internet in these
public venues should know that the court already has sided against
government's prior restraint of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Congress tried prior restraint with the Communications Decency
Act of 1996. A unanimous Supreme Court then ruled that government
had to meet the highest standard of public necessity, the ``strict
scrutiny'' standard, to block anything from the Internet.
Underlying the court decision were the vague criteria the
Communications Decency Act could use to block material from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden words
</P>
<P>
   In the Virginia case, plaintiffs pointed out that
library-installed software blocked some Web sites that had nothing
patently offensive or vulgar, such as the Zero Population Growth
Web site and one offered by the Quakers. The blocking is based on
seeking out key words, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that a public library can
choose to offer Internet services, but cannot choose to offer that
service and then excise parts of it, comparable to tearing pages
out an encyclopedia it offers.
</P>
<P>
   The case set up ironic adversaries. The defendants in the case
were the library and its board. Among those who supported the
plaintiffs' case against the library was the American Library
Association.
</P>
<P>
   One might point out that it's not censorship for libraries to
use discretion as to what material they carry, since they do and
always will.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matthews with the American Library Association said the
discretion amounts to one choice alone: whether to offer the
Internet or not. If you offer it, you offer all of it.
</P>
<P>
   In response to an appeal that she install blocking software,
Waco-McLennan County chief librarian Pamela Bonnell said she won't.
Indeed, she even plans to have an Internet-access terminal in the
children's section when additional terminals are available. She
said the only provision the library might take in the children's
section is to have it in plain sight of a supervisor. Currently,
the library's sole Internet-access terminal has a screen to prevent
eavesdroppers or inadvertent eye-fulls.
</P>
<P>
   Loudoun County's new policy is to make blocking software, still
loaded but in an ``off'' mode, an option to click ``on'' for those
signing up to use the Internet. Children must have the signature of
a parent or guardian, who can choose to have the blocking software
activated.
</P>
<P>
   The American Library Association's Matthews said only about 15
percent of public libraries install blocking software. Based on the
federal court ruling, adults who demand to unblock the 'Net would
be within their rights.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain librarians' virtual solidarity in defiance of
blocking materials?
</P>
<P>
   Their profession is one of which the ``core values'' are
``protecting and advancing intellectual freedom supported by the
First Amendment,'' said Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that First Amendment. It's a Pandora's box, modem not
included.

 &HT;    Recipe sites a tool for every cook
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Food and computers have always made a strange mix. The
earliest programmers and Net wizards seemed to live on Coca-Cola
and cold pizza. But your computer and the Internet can help you
with meals a touch more elaborate than that.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll look at some Web sites that do the expected (provide
terrific recipes) and the unexpected (offer little touches that
make good use of the unique advantages offered by a computer and an
Internet connection).
</P>
<P>
   Our first food site will furnish good examples of what we mean
on both counts. Let's go to Epicurious: Food, Drink, Cooking and
Recipes at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .epicurious.com/ahome
</P>
<P>
   /a00home/home.html to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lavish and well-designed site. It offers a treasure
trove of recipes. Click on the recipe link at the bottom of the
page and you'll be able to ferret out even the most obscure recipe
using keywords. But there are times when you don't know what you'd
like to prepare for dessert, or, if you do know, you can't remember
the name of the dish.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the second method of searching the recipe file will
come in handy. It's divided into what seems to be nearly 100 topic
areas such as appetizers, breads, salads and so on. You can select
one of the topic areas and browse through the recipe file.
</P>
<P>
   That's the example of the expected. Any food site worth its salt
(and red pepper) offers recipes. And that's probably the most
helpful feature. But let's also use this site to see how the best
pages take an extra step toward making cooking easier and more fun.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like some beginning cooks, you may have heard someone
praise a specific ingredient or cooking utensil but need more
information. That's what you'll get at the Epicurious site, an
online dictionary that uses the computer's ability to search and
organize and the Web's knack for transmitting databases full of
information. If you want to know more about balsamic vinegar, for
instance, or even how to pronounce it, just click on the ``b'' in
the dictionary and you'll soon know the pronunciation. If you want
to know more, just use the hot link in the pronunciation guide to
visit an area where you'll learn more about vinegar than you ever
expected to know.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know what to look for in a cooking site, you'll
appreciate the virtues of our next stop: The Culinary Connection at
http://www.culinary
</P>
<P>
   .com/index.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   This site does a fine job with the expected recipe file (more
than 13,000 of them) and has added features that give it a unique
touch. If you're in the mood for live chat about food, you'll find
chat groups here. Or if you want to browse the thousands of Web
sites that feature food, then take a look at the links page. This
isn't the usual collection of names and links. Instead, the links
are rated by other users, so you'll be able to browse sites that
others have found useful.
</P>
<P>
   Those are two terrific general purpose sites. And, with the
collection of links on the second site, you have a way to find even
more. With all that done, let's take a look at a more exotic site
based at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   It's called The Global Gastronomer _ Cuisines of the World at
http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes
</P>
<P>
   /hupfer/global/gastronomer
</P>
<P>
   .html. If you have a special dinner party coming up and want to
prepare something out of the ordinary, you'll get some help in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the page is made up of links that take you to sites
dedicated to cuisine in specific countries. If the notion of
preparing that sort of a menu tickles your interest in a particular
part of the world, you can click on the country on an interactive
map and be taken to databases of information that cover more than
food.
</P>
<P>
   So when you serve the dish, you can also serve up some
information about its country of origin.

 &HT;    Gathering rallies Apple faithful
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What a difference a year makes. At last January's
annual MacWorld convention in San Francisco, Apple Computer was
losing tens of millions of dollars and its share of the market had
fallen to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year's convention, which ended Wednesday, came as Apple
Computer doubled its market share to 10 percent and had the No.
1-selling computer in the United States. And Apple posted its first
annual profit since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the first MacWorld conference that nobody thinks
will be the last MacWorld conference,'' computer industry
journalist David Pogue said as he greeted conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple Computer has had a great year, the company remains
challenged. For one, its $309 million in earnings last year came
mostly from cost cutting and not higher sales. Annual revenues in
fiscal 1997 were $6 billion, down sharply from the company's peak
of $11 billion in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Falling revenue represents both lower prices and fewer sales,
which declined to 2.763 million in 1998. That's down from 2.874
million in 1997 and far below the company's 5 million peak in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe Apple Computer can survive only as a
niche player. Others think the company needs a white knight, such
as Disney or Oracle, to prosper long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macs will never make up more than 10 percent of all desktop
machines,'' consultant Tim Bajarin told MacWorld conventioneers.
``Whether we like it or not, the desktop war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week was a banner one for the Apple Computer optimists.
Consider the good news.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's iMac is the No. 1-selling computer, with 800,000-plus
units purchased since its August introduction.
</P>
<P>
   That success is luring both hardware and software developers
back to the Mac platform. Attendance at MacWorld was up 15 percent
to 420 exhibitors this year over last, according to the
convention's figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of Apple's sheer survival has died down,'' Rob
Scheschareg, MacWorld's director, told the San Jose Mercury News.
``Now the question seems to be, `What's next?' There's a lot of
enthusiasm for innovation.''

 &HT;    First auto designated a 2000 likely to be a Neon
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first automobile to carry the year 2000 on its
registration papers is likely to be the redesigned Dodge/Plymouth
Neon.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers have announced 2000-model-year products, but
with the first 2000 Neons being shipped to retailers this month,
the DaimlerChrysler-built compact should go down in the record
books as the first 2000 to take to the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived in '94 to target the Generation X market segment, Neon
now claims to be ``grown up but not old.''
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of $12,890, Neon boasts about its roominess,
affordability, fun and refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Neon has included as standard those options most frequently
ordered in the past. ``D'' package buyers will get AM/FM/cassette
with six speakers, four cup holders, a 60/40 fold-down split rear
seat, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, visor vanity mirror,
floor mats and a trunk light.
</P>
<P>
   For an additional $1,760, ``G'' package purchasers get remote
keyless entry, theft alarm, tilt steering, cruise control, power
windows and door locks, and air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, traction control and alloy
wheels are also offered.
</P>
<P>
   Cab-forward design
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Neon shares the cab-forward design pioneered by
Chrysler. A new rear-end and taillamp treatment along with more
prominent wheel arches add to a more substantial appearance.
Finally, the Neon gets full-framed doors that increase body
stiffness, improve window fit and reduce wind noise.
</P>
<P>
   On the performance side, Neon has a 132-horsepower 2.0-liter
engine. A manual gearbox remains standard with an automatic
optional.
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the new ``refined'' exterior, taupe has been added
as an interior color choice, but gone are the lizard greens, chrome
yellows and periwinkle purple exterior colors of the original Neon.
Exterior colors include metallic silvers, garnet and jade.

 &HT;    E-mail gone wrong: Think before you send your electronic note
 &HT;    By Paige Braddock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ E-mail has become a mainstay of both business and
personal communication.
</P>
<P>
   People think of it as something that appears and disappears in
an on-screen mailbox at the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail leaves a trail that is very traceable, printable and
anything but private. Real-life e-mail disasters can happen to
anyone who doesn't pay close attention to the possible technical
and emotional glitches only e-mail can offer.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example of how easily an e-mail exchange can go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy sent an e-mail to her friend Jennifer detailing plans to
break up with her boyfriend, Jeff, and why. She was sure she wanted
the breakup but had decided to get through the holidays and do the
deed after New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy and Jennifer sent several responses via that original
e-mail, eventually moving on to other, less-personal topics, one of
which was a bike race. As the plans to participate in the bike race
shaped up, Cindy sent a copy of the exchange to Jeff, so he would
know what the plans were for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff got the e-mail just as he was rushing off to a meeting, so
he printed the whole message out to read later. All previous
discussion between Cindy and Jennifer about the impending breakup
printed, along with the recent details of the bike race.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy got to spend the holidays alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Cindy accomplished her goal to break up with Jeff,
just not in the way she had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good situation to work from as an example of what not
to do when corresponding via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   One rule of thumb that will help keep you out of trouble is
never simply hit ``reply.'' Start a new message each time, so only
the most recent portion of the conversation will remain attached to
the original message, especially if you plan to forward a private
exchange to a public audience.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before you hit ``send,'' ask yourself how you'd feel if
this message were printed or forwarded to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you are sending a message to someone you trust, the
technological nature of e-mail is that once it's out there, it's
out there,'' said Abbie Lundberg, editor in chief of CIO Magazine,
a publication for business and information technology executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also good to ask yourself if e-mail is the best medium
for this message,'' said Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lundberg, people who are new to e-mail sometimes
don't see the consequences that communicating electronically can
have on the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail does not convey emotion well,'' said Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
   A message not intended to convey anger, for example, may trigger
an emotional response that was not intended.
</P>
<P>
   Since you aren't present when the message is received, you have
no control over how it will be interpreted, added Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how careful you are, there is no guarantee a good
e-mail won't go bad. An e-mail addressed incorrectly will bounce
back to you, but at the same time, a carbon copy of that e-mail is
sent to the mail administrator of your service provider.
</P>
<P>
   All incoming mail, misaddressed or otherwise, sits in a folder
waiting to be retrieved by the appropriate user.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and the person getting the e-mail are only two of about
four or five other individuals who could see that e-mail,'' said
Jason Schafer, a Web developer and Internet consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Before venturing on his own, Schafer was a Web server
administrator for an Internet service provider on the East Coast.
He got to see the good and bad of e-mail delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean to read people's mail, but as the administrator,
misdirected mail bounced to me, and sometimes you can't help but
notice certain words. Like if a message has your name in it, for
example,'' said Schafer. ``Or if someone is sending threatening
e-mails to someone on your server.''
</P>
<P>
   Another word of caution is that if you send personal messages
through your company's e-mail system, you might consider getting a
free Internet account.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schafer, most companies have a policy that any
e-mail passing through their system is company property.
</P>
<P>
   The nuances of digital communication not only complicate the way
we communicate, e-mail has increased the pace with which we
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Pace is always increased by technological advances in
communication, and the ability to send e-mail from home and remote
locations has increased the speed of decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that when people were out of town, especially in
a business situation, certain decisions would wait until they got
back to the office,'' said Lundgren, whose online magazine features
resources to help users deal with the challenges of communication
via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quick decision-making is both positive and negative. It can be
negative, because we lose the time for a second thought. We lose
the opportunity to reconsider,'' said Lundgren.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to e-mail, it's always safer to think before you
``send.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the only way to be absolutely sure your
sweet nothings, friendly ramblings or business decisions remain
private is by sending them the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   Mail them at the post office.
</P>
<P>
   REAL-LIFE STORIES
</P>
<P>
   E-mail can bridge distances, emotional and geographical, to keep
people together. It can also be a powerful tool for tearing them
apart. Take these real-life scenarios, for example, in which the
names have been changed to protect the innocent (and the guilty).
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Margaret had been married for 10 years. Before they tied
the knot, Bob worked with the Peace Corps for two years in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bob spent Christmas in Romania. Before he left, he
sent a love letter, via e-mail, to a woman he'd seen while working
in the Peace Corps. Unbeknownst to Bob, the e-mail bounced back to
his home address after his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret logged on to check e-mail and found the love letter,
written by Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret called her attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is a graduate student at a university in Georgia. He sent an
e-mail, of a playful romantic nature, to Kate in Illinois ... or so
he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Using a campus computer, and in a rush to get to class, Sam
accidentally selected his adviser's e-mail address, located just
above Kate's in his address book. Sam nearly got kicked out of
school for sexual harassment before the mishap got straightened
out.
</P>
<P>
   Jim, a postmaster of an e-mail server, receives all messages
that are misaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   Chris sent erotic notes to Susan, addressed to her at both work
and cc'd to her home address, which was typed incorrectly. Jim
thought that after the first couple of auto-replies from his server
about misdirected mail Chris would get the hint and check the
errant address.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of cyber love letters, Jim sent a note to them
both asking them to verify their addresses, ``so that their sweet
nothings could remain between the two of them.'' Chris and Susan
both wrote e-mails back to Jim blasting him for ``hacking'' into
their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Jim had tried to do them the courtesy of pointing out their
error. But after receiving the angry e-mails, Jim printed out all
their correspondence and faxed it to the network guru of their
companies.
</P>
<P>
   George hated his boss.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the tension between them had gotten so bad
that George found himself using e-mail to vent to friends about
work.
</P>
<P>
   One day after losing an argument with his boss, George sat down
to e-mail his buddy Frank. He dashed off an angry message, calling
his boss every name in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, because his boss was in the forefront of his
mind, he sent the message to his boss, instead of Frank.
</P>
<P>
   George now has a new boss.

   ATLANTA _ Remember the ``Brady Bunch'' episode when Bobby and
Cindy got lost in the Grand Canyon on a family vacation and had to
eat baked beans out of a flashlight with an Indian boy?
</P>
<P>
   A National Park Digital Guide could have saved them the hassle.
Maptech, a New Hampshire and Massachusetts-based company, sells the
guides on CD-ROM for $29.50. Regional CD-ROMs, which come in sets
of two discs and have maps for eight to 13 parks, sell for $69.50.
The complete set of 54 parks is $179.50.
</P>
<P>
   The discs include topographic maps, which show elevation, and
information about park wildlife and history. The maps are
printable.
</P>
<P>
   Latitude, longitude and elevation are shown on the screen
automatically as you move your cursor. The interface is similar to
Microsoft Windows and works on a PC. You use a mouse or trackball
to draw your path on the on-screen map. Your charted course can be
printed, measured for distance, and viewed by elevation and
profile.
</P>
<P>
   The program requires Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows NT; a 486
CPU or higher; 2X CD-ROM; 8 megabytes of RAM; and a mouse or a
drawing equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   The map CD-ROMs, a 1998 winner of Popular Science's Best of

   An Atlanta-area software company is helping an international
effort to save the Sumatran tigers in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Sumatran Tiger Project are using satellite
image maps created with ERDAS IMAGINE geographic-imaging software.
Project members use the images to help field research teams map
Sumatran tiger habitats and identify threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Sumatran Tiger Project was started in 1995 by the Indonesian
Ministry of Forestry, the World Conservation Union, the Minnesota
Zoo and Taman Safari Indonesia to gather information on Sumatran
tiger ecology, population and threats. Members are developing
geographic imaging software that will let researchers analyze the
data collected during three years of field studies and use it to
develop conservation plans.

 &HT;    Novice PC buyers should stick to familiar names
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My grandfather had some ironclad rules for buying a
car. It needed a high clearance so that _ when he crossed at the
fording spot on the Caddo River near Arkadelphia _ it wouldn't
scrape on the rocks. The spark advance control needed to be
accessible from the outside so that, when he cranked the engine
himself, he could adjust the spark.
</P>
<P>
   They were excellent rules and served him well. But I doubt
they'll help you much when you buy your next family car. It's much
the same with advice on buying PCs. I write about it often, and
that's because the advice has to change with the times. So let's
spend today assembling a list of what you should look for if that
hoped-for PC didn't arrive as a holiday gift and now you're in the
mood to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an up-to-date list for what to look for when buying a PC.
This advice is aimed at the novice, by the way. My suggestions on
where to buy and what to buy would be different for an advanced
user. I'm figuring advanced PC users don't need this help and could
probably give me advice.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you're going to notice when you go shopping is
prices vary wildly nowadays. You can still pay $2,000 and more for
top-of-the-line, name-brand computers and $400 or less for a PC
from one of the many storefront operations you'll find. The
frustrating fact is some of these storefront PC shops do an
excellent job, putting together a PC with quality components. Some
are as good as the high-priced models. But if you don't know a
motherboard from a surfboard, it's next to impossible to weed out
the bad.
</P>
<P>
   So, until you learn more about computers, search one out with a
brand name you've heard of and buy the PC from a store that has
been around for two or three years. Since some small shops come and
go more frequently than the postman, you'll want to buy from a
place that has a track record. That way, odds are the store will
still be in business if you have problems later on.
</P>
<P>
   Think of buying a PC in the same way my one rich friend selects
a wine in a restaurant. He avoids the highest-priced bottles
because they're often put on the list just for flash, to make an
impression. He also stays away from the cheapest wines because,
often, their total virtue is the fact they are cheap. So think
twice before buying that $325 PC, complete with monitor. Use the
same shopping skills that would come into play if you found a
Toyota that sold for $800. You need to at least wonder why it's
selling for so little money.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you'll notice is Intel isn't the only brand
anymore when it comes to processor chips. The processor is the chip
that does the actual computing work. In the old days, Intel was the
only sensible choice. But now _ based on which reviews you read _
some of the competing chips test out impressively. Power users
eventually develop their own prejudices as to which chip to buy.
But, in your case, I recommend you stick with the Intel chip. It's
still the target for the other chips, which attempt to emulate its
inner workings. Later, you may change your mind, but I promise you
won't feel foolish for buying Intel right now.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, make sure you get enough RAM memory when you buy your
computer. Since you're new at this, you'll feel uncomfortable _ in
the first few months _ even with the simple job of installing RAM.
And if you discover you didn't buy enough, you may end up paying
someone to install it for you. Get at least 64 megabytes of RAM
and, if you can afford it, double that amount. That's another thing
that has changed over the past couple of years. Windows now does a
much better job of turning added memory into faster performance. So
that added RAM can help supercharge your machine.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, since this topic deserves more discussion, we'll talk
about some some specific questions to ask at the computer store.
Some of these questions are very low tech and could end up saving
you a lot of grief and money.

 &HT;    Norton utilities package goes a bit overboard
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After many a fanfare and rolling of the drums, the
computing public finally has Norton SystemWorks, a new package
apparently created because the venerable purveyor of utilities
succumbed to the siren call of introducing a product with a capital
letter in the middle of the name.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Norton Utilities, which have been recovering trashed
and damaged files for about as long as computers have been trashing
them, are here. Thrown in for good measure are a bunch of other
excellent utilities, such as Norton's AntiVirus, CleanSweep and
CrashGuard.
</P>
<P>
   If you install the entire program, you will have what amounts to
a silicon Chicken Little. You will be bombarded by colorful pop-up
messages warning you that WinDoctor has found errors in your
system. Rescue Disk will complain regularly that it needs to be
updated. LiveUpdate will pester you with urgent messages about
checking the Norton Web site for upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro, my Internet mail program, never gives me any
trouble. But the first time I shut it down after installing
SystemWorks, CrashGuard leaped onto the screen, beating its hairy
chest and announcing it had saved me from disaster _ Eudora had
experienced 26 _ count 'em, 26 _ errors and was about to seize up.
</P>
<P>
   When I rebooted the computer for the first time after the
installation session, a Norton program came on and announced the
system hadn't been shut down correctly _ it had _ ran its own
version of Scandisk and found something on the order of 1,000
errors, most of which it corrected in less time than it takes to
tell you about it.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow this puts me in mind of those parking lot vampires who
disable your car when you aren't looking, then run up and
graciously offer to get you going again when it won't start.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I would never want to be without the Norton Utilities.
These are the best tools there are for recovering from accidental
or mistaken file and disk erasures and hard disk crashes. On the
other hand, I am not a computer hypochondriac; I don't want half a
dozen out-of-work neurologists, psychiatrists and proctologists up
to their elbows in my computer all day long, clucking and gasping
over the slightest blemish. Fortunately, there are ways of cutting
down on the communications.
</P>
<P>
   There is one problem in my system WinDoctor cannot, apparently,
solve _ a missing file needed by a Norton program already installed
on my computer. Evidently I'm going to have to uninstall this
program just to get Windoctor off my back about it.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting new part of Rescue Disk offers to create a more
elaborate and effective rescue setup on a 100-meg Zip disk if you
have an Iomega Zip drive. There's a second CD-ROM with the program
that throws in virtually everything else Norton publishes,
including Visual Page, a Web page creator; a basic edition of
WinFax; Norton's Mobile Essentials for laptop users; a utility
intended to bring you into the Year 2000 without disaster; and
something called ``Norton Secret Stuff.'' Hey, I can keep a secret.
</P>
<P>
   But just one suggestion. Why give up a title that stands forever
in anyone's top 10 software programs? If Peter Norton absolutely
had to give it a name with a capital letter in the middle, then why
not just plain NortonUtilities?

 &HT;    Cold weather batters battery's health
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One victim of cold weather car killers is the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Has this ever happened to you? You go out to start your car in
the morning, after a subfreezing night, and hear either a sluggish
``grrrrr,'' a ``click click'' or nothing at all. What in the world
happened? Yesterday morning (a warmer day), the car started fine.
Now, without warning, the engine won't even attempt to turn over.
</P>
<P>
   Car batteries don't like cold weather. Batteries want to live in
temperatures around 80 degrees (don't we all?). At 80 degrees, a
fully charged battery will deliver 100 percent of its energy to
whatever electrical devices the car uses, including the starter. As
the temperature drops, so does the efficiency of the battery. In
fact, at 32 degrees, the battery is only about 80 percent
efficient. At zero degrees, available energy nose dives to around
50 percent. While even a partially charged battery may have enough
energy to start a car at 80 degrees, that same battery will fall
flat on its face when the temperature drops below freezing.
</P>
<P>
   The same cold conditions that cause the battery to become weaker
increase the engine's initial need for more electrical power. After
sitting overnight, the engine oil has a tendency to thicken. This
makes the engine harder for the starter to ``turn over.'' The
starter will try its hardest to accomplish the task, which means
using more electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a vicious circle.
</P>
<P>
   The starter demands more electricity from a battery incapable of
delivering it. Consequently, ``click click.'' When you stop and
think about it, many of us drive around with partially charged
batteries, especially during the winter. If we drive short
distances with the accessories on (lights, wipers, defroster,
radio, etc.), we never give the battery a chance to fully recharge.
It actually takes about 20 minutes of continuous driving at around
2000 engine rpms to feed back to the battery the electricity used
for cranking.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of our commute time is spent idling at low engine
rpm, complete recharge is often never achieved. Of course, short
trips consisting of repeatedly starting the engine, driving a few
miles and shutting it off several times dig the fastest grave for
our little 12-volt friend.
</P>
<P>
   Short of overhauling your lifestyle, what can you do about it?
Make sure your battery is clean and the battery cables are clean
and tight (no green stuff growing on them). This ensures a clear
path for the electricity's travel. Take a long trip occasionally,
or at least make sure the engine is allowed to run continuously
about once a week for 20 minutes or so. (If you do this in the
driveway, don't turn on any accessories.)
</P>
<P>
   You might want to invest in a small, inexpensive battery charger
(2 to 5 amps). Hook it up to the battery overnight about once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   On nights it is going to be really cold, put your car to bed
with an old blanket thrown over the hood. Do this shortly after
you've shut the engine off. This will help keep some of the engine
heat under the hood and some of the cold out, which may help the
starting process in the morning. Most importantly, have your
battery checked and serviced as part of your annual winter
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems and marginal batteries can be caught and
attended to before they leave you stranded.

 &HT;    Recipe sites a tool for every cook
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Food and computers have always made a strange mix. The
earliest programmers and Net wizards seemed to live on Coca-Cola
and cold pizza. But your computer and the Internet can help you
with meals a touch more elaborate than that.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll look at some Web sites that do the expected (provide
terrific recipes) and the unexpected (offer little touches that
make good use of the unique advantages offered by a computer and an
Internet connection).
</P>
<P>
   Our first food site will furnish good examples of what we mean
on both counts. Let's go to Epicurious: Food, Drink, Cooking and
Recipes at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .epicurious.com/ahome
</P>
<P>
   /a00home/home.html to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lavish and well-designed site. It offers a treasure
trove of recipes. Click on the recipe link at the bottom of the
page and you'll be able to ferret out even the most obscure recipe
using keywords. But there are times when you don't know what you'd
like to prepare for dessert, or, if you do know, you can't remember
the name of the dish.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the second method of searching the recipe file will
come in handy. It's divided into what seems to be nearly 100 topic
areas such as appetizers, breads, salads and so on. You can select
one of the topic areas and browse through the recipe file.
</P>
<P>
   That's the example of the expected. Any food site worth its salt
(and red pepper) offers recipes. And that's probably the most
helpful feature. But let's also use this site to see how the best
pages take an extra step toward making cooking easier and more fun.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like some beginning cooks, you may have heard someone
praise a specific ingredient or cooking utensil but need more
information. That's what you'll get at the Epicurious site, an
online dictionary that uses the computer's ability to search and
organize and the Web's knack for transmitting databases full of
information. If you want to know more about balsamic vinegar, for
instance, or even how to pronounce it, just click on the ``b'' in
the dictionary and you'll soon know the pronunciation. If you want
to know more, just use the hot link in the pronunciation guide to
visit an area where you'll learn more about vinegar than you ever
expected to know.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know what to look for in a cooking site, you'll
appreciate the virtues of our next stop: The Culinary Connection at
http://www.culinary
</P>
<P>
   .com/index.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   This site does a fine job with the expected recipe file (more
than 13,000 of them) and has added features that give it a unique
touch. If you're in the mood for live chat about food, you'll find
chat groups here. Or if you want to browse the thousands of Web
sites that feature food, then take a look at the links page. This
isn't the usual collection of names and links. Instead, the links
are rated by other users, so you'll be able to browse sites that
others have found useful.
</P>
<P>
   Those are two terrific general purpose sites. And, with the
collection of links on the second site, you have a way to find even
more. With all that done, let's take a look at a more exotic site
based at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   It's called The Global Gastronomer _ Cuisines of the World at
http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes
</P>
<P>
   /hupfer/global/gastronomer
</P>
<P>
   .html. If you have a special dinner party coming up and want to
prepare something out of the ordinary, you'll get some help in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the page is made up of links that take you to sites
dedicated to cuisine in specific countries. If the notion of
preparing that sort of a menu tickles your interest in a particular
part of the world, you can click on the country on an interactive
map and be taken to databases of information that cover more than
food.
</P>
<P>
   So when you serve the dish, you can also serve up some
information about its country of origin.

 &HT;    Gathering rallies Apple faithful
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What a difference a year makes. At last January's
annual MacWorld convention in San Francisco, Apple Computer was
losing tens of millions of dollars and its share of the market had
fallen to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This year's convention, which ended Wednesday, came as Apple
Computer doubled its market share to 10 percent and had the No.
1-selling computer in the United States. And Apple posted its first
annual profit since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the first MacWorld conference that nobody thinks
will be the last MacWorld conference,'' computer industry
journalist David Pogue said as he greeted conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple Computer has had a great year, the company remains
challenged. For one, its $309 million in earnings last year came
mostly from cost cutting and not higher sales. Annual revenues in
fiscal 1997 were $6 billion, down sharply from the company's peak
of $11 billion in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Falling revenue represents both lower prices and fewer sales,
which declined to 2.763 million in 1998. That's down from 2.874
million in 1997 and far below the company's 5 million peak in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe Apple Computer can survive only as a
niche player. Others think the company needs a white knight, such
as Disney or Oracle, to prosper long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macs will never make up more than 10 percent of all desktop
machines,'' consultant Tim Bajarin told MacWorld conventioneers.
``Whether we like it or not, the desktop war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week was a banner one for the Apple Computer optimists.
Consider the good news.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's iMac is the No. 1-selling computer, with 800,000-plus
units purchased since its August introduction.
</P>
<P>
   That success is luring both hardware and software developers
back to the Mac platform. Attendance at MacWorld was up 15 percent
to 420 exhibitors this year over last, according to the
convention's figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of Apple's sheer survival has died down,'' Rob
Scheschareg, MacWorld's director, told the San Jose Mercury News.
``Now the question seems to be, `What's next?' There's a lot of
enthusiasm for innovation.''

 &HT;    First auto designated a 2000 likely to be a Neon
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first automobile to carry the year 2000 on its
registration papers is likely to be the redesigned Dodge/Plymouth
Neon.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers have announced 2000-model-year products, but
with the first 2000 Neons being shipped to retailers this month,
the DaimlerChrysler-built compact should go down in the record
books as the first 2000 to take to the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived in '94 to target the Generation X market segment, Neon
now claims to be ``grown up but not old.''
</P>
<P>
   With a base price of $12,890, Neon boasts about its roominess,
affordability, fun and refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Neon has included as standard those options most frequently
ordered in the past. ``D'' package buyers will get AM/FM/cassette
with six speakers, four cup holders, a 60/40 fold-down split rear
seat, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, visor vanity mirror,
floor mats and a trunk light.
</P>
<P>
   For an additional $1,760, ``G'' package purchasers get remote
keyless entry, theft alarm, tilt steering, cruise control, power
windows and door locks, and air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, traction control and alloy
wheels are also offered.
</P>
<P>
   Cab-forward design
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Neon shares the cab-forward design pioneered by
Chrysler. A new rear-end and taillamp treatment along with more
prominent wheel arches add to a more substantial appearance.
Finally, the Neon gets full-framed doors that increase body
stiffness, improve window fit and reduce wind noise.
</P>
<P>
   On the performance side, Neon has a 132-horsepower 2.0-liter
engine. A manual gearbox remains standard with an automatic
optional.
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the new ``refined'' exterior, taupe has been added
as an interior color choice, but gone are the lizard greens, chrome
yellows and periwinkle purple exterior colors of the original Neon.
Exterior colors include metallic silvers, garnet and jade.

 &HT;    E-mail gone wrong: Think before you send your electronic note
 &HT;    By Paige Braddock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ E-mail has become a mainstay of both business and
personal communication.
</P>
<P>
   People think of it as something that appears and disappears in
an on-screen mailbox at the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail leaves a trail that is very traceable, printable and
anything but private. Real-life e-mail disasters can happen to
anyone who doesn't pay close attention to the possible technical
and emotional glitches only e-mail can offer.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example of how easily an e-mail exchange can go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy sent an e-mail to her friend Jennifer detailing plans to
break up with her boyfriend, Jeff, and why. She was sure she wanted
the breakup but had decided to get through the holidays and do the
deed after New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy and Jennifer sent several responses via that original
e-mail, eventually moving on to other, less-personal topics, one of
which was a bike race. As the plans to participate in the bike race
shaped up, Cindy sent a copy of the exchange to Jeff, so he would
know what the plans were for the race.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff got the e-mail just as he was rushing off to a meeting, so
he printed the whole message out to read later. All previous
discussion between Cindy and Jennifer about the impending breakup
printed, along with the recent details of the bike race.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy got to spend the holidays alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Cindy accomplished her goal to break up with Jeff,
just not in the way she had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good situation to work from as an example of what not
to do when corresponding via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   One rule of thumb that will help keep you out of trouble is
never simply hit ``reply.'' Start a new message each time, so only
the most recent portion of the conversation will remain attached to
the original message, especially if you plan to forward a private
exchange to a public audience.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before you hit ``send,'' ask yourself how you'd feel if
this message were printed or forwarded to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you are sending a message to someone you trust, the
technological nature of e-mail is that once it's out there, it's
out there,'' said Abbie Lundberg, editor in chief of CIO Magazine,
a publication for business and information technology executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also good to ask yourself if e-mail is the best medium
for this message,'' said Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lundberg, people who are new to e-mail sometimes
don't see the consequences that communicating electronically can
have on the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail does not convey emotion well,'' said Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
   A message not intended to convey anger, for example, may trigger
an emotional response that was not intended.
</P>
<P>
   Since you aren't present when the message is received, you have
no control over how it will be interpreted, added Lundberg.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how careful you are, there is no guarantee a good
e-mail won't go bad. An e-mail addressed incorrectly will bounce
back to you, but at the same time, a carbon copy of that e-mail is
sent to the mail administrator of your service provider.
</P>
<P>
   All incoming mail, misaddressed or otherwise, sits in a folder
waiting to be retrieved by the appropriate user.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and the person getting the e-mail are only two of about
four or five other individuals who could see that e-mail,'' said
Jason Schafer, a Web developer and Internet consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Before venturing on his own, Schafer was a Web server
administrator for an Internet service provider on the East Coast.
He got to see the good and bad of e-mail delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean to read people's mail, but as the administrator,
misdirected mail bounced to me, and sometimes you can't help but
notice certain words. Like if a message has your name in it, for
example,'' said Schafer. ``Or if someone is sending threatening
e-mails to someone on your server.''
</P>
<P>
   Another word of caution is that if you send personal messages
through your company's e-mail system, you might consider getting a
free Internet account.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schafer, most companies have a policy that any
e-mail passing through their system is company property.
</P>
<P>
   The nuances of digital communication not only complicate the way
we communicate, e-mail has increased the pace with which we
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Pace is always increased by technological advances in
communication, and the ability to send e-mail from home and remote
locations has increased the speed of decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that when people were out of town, especially in
a business situation, certain decisions would wait until they got
back to the office,'' said Lundgren, whose online magazine features
resources to help users deal with the challenges of communication
via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quick decision-making is both positive and negative. It can be
negative, because we lose the time for a second thought. We lose
the opportunity to reconsider,'' said Lundgren.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to e-mail, it's always safer to think before you
``send.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the only way to be absolutely sure your
sweet nothings, friendly ramblings or business decisions remain
private is by sending them the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   Mail them at the post office.
</P>
<P>
   REAL-LIFE STORIES
</P>
<P>
   E-mail can bridge distances, emotional and geographical, to keep
people together. It can also be a powerful tool for tearing them
apart. Take these real-life scenarios, for example, in which the
names have been changed to protect the innocent (and the guilty).
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Margaret had been married for 10 years. Before they tied
the knot, Bob worked with the Peace Corps for two years in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bob spent Christmas in Romania. Before he left, he
sent a love letter, via e-mail, to a woman he'd seen while working
in the Peace Corps. Unbeknownst to Bob, the e-mail bounced back to
his home address after his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret logged on to check e-mail and found the love letter,
written by Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret called her attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is a graduate student at a university in Georgia. He sent an
e-mail, of a playful romantic nature, to Kate in Illinois ... or so
he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Using a campus computer, and in a rush to get to class, Sam
accidentally selected his adviser's e-mail address, located just
above Kate's in his address book. Sam nearly got kicked out of
school for sexual harassment before the mishap got straightened
out.
</P>
<P>
   Jim, a postmaster of an e-mail server, receives all messages
that are misaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   Chris sent erotic notes to Susan, addressed to her at both work
and cc'd to her home address, which was typed incorrectly. Jim
thought that after the first couple of auto-replies from his server
about misdirected mail Chris would get the hint and check the
errant address.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of cyber love letters, Jim sent a note to them
both asking them to verify their addresses, ``so that their sweet
nothings could remain between the two of them.'' Chris and Susan
both wrote e-mails back to Jim blasting him for ``hacking'' into
their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Jim had tried to do them the courtesy of pointing out their
error. But after receiving the angry e-mails, Jim printed out all
their correspondence and faxed it to the network guru of their
companies.
</P>
<P>
   George hated his boss.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, the tension between them had gotten so bad
that George found himself using e-mail to vent to friends about
work.
</P>
<P>
   One day after losing an argument with his boss, George sat down
to e-mail his buddy Frank. He dashed off an angry message, calling
his boss every name in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, because his boss was in the forefront of his
mind, he sent the message to his boss, instead of Frank.
</P>
<P>
   George now has a new boss.

 &HT;    CDs detail every inch of national parks
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember the ``Brady Bunch'' episode when Bobby and
Cindy got lost in the Grand Canyon on a family vacation and had to
eat baked beans out of a flashlight with an Indian boy?
</P>
<P>
   A National Park Digital Guide could have saved them the hassle.
Maptech, a New Hampshire and Massachusetts-based company, sells the
guides on CD-ROM for $29.50. Regional CD-ROMs, which come in sets
of two discs and have maps for eight to 13 parks, sell for $69.50.
The complete set of 54 parks is $179.50.
</P>
<P>
   The discs include topographic maps, which show elevation, and
information about park wildlife and history. The maps are
printable.
</P>
<P>
   Latitude, longitude and elevation are shown on the screen
automatically as you move your cursor. The interface is similar to
Microsoft Windows and works on a PC. You use a mouse or trackball
to draw your path on the on-screen map. Your charted course can be
printed, measured for distance, and viewed by elevation and
profile.
</P>
<P>
   The program requires Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows NT; a 486
CPU or higher; 2X CD-ROM; 8 megabytes of RAM; and a mouse or a
drawing equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   The map CD-ROMs, a 1998 winner of Popular Science's Best of
What's New award, are available at http://www.maptech.com or
1-800-627-7236.

   Cereal killing
</P>
<P>
   The good folks at Cheerios are looking for four kids, ages
several months to 10 years, to be featured on a parenting advice
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The site, Growing Up With Cheerios, will offer child development
advice. The site also will include biographies of the four kids,
weekly progress reports and monthly articles written by child
development experts.
</P>
<P>
   Each kid chosen will get a $2,500 savings bond for his or her
college education and a year's supply of Cheerios, a popular
oat-based cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The kid search will be conducted online at the Cheerios site,
</P>
<P>
   http://www.cheerios.com. The site has information about the
Cheerios Kids program, a printable application form and
instructions for entering the search. Applications are due March 1.
The Growing Up With Cheerios site is to be launched in June.

   Save the tiger
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta-area software company is helping an international
effort to save the Sumatran tigers in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Sumatran Tiger Project are using satellite
image maps created with ERDAS IMAGINE geographic-imaging software.
Project members use the images to help field research teams map
Sumatran tiger habitats and identify threats.
</P>
<P>
   The Sumatran Tiger Project was started in 1995 by the Indonesian
Ministry of Forestry, the World Conservation Union, the Minnesota
Zoo and Taman Safari Indonesia to gather information on Sumatran
tiger ecology, population and threats. Members are developing
geographic imaging software that will let researchers analyze the
data collected during three years of field studies and use it to
develop conservation plans.
</P>
<P>
   ERDAS, a mapping software company, started helping with the
project in 1997. The company develops customizable software that is
used in more than 20,000 projects in 105 countries. The software is
used for oil, gas and mineral exploration; natural resources
management; urban and regional planning; environmental monitoring;
forestry; academia; engineering; telecommunications; utilities; and
map-making.

   Online people watching
</P>
<P>
   If you're like the old man who sits on the bench outside the
Hallmark shop people-watching, but you don't have time to hit the
mall, there's a Web site that still might quench that thirst.
</P>
<P>
   Look at http://www.metaspy.com/spy/warningtop.html or, for those
who don't really want a peek into the unfiltered mind of the
average Web surfer, try the Disney version,
http://www.metaspy.com/spy/filtered.html.
</P>
<P>
   Both sites offer an online chance to people-watch, to see what
folks look for when they are on the Web, as viewed through
MetaCrawler's search engine.
</P>
<P>
   A list of random searches is updated every 15 seconds. A recent
slice of online randomness included searches for ``Hefty trash
bags,'' ``IRS forms,'' ``model railroad layouts,'' ``Alan Jackson
calendar,'' ``Teletubbies'' and ``Westchester schools Web sites.''

 &HT;    Novice PC buyers should stick to familiar names
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My grandfather had some ironclad rules for buying a
car. It needed a high clearance so that _ when he crossed at the
fording spot on the Caddo River near Arkadelphia _ it wouldn't
scrape on the rocks. The spark advance control needed to be
accessible from the outside so that, when he cranked the engine
himself, he could adjust the spark.
</P>
<P>
   They were excellent rules and served him well. But I doubt
they'll help you much when you buy your next family car. It's much
the same with advice on buying PCs. I write about it often, and
that's because the advice has to change with the times. So let's
spend today assembling a list of what you should look for if that
hoped-for PC didn't arrive as a holiday gift and now you're in the
mood to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an up-to-date list for what to look for when buying a PC.
This advice is aimed at the novice, by the way. My suggestions on
where to buy and what to buy would be different for an advanced
user. I'm figuring advanced PC users don't need this help and could
probably give me advice.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you're going to notice when you go shopping is
prices vary wildly nowadays. You can still pay $2,000 and more for
top-of-the-line, name-brand computers and $400 or less for a PC
from one of the many storefront operations you'll find. The
frustrating fact is some of these storefront PC shops do an
excellent job, putting together a PC with quality components. Some
are as good as the high-priced models. But if you don't know a
motherboard from a surfboard, it's next to impossible to weed out
the bad.
</P>
<P>
   So, until you learn more about computers, search one out with a
brand name you've heard of and buy the PC from a store that has
been around for two or three years. Since some small shops come and
go more frequently than the postman, you'll want to buy from a
place that has a track record. That way, odds are the store will
still be in business if you have problems later on.
</P>
<P>
   Think of buying a PC in the same way my one rich friend selects
a wine in a restaurant. He avoids the highest-priced bottles
because they're often put on the list just for flash, to make an
impression. He also stays away from the cheapest wines because,
often, their total virtue is the fact they are cheap. So think
twice before buying that $325 PC, complete with monitor. Use the
same shopping skills that would come into play if you found a
Toyota that sold for $800. You need to at least wonder why it's
selling for so little money.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you'll notice is Intel isn't the only brand
anymore when it comes to processor chips. The processor is the chip
that does the actual computing work. In the old days, Intel was the
only sensible choice. But now _ based on which reviews you read _
some of the competing chips test out impressively. Power users
eventually develop their own prejudices as to which chip to buy.
But, in your case, I recommend you stick with the Intel chip. It's
still the target for the other chips, which attempt to emulate its
inner workings. Later, you may change your mind, but I promise you
won't feel foolish for buying Intel right now.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, make sure you get enough RAM memory when you buy your
computer. Since you're new at this, you'll feel uncomfortable _ in
the first few months _ even with the simple job of installing RAM.
And if you discover you didn't buy enough, you may end up paying
someone to install it for you. Get at least 64 megabytes of RAM
and, if you can afford it, double that amount. That's another thing
that has changed over the past couple of years. Windows now does a
much better job of turning added memory into faster performance. So
that added RAM can help supercharge your machine.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, since this topic deserves more discussion, we'll talk
about some some specific questions to ask at the computer store.
Some of these questions are very low tech and could end up saving
you a lot of grief and money.

 &HT;    Norton utilities package goes a bit overboard
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After many a fanfare and rolling of the drums, the
computing public finally has Norton SystemWorks, a new package
apparently created because the venerable purveyor of utilities
succumbed to the siren call of introducing a product with a capital
letter in the middle of the name.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Norton Utilities, which have been recovering trashed
and damaged files for about as long as computers have been trashing
them, are here. Thrown in for good measure are a bunch of other
excellent utilities, such as Norton's AntiVirus, CleanSweep and
CrashGuard.
</P>
<P>
   If you install the entire program, you will have what amounts to
a silicon Chicken Little. You will be bombarded by colorful pop-up
messages warning you that WinDoctor has found errors in your
system. Rescue Disk will complain regularly that it needs to be
updated. LiveUpdate will pester you with urgent messages about
checking the Norton Web site for upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro, my Internet mail program, never gives me any
trouble. But the first time I shut it down after installing
SystemWorks, CrashGuard leaped onto the screen, beating its hairy
chest and announcing it had saved me from disaster _ Eudora had
experienced 26 _ count 'em, 26 _ errors and was about to seize up.
</P>
<P>
   When I rebooted the computer for the first time after the
installation session, a Norton program came on and announced the
system hadn't been shut down correctly _ it had _ ran its own
version of Scandisk and found something on the order of 1,000
errors, most of which it corrected in less time than it takes to
tell you about it.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow this puts me in mind of those parking lot vampires who
disable your car when you aren't looking, then run up and
graciously offer to get you going again when it won't start.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I would never want to be without the Norton Utilities.
These are the best tools there are for recovering from accidental
or mistaken file and disk erasures and hard disk crashes. On the
other hand, I am not a computer hypochondriac; I don't want half a
dozen out-of-work neurologists, psychiatrists and proctologists up
to their elbows in my computer all day long, clucking and gasping
over the slightest blemish. Fortunately, there are ways of cutting
down on the communications.
</P>
<P>
   There is one problem in my system WinDoctor cannot, apparently,
solve _ a missing file needed by a Norton program already installed
on my computer. Evidently I'm going to have to uninstall this
program just to get Windoctor off my back about it.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting new part of Rescue Disk offers to create a more
elaborate and effective rescue setup on a 100-meg Zip disk if you
have an Iomega Zip drive. There's a second CD-ROM with the program
that throws in virtually everything else Norton publishes,
including Visual Page, a Web page creator; a basic edition of
WinFax; Norton's Mobile Essentials for laptop users; a utility
intended to bring you into the Year 2000 without disaster; and
something called ``Norton Secret Stuff.'' Hey, I can keep a secret.
</P>
<P>
   But just one suggestion. Why give up a title that stands forever
in anyone's top 10 software programs? If Peter Norton absolutely
had to give it a name with a capital letter in the middle, then why
not just plain NortonUtilities?

 &HT;    Cold weather batters battery's health
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One victim of cold weather car killers is the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Has this ever happened to you? You go out to start your car in
the morning, after a subfreezing night, and hear either a sluggish
``grrrrr,'' a ``click click'' or nothing at all. What in the world
happened? Yesterday morning (a warmer day), the car started fine.
Now, without warning, the engine won't even attempt to turn over.
</P>
<P>
   Car batteries don't like cold weather. Batteries want to live in
temperatures around 80 degrees (don't we all?). At 80 degrees, a
fully charged battery will deliver 100 percent of its energy to
whatever electrical devices the car uses, including the starter. As
the temperature drops, so does the efficiency of the battery. In
fact, at 32 degrees, the battery is only about 80 percent
efficient. At zero degrees, available energy nose dives to around
50 percent. While even a partially charged battery may have enough
energy to start a car at 80 degrees, that same battery will fall
flat on its face when the temperature drops below freezing.
</P>
<P>
   The same cold conditions that cause the battery to become weaker
increase the engine's initial need for more electrical power. After
sitting overnight, the engine oil has a tendency to thicken. This
makes the engine harder for the starter to ``turn over.'' The
starter will try its hardest to accomplish the task, which means
using more electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a vicious circle.
</P>
<P>
   The starter demands more electricity from a battery incapable of
delivering it. Consequently, ``click click.'' When you stop and
think about it, many of us drive around with partially charged
batteries, especially during the winter. If we drive short
distances with the accessories on (lights, wipers, defroster,
radio, etc.), we never give the battery a chance to fully recharge.
It actually takes about 20 minutes of continuous driving at around
2000 engine rpms to feed back to the battery the electricity used
for cranking.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of our commute time is spent idling at low engine
rpm, complete recharge is often never achieved. Of course, short
trips consisting of repeatedly starting the engine, driving a few
miles and shutting it off several times dig the fastest grave for
our little 12-volt friend.
</P>
<P>
   Short of overhauling your lifestyle, what can you do about it?
Make sure your battery is clean and the battery cables are clean
and tight (no green stuff growing on them). This ensures a clear
path for the electricity's travel. Take a long trip occasionally,
or at least make sure the engine is allowed to run continuously
about once a week for 20 minutes or so. (If you do this in the
driveway, don't turn on any accessories.)
</P>
<P>
   You might want to invest in a small, inexpensive battery charger
(2 to 5 amps). Hook it up to the battery overnight about once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   On nights it is going to be really cold, put your car to bed
with an old blanket thrown over the hood. Do this shortly after
you've shut the engine off. This will help keep some of the engine
heat under the hood and some of the cold out, which may help the
starting process in the morning. Most importantly, have your
battery checked and serviced as part of your annual winter
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems and marginal batteries can be caught and
attended to before they leave you stranded.

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Atlanta poised to be key player in cord blood
technology
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS; PLACENTA
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Frozen in Cincinnati is a Kentucky grandfather's gift
for his grandchildren, Ian and Clare Henderson of Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes they never open it.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is umbilical cord blood, collected on the day each
child was born as a type of biological insurance should the
siblings or other family members need it for a bone marrow
transplant to cure leukemia or other life-threatening illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason not to do it,'' Stephanie Henderson, 32,
said of her decision to have her physician collect the specimen
from both babies, born two years apart at Piedmont Hospital,
``especially since my father-in-law offered to pay for it. Who
wants to be kicking themselves down the road in 10 years when it
could potentially help someone in our family or perhaps save one of
our children's lives?''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, more and more parents are plunking down $1,200 to
$1,500 for private cord blood collection, followed by an annual
storage fee of $100. As evidence of the disease-curing potential of
cord blood grows, some families do it because there's a family
history of cancer. Others, because they are concerned their baby's
ethnicity narrows the possibility of a bone marrow match.
</P>
<P>
   While private cord blood banking is a growing industry with
slick Web sites _ and brochures and videos scattered in doctors'
offices and birthing centers, banking for public use isn't as well
developed. Public blood banks are available in only a handful of
states _ not yet in Georgia _ mostly because cord blood
transplantation is still considered experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Marston found that out recently when she was
pregnant with her first child. Marston's family medical history did
not warrant paying for private cord blood collection, but she
wanted to collect the blood and give it to a national registry that
matches donations to potential bone marrow transplant patients. No
hospital in the Atlanta area does that, though Northside Hospital
and Emory University are looking into collection programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fantastic resource,'' said Marston, an infectious
disease specialist at Emory University. ``I believe most
well-informed people would be willing to donate cord blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Marston and her husband, Dr. Larry Slutsker, watched
the potential lifesaving blood get tossed when Emma Caroline came
into the world two days before Christmas at Crawford Long Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad about it, but there was nothing I could do,'' said
Marston, who lives in Candler Park. ``Hopefully, we can have
another child, and, hopefully, by that time, the ability to donate
cord blood will have become routine.''
</P>
<P>
   She may get her wish.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta may yet emerge as one of the nation's leading public
cord blood donation sites, a Northside Hospital doctor predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is well-positioned to be one of the dominant cord
blood centers in the country,'' said Dr. Kent Holland, medical
director of Northside's stem cell processing lab. He was referring
to two key ingredients of cord blood collection that are already
here _ booming birthing centers and top-notch medical researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Northside Hospital is looking to partner with one of the
national programs already collecting cord blood and is seeking
grants to get a donor program up by spring, Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Northside is the nation's leading community hospital when it
comes to stork visits _ just over 13,000 babies were born there in
1998. Also, it's a leader in adult bone marrow transplants, with
100 procedures last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a facility already supporting the bone marrow
transplants. So storing cord blood would not be a problem,''
Holland said. ``But when developing a donor cord blood program,
it's very important to properly educate the people you are
approaching and there's all kinds of ethical questions that have to
be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory is also considering starting a public cord blood donation
program, estimating it would cost a couple of million dollars in
seed money. Last month, cord blood from an anonymous New York donor
was infused into sickle cell patient Keone Penn, 12, of Centerville
at Egleston Children's Hospital. It is believed to be the world's
first such unrelated cord blood transplant for sickle cell.
</P>
<P>
   White blood cells are just starting to appear in Keone's blood,
the first indication the transplant may be taking hold. Keone's
cord blood came from the Placental Blood Program at the New York
Blood Center, the nation's first and largest public cord blood
program, which is supported by federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Placenta blood collected by such public programs, and some
participating hospitals, are made available on a national registry.
The nearest facility to Georgia with a public cord blood donation
program is the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, which collects from
volunteer mothers at Duke University Medical Center and Durham
Regional Hospital in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply not ready to bank everyone's cord blood,'' said
LeeAnn Jensen, immunologist at the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute in Bethesda, Md., the federal center now expanding the
national public cord blood bank. ``It costs about $2,000 to collect
each unit of it. It's very expensive and labor-intensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Other facilities now contributing under a National Institutes of
Health grant to a public cord blood bank are Georgetown University
and the University of California at Los Angeles; six other centers
will be collecting donated cord blood and adding to the national
stockpile under a five-year, $30 million federal grant. Several
other smaller public cord blood collection sites exist at
university hospitals around the country.
</P>
<P>
   While public cord banking grows, some scientists worry about the
competition from private cord blood enterprises, which they claim
play on the worst fears of parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking insurance against getting hit by a meteor,''
said Dr. Lewis Hsu, pediatric hematologist at Grady Health System.
``The chances of someone getting leukemia is so so small. ... The
companies are just going to make tons of money off this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Angela Ogden, who oversees many bone marrow transplants at
Egleston Children's Hospital, said she's seen some private cord
blood brochures that exaggerate the potential of cord blood and
overstate the chances of possibly needing it .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they coerce some mothers into banking their children's
blood based on false data,'' Ogden said. ``The chance your child
will use it is about one in a million.''
</P>
<P>
   (There are about 3,100 U.S. cases annually of the most severe
type of childhood leukemia, called ALL for acute lymphocytic
leukemia; the risk is less than 1 in 100,000 your child will
develop it.)
</P>
<P>
   And, even if your child does develop leukemia, it would be
better to give that child someone else's cord blood, a Duke
University expert says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that cord blood may contain the leukemic cells.
Also, when you give them back their own cord blood, you're giving
them back their own immune system, which was not able to fight off
cancer the first time around,'' said Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, who has
performed the most cord blood transplants in the world, 185, and
has a 50 percent success rate. She's also director of the Carolinas
Cord Blood Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ViaCord Inc., the private cord blood bank that's storing the
Henderson children's blood, says that so far, three families have
used the cord blood from their newborn for a sibling. All three
clients knew when they collected the sample that a brother or
sister needed it; one patient died and the other two are healthy
and featured in ViaCord brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Since cord blood banking is not regulated (the FDA is now
drafting standards for quality and safety), there is no way to know
how many families have opted for this new type of biological
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, ViaCord says its main competitors are CordBlood
Registry and CorCell; the three are considered the nation's largest
private cord blood companies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,000 families that ViaCord has collected from in the
past several years, 25 were from Georgia, said Mary Beth Mohan,
ViaCord marketing communications manager. Atlanta hospitals it's
worked with include Piedmont, Northside and Crawford Long.
</P>
<P>
   ViaCord customers also have the option of donating their blood
to the national registry, but they would still have to pay the
$1,500 down payment and the transportation fee. Local ViaCord
families interviewed for this article, however, said they never
read or heard of that option. Insurance companies are beginning to
pay for cord blood collection if there's proof a sibling needs the
blood for a medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of reasons people chose to collect the cord
blood, '' Mohan said, reading from a survey of ViaCord's customers
nationwide. ``The most common is a family history of cancer and
other diseases. But one mother did it because her baby was from
donated sperm and she didn't know the father's history. Lesbian
couples have chosen to do so. And parents who've gone through
infertility treatment and are pretty sure they are not going to
have another child.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these situations fits the Hendersons, whose son's blood
was collected in September 1996, followed by their daughter's this
past September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no particular reason we did other than precaution,''
said Ian Henderson Jr., father to Ian Henderson III and son to Ian
Henderson Sr., a lawyer in Louisville. ``I had never heard of this
until my father brought it up. He fancies himself as a doctor even
though he's a lawyer. We hope we'll never need to use it, but at
least we know it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen and Eric Schwartz of Northlake also admitted they are not
in a high-risk category for ever needing baby Ariel's cord blood.
But they preserved it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably doesn't statistically make sense for us, but you
never know in a few years from now what they may discover can be
done with it,'' Ellen Schwartz said over the cries of her
6-week-old daughter. ``You buy insurance for things you can't
afford to replace.

 &HT;    Celebrating placenta part of many cultures
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the human placenta is usually regarded in
Western medicine as nothing more than hospital waste, it receives
ceremonial handling by many cultures around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Revered for its symbolism of life, spirit and individuality, it
is often buried outside. Some people even promote cooking and
eating it as a celebration of birth and a source of rich nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Navajo Indians of the Southwest, it's customary to
bury a child's placenta within the sacred Four Corners of the
tribe's reservation as a binder to ancestral land and people. New
Zealand's Maoris have the same tradition of burying the placenta
within native soil. In their native language, the word for land and
placenta are the same, whenua.
</P>
<P>
   Among the indigenous Bolivian Aymara and Quecha people, the
placenta is said to have its own spirit. It is to be washed and
buried by the husband in a secret and shady place. If this ritual
is not performed correctly, they believe the mother or baby may
become very sick or even die.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Ibo of Nigeria and Ghana, the placenta is treated as
the dead twin of the live child and given full burial rites.
</P>
<P>
   Filipino mothers are known to bury the placenta with books, in
hopes of a smart child. Other cultures place a symbol of their
people with the placenta when burying it, as a kind of heritage
insurance. Among the Hmong culture of Southeast Asia, the word for
placenta can be translated as ``jacket,'' as it's considered an
infant's first and finest clothing. The Hmong bury the placenta
outside. They believe that after death, the soul must retrace the
journeys undertaken in life until it reaches the burial place of
its placenta jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the not-so-ceremonial use of it, the commercial
use of ``placenta extract'' found in some cosmetics, such as facial
cream sold in France. In 1994, Britain banned the practice of
collecting placentas in hospitals from unsuspecting mothers, after
it was learned that 360 tons of it were annually being bought and
shipped by French pharmaceutical firms. They used it to make a
protein, albumin, for burns and to make enzymes to treat rare
genetic disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The placenta is a vascular organ that develops within the uterus
during pregnancy. Attached by the umbilical cord to the baby, the
placenta discharges shortly after birth; thus, it is often called
the afterbirth. Since it is the structure through which the fetus
receives nourishment, many cultures consider it rich in nutrients;
it's even said to relieve post-natal depression.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing the placenta for consumption by mothers is considered
traditional among Vietnamese and Chinese people. The Chinese
believe a nursing mother should boil the placenta, make a broth,
then drink it to improve her milk.
</P>
<P>
   That practice, known as ``placentophagy,'' did not go over well
when depicted last year on the British cooking show ``TV Dinner,''
according to The Independent, a London newspaper. The show featured
a London couple celebrating the birth of their granddaughter by
preparing, then eating, the baby's placenta as a means of
reflecting rituals around the world and symbolically sharing in the
baby's gene pool.
</P>
<P>
   The placenta (not to be confused with polenta, the Independent
wrote) was fried with shallots and garlic, flambeed and pureed and
served to 20 family and friends as a pate on focaccia bread. The
father had 17 helpings _ but other guests were less enthusiastic,
the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving complaints from viewers, the Broadcasting
Standards Commission ruled the program had breached a taboo that
``would have been disagreeable to many,'' even though the producers
attempted to treat the subject sensitively and fairly.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to find out what is legal in how a 401(k) plan is
administered. My employer has a 401(k) plan and started taking
money out of my paycheck on Sept. 25. Well, now it's three months
later _ a total of more than $1,400, not including any gains or
interest accrual, has been taken _ and the funds are still not in
the account. I have contacted Human Resources about this
repeatedly. My account is still inactive. Is it legal for this
company to be messing around with my 401(k) funds? I find its
lackadaisical attitude highly irresponsible and disturbing. What
sort of recourse do I have? Personnel and Payroll have so far been
no help whatsoever. I am beginning to worry that something is
rotten in the state of Denmark! _B.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't know where the money is, but the U.S. Department of
Labor will help locate it! The Labor Department's Pension and
Welfare Benefits Administration field office in Dallas looks into
this sort of thing. As of Feb. 3, 1997, an employer is allowed a
maximum of 15 business days after the month in which money is taken
out of your wages for your 401(k) to deposit it. The department
computes the amount owed starting at the earliest date the money
could begin working for you. You stand to gain the 401(k)
contributions as well as what the plan would have earned on late
contributions or the prime interest rate plus 2 percent _ whichever
is higher. The employer may also be subject to the 502(l) penalty,
which goes to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for four-tine fork lapel pins. _J.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: None ready made. Have these trinkets custom made by Flojac at
(800) 430-8368. Q: I have been wanting to ask you if you know of a
company that sells fireworks by mail. I happened to order some
before but that was many years ago. See what you can do. If not,
thanks anyway. _Jose B.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Fireworks have no place in the mail,'' says Postmaster
Dennis Walsh. ``It is clearly a safety issue.'' All fireworks are
Class 1 explosives and, as such, are prohibited from mailing. You
cannot even mail matches. Fina Morales, U.S. Postal Service
spokeswoman, says hazardous materials (flammable, corrosive,
reactive or toxic) cannot be mailed either.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been looking for punch tin that is in reproduction.
You see it in restaurants on ceilings. Someone told me there is a
place in Houston. Can you help me find the number where I can
purchase this? _Jan C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact the Chelsea Decorative Metal Co. for a free catalog.
Rumor has it these sheets are easy to install. The company sells
2-by-4-foot sheets of several styles of this pressed tin used on
ceilings and walls _ Victorian to art deco. The number: (713)
721-9200.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find a ``Phases of the Moon'' calendar for
1999. I heard that planetariums offered them for free. Is that
true? Where would the closest planetarium be? _L.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: The posters, alas, are not free but are well-priced ($11 to
$15 plus shipping) from the McDonald Observatory, P.O. Box 1337,
Fort Davis, TX 79734. Interested in the full moons coming up?
January and March each boast two (as in once in a blue moon);
February is skipped altogether. By the way, it is atmospheric
conditions that make the moon appear blue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My granddaughter is visiting and had head lice. We purchased
an over-the-counter product and treated her head; however, I can
still see what appears to be eggs stuck to some of her hair
follicles. I read somewhere recently that if you coat the hair with
olive oil overnight, the eggs suffocate and can be removed easily.
Fact or fiction? I'm really in a quandary as I do not want to send
her home with lice and definitely don't want lice myself.
Suggestions? _C.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yikes! Children are the main carriers of head lice, passing
the critters along when sharing combs, coat racks and hats. Some
chemical treatments have not been effective in recent years.
Bedding and clothes should be washed in hot water and dried at high
heat as part of the treatment. The National Pediculosis Association
does not endorse treatments like olive oil, mayo or Vaseline to
smother the critters. The removal of the treatment is often
difficult and risky. Getting the lice out may be successful, but
then getting the Vaseline or olive oil out may pose other problems.
Call your doctor for a recommendation. The association does state
``mechanical removal is the common denominator for success.'' So
buy a nit comb to remove eggs _ a tedious process. (The association
happens to sell one, aptly called the LiceMeister.) For more
information, contact the association at (781) 449-6487.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am 9 years old and would like to know why we say ``Merry''
Christmas instead of ``Happy'' Christmas like we do for all the
other holidays (like Happy New Year, Happy Thanksgiving, Happy
Birthday, etc.)? Thank you. _Laura Mahany
</P>
<P>
   A: You have stumped me _ and all the other wordsmiths I
consulted. Maybe the ``merry'' was used to avoid repetition in
Happy Christmas and Happy New Year. The Brits sometimes say ``Happy
Christmas,'' and it is to English literature that I turned for
etymology. ``A Christmas Carol'' contains the line, ``They wished
each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog.'' (That grog thing
is a whole other issue.) Victorian times hatched many holiday
traditions _ maybe this phrase is one. Shakespeare penned ``Welcome
Merry Shrovetide'' in ``Henry IV.'' Shrovetide is th three days
preceding Lent. It's the only other place I found the adjective as
part of a salutation. The best part of a job like mine is there are
lots of folks to improve my answers.

   _ Several readers answered my call for why the traditional box
exchanged at a Mexican wedding contains 13 pieces of silver. One
reader suggests the 13 pieces represent Jesus and the 12 disciples;
another, the 13 original colonies. All agree the exchange of these
coins represents a financial commitment between the bride and groom
to the new family.

office six weeks' advance notice for greetings regarding those
celebrating birthdays of 80 years or more, anniversaries of 50
years or more, weddings and births. Include the name and address of
honoree(s), exact date of the occasion, and age or number of years
of marriage. This is the work of volunteers, so be patient and
appreciative!

August, in March. Clip these numbers for easy reference: Campground

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Atlanta poised to be key player in cord blood
technology
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS; PLACENTA
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Frozen in Cincinnati is a Kentucky grandfather's gift
for his grandchildren, Ian and Clare Henderson of Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes they never open it.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is umbilical cord blood, collected on the day each
child was born as a type of biological insurance should the
siblings or other family members need it for a bone marrow
transplant to cure leukemia or other life-threatening illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no reason not to do it,'' Stephanie Henderson, 32,
said of her decision to have her physician collect the specimen
from both babies, born two years apart at Piedmont Hospital,
``especially since my father-in-law offered to pay for it. Who
wants to be kicking themselves down the road in 10 years when it
could potentially help someone in our family or perhaps save one of
our children's lives?''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, more and more parents are plunking down $1,200 to
$1,500 for private cord blood collection, followed by an annual
storage fee of $100. As evidence of the disease-curing potential of
cord blood grows, some families do it because there's a family
history of cancer. Others, because they are concerned their baby's
ethnicity narrows the possibility of a bone marrow match.
</P>
<P>
   While private cord blood banking is a growing industry with
slick Web sites _ and brochures and videos scattered in doctors'
offices and birthing centers, banking for public use isn't as well
developed. Public blood banks are available in only a handful of
states _ not yet in Georgia _ mostly because cord blood
transplantation is still considered experimental.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barbara Marston found that out recently when she was
pregnant with her first child. Marston's family medical history did
not warrant paying for private cord blood collection, but she
wanted to collect the blood and give it to a national registry that
matches donations to potential bone marrow transplant patients. No
hospital in the Atlanta area does that, though Northside Hospital
and Emory University are looking into collection programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fantastic resource,'' said Marston, an infectious
disease specialist at Emory University. ``I believe most
well-informed people would be willing to donate cord blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Marston and her husband, Dr. Larry Slutsker, watched
the potential lifesaving blood get tossed when Emma Caroline came
into the world two days before Christmas at Crawford Long Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad about it, but there was nothing I could do,'' said
Marston, who lives in Candler Park. ``Hopefully, we can have
another child, and, hopefully, by that time, the ability to donate
cord blood will have become routine.''
</P>
<P>
   She may get her wish.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta may yet emerge as one of the nation's leading public
cord blood donation sites, a Northside Hospital doctor predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is well-positioned to be one of the dominant cord
blood centers in the country,'' said Dr. Kent Holland, medical
director of Northside's stem cell processing lab. He was referring
to two key ingredients of cord blood collection that are already
here _ booming birthing centers and top-notch medical researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Northside Hospital is looking to partner with one of the
national programs already collecting cord blood and is seeking
grants to get a donor program up by spring, Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Northside is the nation's leading community hospital when it
comes to stork visits _ just over 13,000 babies were born there in
1998. Also, it's a leader in adult bone marrow transplants, with
100 procedures last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a facility already supporting the bone marrow
transplants. So storing cord blood would not be a problem,''
Holland said. ``But when developing a donor cord blood program,
it's very important to properly educate the people you are
approaching and there's all kinds of ethical questions that have to
be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory is also considering starting a public cord blood donation
program, estimating it would cost a couple of million dollars in
seed money. Last month, cord blood from an anonymous New York donor
was infused into sickle cell patient Keone Penn, 12, of Centerville
at Egleston Children's Hospital. It is believed to be the world's
first such unrelated cord blood transplant for sickle cell.
</P>
<P>
   White blood cells are just starting to appear in Keone's blood,
the first indication the transplant may be taking hold. Keone's
cord blood came from the Placental Blood Program at the New York
Blood Center, the nation's first and largest public cord blood
program, which is supported by federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Placenta blood collected by such public programs, and some
participating hospitals, are made available on a national registry.
The nearest facility to Georgia with a public cord blood donation
program is the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, which collects from
volunteer mothers at Duke University Medical Center and Durham
Regional Hospital in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply not ready to bank everyone's cord blood,'' said
LeeAnn Jensen, immunologist at the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute in Bethesda, Md., the federal center now expanding the
national public cord blood bank. ``It costs about $2,000 to collect
each unit of it. It's very expensive and labor-intensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Other facilities now contributing under a National Institutes of
Health grant to a public cord blood bank are Georgetown University
and the University of California at Los Angeles; six other centers
will be collecting donated cord blood and adding to the national
stockpile under a five-year, $30 million federal grant. Several
other smaller public cord blood collection sites exist at
university hospitals around the country.
</P>
<P>
   While public cord banking grows, some scientists worry about the
competition from private cord blood enterprises, which they claim
play on the worst fears of parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking insurance against getting hit by a meteor,''
said Dr. Lewis Hsu, pediatric hematologist at Grady Health System.
``The chances of someone getting leukemia is so so small. ... The
companies are just going to make tons of money off this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Angela Ogden, who oversees many bone marrow transplants at
Egleston Children's Hospital, said she's seen some private cord
blood brochures that exaggerate the potential of cord blood and
overstate the chances of possibly needing it .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they coerce some mothers into banking their children's
blood based on false data,'' Ogden said. ``The chance your child
will use it is about one in a million.''
</P>
<P>
   (There are about 3,100 U.S. cases annually of the most severe
type of childhood leukemia, called ALL for acute lymphocytic
leukemia; the risk is less than 1 in 100,000 your child will
develop it.)
</P>
<P>
   And, even if your child does develop leukemia, it would be
better to give that child someone else's cord blood, a Duke
University expert says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that cord blood may contain the leukemic cells.
Also, when you give them back their own cord blood, you're giving
them back their own immune system, which was not able to fight off
cancer the first time around,'' said Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, who has
performed the most cord blood transplants in the world, 185, and
has a 50 percent success rate. She's also director of the Carolinas
Cord Blood Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ViaCord Inc., the private cord blood bank that's storing the
Henderson children's blood, says that so far, three families have
used the cord blood from their newborn for a sibling. All three
clients knew when they collected the sample that a brother or
sister needed it; one patient died and the other two are healthy
and featured in ViaCord brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Since cord blood banking is not regulated (the FDA is now
drafting standards for quality and safety), there is no way to know
how many families have opted for this new type of biological
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, ViaCord says its main competitors are CordBlood
Registry and CorCell; the three are considered the nation's largest
private cord blood companies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,000 families that ViaCord has collected from in the
past several years, 25 were from Georgia, said Mary Beth Mohan,
ViaCord marketing communications manager. Atlanta hospitals it's
worked with include Piedmont, Northside and Crawford Long.
</P>
<P>
   ViaCord customers also have the option of donating their blood
to the national registry, but they would still have to pay the
$1,500 down payment and the transportation fee. Local ViaCord
families interviewed for this article, however, said they never
read or heard of that option. Insurance companies are beginning to
pay for cord blood collection if there's proof a sibling needs the
blood for a medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of reasons people chose to collect the cord
blood, '' Mohan said, reading from a survey of ViaCord's customers
nationwide. ``The most common is a family history of cancer and
other diseases. But one mother did it because her baby was from
donated sperm and she didn't know the father's history. Lesbian
couples have chosen to do so. And parents who've gone through
infertility treatment and are pretty sure they are not going to
have another child.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these situations fits the Hendersons, whose son's blood
was collected in September 1996, followed by their daughter's this
past September.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no particular reason we did other than precaution,''
said Ian Henderson Jr., father to Ian Henderson III and son to Ian
Henderson Sr., a lawyer in Louisville. ``I had never heard of this
until my father brought it up. He fancies himself as a doctor even
though he's a lawyer. We hope we'll never need to use it, but at
least we know it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen and Eric Schwartz of Northlake also admitted they are not
in a high-risk category for ever needing baby Ariel's cord blood.
But they preserved it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably doesn't statistically make sense for us, but you
never know in a few years from now what they may discover can be
done with it,'' Ellen Schwartz said over the cries of her
6-week-old daughter. ``You buy insurance for things you can't
afford to replace.

 &HT;    Y2K? Y2K worry? Bring it on
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's such a small problem. A few computer geeks
forgot to put a couple of extra numbers on a date. A tiny glitch.
Now what?
</P>
<P>
   (Say in a dramatic echo) Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Bank accounts will be erased; the stock market will crash. Some
warn that we will be left penniless, groveling for food. People
will starve. Planes will fall out of the air. There will be panic
in the streets. Gunfire. Bloodshed. Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   To all that I say: So what? Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, we're sweating the big stuff. Not seeing the trees for
the forest. It's the small stuff that's going to get us. What I
want to know is if my Walkman will work and if I will be able to
get a beer or play a videogame. Bank accounts? Who cares? Erase
them. More important, will the Y2K bug keep me from getting a scoop
of ice cream or microwaving a burrito?
</P>
<P>
   I set out recently to see what the true impact of Y2K would be,
to look at what life could be like for the common man, namely me.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping in mind that the fall of civilization as we know it will
occur after New Year's Eve, my first priority of the new century
will be to rid myself of my hangover (hair of the dog, it's a
Louisiana thing). For this, I visited Steve Anderson, brewmaster at
Waterloo Brewing Co., and addressed him with my concern. He gruffly
assured me there will be no problem, and if all hell broke loose,
the brewpub could store up to 168 barrels of nature's organic
hangover cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in Y2K,'' said Anderson. ``It's a hoax. Just
another way for the software companies to make money. Besides,
brewing beer hasn't changed much in hundreds of years. My main
instrument isn't a computer; it's a paddle. Believe me, we will
have beer on New Year's Day 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   While enjoying my beer, I'll surely want some live music. In the
coming dark times, we'll all need music to keep the human spirit
alive. The failure of computer-driven synthesizers could decimate
Austin's global reputation as ``Live Music Capital of the World.''
The horror.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Koym, guitarist and band leader of the cover band the Be
Wires, assured me that his band wouldn't be affected by the bug. He
said he has numerous backup synthesizers, but things would really
have to go haywire for them not to be able to play or, worse, have
to play acoustic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lost our keyboard, we couldn't play 50 percent of our
tunes,'' Koym said. ``You know, like we couldn't play our '80s
crowd-pleasers like `Bizarre Love Triangle' by New Order or
`Tainted Love' by Soft Cell. In that case, we would just play a lot
of guitar-based tunes like the Romantics' `What I Like About You'
or 'Matchbox 20'. We'd just cut out the dance material.''
</P>
<P>
   Music is safe, it seems, but how and what will I eat in the New
World Order? Most survivalist and Y2K alarmist groups speak of
storing grain, beans and canned goods. They claim the only way to
eat will be to live off the fat of the land. I question this plan
and fully expect to be gorging myself on queso fries and Dixie Red
Hot sandwiches at Texicalli Grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we'll be open in 2000,'' said the hyper-optimistic Danny
Young, owner of the restaurant. ``And I bet my 1954 station wagon
starts, too. Let me tell you something: I don't have a single
computer, answering machine or a touch-tone phone. As long as the
gas comes on, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if things turn ugly, and Danny is forced to take up
arms against a group of queso-starved survivalists who are sick of
beans and grain? That's when I go to the vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machines are a veritable Y2K food and beverage stockpile
unto themselves: Ham and cheese sandwiches, burritos, Cokes and
Milky Way candy bars. Here in the American-Statesman building, we
have a hallway full of them. Recently, I asked a mustached service
associate replenishing a machine with tuna nicoise and french toast
and sausage sandwiches if they were Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck is that? Y2K?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the moment when 1999 becomes 2000, and all the computers
supposedly shut down. It is rumored the world could possibly end,''
I answered.
</P>
<P>
   I called his boss at Accent Food Services to ask my question
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a problem if those vending machines stopped
working,'' said Tom Hawkins, president of Accent.
</P>
<P>
   I concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we've contacted all of our suppliers and have
been told it won't be a problem,'' he said. ``We expect our Y2K
compliance letters from them in 30 to 60 days.''
</P>
<P>
   What a relief. With the food question out of the way, I turned
again toward entertainment. With the world on fire, it might be
safer to stay at home and play Playstation. At Babbage's in
Highland Mall I spoke with sales associate Frank. Frank is short
and robotic in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because your Playstation has no built-in calendar system or
battery backup system, there will be no problem with it,'' he said
in a tone that made me fear for his personal Y2K compliance. ``You
have nothing to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   But what fun would holing up with my Playstation be without a
big tub of Amy's ice cream? I couldn't imagine playing videogames
in a Y2K-worn world without a large serving of Mexican vanilla with
a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup mix-in. While Phil Clay, the self
proclaimed ``No. 1 Ice Cream Guy for Amy's,'' admitted there might
be a small problem with the company's computer network, he said
Amy's expects to be ready for business in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company doesn't hinge on the Y2K problem,'' he said.
``Assuming society doesn't collapse, we will definitely be serving
ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is that aforementioned Walkman thing. If there is
going to be a global collapse, I want it to happen to the tune of
whatever I'm playing. To check that there wouldn't be a problem, I
dialed up the Sony customer service line at(800) 222-SONY.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony Electronics, this is Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Gregory Kallenberg, and I want to make sure my
Walkman is Y2K compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will my Walkman still work after New Year's Eve 1999? After
all the computers shut down and the Earth is in chaos, will I still
be able to listen to my Pearl Jam album?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what you mean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you hold on a moment? Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Three and a half minutes later, Pat returned and read this
prepared statement: ``Sony products will not malfunction by virtue
of the transition of 1999 to 2000. Any such products which keep the
date will accurately do so, and no Sony products will fail because
of the date change. Thank you. Have a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   So while bank accounts might disappear and planes fall out of
the sky, we, the common people, will be fine. We will eat our queso
fries, play our videogames and drink our beers, all to the tune of
whatever is playing on our fully functioning Walkmans.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K. Bring it on. 354 days and counting.

for Sunday, Jan. 10, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-STATEOFUNION-REVIEW (Washington) _ In State of the Union
speeches before members of Congress and the Supreme Court,
presidents have made an implicit argument that the three branches
of government may be equal, but some are more equal than others.
This year, as President Clinton assesses the union's state before
an audience that is considering ejecting him from office, he will
be testing that proposition. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-CAPITAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Never in the history of
modern business has there been a class of companies that has
spiraled so high, so fast and with so little regard for convention
as the Internet companies whose market values continue to astonish
Wall Street. What is particularly surprising is that most of them
have few if any physical assets. By David Barboza. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-LIDDY-REVIEW (Washington) _ It may be the ultimate slap
at the boys in suits who have long dominated U.S. politics: the
hottest electoral commodities, as of last week at least, are best
known for whom they married and have never run for public office:
Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Dole. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   PET-PSYCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Given the money to be made catering
to Americans' twin obsessions with psychological advice and pets,
it's only a matter of time before a flood of books, TV shows, radio
programs and newspaper columns feature pop psychiatrists whose
specialty is putting Rover on the couch or on Prozac. BY Joe
Sharkey. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE-DATABASE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Linguists say that digital
libraries like JSTOR will reduce dependence on searching through
libraries to study the history of the language. Already, the word
`hopefully,' long considered a grammatical corruption that
originated in the 1960s, has been found in texts as far back as the
1930s. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   TV-ANCHORS-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Perhaps to enhance their
legitimacy, America's TV news anchors are increasingly drawn across
the boundary from electronic media to the solid ground of books on
paper. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Some liberals are beginning to
think that vouchers _ something they have largely shunned for use
in education _ might be a good for Medicare. By Michael Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in `i' category
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-MAFIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Comparing the Russian and Italian
mafias. In Italy, the word `mafia' signifies discreet criminal
organizations with strict hierarchical structures, but in Russia it
has come to mean much more. In Russia it embraces the noxious blend
of crime, politics and business that has engulfed the nation in the
post-Soviet era. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-PROFESSIONS-REVIEW (Phnom Penh) _ In exterminating
Cambodia's lawyers but doctors, teachers, engineers, accountants,
clerks, businessmen, monks, artists and other professionals in the
1970s, the Khmer Rouge not only destroyed Cambodia's culture,
commerce and civil society. It eliminated the people who might have
been available to rebuild them. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-DEATHSQAUDS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Iran's official admission
that a death squad within the intelligence service killed some of
the regime's critics was made only after the murders had already
unleashed a remarkably open public debate, in which people who
suddenly felt more vulnerable complained of the specter of official
terror. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   KISSINGER-TRANSCRIPTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Documents released from
the archives of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger include
transcripts of conversations that he and President Richard Nixon
had with Communist leaders like Mao Tse-tung and Leonid Brezhnev,
offering new insights on the thaw in the Cold War of the early and
mid-1970s.

   INTERNET-CAPITAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Never in the history of
modern business has there been a class of companies that has
spiraled so high, so fast and with so little regard for convention
as the Internet companies whose market values continue to astonish
Wall Street. What is particularly surprising is that most of them
have few if any physical assets. By David Barboza. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-LIDDY-REVIEW (Washington) _ It may be the ultimate slap
at the boys in suits who have long dominated U.S. politics: the
hottest electoral commodities, as of last week at least, are best
known for whom they married and have never run for public office:
Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Dole. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   PET-PSYCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Given the money to be made catering
to Americans' twin obsessions with psychological advice and pets,
it's only a matter of time before a flood of books, TV shows, radio
programs and newspaper columns feature pop psychiatrists whose
specialty is putting Rover on the couch or on Prozac. BY Joe
Sharkey. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE-DATABASE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Linguists say that digital
libraries like JSTOR will reduce dependence on searching through
libraries to study the history of the language. Already, the word
`hopefully,' long considered a grammatical corruption that
originated in the 1960s, has been found in texts as far back as the
1930s. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>

   TV-ANCHORS-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Perhaps to enhance their

</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in `i' category
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-MAFIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Comparing the Russian and Italian
mafias. In Italy, the word `mafia' signifies discreet criminal
organizations with strict hierarchical structures, but in Russia it
has come to mean much more. In Russia it embraces the noxious blend
of crime, politics and business that has engulfed the nation in the
post-Soviet era. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-PROFESSIONS-REVIEW (Phnom Penh) _ In exterminating
Cambodia's lawyers but doctors, teachers, engineers, accountants,
clerks, businessmen, monks, artists and other professionals in the
1970s, the Khmer Rouge not only destroyed Cambodia's culture,
commerce and civil society. It eliminated the people who might have
been available to rebuild them. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-DEATHSQAUDS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Iran's official admission
that a death squad within the intelligence service killed some of
the regime's critics was made only after the murders had already
unleashed a remarkably open public debate, in which people who
suddenly felt more vulnerable complained of the specter of official
terror. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   KISSINGER-TRANSCRIPTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Documents released from
the archives of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger include
transcripts of conversations that he and President Richard Nixon
had with Communist leaders like Mao Tse-tung and Leonid Brezhnev,
offering new insights on the thaw in the Cold War of the early and
mid-1970s.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Jan. 2, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

   WASHINGTON _ On Friday, the Senate finally settled on some basic
details for President Clinton's impeachment trial: when procedural
motions are due (Monday), when the prosecution will begin its case
(Thursday) and how long each side will have to present the
now-familiar evidence and arguments (a numbing 24 hours).
</P>
<P>
   But alongside the Senate's crisp, lawyerly schedule is another
timetable: when Clinton will deliver his State of the Union
address.
</P>
<P>
   The speech has long been scheduled, by agreement of the White
House and Congress, for Jan. 19. But already some Republican and
even some Democratic lawmakers have complained about the prospect
of a president extolling the union's state to House members who
impeached him and senators who are mulling his removal from office
on charges mired in Oval Office sex.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton might accommodate a congressional proposal to shift the
address by a few days, his advisers say, but he will not postpone
it indefinitely. To the administration, the speech is a golden
opportunity for Clinton to appear presidential before a national
television audience _ and to challenge his tormentors to improve
affairs of state even as they dicker over the state of his affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The question of when to deliver the speech represents one of
those Washington proxy fights over something bigger. Since Woodrow
Wilson revived the speech describing the State of the Union,
presidents have used it to make an implicit argument before the
upturned faces of their live audience: The three branches of
government may be equal, but one is more equal than others.
</P>
<P>
   Packed into the House chamber, representatives, senators and
justices of the Supreme Court are all listening to him as he
presents his agenda. He does not return the favor, at least not in
such a majestic setting. This year more than ever, some senators
seem uncomfortable with that unbalancing act.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be testing the command of his office,
challenging the widely discussed notion that his impeachment has
weakened the presidency. That is likely to work to Clinton's
advantage, the White House believes. In fact, aides said, the start
of the trial only made it more likely that he will deliver his
speech as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   They view the speech as a critical demonstration that the
government's business continues.
</P>
<P>
   The government's other branches might be reluctant to cheer
Clinton's view of a vibrant, healthy America after a year dominated
by sex talk and perjury charges. But would even the most
obstreperous opponents jeer the president of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   The conservative National Review editorialized last week that
Clinton should speak and that Congress should ``listen
courteously,'' giving the respect due the office. (It added that it
should later dispatch him to private life.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with the majesty of his office, Clinton has his own
political appeal to fall back on. As the president, in the camera's
tight focus, talks about his plans for education and health care,
the viewer is more likely to be impressed with him than with some
unseen member of congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else shows up,'' said a senior Clinton aide, ``but
when you look at it, the president is center stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not have to give the speech at all. The
Constitution says nothing about an annual State of the Union
speech. It requires only that the president ``from time to time''
give Congress ``information of the State of the Union'' and policy
recommendations. From Jefferson until Wilson, presidents contented
themselves with annual, written reports.
</P>
<P>
   And an unspoken State of the Union would probably not
irreparably sadden the citizenry or enfeeble the Republic. Franklin
D. Roosevelt enunciated the Four Freedoms in his 1941 address.
Ronald Reagan added the dramatic touch of singling out heroes in
the gallery. But let's face it: There have not been many memorable
State of the Union speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can think of phrases from inaugurals or departure
speeches,'' said Todd Gitlin, professor of culture, journalism and
sociology at New York University. ``Can anyone remember a phrase
from a Reagan State of the Union or a Kennedy one? I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Clinton loves to give this speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the State of the Union is probably Bill Clinton's
favorite day of the year,'' said Paul Begala, the White House
counselor. ``It's the complete coalescence of politics and policy
and communications and one-on-one hand-clasping with members in the
aisles and leading the nation. It's everything.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be little doubt of Clinton's ability to give a
coherent, resolutely high-minded speech that addresses his
predicament obliquely, if at all. Last year, he delivered a smooth
State of the Union Message just six days into the furor over Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   More than other modern presidents, Clinton has used the State of
the Union to annually rewind the mainspring of his administration.
In the months leading up to his address, his top aides meet to plan
the programs he will announce in the speech. Those programs become
the framework for Clinton's entire year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a demonstration of the doggedness of this White House
strategy that meetings to plan the State of the Union were held the
same Saturday last month that Clinton was impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can define a lot of the history of the Clinton presidency
from his State of the Union addresses,'' said William E.
Leuchtenburg, a professor of history at the University of North
Carolina. He argues that Clinton has been given too little credit
on foreign policy and too much for the often small-bore domestic
initiatives that tend to stock his State of the Union messages.
</P>
<P>
   Using the speech to set an agenda is in itself an expansion of
presidential power that has reversed the intended dynamic of the
message. ``It was not an assertion of presidential authority,''
said Garry Wills, adjunct professor of history at Northwestern
University. ``The whole point was that Congress as the boss, the
legislator, is asking the subordinate who executes the laws,
`How're ya doin'?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But now, because of both its content and the surrounding
pageantry, the speech suggests the primacy of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The address also gives Clinton his best annual opportunity to
reach over the heads of Congress to tell Americans of his plans,
which are poll tested for approval. That's why Lyndon Johnson moved
the speech from mid-day to the evening, when the television
audience was larger.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows how Congress will respond? The speech could soften
members toward him. Wilson, in reviving the custom of appearing
before Congress, said he wanted to demonstrate that the president
``is a person'' and a ``human being trying to cooperate with other
human beings in a common service.''

FRIGHTENING REASSURANCES IN IRAN

   WASHINGTON _ ``Be suspicious, the better to escape another's
trickery,'' the Persian maxim goes. Indeed, Iran, with its high
walls, veiled women and mirror-mosaics, is a country that never was
accustomed to revealing its secrets, whether its leader wore a
turban or a crown.
</P>
<P>
   So last week's official admission that a death squad operating
inside its secretive intelligence service was responsible for a
series of killings of the regime's critics was startling, to say
the least.
</P>
<P>
   By American standards, the statement from a spokesman (unnamed)
of the Ministry of Information (as it is called) did not reveal all
that much. It did not identify the ``irresponsible, misguided and
unruly personnel'' who it said had been arrested. It did not say
who ordered the murders. It did not promise a wholesale purge of
the super-secret ministry, which is believed to have carried out
scores of assassinations abroad, sanctioned rogue operations and is
larger and more intrusive in the lives of its own citizenry than
its predecessor, SAVAK, the shah's secret police.
</P>
<P>
   But why, after all, should anyone have expected a full and frank
explanation? Mysterious disappearances, fatal heart attacks in
prison and outright murders have long been part of the political
landscape of Iran's Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, for example, after 134 members of a writers'
association signed a letter calling for an end to censorship in
Iran, five of the signatories were killed or died soon afterward in
suspicious circumstances. The next summer, the driver of a bus
carrying 30 members of the group to a poetry conference in Armenia
twice tried to run the bus off a mountain, both times jumping out
of the bus to save himself first. Both times a passenger grabbed
the wheel and steered the bus back onto the road.
</P>
<P>
   But these incidents were always talked about in hushed tones
around dinner tables, not spread across the front pages of the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   This time things are different.
</P>
<P>
   The confession of criminality in the heart of the Islamic regime
was made only after the murders had already unleashed a remarkably
open public debate, in which people who suddenly felt more
vulnerable complained of the specter of official terror, and
Islamic purists blamed anti-Islamic elements and outsiders for the
killings. ``American and Israeli spies'' were behind the murders,
the Minister of Information, Ghorban-Ali Dorri-Najafabadi, had
declared.
</P>
<P>
   So the official announcement was something of an answer,
intended to calm the country while still casting suspicion on
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a critical change in the atmosphere had taken place a
year and half ago, when Mohammed Khatami was unexpectedly elected
president, a post in which he shares power with Iran's more
autocratic spiritual guide, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   In the public debate, which can be followed even overseas in
Iranian publications these days, President Khatami has argued that
the goal of the murders was to undermine his campaign to create a
civil society and impose the rule of law in Iran. This amounted to
a public acknowledgment that the country's intelligentsia was at
risk, and it created tremendous public pressure to hold the
government accountable to its people.
</P>
<P>
   Even Khamenei, who has effective authority over the intelligence
and security apparatus, eventually called the murders crimes
``against the country's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear, however, is just how much reassurance this
semi-openness has provided for the writers and others who have come
to fear for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After the Ministry of Information's announcement that it had
uncovered rogues in its ranks, Khatami made it sound as if the
committee had finished its work and the case was closed. ``What
happened in recent days shows that the Ministry of Intelligence is
alert and alive and its strong body has the capability to eradicate
fast and forcefully any sick cell or strange limb that might
appear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of stanching protest and closing the books, the
disclosure elicited calls for more action.
</P>
<P>
   A newly founded party that supports Khatami is calling on the
Government to revamp the entire structure of the intelligence
apparatus, especially its managers. An editorial in Zan, a
newspaper run by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, called for the investigatory
committee to look into other mysterious matters, including assaults
against two ministers and violent acts against legal meetings and
newspapers. Others are demanding more openness in the judicial
process, or the resignation of the Information Minister.
</P>
<P>
   But in an address at Friday prayers last week, Ayatollah
Khamenei called for an end to the public debate. ``I am surprised
by what some of our own press is doing,'' he said. ``They are
acting like the enemy, like a foolish child who would ridicule his
father for being in a verbal fight with someone.'' Personally, he
added, ``I can not believe that there was not a foreign scenario or
plot behind the recent murders that harmed this system, the
government and the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And an editorial in the Islamic hardline daily, Qods, blamed the
intelligence agency for talking too much in revealing its
shortcomings, saying, ``The Ministry of Information could have
informed higher officials instead of informing the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as part of a remarkably public debate, that kind of thought
doesn't reassure the intellectuals and dissenters. ``Writers,''
said the novelist Houshang Golshiri in an interview with the daily
newspaper Arya. ``still feel the threat of murder.''

   Never in the history of modern business has there been a class
of companies that has spiraled so high, so fast and with so little
regard for convention as the Internet companies whose market values
have astonished Wall Street in recent months and caused even more
surprise last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some have shown profits, but many haven't. Some rent space in
office parks or old warehouses. They have relatively few employees,
no manufacturing plants and little inventory.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every traditional way of measuring a company's worth,
they don't add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that we live in a world where Wall Street can't explain
why these stocks are going up and where pundits can't explain why
Clinton is so popular,'' said Mark Pincus, the 32-year-old
president of Tioga Systems, a software company in Palo Alto,
Calif., who sold his Internet company, Freeloader, for $38 million
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the old world of building a lot of facilities is
going nowhere,'' Pincus said, ``while the value of doing things
that are idea-based on the Web is going up exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory of business, physical assets are liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's atoms you're trying to minimize,'' said Bill Gross, the
president of Idealab, a Pasadena, Calif., company that helps
Internet startups. ``The more neurons you have per dollar the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``zero-gravity'' view of commerce in which ``you don't
want molecules,'' he said. ``Knowledge moves at the speed of light;
molecules move at 600 miles per hour with Fed Ex.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have a less exotic explanation for the
surge in interest in Internet businesses: the potential for
tremendous growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, there were about 5 million Internet users, but the
number is expected to rise to 115 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for this latest run is growth,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Securities. ``And Wall
Street loves growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com would be a textbook example of the new Internet
businesses, if a textbook existed. It was founded almost four years
ago by Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban, old college friends who were
then in their mid-30s. When it went public last year, it had one of
the fastest opening-day sprints in Wall Street history, rising
nearly 250 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company broadcasts live speeches, conferences, television
events and even professional wrestling over the Internet. It has
250 employees who work out of an old warehouse in Dallas that it
rents for $4,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, almost inexplicably, shares of Broadcast.com rose 50
percent and the company ended the day with a value of $3.4 billion,
more than the value of Wendy's International, which has 150,000
employees and 5,391 restaurants around the country.
</P>

   Following is a comparison of Internet companies and more
traditional businesses with similar market values.

year and half ago, when Mohammed Khatami was unexpectedly elected
president, a post in which he shares power with Iran's more
autocratic spiritual guide, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   In the public debate, which can be followed even overseas in
Iranian publications these days, President Khatami has argued that
the goal of the murders was to undermine his campaign to create a
civil society and impose the rule of law in Iran. This amounted to
a public acknowledgment that the country's intelligentsia was at
risk, and it created tremendous public pressure to hold the
government accountable to its people.
</P>
<P>
   Even Khamenei, who has effective authority over the intelligence
and security apparatus, eventually called the murders crimes
``against the country's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear, however, is just how much reassurance this
semi-openness has provided for the writers and others who have come
to fear for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   After the Ministry of Information's announcement that it had
uncovered rogues in its ranks, Khatami made it sound as if the
committee had finished its work and the case was closed. ``What
happened in recent days shows that the Ministry of Intelligence is
alert and alive and its strong body has the capability to eradicate
fast and forcefully any sick cell or strange limb that might
appear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of stanching protest and closing the books, the
disclosure elicited calls for more action.
</P>
<P>
   A newly founded party that supports Khatami is calling on the
Government to revamp the entire structure of the intelligence
apparatus, especially its managers. An editorial in Zan, a
newspaper run by Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former President
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, called for the investigatory
committee to look into other mysterious matters, including assaults
against two ministers and violent acts against legal meetings and
newspapers. Others are demanding more openness in the judicial
process, or the resignation of the Information Minister.
</P>
<P>
   But in an address at Friday prayers last week, Ayatollah
Khamenei called for an end to the public debate. ``I am surprised
by what some of our own press is doing,'' he said. ``They are
acting like the enemy, like a foolish child who would ridicule his
father for being in a verbal fight with someone.'' Personally, he
added, ``I can not believe that there was not a foreign scenario or
plot behind the recent murders that harmed this system, the
government and the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And an editorial in the Islamic hardline daily, Qods, blamed the
intelligence agency for talking too much in revealing its
shortcomings, saying, ``The Ministry of Information could have
informed higher officials instead of informing the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as part of a remarkably public debate, that kind of thought
doesn't reassure the intellectuals and dissenters. ``Writers,''
said the novelist Houshang Golshiri in an interview with the daily
newspaper Arya. ``still feel the threat of murder.''

   Never in the history of modern business has there been a class
of companies that has spiraled so high, so fast and with so little
regard for convention as the Internet companies whose market values
have astonished Wall Street in recent months and caused even more
surprise last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some have shown profits, but many haven't. Some rent space in
office parks or old warehouses. They have relatively few employees,
no manufacturing plants and little inventory.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every traditional way of measuring a company's worth,
they don't add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that we live in a world where Wall Street can't explain
why these stocks are going up and where pundits can't explain why
Clinton is so popular,'' said Mark Pincus, the 32-year-old
president of Tioga Systems, a software company in Palo Alto,
Calif., who sold his Internet company, Freeloader, for $38 million
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the old world of building a lot of facilities is
going nowhere,'' Pincus said, ``while the value of doing things
that are idea-based on the Web is going up exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory of business, physical assets are liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's atoms you're trying to minimize,'' said Bill Gross, the
president of Idealab, a Pasadena, Calif., company that helps
Internet startups. ``The more neurons you have per dollar the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``zero-gravity'' view of commerce in which ``you don't
want molecules,'' he said. ``Knowledge moves at the speed of light;
molecules move at 600 miles per hour with Fed Ex.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have a less exotic explanation for the
surge in interest in Internet businesses: the potential for
tremendous growth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, there were about 5 million Internet users, but the
number is expected to rise to 115 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for this latest run is growth,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Securities. ``And Wall
Street loves growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com would be a textbook example of the new Internet
businesses, if a textbook existed. It was founded almost four years
ago by Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban, old college friends who were
then in their mid-30s. When it went public last year, it had one of
the fastest opening-day sprints in Wall Street history, rising
nearly 250 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company broadcasts live speeches, conferences, television
events and even professional wrestling over the Internet. It has
250 employees who work out of an old warehouse in Dallas that it
rents for $4,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, almost inexplicably, shares of Broadcast.com rose 50
percent and the company ended the day with a value of $3.4 billion,
more than the value of Wendy's International, which has 150,000
employees and 5,391 restaurants around the country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. FOLLOWING SENTENCE SHOULD BE USED IF
</ANNOTATION>
GRAPHIC IS BEING USED.)
<P>
   Following is a comparison of Internet companies and more
traditional businesses with similar market values.

   WASHINGTON _ It may be the ultimate slap at the boys in suits
who have long dominated U.S. politics: the hottest electoral
commodities, as of last week at least, are best known for the men
they married, and their last tries for elective office were in
student government.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Hanford Dole commanded international attention when
she announced she was resigning as president of the American Red
Cross to ponder going after the Republican presidential nomination
next year. Hillary Rodham Clinton did not announce anything, and
there is no evidence that she will. But that has not tamped down a
persistent buzz in New York political circles _ one stoked happily
by the press _ that she might dive into the Democratic race to
succeed Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The boomlets for Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Clinton, both of whom were
at the top of Gallup Poll's survey of most admired women of 1998
(Mrs. Clinton placed first, followed by Oprah Winfrey and Mrs.
Dole), are surprising. Both women have formidable professional
accomplishments but are nonetheless most famous because of their
husbands. Mrs. Dole even overtook the early favorite, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, in a poll last week of Republican primary voters in
New Hampshire. (That may reflect little more than her name
recognition and the initial excitement over her announcement.)
</P>
<P>
   The enormous interest comes despite _ or maybe because of _ the
fact that their husbands have seen better days: President Clinton
faces an impeachment trial; former Sen. Bob Dole led his party to a
devastating defeat by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But their unusual circumstances have given both women rare
political appeal: While some ambitious, bright women threaten
voters, particularly men, Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Dole ease such
qualms because they are also viewed as loyal, traditional wives.
</P>
<P>
   Besides enduring the cascade of revelations about her husband's
affairs, Mrs. Clinton aggressively defended him. And Mrs. Dole did
for her husband at the 1996 Republican convention what he could not
do for himself: She waded into the audience and tried to rescue his
candidacy by articulating a passionate case for his election.
</P>
<P>
   The positive reaction may be the latest example of voters who _
after the yearlong Lewinsky drama _ have lost confidence in the
political structure and see women as representing different values.
That happened in 1992, when voters elected four women to the Senate
in part out of bitterness over the Clarence Thomas hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women are not Jesse Ventura,'' said Rachel Gorlin, a
Democratic strategist, referring to the professional wrestler who
was elected governor of Minnesota in November. ``They are very
tested. They are very established. But they are kind of a hybrid:
they represent values that are not the traditional back-room guy
chomping the cigar but are not completely outside of the political
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Dole are devout Methodists who are
admired for their devotion to the church. Yet they are also driven,
Ivy League-trained lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases, you're talking about women who rose
professionally because of who they were married to,'' said Ralph
Reed, a Republican strategist. ``In Elizabeth's case, when she was
named a Cabinet secretary, it didn't hurt that she was married to a
vice presidential candidate and a powerful senator. But what makes
these women figures of sympathy and desirable on a political level
is the perception that they are better politicians than their
husbands.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mrs. Clinton, at 51, is 11 years younger than Mrs. Dole,
she has forged a more traditional path. She followed Clinton to
Little Rock, where they reared their daughter. By contrast, Mrs.
Dole did not have children and by the time she married late in
life, she was nearly a decade into her climb up the governmental
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Clinton do not necessarily signal any trend
because they are not ordinary politicians. Although Democrats enjoy
an advantage over Republicans in wooing female voters, women do not
reflexively flock to the polls to vote for women.
</P>
<P>
   For example, former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, who made history as
the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984, did not do
particularly well among Democratic women last year when she lost
her party's nomination for U.S. senator from New York after a
lackluster campaign. And New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, a
Republican, drew fewer votes from women than did her male opponents
in 1997 and 1993. ``Christie Whitman's biggest problem is getting
women to vote for her,'' said Mike Murphy, an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Clinton have emerged as possible
potent antidotes to what ails their parties: Mrs. Clinton had
reignited the fears people have of liberal Democrats by championing
national health care, and because of the perception that she would
be a co-president. But her image as a compassionate figure who was
wronged by her husband has quieted those misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, increasingly, have suffered a reputation as being
dominated by males who are not interested in issues like education
and health care. Mrs. Dole is in a position to neutralize that
perception, and she would stand out in the sea of men seeking the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Yet timing is a factor: Before Ferraro's vice presidential
candidacy, most people probably would not have dared to advance a
Clinton or Dole candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see either Elizabeth Dole or Hillary Clinton springing
out of the head of Zeus,'' said Ruth Mandel, a political scientist
at Rutgers University. ``They emerged out of the last quarter of
the 20th century from a culture which makes it possible for people
to consider women as potential presidential candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that if they began running in earnest, their
prominence might magnify any blunders they make. And they could not
expect to be embraced automatically by women. Referring to Mrs.
Dole's opposition to abortion, Murphy said, ``The pro-choice women
will turn on her.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why it is far from assured that the names Dole and
Clinton will adorn bumper stickers again. Yet there is no question
that both women are drawn to political power. After starting a book
club in junior high school, Mrs. Dole writes, she took matters into
her own hands: ``I simply declared myself president.''

<P>
   Psychotherapy or pills? For years, mental health professionals
have differed over how best to treat people with disorders listed
in the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
</P>
<P>
   In the pet world, some veterinarians have found a niche treating
behavioral problems that can drive pet-owners, well, crazy. But
except for the occasional tranquilizer, animal mental-health
specialists have mostly employed a kind of psychotherapy _ behavior
modification _ to help pets deal with anxiety, rage, depression and
other problems that some veterinarians say affect animals as well
as humans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the Food and Drug Administration approved
two drugs commonly prescribed for human depressive and
nervous-system disorders as medications for dog mental-health
problems like separation anxiety (which causes some pooches to tear
up the furniture when their owners go out) and old dog syndrome
(which leads dogs to forget important things, like having been
housebroken).
</P>
<P>
   Given the money to be made on Americans' twin obsessions with
psychological advice and pets, it's only a matter of time before a
flood of books, television shows, radio programs and newspaper
columns feature pop psychiatrists whose specialty is putting Rover
on the couch or on Prozac. Here's how one column might look:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   My once playful, affectionate cat, Miss Whispers, has suddenly
stopped responding to me. She won't come to eat when I call her,
and refuses to play with her little toys or demonstrate affection.
All she does is lie on the couch. Please, would psychotherapy or
drugs help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Heartbroken in Hackensack
</P>
<P>
   Dear Heartbroken:
</P>
<P>
   Mental-healthwise, cats are tough nuts to crack. Perhaps Miss
Whispers is suffering from Oppositional Defiant Disorder, one
symptom of which the DSM lists thusly: ``Often actively defies or
refuses to comply with adult's requests or rules.'' You might
consider counseling, psychotropic medication and involuntary
commitment in a secure but cheerful facility.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   I recently went horseback riding for the first _ and last _
time. Obviously hoping to encourage other riders to ridicule me
behind my back, the stable manager put me on a bloated mare that
stopped abruptly every 30 feet or so, jerking its head down to
gorge itself on huge mouthfuls of grass, leaves and other debris.
The horse also chewed the tip of my sneaker. What's ailing her?
</P>
<P>
   _ Recovering in Rochester
</P>
<P>
   Dear Recovering:
</P>
<P>
   What I'm hearing here is a classic case of Binge Eating
Disorder, which the DSM says is characterized by ``eating, in a
discrete period of time, an amount of food that is definitely
larger than most people would eat in a similar period.''
</P>
<P>
   This disorder responds well to group therapy, but horses are
notoriously judgmental, and it may be that she just hated you.
</P>
<P>
   Hey Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   I got 40 acres here in God's country, and a couple of months ago
I caught my Rotweiler, Lt. Colonel Himmler, whimpering out by the
gun shed, where it had been chased by a chicken. This is the very
same dog I once seen chew the hind leg off a billy goat.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dog cries all the time, don't eat, and won't even growl
at the mailman, a uniformed federal employee. What should I do?
This is important. I'm going to be needing a combat-ready canine
come Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   _ Igor from Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Igor,
</P>
<P>
   Your dog may have a a combination of Dysthymic Disorder, (``low
self-esteem'' and ``feelings of hopelessness'') and Dissociative
Fugue (``confusion about personal identity'' and ``inability to
recall one's past''). Please do not contact me again.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   My once well-behaved pet monkey, Moonshine, has begun to scream
hysterically 24 hours a day. He demands constant attention and
praise and is always showing off. When I have people over he makes
a disgusting spectacle of himself with lewd behavior, if you know
what I mean. Is psychiatric intervention called for?
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael from Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Michael:
</P>
<P>
   Well, as the man on the radio used to say, Monkeys is the
cwaaaziest people. We're probably talking Hypomanic Episode
(``inflated self-esteem or grandiosity'' and an increase in
``psychomotor agitation''). There also may be a concurrent onset of
Exhibitionism, ``behaviors involving the exposure of one's genitals
to an unsuspecting stranger.'' Group therapy sometimes works, but
seldom with monkeys, as you can't get them to pay attention.
Electroshock is an option, though he won't be as frisky afterward.

   Psychotherapy or pills? For years, mental health professionals
have differed over how best to treat people with disorders listed
in the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
</P>
<P>
   In the pet world, some veterinarians have found a niche treating
behavioral problems that can drive pet-owners, well, crazy. But
except for the occasional tranquilizer, animal mental-health
specialists have mostly employed a kind of psychotherapy _ behavior
modification _ to help pets deal with anxiety, rage, depression and
other problems that some veterinarians say affect animals as well
as humans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, the Food and Drug Administration approved
two drugs commonly prescribed for human depressive and
nervous-system disorders as medications for dog mental-health
problems like separation anxiety (which causes some pooches to tear
up the furniture when their owners go out) and old dog syndrome
(which leads dogs to forget important things, like having been
housebroken).
</P>
<P>
   Given the money to be made on Americans' twin obsessions with
psychological advice and pets, it's only a matter of time before a
flood of books, television shows, radio programs and newspaper
columns feature pop psychiatrists whose specialty is putting Rover
on the couch or on Prozac. Here's how one column might look:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   My once playful, affectionate cat, Miss Whispers, has suddenly
stopped responding to me. She won't come to eat when I call her,
and refuses to play with her little toys or demonstrate affection.
All she does is lie on the couch. Please, would psychotherapy or
drugs help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Heartbroken in Hackensack
</P>
<P>
   Dear Heartbroken:
</P>
<P>
   Mental-healthwise, cats are tough nuts to crack. Perhaps Miss
Whispers is suffering from Oppositional Defiant Disorder, one
symptom of which the DSM lists thusly: ``Often actively defies or
refuses to comply with adult's requests or rules.'' You might
consider counseling, psychotropic medication and involuntary
commitment in a secure but cheerful facility.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   I recently went horseback riding for the first _ and last _
time. Obviously hoping to encourage other riders to ridicule me
behind my back, the stable manager put me on a bloated mare that
stopped abruptly every 30 feet or so, jerking its head down to
gorge itself on huge mouthfuls of grass, leaves and other debris.
The horse also chewed the tip of my sneaker. What's ailing her?
</P>
<P>
   _ Recovering in Rochester
</P>
<P>
   Dear Recovering:
</P>
<P>
   What I'm hearing here is a classic case of Binge Eating
Disorder, which the DSM says is characterized by ``eating, in a
discrete period of time, an amount of food that is definitely
larger than most people would eat in a similar period.''
</P>
<P>
   This disorder responds well to group therapy, but horses are
notoriously judgmental, and it may be that she just hated you.
</P>
<P>
   Hey Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   I got 40 acres here in God's country, and a couple of months ago
I caught my Rotweiler, Lt. Colonel Himmler, whimpering out by the
gun shed, where it had been chased by a chicken. This is the very
same dog I once seen chew the hind leg off a billy goat.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dog cries all the time, don't eat, and won't even growl
at the mailman, a uniformed federal employee. What should I do?
This is important. I'm going to be needing a combat-ready canine
come Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   _ Igor from Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Igor,
</P>
<P>
   Your dog may have a a combination of Dysthymic Disorder, (``low
self-esteem'' and ``feelings of hopelessness'') and Dissociative
Fugue (``confusion about personal identity'' and ``inability to
recall one's past''). Please do not contact me again.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Petshrink:
</P>
<P>
   My once well-behaved pet monkey, Moonshine, has begun to scream
hysterically 24 hours a day. He demands constant attention and
praise and is always showing off. When I have people over he makes
a disgusting spectacle of himself with lewd behavior, if you know
what I mean. Is psychiatric intervention called for?
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael from Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Michael:
</P>
<P>
   Well, as the man on the radio used to say, Monkeys is the
cwaaaziest people. We're probably talking Hypomanic Episode
(``inflated self-esteem or grandiosity'' and an increase in
``psychomotor agitation''). There also may be a concurrent onset of
Exhibitionism, ``behaviors involving the exposure of one's genitals
to an unsuspecting stranger.'' Group therapy sometimes works, but
seldom with monkeys, as you can't get them to pay attention.
Electroshock is an option, though he won't be as frisky afterward.

<TEXT>
<P>
   They have a weighty title _ anchor _ but an evanescent legacy.
Their faces are etched into the public eye by weightless electrons
30 times a second, but after 1,800 seconds, the music swells, the
screen changes to ``Jeopardy'' and they are gone until the next
evening, the next bulletin, the next interruption of that regularly
scheduled program.
</P>
<P>
   But where there is ink, there is permanence, and it is not
difficult to understand why the nation's television news anchors
are increasingly drawn across the boundary between media to the
solid ground of books on paper. Both Tom Brokaw of NBC and Peter
Jennings of ABC have books on the best-seller list (in fact, they
are currently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, on The New York Times
nonfiction list), and Dan Rather of CBS, who has written or edited
five books, has two more scheduled to come out in the next year or
so.
</P>
<P>
   The anchors are not shy about acknowledging their envy for the
one comfort of writers everywhere: the constancy of the written
word, the lasting victory of the printed page over videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always frustrated by the abbreviated form we have,''
said Brokaw, author of ``The Greatest Generation'' (Random House),
a 352-page account of the World War II years. ``You spend a day on
a distinguished piece of work, and as the joke goes, it all goes
out to Venus at the end of the day. But after the book came out, I
had dinner with Jim Lehrer, who said to me, `Brokaw, you know, your
great-grandchildren won't see you on TV, but they'll read this
book.' '' (Lehrer, of the PBS NewsHour, has written 11 books.)
</P>
<P>
   Most older television journalists got their start in print and
never really lost the sense that it is first among equals as a
communications medium, the classic sense of pencil envy that
Jennings says is rapidly disappearing among younger workers who
came straight to video, as he did. Rather unabashedly admits that
over a late-night glass of wine, there is nothing quite so
satisfying as seeing one's name on the spine of a hard-cover book
on a well-populated shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound corny, but I like the writer's life, the way a
book looks and feels,'' he said. ``When you're thinking about your
life's dreams and trying to get past the ephemeral, writing a book
provides a unique satisfaction.'' Rather is completing a collection
of essays, ``Deadlines and Datelines,'' for publication by Morrow
this spring, and is working on a documentary film for PBS about his
native Texas that will also be spun off into a book.
</P>
<P>
   But even beyond the physical pleasure and vague sense of
immortality, there is also a sense that books confer a legitimacy
on a profession often derided for its absence of seriousness. ``All
these guys think of themselves primarily as journalists, and they
want to be recognized as more than just television personalities,''
said Peter Osnos, the publisher of Public Affairs books, who has
helped transform Sam Donaldson, Morley Safer, Ted Koppel and others
into authors. ``They don't need to cash in, but they like having
people acknowledge them as writers.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why their topics are so sweeping: centuries,
generations, epochs instead of the seconds usually used to measure
their work. Even Rather edited a book on the early years of the
20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings' book, written with Todd Brewster, was called ``The
Century'' (Doubleday). ``It was hard, because I'm used to writing
for sound,'' Jennings said. ``But the material was so broad it was
inescapable. The calendar told us to do it.''

 &HT;    Optimizing a computer can elevate gaming to the surreal
 &HT;    EDs: This is the first in a regular series of columns for
advanced computer users.
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'll never forget the time I saw the light _ literally _ inside
a dungeon.
</P>
<P>
   I had discovered a keyboard command on a Dungeon Keeper chat
board; so I executed it, while possessing an imp. Suddenly, my
on-screen vision (through the imp's eyes, of course) sharpened, and
everything became crystal clear and very detailed, from the flames
in the fire to the shadowy creatures scurrying through darkened
passages.
</P>
<P>
   The command had kicked Dungeon Keeper into high-resolution mode,
and even with my little 2-megabyte video card it was one of those,
ahem, eye-opening moments that make you sit up straight in your
chair.
</P>
<P>
   The lush 3-D graphics, sound effects, music and speedy game
engines today yield incredible results on several levels. They're a
blast on an older machine, like my Pentium 166 with 2Mb of video
memory. But they can also take advantage of current high-speed CPUs
and a new graphics bus to blow you right out of your chair.
</P>
<P>
   From dad's flight simulator to junior's death match in ``Quake
II,'' it's a simple matter to optimize the family PC to provide a
surreal gaming experience.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the basics, and we encourage further exploration on the
Web and in the newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   There are minor modifications you can make regarding sound, like
adding a subwoofer system or using Creative Labs' Sound Blaster
live or a few more speakers for surround sound. And, of course,
there's a slew of joysticks and steering wheels and USB hubs for
dual play.
</P>
<P>
   But the real meat and potatoes of gaming (and a primary source
of confusion) are good 3-D accelerated graphics.
</P>
<P>
   If you're about to buy a new PC, get one with an AGP bus
(accelerated graphics port) and at least 8Mb of video memory. AGP
is the new graphics bus standard _ which can be 4X as fast as PCI _
and there are a wide range of accelerator cards from which to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   If you just got a new PC that doesn't have AGP, or if you're
upgrading an older Pentium machine, like a 166, it's only a problem
if you're one of those benchmark types who help keep the industry
honest. There are also plenty of good 3-D accelerators on PCI bus
cards you can use.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if you want to upgrade to AGP, you'll have to get
a new motherboard with an AGP slot on it.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also have to take into consideration the RAM on your
video card. One important thing to know is it deals with the number
of colors you can use at high resolution. For example, an 8Mb card
will allow 24-bit 3-D color at resolutions up to 1,200x1,600, but
you'd want at least a 19-inch monitor to get good results.
</P>
<P>
   A brief note about monitors: You'll want at least a 75-MHz
refresh rate.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of types of video memory available for the
various cards. SGRAM is the fastest right now, but the PCI bus
speed doesn't take full advantage of it. MDRAM, WRAM and VRAM are
the next best choices, EDO RAM is a last resort, and don't even
think about using DRAM for your gaming video board.
</P>
<P>
   Another point of confusion is the API _ application programming
interface _ that your video card supports. Game makers use three
primary ones: Microsoft's Direct3D, OpenGL and GLide. Many new 3-D
cards support all three APIs and cost anywhere from $69 to $199.
</P>
<P>
   Many new 3-D cards now also handle 2-D _ for non-3D stuff, like
DOS and Windows. If you get one that doesn't, you'll need an
available PCI slot, and it will come with a cable to connect it
with the 2-D card you're already using. The Voodoo2 chipset, by
3Dfx, is the current rage of the high-speed gaming community, which
also saw versions of Voodoo3 at Comdex '98. But there are plenty of
gamers who also rave about nVIDIA's Riva, ATI's Rage 128, Number
Nine's Revolution IV and S3's Savage3 cards.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these will be pretty astounding _ no matter whether
you're using PCI or AGP _ especially if you are upgrading from a
1Mb or 2Mb card.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to explore high-end visuals even deeper and
you're flush with PCI slots, you can investigate SLI (Scan Line
Interleaving). That's the still somewhat experimental trick of
connecting two 3-D cards with a cable and theoretically doubling
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think I'll stay in the dungeon until they finish
working it out.

   For years, language purists have rent their garments over the
use of the word hopefully to mean ``I hope,'' as in, ``Hopefully,
that will never happen again.'' Such use, they assert, arose in the
rule-smashing 1960s. For many, it was and remains a sign of the
decline of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes Fred Shapiro, associate librarian at Yale Law
School, using a powerful new computer tool called JSTOR that
permits detailed searches of thousands of issues of scholarly
journals back to the 19th century. And, lo and behold, the use in
formal English of hopefully to modify a whole sentence goes back
easily to the 1930s. He has found dozens of examples before 1960,
including an 1851 citation that starts, ``Hopefully, not to say,
certainly, in that time . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's findings will appear in a forthcoming issue of the
journal ``American Speech.'' He has also uncovered a 1912 use of
``double standard'' referring to the gap between the treatment of
men and women 39 years before the Oxford English Dictionary's first
citation of it; a 1931 example of ``Native American'' for American
Indian, 43 years ahead of Oxford's first example, and a 1914 use of
``solar energy,'' 58 years earlier than any other known use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of language is being rewritten because of these
electronic tools,'' said Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   JSTOR, which is a nonprofit project to put online forgotten and
inaccessible scholarly journals, is likely to cause a great deal of
intellectual history to be revised. For the first time, biologists,
economists and mathematicians can trace the development of a
question over the last century.
</P>
<P>
   And as they do their research, they are discovering not only new
facts but something else: humility. Many new ideas are just old,
forgotten ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathematics has a long shelf life and there are important
ideas to be picked up from papers of 100 years ago,'' said Cathleen
Synge Morawetz, a professor emerita of mathematics at New York
University and a recent winner of the National Medal of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Morawetz said an intriguing possibility is that
forgotten computational problems abandoned decades ago because the
technology was unavailable can now be solved. ``This opens up huge
possibilities as people get used to the idea of accessing old
journals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   JSTOR, an acronym for ``journal storage,'' is the creation of
William Bowen, president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Bowen,
a former president of Princeton University, thought of the idea
after a 1992 board meeting at Denison University in Ohio, where he
is a trustee and alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting it was announced that the university wanted to
build a new library wing. When Bowen asked what was taking up so
much shelf space, it turned out to be mostly back copies of
scholarly journals. He suggested looking into ways to digitalize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Denison never got its library wing, but the world got JSTOR.
</P>
<P>
   The Mellon Foundation has put up about $5 million for JSTOR,
which has been in operation for more than a year. The computer data
base contains many of the issues of 67 scholarly journals in a wide
range of fields _ from mathematics to the social sciences. All back
issues of 100 journals are expected to be online by the end of this
year. JSTOR clients are mostly American university libraries, and
it is starting to sign up subscribers overseas. So far,
subscriptions are unavailable for individuals and commercial
enterprises, but the hope is to make JSTOR self-sufficient. The Web
site is www.jstor.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, people asked what the point of it all is since
nobody ever searches for 30-year-old articles,'' recalled Kevin
Guthrie, president of JSTOR, which is based in New York City. ``But
it turned out that nobody was using older literature because it was
impossible to get to and search. You had to stumble on something or
it had to be cited by someone else. Now you can ask a question and
search through the journals.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliana Mulroy, professor of biology at Denison, said she has
used the search tool to trace cross-disciplinary views of the Dust
Bowl that were a precursor to the current debate over global
warming. In the past, such research would have been enormously
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   What has struck Professor Mulroy is the way JSTOR will change
the class boundaries within academia. ``I don't have to be at
Harvard or Berkeley to have access to a first-class library
anymore,'' she said. ``I can do this research sitting in my
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said he has been excited to hear from small colleges in
the Appalachian mountains and from housebound scholars using JSTOR.
</P>
<P>
   Some uses for the new files have been unexpected, Guthrie says.
The William and Mary Quarterly was expected to yield little from
its turn-of-the-century volumes, which were not research oriented
at the time. But those issues are filled with family names and
rosters of families' comings and goings in the early colonial
period, and genealogists have found them a rich vein.
</P>
<P>
   Linguists say digital libraries like JSTOR will reduce
dependence on searching through libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have people sitting around reading early books,''
said John Simpson, chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
``But digital data bases like JSTOR are doing a lot to fill in the
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed of the new findings on ``hopefully,'' Sol Steinmetz,
former editorial director of the Random House Reference and
Information Division, said he was delighted. ``Even though there
are plenty of sentence adverbs, like frankly,'' he said, ``for some
reason people grabbed onto hopefully and wouldn't accept it. It's a
lot of nonsense. I'm sure people will be very surprised by what is
turning up. I consider it a pleasant shock.''

 &HT;    Jury selection resumes in retrial of Florida slaying suspect
 &HT;    By Christine Stapleton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Four days after Duane Owen arrived on
Death Row in 1986 he wrote a polite ``to-whom-this-may-concern''
letter to police in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am corresponding at this time in regards to some murders
that I committed in your area,'' Owen wrote to the Lakewood, Colo.
police department. ``I am an honest person,'' he continued, saying
that he wanted to clear his past before he was executed.
</P>
<P>
   Owen, 37, had a history of teasing police about his crimes, and
Colorado police knew it. Two years earlier, he had played a
demented game of cat and mouse with detectives from Delray Beach
and Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roses are red, you pigs are blue, count up your victims, there
will be quite a few,'' Owen said during 24 hours of videotaped
interviews with detectives, during which he confessed to murdering
and raping a Delray Beach babysitter and a Boca Raton mother.
``Catch me if you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen's interviews with police have become the centerpiece of his
upcoming retrial for the 1984 murder of Karen Slattery, a
14-year-old Delray Beach babysitter. The Florida Supreme Court
reviewed the videotaped interviews in 1990 and concluded that Owen,
who was sentenced to death for Slattery's rape and murder, should
get a new trial because police violated his Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   During exhaustive questioning by detectives, Owen _ who did not
have a lawyer present _ twice said that he didn't think he should
answer questions. Police didn't follow up on his comments and
continued with the interrogation. Owen ultimately confessed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court in a later case said police could
continue questioning suspects if they make ``equivocal or
ambiguous'' requests to have an attorney present or to remain
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Harold Cohen, who is presiding over Owen's
retrial, has ruled that jurors should hear and see all of Owen's
statement to detectives regarding the Slattery murder. Lawyers
began picking the jury last week and will resume with jury
selection this week.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, once it's picked, will not learn about Owen's attempts
to contact Colorado police. Yet the letters and interviews _ which
have become public during the retrial _ offer more insight into
Owen's mind. Owen's attorney, Carey Haughout, now claims Owen was
insane when he attacked Slattery.
</P>
<P>
   When he was arrested in 1984 and charged with the murders of
Slattery and Georgianna Worden, a 38-year-old Boca Raton mother,
Owen became the focus of a massive media blitz. His conviction and
death sentence for Worden's murder still stand, although Owen has
one more appeal pending.
</P>
<P>
   Through two trials and an escape attempt, Owen made headlines.
He occasionally called the press room at the courthouse and
critiqued articles with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   There was no limelight on Death Row. His letters to police in
Colorado, however, brought Owen instant attention. Still, Colorado
police were skeptical. They had flown to West Palm Beach and
interviewed Owen in jail in 1984. Teresa Sue Knuth, 22, had
disappeared in Summit County about the same time Owen had lived
there and police thought they had to check out his murder claims.
</P>
<P>
   Their 1984 interview with Owen was ``cordial'' but ``no
information was developed to establish (Owen) as a primary suspect
in any offense within the state of Colorado,'' the Lakewood, Colo.,
police chief wrote.
</P>
<P>
   So after receiving Owen's 1986 letter, Colorado detectives told
Owen they wanted details this time: ``How the victims were killed
and weapons used? . . . were the victims' bodies left where they
were killed or were they removed to another area? . . . any items
stolen from your victims or removed from their bodies?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try and describe the victims,'' Owen responded. ``The
names will be hard because of the time lapse, but here goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Victim one was a ``hooker.'' He said he strangled her, then took
her panties. Victim two was beaten and buried near a campground
where Owen lived near Breckenridge. Owen included a map detailing
where he said he had buried her. Victim three was stabbed and left
on a road. Owen took her bikini bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Owen replied, he had ``stabbed, strangled and
beaten,'' nine females between the ages of 12 and 25 from Grand
Junction to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please send someone to visit me so that I may clear my horrid
past,'' Owen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, 1986, Detective Richard Eaton of the Summit County,
Colo. Sheriff's Office visited the Florida State Prison. Owen told
Eaton he had picked up a young woman hitchhiking and stabbed her
with a bayonet when she refused his sexual advances. Using
topographical maps, Owen showed Eaton where he buried the woman's
body.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton went back to Colorado and searched a square mile area with
a metal detector. He found nothing. Eaton and other detectives
videotaped the area and returned to Florida to show the tape to
Owen. Owen pinpointed the spot where he said he had left his car
and described the victim's clothing, which matched the clothes
Knuth was last seen wearing.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives narrowed the search area to 50 square yards and
dug, by hand, looking for the grave. And still found nothing. More
videos and aerial photographs were sent to Owen in July 1986. Owen
said the area looked familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives rented a backhoe and, with the help of the U.S.
Forestry Service, excavated more sites. They found no bodies. Owen
wanted to go to Colorado to show detectives the murder site.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, in August 1986, Owen clammed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time I must inform you that upon my attorney's
request, I no can longer talk,'' Owen wrote. ``I so regret this.
Until further contact by me, please take care.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of Teresa Knuth remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still can't completely eliminate him as a suspect,'' Eaton
said. ``But he's not any more insane than Bundy was.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Eaton wonders if Owen wasn't just trying to get
off Death Row for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on Death Row with Bundy and the idea of getting little
trips, maybe that's where it came from,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview last year Owen said he was lying about
the Colorado murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just stupidity,'' Owen said about his letters to
Colorado police. ``I was just mad and sent them out on a wild goose
chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen also said he was angry at Delray Beach and Boca Raton
detectives, whom he felt had violated his rights and made false
promises to keep him talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have done some wrong in my day,'' Owen said, ``but I
think they violated my rights.

FIXING MEDICARE: LIGHT AT A TUNNEL'S END
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A tense exchange last week between two liberal
members of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of
Medicare moved the group toward a dramatic agreement. The members
agreed to develop a plan to radically revamp Medicare by giving its
beneficiaries a fixed sum of money to buy private or public
insurance. In short, the use of vouchers _ something liberals have
shunned in education _ might be good for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vladeck, a former administrator of Medicare, who is a
staunch defender of the basic fee-for-service plan, began the
debate by proposing that Medicare officials get stronger powers to
restrict some medical practices, to negotiate fees and to favor
participation by some physicians over others.
</P>
<P>
   A dissenting member, Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University
professor, argued that Vladeck's proposals might result in
excessive governmental control. He could support them only if
Medicare moved to a system of competing public and private health
plans that would give the beneficiaries attractive ways to opt out
of the traditional government program. .
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck eventually chose Altman's competitive model, which put
him in temporary alliance with at least 10 other commissioners; 11
votes from among the commission's 17 members are needed to forward
a recommendation to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus may be more illusory than real. Much more has
to be agreed on before Vladeck, Altman and other Democratic
appointees will agree on a voucher plan to send to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, primarily a fee-for-service health plan serving about
40 million elderly, pays nearly any bill submitted by any doctor on
behalf of any enrollee. There is little supervision of physician
care. The system excludes prescription drugs and other benefits
routinely provided by private insurance plans but does not hold
down costs. As the baby boomers begin to retire, Medicare costs are
expected to soar to about 5 percent of aggregate income by 2020
from about 2.5 percent today
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to change all that are eight Republican appointees of the
advisory commission along with its chairman, Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. They envision Medicare as a
health care system similar to the one covering federal employees,
who can choose from many insurance plans. Under one version, the
beneficiaries would in effect receive a voucher enabling them to
enroll in either the traditional government plan or in a private
managed-care plan. Each plan would offer an identical package of
core benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky step is assigning a dollar value to the voucher. Many
economists favor plans setting their own premiums. Then the
government would pay a certain amount, say, 75 percent of the cost
of the average plan. The beneficiaries would pay the remaining 25
percent, receiving rebates if they chose inexpensive plans. Under
some versions, the government would provide subsidies for
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   This voucher system _ which proponents call premium support _ is
designed to encourage innovation and to pressure plans to keep
their premiums low. Proponents point out that this plan exposes the
beneficiaries to little risk because it ties the dollar value of
the voucher to the premiums that health plans actually charge in
the market. That way, the voucher will not fall below the amount
that families need to buy the government-mandated benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck and some of the other Democratic appointees disagree.
They are skeptical that private plans will be affordable to
moderate income families or that the government can adequately
supervise the market.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Steelman, a Republican appointee, says that the
commission will have to save enough money to cover the future
deficit in the current program and save more money to pay for any
new benefits that the commission adds. Democratic appointees worry
that the savings cannot be achieved without depriving the
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have so far refused to consider raising taxes to
pay for any new benefits. Ms. Steelman cites the ugly backlash in
1989 after Congress taxed every beneficiary in order to add
benefits that many elderly already received from their former
employers. The uproar forced Congress to repeal the new benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats say the only way to make adequate health
benefits universal is to make them mandatory. Vladeck and Altman
are unlikely to approve a voucher plan that lacks sufficient
revenues for drugs and other essentials and fails to cover
low-income families. They lean toward raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other potential sources of dispute. Should the
commission close some of the future deficit by raising the age of
eligibility? And how will it encourage private plans to cater to
AIDS patients and others requiring expensive care? So what seemed
like an easy consensus last week could quickly break down. The
commission may wind up agreeing only to small-bore fixes that would
keep the program solvent for a few more years. And even if it does
propose a radical overhaul, Congress might not go along.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something of potential importance occurred last week.
Vladeck and other defenders of the current system know they cannot
make traditional Medicare work well unless Congress gives it the
power so long withheld. But, Altman says, the road to the best
fee-for-service plan possible runs right through the voucher
system.

members of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of
Medicare moved the group toward a dramatic agreement. The members
agreed to develop a plan to radically revamp Medicare by giving its
beneficiaries a fixed sum of money to buy private or public
insurance. In short, the use of vouchers _ something liberals have
shunned in education _ might be good for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vladeck, a former administrator of Medicare, who is a
staunch defender of the basic fee-for-service plan, began the
debate by proposing that Medicare officials get stronger powers to
restrict some medical practices, to negotiate fees and to favor
participation by some physicians over others.
</P>
<P>
   A dissenting member, Stuart Altman, a Brandeis University
professor, argued that Vladeck's proposals might result in
excessive governmental control. He could support them only if
Medicare moved to a system of competing public and private health
plans that would give the beneficiaries attractive ways to opt out
of the traditional government program. .
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck eventually chose Altman's competitive model, which put
him in temporary alliance with at least 10 other commissioners; 11
votes from among the commission's 17 members are needed to forward
a recommendation to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus may be more illusory than real. Much more has
to be agreed on before Vladeck, Altman and other Democratic
appointees will agree on a voucher plan to send to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, primarily a fee-for-service health plan serving about
40 million elderly, pays nearly any bill submitted by any doctor on
behalf of any enrollee. There is little supervision of physician
care. The system excludes prescription drugs and other benefits
routinely provided by private insurance plans but does not hold
down costs. As the baby boomers begin to retire, Medicare costs are
expected to soar to about 5 percent of aggregate income by 2020
from about 2.5 percent today
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to change all that are eight Republican appointees of the
advisory commission along with its chairman, Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. They envision Medicare as a
health care system similar to the one covering federal employees,
who can choose from many insurance plans. Under one version, the
beneficiaries would in effect receive a voucher enabling them to
enroll in either the traditional government plan or in a private
managed-care plan. Each plan would offer an identical package of
core benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The tricky step is assigning a dollar value to the voucher. Many
economists favor plans setting their own premiums. Then the
government would pay a certain amount, say, 75 percent of the cost
of the average plan. The beneficiaries would pay the remaining 25
percent, receiving rebates if they chose inexpensive plans. Under
some versions, the government would provide subsidies for
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   This voucher system _ which proponents call premium support _ is
designed to encourage innovation and to pressure plans to keep
their premiums low. Proponents point out that this plan exposes the
beneficiaries to little risk because it ties the dollar value of
the voucher to the premiums that health plans actually charge in
the market. That way, the voucher will not fall below the amount
that families need to buy the government-mandated benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck and some of the other Democratic appointees disagree.
They are skeptical that private plans will be affordable to
moderate income families or that the government can adequately
supervise the market.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Steelman, a Republican appointee, says that the
commission will have to save enough money to cover the future
deficit in the current program and save more money to pay for any
new benefits that the commission adds. Democratic appointees worry
that the savings cannot be achieved without depriving the
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have so far refused to consider raising taxes to
pay for any new benefits. Ms. Steelman cites the ugly backlash in
1989 after Congress taxed every beneficiary in order to add
benefits that many elderly already received from their former
employers. The uproar forced Congress to repeal the new benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats say the only way to make adequate health
benefits universal is to make them mandatory. Vladeck and Altman
are unlikely to approve a voucher plan that lacks sufficient
revenues for drugs and other essentials and fails to cover
low-income families. They lean toward raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other potential sources of dispute. Should the
commission close some of the future deficit by raising the age of
eligibility? And how will it encourage private plans to cater to
AIDS patients and others requiring expensive care? So what seemed
like an easy consensus last week could quickly break down. The
commission may wind up agreeing only to small-bore fixes that would
keep the program solvent for a few more years. And even if it does
propose a radical overhaul, Congress might not go along.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something of potential importance occurred last week.
Vladeck and other defenders of the current system know they cannot
make traditional Medicare work well unless Congress gives it the
power so long withheld. But, Altman says, the road to the best
fee-for-service plan possible runs right through the voucher
system.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the old days, Russians traveling abroad were often _
and often rightly _ suspected of being KGB agents. Now they are
more likely to be suspected of belonging to something called the
Russian mafia _ a nebulous term that has taken on real meaning in
Budapest, Geneva, Brooklyn, Los Angeles and anywhere else where
Russia's brazen criminal class has managed to set up branch
offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the term ``mafia'' _ an Italian word _ is something of a
misnomer in Russia's freewheeling criminal world. That is one of
the reasons why Sergei Mikhailov was recently set free by a court
in Geneva after being exonerated, in a 10-day trial, of charges
that he is the boss of the largest and most powerful gang in Russia
today.
</P>
<P>
   According to news accounts, the mountain of evidence presented
against Mikhailov, 40, did little more than prove that he is, as he
put it, ``very, very rich,'' and that he has on occasion hung out
with some very unpleasant people connected to Russian gang
activity.
</P>
<P>
   If he were an Italian being tried in Italy, he might well have
been found guilty under a 1982 law that makes ``mafia association''
a criminal offense. With laws like these, Italy's war against
organized crime has scored major victories in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But for such a law to work against a Russian (assuming that it
would ever be enforced), the first task would be to define the word
``mafia.'' While in Italy the word signifies discreet criminal
organizations with strict hierarchical structures, in Russia it has
come to mean much more. In Russia, it embraces the noxious blend of
crime, politics and business that has engulfed Russia since the
lifting of Communist controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is in the definition,'' said Pino Arlacchi, an
expert on the Italian mafia and a former Italian senator who heads
the United Nations' Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention.
``When you go to court, you have to be able to define what the
mafia is. In Italy, we discovered that there was a formal
structure, with a very precise division of roles, and formal system
for joining. In Russia, you don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, purists argue that the word ``mafia'' applies only to
the Cosa Nostra, the tightly run Sicilian organization that has
traditionally been the country's most powerful and brutal criminal
group. In the 1980s, when hundreds of Sicilian mafiosi were put on
trial and convicted, the Cosa Nostra's dominant Corleone clan
lashed out with a campaign of terror that culminated in the
assassination in 1992 of Giovanni Falcone, Sicily's top prosecutor.
Today all but one of the top leaders of the Cosa Nostra _ members
of its ``cupola'' or board of directors _ are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of Italy's other regional crime groups, the Camorra in Naples is
the most anarchic, a loose band of gangs whose penetration into
local society has been more difficult to root out. According to
Arlaachi, Russian organized crime is closer in kind to the
Neapolitan version, although even in Naples, he conceded, the
Neapolitans abide by rules that the Russians routinely ignore.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlaachi's view, only 10 percent to 20 percent of Russian
crime can be attributed to organized crime, in the mafia sense of
the word. ``Most of these groups have proliferated very quickly,
taking advantage of the weakening of the state,'' he said. ``They
are not concerned about a high level of organization. They are too
busy exploiting the opportunities they have in front of them. They
use violence in ways that to a Sicilian mafioso would be
inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Russians and foreigners who do business here, the
collusion between criminals and bureaucrats, between gunrunners and
bankers, between policemen and thieves is so widespread and runs so
deep that untangling the links is now virtually impossible, not to
mention dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The intermingling of legal and illegal business dates back to
the late 1980s, when cooperatives were first allowed to creep
through the cracks in the state-controlled economy, before a legal
framework was ready to promote and protect private enterprise.
Rackets soon sprang up in the cooperatives' shadow, offering both
protection and a method of settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
   As business became more sophisticated, criminal gangs followed
suit. By the early 1990s, small businesses whose bank accounts had
grown to critical levels were likely to get a visit by men who,
tipped off by their agents inside the banking system, would offer
their protective services in return for a share of profit, or
alternatively a loan on terms that were hard to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   By its very essence, the Russian version of the mafia defies the
Italian definition of a secret society, which until recently
protected itself by a wall of silence. In Russia, there is no oath
of silence, or ``omerta,'' as the Sicilians call it. Instead, crime
groups have an open-door policy that over the last 10 years has
been wide enough to let in a large swath of society, willingly and
unwillingly, from policemen to bankers, from politicians to
industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian criminal world has come a long way from the
now-legendary days of the ``thieves in law,'' a peculiar term given
to criminals who during their long stints in Soviet prisons were
crowned by their peers as the ultimate arbiters of criminal
disputes. Such men still exist but their authority has been
undermined by a de facto legitimization of crime that started with
run-of-the-mill racketeering, gambling and prostitution, and
gradually climbed up through the ranks of government.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Mikhailov, who 15 years ago was a waiter at a
Moscow hotel. Sent to prison in 1984 for insurance fraud (he stole
his own motorcycle), he made the contacts that, according to police
and press reports, were to lay the groundwork for the rest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   After prison, he set up a local sports organization and was
allowed to travel abroad in 1986, despite Soviet-era controls
barring most Russians from leaving the country. He was arrested
twice again _ once for racketeering, another time for the murder of
a casino owner _ but was not convicted.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest in Switzerland in 1996, Mikhailov was
an international operator with an empire that was said to include a
hotel in Budapest, a banana-exporting business in Costa Rica and
interests in Israel, Belgium and across the former Soviet Union.
Witnesses at the trial testified that his arrest broke up
negotiations on two contracts totaling $350 million, one involving
the laying of a new sewage system in Moscow, the other the
construction of a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a former waiter become a multi-billionaire, with a
home in Switzerland, a Costa Rican diplomatic passport, and the
kind of insider political contacts that can make or break a
business in Russia?
</P>
<P>
   On his arrival in Moscow before a bank of television cameras,
Mikhailov had an answer. Flashing a V-for-victory sign, he told
reporters that his exoneration by the Swiss was proof not only that
``Russians are not necessarily criminals,'' but that ``they can be
businessmen who contribute to the development of the economy of
Russia.''

   The farm life is a life of struggle.
</P>
<P>
   To make a profit, farmers must overcome weather, pests,
temperamental markets and intense competition. Black farmers
maintain that they have had to battle an additional obstacle in
recent decades _ racism _ and now the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has acknowledged that complaint. It settled a
class-action lawsuit filed by black farmers who maintained that
department officials discriminated in the processing of federal
farm loans.
</P>
<P>
   While not admitting bias, the department offered to pay $50,000
to black farmers claiming discrimination and to forgive their
outstanding federal debt. Noting that only 1 percent of today's
farmers are black, down from 14 percent in 1920, many black farmers
said the settlement came far too late.

   U.S. Admits Using Spies In Arms Inspection Team
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officers
worked undercover on teams of United Nations Special Commission
inspectors ferreting out secret Iraqi weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   They said U.S. intelligence agencies provided
electronic-eavesdropping equipment and secret information to the
special commission.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, they said, the United States received information on
Iraqi weapons programs that the inspectors uncovered. Iraq has long
accused the commission of being riddled with ``American spies and
agents.''

   Ed, Formerly Known As Prince, to Wed
</P>
<P>
   The last child of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, Prince Edward, 34,
has decided to marry his longtime girlfriend, Sophie Rhys-Jones,
33, this summer, and the public well-wishing at the engagement
announcement was mixed with expressions of anxiety over whether he
could do better than his three siblings, all of whose youthful
marriages ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Things are promisingly different this time. The couple has been
together for five years, they are not in their 20s, they both have
jobs, and they shun publicity.
</P>
<P>
   She runs her own public-relations firm in London, and he is a
film producer. He may be her prince, but he prefers to be known as
Edward Windsor.

   Hello. Anyone Alive Here?
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for extraterrestrial life picked up speed as NASA
launched the second of two new spacecraft toward Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The pair are part of a fleet of more than a dozen probes that
over 16 years are to help the agency answer the Martian riddle once
and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Mars Climate Orbiter was launched from Florida on Dec. 11, now
joined by Mars Polar Lander. The latter craft is to look deep
beneath the Martian surface in search of water, which is considered
the key ingredient for life.
</P>
<P>
   The new lander also carries a tiny microphone, paid for by the
Planetary Society, a private group in Pasadena, Calif., that backs
space exploration. The experiment's goal is to beam back sounds of
winds, lightning and any aliens that happen to amble by, though
that is considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave of craft left for Mars in 1996 and the series, if
money holds up, is to continue at least through 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is to culminate in the return to Earth of rocks from
Mars that will be examined for signs of microscopic life, either
fossil or extant.

   Jesse Becomes The Body Politic
</P>
<P>
   So he didn't begin his inauguration ceremony by rappelling into
the Capitol from a helicopter. The mere fact that Jesse ``the
Body'' Ventura became governor of Minnesota was enough of a
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   The former professional wrestler, elected on the Reform Party
ticket in a stunning upset of the two major parties, had already
demonstrated his flair for the unconventional _ licensing Jesse
Ventura action figures and T-shirts to replenish his campaign
treasury, giving few hints of his policies and suggesting that his
wife, Terry, merits a state salary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ventura, for her part, wasn't asking for compensation; she
was expressing shell shock about the whole first lady gig. ``The
last time I gave a speech I was at my sister's wedding,'' she said.
``I was the maid of honor and I said: `Congratulations. Have a
great life.' ''

   A Small Break For Black Farmers
</P>
<P>
   The farm life is a life of struggle.
</P>
<P>
   To make a profit, farmers must overcome weather, pests,
temperamental markets and intense competition. Black farmers
maintain that they have had to battle an additional obstacle in
recent decades _ racism _ and now the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has acknowledged that complaint. It settled a
class-action lawsuit filed by black farmers who maintained that
department officials discriminated in the processing of federal
farm loans.
</P>
<P>
   While not admitting bias, the department offered to pay $50,000
to black farmers claiming discrimination and to forgive their
outstanding federal debt. Noting that only 1 percent of today's
farmers are black, down from 14 percent in 1920, many black farmers
said the settlement came far too late.

   A Tiny Opening to Cuba With Little Political Risk
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration took steps to allow more U.S. money,
air planes, food and mail flow into Cuba, with an eye toward the
day when Fidel Castro no longer rules the isolated island. But the
White House, which is wary of the political power of anti-Castro
Cuban-Americans, rejected calls for creating a national commission
that would study the 37-year-old American economic embargo that has
stifled Cuba's economy.

   A British Scandal Claims Another Victim
</P>
<P>
   A third official has fallen from the British government of Prime
Minister Tony Blair, which came into office 20 months ago pledging
an end to the kind of behavior that led 12 ministers in the
previous Conservative government of John Major to depart in
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting just before Christmas were Paymaster General Geoffrey
Robinson, 60, a millionaire industrialist and politician who had
given Trade and Industry Minister Peter Mandelson, 45, a $620,000
home loan, and Mandelson, Blair's closest confidant, who kept the
loan a secret even after Robinson's financial affairs came under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was Charlie Whelan, the press secretary to
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, the second most powerful
man in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Whelan's crime was to have conducted a negative campaign against
Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
   It was viewed as disruptive to the image-conscious government's
mission to portray itself as unified.

   A Plan for Tax Relief
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed a program of $6 billion in tax
credits and other assistance to people providing long-term care for
relatives with chronic illnesses and disabilities. The proposal
amounts to a tax cut for the middle class. People with relatively
high incomes would be ineligible, as would people with incomes so
low that they do not have to pay income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Deets, executive director of the American Association of
Retired Persons, said the tax credit of $1,000 a year would provide
``long-overdue recognition'' to families caring for relatives.

   When you reach the fork in the road, take it, Yogi Berra is said
to have once told a friend who was coming to visit. Last week, when
George Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees' principal owner, made
his way to Berra's home turf to ask that they bury their 14-year
feud, the Hall of Fame catcher decided it was time for both men to
take the high road. ``Fourteen years,'' his son, Dale, told him,
``is long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   So Berra opened his arms _ and the museum bearing his name on
the Montclair State University campus in New Jersey _ to the man
who dismissed him as Yankee manager through an intermediary in
1985. The Boss told Berra that failing to deliver the bad news in
person was ``the worst mistake I ever made in baseball'' and
pleaded with him to return to Yankee Stadium next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' Berra said, unwilling to firmly commit himself to
taking this latest fork. But his smile gave him away. Yogi, it
seems, is finally going home.

   No one was happier with the salvation of the National Basketball
Association season last week than Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the world's greatest hoopster. The Michael Jordan who
averages 17 points per game for the University of Pennsylvania, a
very mortal No. 23 who, in the absence of the NBA, became fodder
for America's sports announcers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll stop killing me with the jokes,'' Jordan said on
the telephone before Penn played Yale in an Ivy League game Friday.
``One night I hear about a guy on ESPN starting his highlights,
`Jordan . . . from the top of the key . . . . airball.' With no
NBA, when you're in a little slump and your name is Michael Jordan,
the whole world knows.''
</P>
<P>
   The professional players and owners finally reached agreement on
Wednesday after an all-night bargaining session Tuesday night, in a
deal that promises labor peace into the next century with the
league having achieved its main goal of containing the contracts of
high-salaried players.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if Chicago's Michael Jordan will retire or not. As
for Penn's Michael Jordan, the accidental lockout casualty from
Philadelphia whose mother named him after her favorite cousin, he's
elated at the NBA's return.

but without the jokes, maybe it will be easier.''

   President Richard M. Nixon went to China. Henry A. Kissinger
came along. They talked with Chairman Mao Tse-tung and his aides of
war, peace, sex, death and the incendiary powers of the potent rice
liquor known as mao tai.
</P>
<P>
   When Kissinger stepped down as secretary of state in 1977, he
took reams of documents and sought to seal them until after his
death. But the National Security Archive, a research group in
Washington, tracked down records of his talks in the 1970s with
Chinese and Soviet leaders like Mao and Leonid Brezhnev in pursuit
of diplomacy and detente. They will be published this month as
``The Kissinger Transcripts'' (The New Press).
</P>
<P>
   Here is the first thaw of the Cold War _ the old-time communists
chatting amiably and talking tough with the Americans. In these
talks of a quarter-century past, there are resonances with the
present _ presidential scandal, Chinese spying and Russian
intrigues. There are also touching moments as the Americans try to
cozy up to the cantankerous Brezhnev and the chilly mountain of the
dying Mao.

between Nixon and Mao, arranged through Kissinger's secret
negotiations. Mao wants to talk philosophy, not politics.

   Nixon: I have read the chairman's poems and speeches, and I knew
he was a professional philosopher. (The Chinese laugh.)

<P>
   Nixon: He is a doctor of brains.

to my classes at Harvard.

instructive in what I wrote.

   Nixon: The chairman's writings moved a nation and have changed
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: I haven't been able to change it. I've only been able to
change a few places in the vicinity of Beijing. . . . We two must
not monopolize the whole show. It won't do if we don't let
Kissinger have a say. You have been famous about your trips to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: It was the president who set the direction. . . .

   Nixon: He is a very wise assistant to say it that way. (Mao
laughs).
</P>

   Mao: He is praising you, saying you are clever.

   Nixon: He doesn't look like a secret agent. He is the only man
in captivity who could go to Paris 12 times and Peking once and no
one knew it except possibly a couple of pretty girls. (Prime
Minister Chou En-lai laughs.) . . . Anyone who uses pretty girls as
a cover must be the greatest diplomat of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Mao (who had had many concubines): So your girls are very often
made use of?

   Feb. 17-18, 1973, Mao's residence: A midnight meeting. Mao,
fading in and out of logical discourse, talks about spies, war and
heaven. The Briton he refers to is the World War II field marshal
General Bernard Law Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: I don't look bad, but God has sent me an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   There was someone in the British army who was opposed to the
independence of your country. . . . He probably doesn't oppose you
anymore. At that time, you also opposed us. We also opposed you. So
we are two enemies (laughter).

</P>
<P>
   Mao: Now we call the relationship between ourselves a
friendship.
</P>

   Kissinger: That's our sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: That's what I am saying. . . . But let us not speak false
words or engage in trickery. We don't steal your documents. You can
deliberately leave them somewhere and try us out. Nor do we engage
in eavesdropping and bugging. There is no use in those small
tricks. And some of the big maneuverings, there is no use to them,
too. . . . Your CIA is not good for major events.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: That's absolutely true. That's been our experience.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: You want information on a certain question, then the
intelligence reports come in as so many snowflakes. We also have
our intelligence service and it is the same with them. (Chou
laughs.)

</P>
<P>
   Later, Mao wonders if Washington wants Moscow to attack China.
The Chinese, like the Americans, were worried that the Soviets
might launch a war for world domination.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: If there are Russians planning to attack China . . .
perhaps you can begin to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: Mr. Chairman, it is really very important that we
understand each other's motives. We will never knowingly cooperate
in an attack on China.
</P>
<P>
   Mao (interrupting): No, that's not so. Your aim in doing that
would be to bring the Soviet Union down.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: That's a very dangerous thing. (Laughter.)
</P>
<P>
   Mao: The goal of the Soviet Union is to occupy both Europe and
Asia, the two continents.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger: We want to discourage a Soviet attack, not defeat it.
We want to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Mao: As for things, matters, in the world, it is hard to say. .

invitation.

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Put the Khmer Rouge on trial for mass
murder? ``Who's going to try them?'' asked a foreign human rights
worker. ``They killed all the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only lawyers but doctors, teachers, engineers, accountants,
clerks, businessmen, monks, artists _ anybody who stood in their
way as they dragged Cambodia backward from the modern age toward
their goal: a bizarre, primitive agrarian utopia.
</P>
<P>
   The principal tactic was to eliminate _ not by re-educating but
by killing _ the entire class of people who could be called modern.
In that, if in nothing else, the Khmer Rouge seems to have
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years later, as Cambodia still struggles to get back
onto its feet, the country faces a harsh fact that sets its
suffering apart, even from the atrocities of Hitler, Stalin and the
like: The Khmer Rouge not only destroyed Cambodia's culture,
commerce and civil society in the 1970s; it eliminated the people
who might have been available to rebuild them.
</P>
<P>
   In December, two top Khmer Rouge leaders _ Khieu Samphan and
Nuon Chea _ surrendered to the government, apparently in return for
a free pass to settle into a comfortable retirement. But foreign
countries and many Cambodians are pressing hard for a tribunal to
try them for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million people died of malnutrition, overwork,
misdiagnosed disease and execution when the Khmer Rouge were in
power from 1975 to 1979. Many of those targeted for killing came
from the educated class. Of 545 judges in the country in 1975, said
Belgian historian Raoul Jennar, all but four died. Of approximately
800 doctors, only about 40 survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Khmer Rouge time there were entire professions which
disappeared,'' Jennar said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1980s, there was nobody in Cambodia who knew how
to use a computer, he said. No one knew how to run an electric
power plant. The country's power stations, built by the French in
the 1930s, had to be repaired by Soviet engineers.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers have hardly risen in the two decades since the
Khmer Rouge were driven from power by a Vietnamese invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s Cambodia was under the control of a
Vietnamese-backed Communist government that was shunned by most of
the outside world, and it was preoccupied by a civil war. Most of
the intellectuals who survived joined an exodus of as many as
400,000 refugees, and the country's ruined education system could
not begin to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back to Cambodia in 1992, we visited the prison
and we found out that very few prisoners had had trials, and those
trials were conducted without lawyers,'' said Kek Galabru, who
founded the country's leading human rights group, Licadho, when she
returned from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have about 200 lawyers in the nation, but the
quality is not good,'' she said. ``The problem is quality. Even in
human rights work we have to train our staff _ train, train,
train.''
</P>
<P>
   The task of training is monumental in a country that never had a
high literacy rate and now has one of the world's lowest, about 35
percent. Even today, as many as half the country's high school
teachers have only an elementary school diploma, and one in 20 does
not even have that, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the warfare and killings of the 1960s and 1970s,
Cambodia was an unsophisticated, poorly educated farming nation,
fought over through the centuries by its neighbors, Vietnam and
Thailand, and treated as an afterthought by its colonial masters,
the French.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the devastation of the Khmer Rouge years, assuring
that Cambodia would take no part in the economic boom that would
transform much of Southeast Asia after the end of the Indochina
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think people are still underestimating the legacy of the
'70s and the '80s,'' Jennar said. ``In the '70s, 95 percent of the
human resources disappeared. And the legacy of the '80s is the
impossibility to stop to train new human resources. So when we
speak of the rule of law, we must keep in mind that Cambodia was
able to reopen its faculty of law only in 1992. It is very
difficult to make the rule of law work when you do not have
jurists.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the absence of skilled practitioners of law or medicine
or administration, said American historian David P. Chandler,
Cambodian society suffers from a more generalized malaise as a
result of the brutalization of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just sort of traumatized,'' Chandler said. ``Even if
they had a bourgeois background, these people are still stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the country's continuing political feuds and violence,
which also have their roots in the struggles of the Khmer Rouge
years, these stunned Cambodians have not had the peace and
stability that would allow them at least to rest and recover.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the country were simply to open a dialogue about the
past, Chandler had doubts about what could be accomplished. ``I
don't see the people in Cambodia who are capable of picking up the
ball in a debate like this,'' he said. ``I don't see the people who
have the education, who know how to do a trial, who know what
evidence means, who know what corroboration means.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the nation's catastrophe are visible even in Long
Beach, Calif., a center for Cambodian immigrants who fled the Khmer
Rouge killings, carrying their traumas with them, Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cambodians are the worst group in every category except
arrests,'' he said, referring to a recent study. ``The worst
literacy, the lowest voting record, the lowest income, the highest
infant mortality. In arrests they are fourth or fifth up from the
bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the absence of lawyers but the absence of an
educated class that holds back Cambodia's development into a civil
society. Without a middle class, the nation lacks the public
pressure to hold its leaders accountable and to demand basic
rights.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nation with a history of arbitrary rule, where the
elite govern for themselves, not for the population at large, and
where the word for ``govern'' is the same as the word for
``consume.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have educated people, it is more and more difficult
to impose an arbitrary system,'' Jennar said. ``I do think this is
the key, the key issue. I think it is impossible to make steps on
democracy-building or on fighting corruption or improving the
national administration without an educated class.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cambodia's trauma _ the legacy of the Khmer Rouge _ goes
beyond this, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not only people with skills who disappeared,'' Jennar
said. ``There was also the destruction of the social fabric, the
destruction of the society and I must say the destruction of the
Khmer soul. This is still a broken society. It will take
generations to heal.''

   SMALLSTUFF _ Y2K. Such a small problem. Some say bank accounts
will be erased, the stock market will crash. We are told we will be
left penniless, groveling for food like animals. People will
starve. Planes will fall out of the air. There will be panic in the
streets. Gunfire. Bloodshed. Armageddon. To all that I say: Big
deal. Once again, we're sweating the big stuff. It's the small
stuff that's going to get us. What I want to know is if my Walkman
is going to work. That's right. If the world is going to catch on
fire, it better do it to the tune of whatever I have playing. If
not, I'm in big trouble. So in an attempt to uncover the larger
conspiracy of this ugly phenomenon, I have set out to see what the
true impact of Y2K will be on the common man, namely me.

Atlanta, or anywhere in Georgia. At least not yet. Emory University
is considering starting such a program, perhaps within a year. But
until then, mothers-to-be such as Marston are left to sort through
brochures of private companies making the pitch to buy biological
insurance. These companies collect and save the mother's placenta

   In the mother of all concepts, the life of one ordinary young
man, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey, left), is the subject of a
long-running _ 30 years and counting _ television show that records
every move the fellow makes. All the world dotes on this stuff,
which makes it imperative for the ``televisionary'' (Ed Harris) who
invented the show to keep Truman, who is unaware that he's being
televised, happily buttoned up in town, which is really a gigantic
sealed set done up as a pretty slice of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, though, Truman gets the picture and rebels in Peter
Weir's film, which, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, is
clever entertainment but ``doesn't quite lead anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   1998. Paramount. $107.37. 102 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.
Release date: Jan. 12.

   Without forsaking his usual clean look and hyper-real clarity,
Hal Hartley takes his filmmaking to a new level with a meditation
on (among other things) art, trust, loyalty, politics and popular
culture. A hapless garbage man who takes a heap of abuse from his
neighbors, Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) is taken in hand by the
brash Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan), who makes a writer out of him.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, Simon's work has a profound effect on people, but
his seriousness creates tension with the ambitious Henry, a writer
himself, in a film of ``brilliance and deep resonance'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36. 141 minutes. Closed captioned.
R. Release date: Jan. 12.

   With a chance to make lively work of New York's voracious 70s
disco scene, Mark Christopher's timid, meandering film fires a
blank. The ultimate pleasure dome, Studio 54, and its social
director, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), are setting the pace when a
good-looking 19-year-old nobody from New Jersey (Ryan Phillippe)
gains entrance and uses sex to become a star of the place.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying a soap-opera princess and club fixture, Neve Campbell
is a hopelessly insipid love interest, and Myers' caricature is
skin deep in a film that feels like ``a patched-together collection
of notes for a project that got lost on the cutting room floor''
(Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Miramax. $104.16. 92 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release

the critics may have sniffed at but proved popular at the box
office and in video stores. Here is a selection. All but ``The
Wedding Singer'' were released in theaters in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson won Academy
Awards in James Brooks' comedy about the stormy relationship
between a wisecracking waitress and a misanthropic writer, the
year's No. 1 renter. Columbia Tri-Star. $23.95. 138 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD WILL HUNTING. Check out those equations. A janitor (Matt
Damon) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology turns out to be
a mathematical prodigy. Miramax. $19.98. 126 minutes. R.
</P>
<P>
   KISS THE GIRLS. In a film that opens fast but then loses
adrenaline, a forensic specialist (Morgan Freeman) and a young
doctor (Ashley Judd) close in on Casanova, a serial killer.
Paramount. $19.98. 117 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   THE WEDDING SINGER. Doing his career no harm in 1998, Adam
Sandler _ star of ``The Water Boy'' _ is a singer who croons at
other people's weddings while nursing the wounds of his own
abandonment at the altar. New Line. 96 minutes. Closed captioned.
PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   G.I. JANE. Shaving her head bare with a smug little smile,
Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore) gives as good as she gets as the first
woman to survive the training grinder as a Navy Seal. Hollywood.
$19.98. 124 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   THE GAME. An icy banker (Michael Douglas) gets a surprise
birthday present that could ruin him and it's from his little
brother (Sean Penn). Polygram. $19.98. 128 minutes. Closed
captioned. R.

   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   QUAKE-PREDICTION (San Francisco) _ In October, the U.S.
Geological Survey is scheduled to issue, for the first time in
almost a decade, a ``probabilities'' report _ an official estimate
of how soon, and on which faults, the Bay Area is likely to
experience an earthquake. By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   LESBIANS-METHODIST (San Francisco) _ The Rev. Don Fado knew it
was a big deal when he resolved to bless the relationship of a
lesbian couple, against the express will of the United Methodist
Church. The Sacramento pastor had searched his conscience and
determined he could do nothing less, even at the risk of his
calling.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ARKANSAS (Little Rock, Ark.) _ Waitresses at the
International House of Pancakes in the capital city of Clinton's
home state are backing impeached President Clinton in his fight to
keep his office. That seems to be the majority view in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-MONEY (Austin, Texas) _ Now begins round two of the
Texas tobacco fight. While the last bout pitted Texas against Big
Tobacco at the courthouse, the statehouse is the next setting in
the high-stakes saga. The curtain rises Tuesday on the legislature
convenes to decide how to spend the historic $17.3 billion
settlement Texas struck with the tobacco industry last year. By
NICOLE FOY.
</P>
<P>
   FEATURES/LIFESTYLE (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SHOELESS-HOUSE (Bethelehem, N.Y.) _ First, there were no hats in
the house. Now there's a move afoot to shed your shoes at the
doorstep. As Americans become exposed to new traditions through
shifting immigration patterns and increased travel abroad, the foot
has come under fire. Urban and suburban dwellers in the know, now
request that you leave your dirty shoes at the door. By KIMBERLY
MARTINEAU.
</P>
<P>
   STEPHEN-AUSTIN (San Antonio) _ A cache of rare Texana artifacts
going on sale Friday makes one thing clear: The Father of Texas,
Stephen F. Austin, was no Betsy Ross. In a March 4, 1836, letter,
Austin proposed and sketched a somewhat convoluted flag design. By
MARINA PISANO.
</P>
<P>
   BLUE-NITRO (San Francisco) _ Touted by its promoters as a
euphoric elixir that can boost your mood, burn fat, rev up your sex
life and even send you off into blissful slumber, a trendy new brew
known as Blue Nitro has hit San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   TEDDY-ROOSEVELT (Albany, N.Y.) _ Even though Theodore Roosevelt
is placed among the handful of our greatest presidents, he grew
into the role and brought the nation along with him. For all his
achievements in conservation, regulating railroads, refereeing big
business and big labor, historians give Roosevelt the highest marks
for bringing the power and prestige of the presidency up to today's
stature and expectation. By FRED LeBRUN
</P>
<P>
   MONEY (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL-TEACHING (San Francisco) _ The 63 students who enrolled
in Peter Navarro's economics course at UC-Irvine last spring had a
choice: Take a seat and listen to the lectures, or take off and on
your way out grab a multimedia CD-ROM containing simulated
lectures. Is ``cyberlearning'' an educational fraud or the wave of
the future? He wanted to answer that question for himself. By
GEORGE RAINE.
</P>
<P>
   BANKAMERICA (Charlotte, N.C.) _ One of Bank of America CEO Hugh
McColl's favorite paintings in his office is a commissioned work
titled ``Take The Money And Run.'' It shows the bad guys making
their getaway from a bank called ``Republic.'' Fittingly, McColl's
former NationsBank Corp. merged with Texas' Republic Bank in 1988,
setting off a wave of acquisitions that culminated with the
marriage to San Francisco's BankAmerica Corp. in 1998. By GEORGE
RAINE.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-ANIMATION (Undated) _ We are in a comedic golden age. With
all due apologies to Walt Disney, Chuck Jones and the giants of the
1930s and '40s, we are now in an unsurpassed time for animation.
This goes for television as well as the movies. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Why do leaves turn brown in
the fall? What is the largest shark ever caught on a fishing rod
and reel? Easy enough, right? Nope. Of the thousands of entries in
the annual Examiner Outdoor Quiz, it was one of these two questions
that stymied nearly all. By TOM STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ On Friday, the day the members of
the U.S. Senate got together to work out procedures for Bill
Clinton's impeachment trial, I took an impromptu public opinion
survey. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Late last month, U.S. Rep. Bob
Inglis, R-S.C., posed a somber question to his congressional
colleagues about the future of American values. ``Are we a nation
based on truth or moral relativism?'' he asked. ``Does the truth
matter?'' By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-STORE (San Francisco) _ Barnes and Noble may be a wonderful
company to work for. But in the world of independent booksellers,
the expectations for corporate takeover are no different from any
other business: lower pay, fewer benefits, stricter rules, rigid
adherence to the bottom line. To say nothing of termination. And,
please, let's say nothing of termination. By AL MCKEE.

 HEALTH BRIEFS

  Includes electronic art of two women eating breakfast. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 EAT UP TO PREVENT STROKE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Experts have suspected that getting more potassium in your diet
may lower stroke risk _ now a large, eight-year study backs that
up.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Harvard University tracked 43,738 men, ages 40 to
75, and found that those whose diets were richest in potassium, as
well as cereal fiber and magnesium, had a ``substantially reduced''
risk of stroke (Circulation, Sep. 22, 1998). (A parallel study
involving women is underway.)
</P>
<P>
   The apparent protective effect was especially strong in men with
high blood pressure, says study leader Dr. Alberto Ascherio, an
associate professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard's
School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   But even men with normal blood pressure can enjoy a lower risk
of stroke by reducing their intake of processed foods (they tend to
be low in potassium) and loading up instead on potassium-rich
edibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best sources are vegetables, because they have high
potassium/calories ratios,'' Ascherio says. ``Fruits are also
good.'' Some top picks: tomatoes (or tomato juice), spinach,
bananas and oranges (or orange juice).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Don't use potassium supplements without consulting your
doctor, Ascherio warns. Potential risks include gastric irritation,
ulcers, and even arrhythmias in some people. &QL; 
 &UR; PATCH REDUCES INJECTION PAIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new adhesive skin patch makes shots, stitches and other minor
procedures much less painful. According to Dr. Steven J. Weisman,
professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at the Medical College
of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, the patch (called the EMLA Anesthetic
Disc) delivers a mixture of the commonly used anesthetics lidocaine
and prilocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was primarily designed for children, but adults can use
it as well,'' he says. Since the patch takes an hour to work, some
doctors may prescribe the patch ahead of time for patients to apply
before their appointment. &QL; 
 &UR; DO YOU NEED TAMOXIFEN? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drug tamoxifen has been shown in recent studies to help
prevent breast cancer, but it does have health-threatening side
effects. There are possible fatal side effects from taking
tamoxifen, such as pulmonary embolism and uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., has
developed a computer program that can assist you and your doctor in
weighing your options.
</P>
<P>
   After prompting you to answer a series of questions, such as
your age and health history, the program calculates your estimated
5-year and lifetime risk of breast cancer, and compares your risk
with women who participated in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial.
It also provides information from tamoxifen research studies. The
result may be a suggestion that you discuss tamoxifen and other
prevention options further with your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   More commonly, it may put you at ease, says Leslie G. Ford,
associate director of the Early Detection and community Oncology
program in the division of cancer prevention at the institute.
``Most women overestimate their risk of breast cancer,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   The program, called ``The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool,''
comes on a standard computer disk for PC or Mac and is available
free by completing the Risk Assessment Tool order form on the
institute's Web site at cancertrials.nci.nih.gov. You can also call
(800) 4-CANCER (422-6237). You can also ask your health-care
provider if he can make the program available to you. &QL; 
 &UR; BREAKTHROUGH PROCEDURE HEALS DAMAGED EARS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delivering antioxidants directly to delicate hairlike nerve
cells within the inner ear seems to undo noise-induced hearing
loss. ``When exposed to traumatic noise levels, the ear releases
free radicals,'' explains Dennis McBride, program officer for
biomedical science and technology at the Office of Naval Research
in Arlington, Va. ``These free radicals can cause the cells
responsible for hearing to die.''
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers have discovered that antioxidant medication
delivered directly to the inner ear through a miniature tube can
mop up enough free radicals to prevent permanent damage _ if the
treatment's given within six hours of the exposure to noise. The
procedure has restored full hearing in five patients tested thus
far, and trials are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   McBride, whose research team developed the technique, speculates
that the procedure may become generally available within months. &QL;

   When I hit my 40s, I began to understand why my parents didn't
want to get down on the floor with me when I was a kid. Although I
exercised regularly, my lower back ached. My shoulders and neck
were so stiff that it hurt when I'd turn to look out the rear
window of my car.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time I happened to pick up a book showing people who
were older than me _ 20, 30, even 40 years older _ who were far
more flexible! Their secret? Yoga. I had to try it.
</P>
<P>
   I signed up for a women-only class through a local gym. There
were about six of us, ranging in age from 25 to 50. We started with
simple, gentle poses. Following the instructor's lead, I exhaled as
I bent forward. It was OK if I couldn't touch my toes. I went only
as far as was comfortable for me.
</P>
<P>
   As I practiced in class and at home, I felt tremendous physical
pleasure. Lunging with my arms outstretched, my legs felt strong.
Energy shot from my shoulders out through my fingertips. Areas in
my body that were tight became relaxed, and those that were weak
became strong.
</P>
<P>
   My greatest breakthrough was learning to concentrate. When I
took the time to slow down and immerse myself in what I was doing,
I felt my muscles and ligaments stretching, little by little. As I
bent, breathing deeply, my arms folded around my head, I felt the
muscles in the back of my thighs release as I slowly dropped closer
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at age 46, I consider yoga a necessity. When I get out of
bed, I do some stretches. This eliminates back discomfort or pain.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm working in the kitchen, I'll use the countertop to
stretch my whole body from my fingers to my toes. At work, I do
gentle neck stretches to relieve the stiffness and pain that
develop from working at a computer all day. I hope someday to get
myself as flexible as the 70-year-olds I've seen who lie on the
floor and bring their toes to their nose! &QL; 
 &UR; TAKING THE FIRST STRETCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + CLASSES: Contact local colleges, hospitals, Ys, health clubs
and yoga studios. There are many different types of classes. Some
concentrate more on stress reduction, others on building power and
strength or maintaining flexibility, so observe classes before you
sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Working with an experienced teacher is the best way to avoid
injury and maximize yoga's benefits. There are many ways to move
your body that may look right to an amateur. A teacher can gently
correct your positions, so you can feel ``from inside'' what it's
like to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   + COST: $5 to $15 a class.
</P>
<P>
   + EQUIPMENT: loose-fitting, nonrestrictive clothing and bare
feet. Classes usually provide mats and other necessary equipment.
</P>
<P>
   + VIDEOS: My two favorites are ``Yoga for Beginners with
Patricia Walden'' ($15) and Lilias Folan ``Yoga Workout Series,''
volumes 1 and 2 ($20 per volume). To order, call Collage Video at
(800) 433-6769. &QL;

RODALE'S HEALTHY LIVING 
 ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE: HOT REMEDIES FROM ONE RED-HOT PEPPER
</HEADLINE>
  Includes 100-word sidebar. 
 FOR RELEASE MON., JAN. 18, 1999  
 EXCERPTED FROM PREVENTION 
 By VARRO E. TYLER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to red peppers, the same heat that makes your
tastebuds tingle can banish some annoying health problems.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether you call this herb capsicum, cayenne pepper,
red pepper, chili pepper or paprika, red-hot peppers of any variety
do more than just fire up your food.
</P>
<P>
   The source of red pepper's sizzle is the chemical capsaicin,
usually extracted as a mixture of several closely related compounds
that are very pungent. The capsaicin content of different red
pepper varieties ranges from zero to about 1.5 percent. This
variation accounts for the range of differences between sweet bell
peppers, spicy jalapenos and super hot habaneros. The hotter the
pepper, the more capsaicin it contains _ thus, the more healing
power.
</P>
<P>
   The best proven medicinal use of capsaicin is as a topical
painkiller. Very small amounts of capsaicin (0.025 percent to 0.075
percent) are added to cream bases and applied locally to provide
relief from obstinate pain. Arthritis pain, cluster headaches and
various kinds of neuropathies and neuralgias (painful nerve
conditions) respond well to capsaicin creams. These creams are
thought to deplete substance P, a neurotransmitter or ``messenger''
in the nerves, if substance P is depleted, pain sensations can't
reach the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Capsaicin cream must be applied three or four times daily for
two or even three weeks before it becomes truly effective. For a
few days, at least, it can sting, but you may find that such
stinging is a small price to pay for relief from unrelenting pain.
Neurologists tell me that the stuff really works. Don't get
capsaicin cream in your eyes, in open wounds or on sensitive mucous
membranes _ the burning sensation will be more than you expected.
</P>
<P>
   If you chomp down on a really hot pepper, your eyes will tear,
your nose will run a little, and you'll even sweat some _ sure
signs that capsicum is increasing the flow of various bodily
fluids. You'll feel less stuffy and you'll cough much less, so
you'll feel better. Because red pepper thins thick mucus, your
cough will expel it more easily. One of my favorite cold remedies
is any good chicken soup with a dose of red pepper tossed in.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, in spite of its pungent properties, capsicum
has an ancient folkloric reputation as a digestive aid. It is
recommended for easing flatulence (gas) and stomach cramps as well
as stimulating digestion and relieving indigestion. For a soothing
brew, try adding 1/4 teaspoon hot red pepper (more or less
depending on your tolerance) to 1 cup of hot tea. Don't use red
pepper for digestive purposes if you have an active stomach ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a toothache, try chewing a hot chili pepper to
obtain temporary relief. It's said to be as effective as clove oil.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you can make your own warmup powder for cold feet by
adding ground red pepper or red pepper flakes to talc or
cornstarch. Start by adding just a small amount of each and
increasing it gradually until you find the right amount for you.
Dust lightly in your socks to keep your feet warm.
</P>
<P>
   The powder works as a counterirritant. It causes the small blood
vessels under the skin to dilate, providing extra blood flow and
warmth to the area where it is applied. Use it cautiously _ don't
get it in your eyes or mucous membranes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, red pepper is used by some as a blood anti-clotting agent
and cholesterol reducer. There's really not enough scientific
evidence, however, to promote this use.
</P>
<P>
   It's been said that red pepper can cause stomach cancer. Here's
my opinion: It is estimated that 25 percent of the world's
population eats red pepper daily. If it were significantly
carcinogenic, trust me, many more people would have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Don't worry about it, unless you consume lots more
than the U.S. average of 6.9 pounds per person per year. Besides,
hot peppers are a good source of healthy antioxidants and vitamins
A and C.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hot Tip: &LR;  If you've bitten into a pepper that causes an
intolerable burning sensation in your mouth, don't drink water _ it
won't help and will only spread the irritation. Instead, try
chewing a textured food such as rice. That absorbs the capsaicin.
Alternatively, drink a glass of cold whole milk. Its fat content
will dissolve the capsaicin.  &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: CAPSICUM AT A GLANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Common names: red pepper, cayenne pepper, chili pepper,
paprika
</P>
<P>
   + Scientific names: Capsicum species, especially C. annuum and
C. frutescens, their hybrids and varieties
</P>
<P>
   + Benefits: topical analgesic, expectorant, sore-throat remedy,
digestive aid, toothache treatment, foot warmer, food flavoring
</P>
<P>
   + Possible side effects: severe irritation of the mouth and
throat following consumption, severe irritation on contact with
eyes, injured skin or sensitive body areas
</P>
<P>
   + Herbal fact: The hotness of hot peppers is often measured on a
scale devised by pharmacist Wilbur Scoville in 1912. Sweet bell
peppers have zero Scoville units. Jalapenos measure about 5,000.
Habaneros measure about 200,000 to 300,000. Pure capsaicin is 15
million. Humans can detect capsaicin at levels of one part per
million. &QL;

RODALE'S HEALTHY LIVING 
 IS YOUR WATER SAFE TO DRINK?  
 FOR RELEASE MON., JAN. 18, 1999  
 EXCERPTED FROM PREVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes electronic art of a glass of water. 
 By CAROL KEOGH  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Water is vital to life. But is it safe to drink?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a wimpy ``maybe.'' A lot of things can happen to
your water before it touches your lips. The safety of your home
supply depends on the quality of its source _ and that source is
subject to both the whims of Mother Nature and the carelessness of
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, you get water in one of three ways: from a public
utility that's regulated by the state and federal government, from
your own private source _ usually a well _ or bottled. Here's how
they stack up:
</P>
<P>
   + Public water: two thumbs up most of the time. There are
notable and well-publicized exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   + Well water: It may or may not be safe, depending on both the
quality of the underground water and the diligence of the homeowner
in caring for the well.
</P>
<P>
   + Bottled water: Almost always safe, but it may not be as
``pure'' as you think.
 &UR; PUBLIC WATER: USUALLY SAFE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Public water is tested, analyzed and treated so it will do you
no harm, says Patti Kay Wisniewski, an environmental scientist at
the Environmental Protection Agency. ``The water is safe to
drink,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That should be good news to the 85 percent of you whose tap
water comes from a municipal source. Except...
</P>
<P>
   What about those news reports that some of New Jersey's public
wells test high for radium and that some of California's public
wells are contaminated with a gasoline additive? What about the
403,000 people in Milwaukee who were sickened in 1993 when a
parasite known as cryptosporidium crept into their water supply?
What about E. coli bacteria, lead, and pesticides?
</P>
<P>
   You can lay the radium problem at the feet of Mother Nature.
When uranium in surface rocks decays, it naturally turns into
radium, which moves into the underground water supply, as happened
in New Jersey. The gas additive leak most likely was the result of
human error.
</P>
<P>
   Cryptosporidium _ as well as bacteria and viruses _ gets into
public water when human and animal wastes enter lakes and rivers
from sewage plant overflows and city and farm run-off, the latter
of which is probably also responsible for any pesticide residue.
And while lead sometimes leaches from water distribution pipes,
it's more likely to be coming from inside your home.
</P>
<P>
   Constant monitoring reveals most of these problems, and then
steps can be taken to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   But the system doesn't work perfectly. Both the federal
government and your state require your water supplier to test
regularly for contaminants, including bacteria, radioactive
elements and certain toxic chemicals. And if they find a problem,
your water company is required to notify you and tell you what to
do _ such as boil your water.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nation's 170,000-some public water systems comply
faithfully with testing and notification requirements. The ones
that don't are fined by the state or federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent investigation by USA Today revealed that as many as
40,000 U.S. water systems violated testing requirements and purity
standards last year, putting 58 million people at risk. The
investigation also found that state and federal officials took
action against only about 10 percent of violators between 1994 and
early 1997. And more than a quarter were repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, however, has recently taken action to
assure you that your water system is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water systems are now required to issue annual reports, called
Consumer Confidence Reports,'' Wisniewski says. ``This law took
effect in September 1998, and the companies have until next October
to produce them.'' The reports will come with your water bill, but
will also be available at libraries and schools, and in local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Consumer Confidence Reports are already accessible on the
World Wide Web. Check out the Web site at www.EPA.gov/ogwdw. Select
``Local Drinking Water Information.'' There, you can click on your
state, then your county, and finally on your own water utility and
see what's in your water.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you're ever notified of a problem, call the EPA's Safe
Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 and get some on-the-spot
expert advice.
 &UR; THE TREATMENT TRAIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But testing is only one aspect of the very complex job being
performed at the other end of your water main. Your water is
processed in what utilities call ``the treatment train.''
</P>
<P>
   It's filtered to remove clay, silt, organic debris,
microorganisms and some minerals. Then any tiny particles that slip
through the filters are clumped together so they become heavy
enough to sink. Finally, the water is disinfected, usually with
chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, enough chlorine is used to treat the water all the
way from the plant to your home. Chlorination does an excellent
job, but it has a downside. It generates disinfection byproducts
that, with long- term exposure, have been associated with a risk of
cancer or other adverse health effects.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA says that to avoid these unwanted byproducts, more water
suppliers are disinfecting with ozone instead. Call yours to find
out what treatment is used. In the meantime, you can remove these
unwanted disinfectant byproducts with a carbon filter.
 &UR; WELLS AND YOUR WELL-BEING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wells, which serve about 15 percent of Americans or 23 million
people, are not regulated by most states nor the federal
government. The responsibility is entirely on you to see that your
water is safe. There are three steps you need to follow to make
sure your well water is safe to drink.
</P>
<P>
   + First, protect your well site:
</P>
<P>
   _ Locate your well at least 50 feet from your septic tank and
100 feet from its drain field.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disinfect it, if needed, with bleach solution or hypochlorite
granules.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mix pesticides and herbicides as far away from the well as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep all hazardous substances out of your septic system.
</P>
<P>
   _ Properly dispose of products such as leftover paint, solvents,
used oil and batteries (don't dump them down the sink or in the
yard).
</P>
<P>
   _ Channel all runoff water away from your well.
</P>
<P>
   + Second, inspect your well regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Check the well casing for holes or cracks. Also check the cap
often to make sure it's tightly in place, so that it will continue
to keep out insects, small rodents, and surface runoff.
</P>
<P>
   + Third, test it-at least once a year for some contaminants, but
immediately if you notice changes in the smell or taste of the
water or you and your family are getting sick more often.
</P>
<P>
   You can't test for everything, because it would cost a fortune,
Wisniewski says. ``Instead,'' she says, ``test for likely
contaminants, such as coliform bacteria. If you live in an
agricultural area, test for pesticides, herbicides and nitrates.''
</P>
<P>
   If you need help deciding what to test for, contact your state
or local health department. If a contaminant is found, ask the
health department for assistance. Or call the EPA's Safe Drinking
Water Hotline, which also offers technical assistance.
 &UR; BOTTLED WATER: WHAT'S BETWEEN THE EARTH AND YOU? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bottled water carries with it the myth that it's so pure it
gushes straight from the earth's depths into those pristine bottles
_ virtually untouched by human hands. While it true that bottled
water has no chlorine, no weird off-tastes and no odors, and is
certainly is safe to drink, it has been touched _ plenty _ on its
way to your home.
</P>
<P>
   It's processed, or at least bottled, in manufacturing plants
that are inspected by the Food and Drug Administration every five
or six years. ``We look at the facility to determine if bottled
waters are produced under safe and sanitary conditions,'' says an
FDA administrator. Individual states also inspect plants regularly.
On top of that, the International Bottled Water Association
commissions NSF International, an independent testing organization,
to conduct annual surprise inspections of its members' facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the bottlers test the source water for chemical
contaminants such as benzene or pesticides a minimum of once a
year, for microorganisms such as E. coli once a week, and for
inorganic compounds such as antimony, arsenic, lead and zinc, among
others, once a year. They also test for radiological contaminants
such as radium about once a year.
</P>
<P>
   If chemical contaminants are found, they are removed from the
water. In addition, most bottled waters produced in the United
States have been disinfected, says a spokesperson for the FDA. The
reason you don't taste chlorine is that most bottlers disinfect
with ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Imported water must meet federal regulations too. It's subject
to sampling and testing at entry into the United States, says a
spokesperson for the FDA. IBWA member companies with facilities
abroad are subject to the same surprise inspections.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be sure of the safety of your bottled water, look
for the letters IBWA on the label. Members of the association are
held to a higher standard than bottlers who are not.
</P>
<P>
   They must follow a model code that is stricter than the FDA'S,
says Adele Logan Galen, vice president of communications for the
IBWA. If you want to know if your favorite water is bottled by an
IBWA member, call the association at (800)-WATER11 (928-3711). Or
check their Web site for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) at
www.bottledwater.org.
</P>
<P>
   All bottled waters aren't the same. Water quality can vary among
brands. ``Sometimes (bottled water) is just water from a public
system that has been `polished,'' Wisniewski says.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 25 percent of bottled water sold in the United
States comes from public water supplies. It is further processed by
the bottler, in which case the label does not have to say what the
source is. Sometimes, however, it hasn't been further processed. By
law, then, the label must indicate that the water is from a public
source. Which means you're paying an awful lot for that pretty good
thing that's already flowing from the tap. &QL;

   QUESTION: When I'm really winded, why do I instinctively bend
over with my hand on my knees? This seems as if it would be
counterproductive _ and my highschool football coach used to yell
at us to stand up to catch our breath _ D.K., Phoenix, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: According to Dr. Robert Gotshall, of Colorado State
University's department of exercise and sports science, you bend
over in an attempt to get adequate blood flow to your head. ``When
you're exercising, your muscles are helping your heart fill with
blood quickly so you can have a high cardiac output, which helps
maintain blood pressure,'' Gotshall says. ``If you stop suddenly _
which most athletes tend to do _ you no longer have the support for
that cardiac output.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping often results in a rapid drop in blood pressure _ so
much so that there's barely enough pressure to pump blood up to
your head. You instinctively lower your head to or below heart
level to get more blood flowing to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Your football coach was right to tell you to stand up to catch
your breath, but ``take care of the blood flow to your head
first,'' Gotshall says. ``Once the nervous system regains control
of your blood pressure, you'll be able to stand up and catch your
breath.'' That'll be even easier, by the way, with your hands on
your head.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My elbow has been hurting like hell lately, and I
don't know why. I'm wondering if I have tennis elbow, but I don't
know what it is or how to get rid of it. _ L.McK, Shreveport, La.
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: ``Tennis elbow is the equivalent of a heart attack in
your elbow tendon,'' says Dr. Robert Nirschl, an orthopedic surgeon
at the Nirschl Sports Medicine Clinic in Arlington, Va. It's
normally an overuse problem in which the tendon is mechanically
injured, becomes stressed, loses its vitality and eventually fails.
The unhealthy tendon tissue can be painful.
</P>
<P>
   If the pain is coming from the outside of your elbow, it's
probably tennis elbow. ``The only way to improve the tissue is
through rehabilitative resistance exercises,'' Nirschl says. That
means working the forearm muscle groups that attach o the bone of
your elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The following five rehabilitative exercises work these muscles.
Do all of them with your arm bent and your elbow at your side.
Perform each exercise five to 10 times, up to five times a day.
</P>
<P>
   + Wrist extension.
</P>
<P>
   Spread your fingers as wide as you can, then close them.
</P>
<P>
   + Wrist flexion.
</P>
<P>
   With your hand palm-down and loosely closed, bend your wrist
toward the ceiling, then toward the floor.
</P>
<P>
   + Radial deviation.
</P>
<P>
   With your palm down, bend your wrist to the inside (toward your
thumb).
</P>
<P>
   + Ulnar deviation.
</P>
<P>
   With your palm down, bend your wrist to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   + Rotate your forearm from a pronated position (palm down) to a
supinated one (palm up).
</P>
<P>
   Your elbow also needs a rest from abusive activity, including
sports. And realize that using drugs for short-term pain reduction
isn't going to solve your problem. ``People mistakenly equate pain
relief with cure,'' Nirschl says. ``Drugs may give you comfort, but
they don't fix the problem.'' &QL;

 HEALTHY PARENTING: SWOLLEN GLANDS: WHEN INFECTION SENDS SIGNALS 
 FOR RELEASE MON., JAN. 18, 1999  
 EXCERPTED FROM ``THE DOCTORS BOOK OF HOME REMEDIES FOR CHILDREN''
</HEADLINE>
  By THE EDITORS OF PREVENTION MAGAZINE HEALTH BOOKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lymph glands are like little crisis-management centers located
throughout the body. Ordinarily, these pea-size glands are filled
with cells called lymphocytes, which produce the antibodies needed
to fight off invading organisms such as bacteria or viruses.
</P>
<P>
   When your child gets a viral infection such as a cold, or a
bacterial infection such as impetigo, the lymphocytes multiply
rapidly in the lymph gland nearest to the source of the infection,
which makes the gland somewhat swollen.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that your child has swollen glands doesn't mean that he
has an illness. Rather, it's a sign that your child's immune system
is at work. When your child's glands are swollen, you may actually
be able to feel and see the swelling, and the glands may be tender
to the touch. If you examine your child carefully, you may even be
able to discover the infection or injury that has caused the gland
to swell, says Dr. Jack H. Hutto of All Children's Hospital in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Hutto says, a swollen gland in the groin may be
due to an ingrown toenail or an infected knee, while a swollen
gland in the front of the neck may indicate a cold or tonsillitis.
A swollen gland under the armpit could be due to the immune
system's reaction to an infected finger.
</P>
<P>
   You can expect your child to have many swollen glands as she
confronts the numerous cuts and colds of childhood, and for the
most part, it shouldn't worry you, especially if you keep in mind
the following tips.
</P>
<P>
   + Leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the gland has a bacterial infection within it, leave it
alone, says Dr. Lorry Rubin, a pediatrician at Schneider Children's
Hospital of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park,
N.Y., and associate professor of Pediatrics at the Albert Einstein
School of Medicine in New York City. With swollen glands, it is
more important to diagnose and treat the source of infection. The
glands themselves need no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   + See if it moves.
</P>
<P>
   A lymph gland at work on a minor infection should feel
relatively soft, may be tender and should be somewhat mobile, says
Dr. Blair M. Eig, a pediatrician in private practice in Silver
Spring, Md. To make sure the infection is minor, you should try
moving the gland with your fingers, he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   + Be alert to warmth and pain.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, the glands can become overwhelmed with bacteria,
causing the infection to spread and grow in the lymph gland. If the
gland itself becomes infected, the skin overlying the Iymph node
gets red and hot, and it will be very tender and very sore, Rubin
says. For pain relief, you can give your child a dose of
acetaminophen (Children's Tylenol). Check the package directions
for the correct dosage for your child's age and weight.
</P>
<P>
   If your child is under 2, consult a physician. This type of
infection may require antibiotic therapy and perhaps surgical
drainage, Rubin says. &QL; 
 &UR; MEDICAL ALERT: WHEN TO SEE THE DOCTOR &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If your child has a swollen gland that is red and painful or is
larger than two inches, or if your child feels ill or feverish,
consult your pediatrician, says Dr. Blair M. Eig, a pediatrician in
private practice in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The swollen glands may be responding to a bacterial infection
that needs to be treated with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lorry Rubin, a pediatrician at Schneider Children's Hospital
of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.,
and associate professor of Pediatrics at the Albert Einstein School
of Medicine in New York City, says his rule of thumb is: If the
gland is big enough to see, take your child to the physician. Also,
if your child has a gland that is persistently enlarged but is not
tender or mobile, have it evaluated by a physician. In rare
instances, it could indicate a more serious medical condition. &QL;

MELANIE GRIFFITH'S WALK ON THE WILD SIDE

 Includes a color slide of Melanie Griffith in a scene from
``Another Day in Paradise.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Melanie Griffith is a Hollywood star from head to toe, from her
immaculately coiffed blonde hair to ... to ...
 &HT;    All right, why is each of her nails a different color?
 &HT;    ``I have two little girls,'' Griffith says, laughing. ``I also
have lots of nail polish sitting around, and it's the holiday
season. I just thought it would be fun for all three of us.''
 &HT;    She sighs.
 &HT;    ``But my youngest, Stella, is only 2,'' she adds, ``so the test
was whether Stella could sit still long enough for her nails to
dry. I bet you can guess the answer.''
 &HT;    The idea of the glamorous Griffith as a hands-on mom is hard to
picture, but no harder than her latest onscreen role, in ``Another
Day in Paradise,'' opening Jan. 22.
 &HT;    Griffith plays Sid, a heroin addict who isn't above taking care
of business with a 12-gauge shotgun. She and her
small-time-criminal boyfriend (James Woods) recruit another pair of
misfits _ a teen-age runaway and his girlfriend (Vincent Kartheiser
and Natasha Gregson Wagner) _ into a downward-spiraling series of
shockingly violent scams.
 &HT;    Having struggled with much-publicized substance-abuse problems
in the past didn't make her role any easier, the actress says.
 &HT;    ``I was doing drugs in the '70s,'' she says matter-of-factly.
``I never experienced the kind of life that's in the movie.
Everyone was into cocaine, but heroin was definitely a no-no. I
never faced the kind of addiction that Sid has.
 &HT;    ``Looking back, though,'' she adds, ``I went though some pretty
wild nights. I guess the most important thing for me was hoping
that, when I went to bed, I'd wake up in the morning and get
excited about living again. There were lots of times when I didn't
even care if I got up. I had to work to get over that.''
 &HT;    Preparing for the role, Griffith spent some time with real
addicts.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to find out how people behaved on heroin,'' she says.
``Many of them function pretty normally _ you wouldn't know they
were doing it, even though it was destroying them. That helped me
give my character some depth, and not just turn her into a
drug-crazed cliche.''
 &HT;    In what may be the most shocking moment in the film, Sid uses a
syringe to inject heroin into her neck.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't in the script,'' she says. ``But I met a junkie who
told me how he used to do it, because it was the only place he
could find a vein that hadn't collapsed.
 &HT;    ``At least it wasn't painful to film,'' she adds, ``because the
syringe had a collapsing needle and it didn't even break my skin.
There's no way I would ever stick a needle into my own body.''
 &HT;    Griffith took the role at the urging of Woods, who also
co-produced ``Another Day In Paradise,'' which director Larry Clark
_ whose previous film was the controversial ``Kids'' _ adapted from
the celebrated novel by ex-con Eddie Little.
 &HT;    ``Jimmy called me up and said, `You have to do this f---in'
movie, I'm sending the script over and you've got to read it right
now and tell me what you think of it,''' she recalls. ``So I read
it, and I knew he was right. I knew it would be challenging, but
the script was amazing.''
 &HT;    The production sparked rumors of angry confrontations between
Woods and Clark, who after an altercation with co-producer Stephen
Chin at the film's premiere announced that he was entering a
facility for lapsed substance abusers.
 &HT;    Asked about the mood on the set, Griffith shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I don't know if you could call making this film fun,'' she
says. ``It was hard, and we had a very low budget. It's a tough
story, and it wasn't like everyone was laughing a lot _ it was
pretty heavy and difficult. You had to really put yourself out
there.''
 &HT;    The highlight of each day, the actress says, was setting aside
her emotionally draining character and going home to her children.
 &HT;    ``I take a lot of comfort in knowing that my kids won't accept
me if I ever bring my work home,'' she says, smiling. ``It was
great to just be a mom, to feed them dinner, get their baths ready
and help them with their homework.''
 &HT;    Griffith's family is more complicated than most, including her
son Alexander, whose father is actor Steven Bauer. Then there's her
daughter Dakota, by ``Nash Bridges'' star Don Johnson _ whom
Griffith married twice, once in her teens and once in her 30s _ and
Johnson's son Jesse, whose mother is actress Patti D'Arbanville.
 &HT;    Rounding out the mix is Stella, Griffith's daughter by Banderas.
 &HT;    ``My kids get moved around over the holidays,'' she admits.
``Antonio and I took Stella to Spain. Alexander and Dakota went
skiing in Aspen with Don, and then he took them to Jamaica. But
next year, we'll have everyone with us.
 &HT;    ``I can't say that I'm raising my children the way I was
raised,'' says Griffith, whose mother is the actress Tippi Hedren.
``My mother was great and I love her, but I was still 14 when I
pretty much left home. I just wanted to be in love and have kids of
my own. I didn't give my mom much choice _ I was pretty headstrong.
 &HT;    ``I wouldn't want that for my children, to be out on their own
at such a young age.''
 &HT;    However much she enjoys being a mother, Griffith is equally
determined to be a success as Banderas' wife.
 &HT;    ``I've never met anybody like him,'' she says. ``Antonio is so
talented and knowledgeable about things like literature and music,
yet he's extremely humble. He's also an incredible father _ not
just to our daughter Stella, but to all my kids.
 &HT;    ``And he's so gorgeous,'' she adds with a wicked grin. ``He's
very romantic and so am I, maybe because we're both Leos and we've
both been around the block a few times. I really make it a priority
to keep the romance in our relationship.
 &HT;    ``But Antonio takes care of that, too,'' she says. ``I remember
he proposed to me on a beach in North Carolina at sunset. He got
down on his knee and asked me to marry him. It was beautiful.''
 &HT;    The pair recently completed filming ``Crazy in Alabama,'' in
which Banderas directs his wife and, in cameo appearances, two of
her children.
 &HT;    ``It's a dark comedy set in the '60s,'' she says, shaking her
head as she tries to describe it. ``It's about a woman with seven
children who's been mistreated by her husband until she can't take
it anymore. She puts rat poison in his coffee, cuts off his head
with an electric carving knife and puts it in a Tupperware bowl,
and heads for Hollywood to try to get on `Bewitched.'
 &HT;    ``But behind the humor is a very powerful statement about women
freeing themselves from abusive relationships.''
 &HT;    To say the least, it's another offbeat role for a onetime
ingenue _ she peaked with her Academy Award-nominated performance
in ``Working Girl'' (1988) _ whose most recent roles have been
anything but, including her ``Paradise'' addict and the shrill
Charlotte Haze in ``Lolita'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``I'm 41,'' she says, ``and I can't pretend that I'm going to
play the ingenue anymore. Besides, it's not that much fun anyway.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I'll keep on playing drug addicts, but I'm going
to go for interesting parts, and if they're in low-budget,
independent movies I won't care, as long as it gives me a chance to
do something different.
 &HT;    ``Some people said it took courage for me to play an addict,''
Griffith adds. ``I didn't see it that way at all _ I just saw it as
a wonderful challenge. That's what I'm looking for in my life.''

THE `DAILY' WORLD OF JON STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes a color slide of Jon Stewart in a scene from ``The Daily
Show.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He was never the class clown.
 &HT;    Jon Stewart didn't have time for that growing up in Lawrence,
N.J. He needed his wit for other things, such as making money.
 &HT;    ``My senior year of high school, I got a job,'' he recalls. ``So
I signed myself out of school everyday at 1 p.m. after clowning
around with the secretaries, who thought I was hilarious or that I
had an illness.''
 &HT;    Before they could think twice, the skinny Jewish kid who was a
walking punch line was out the door.
 &HT;    That's the deal with Stewart. Funny, yes, but with a purpose.
Right now, for example, he's being funny to promote his two films,
the current teen science-fiction epic ``The Faculty'' and the drama
``Playing By Heart,'' due to open Jan. 22.
 &HT;    But don't forget his book, ``Naked Pictures of Famous People''
(Rob Weisbach Books, 1998), which is still selling well.
 &HT;    And neither of those is even his main gig: Since Jan. 11,
Stewart has been the host of ``The Daily Show,'' the Comedy Central
staple.
 &HT;    Not bad for a guy whose most prominent previous credit has been
a flop talk show on MTV, 1995's ``The Jon Stewart Show.''
 &HT;    Fortunately, his predecessor on ``The Daily Show,'' Craig
Kilborn, gave him a lift. Literally.
 &HT;    ``I'm a little shorter than Craig,'' Stewart says with a mock
grimace, ``so he sent me a telephone directory to sit on for my
first show!''
 &HT;    The tone of the show has very much reflected Kilborn's persona,
and Stewart expects that now it will evolve to reflect his own.
 &HT;    ``The changes will be slow over the next few months,'' he says,
``but I'm sure I will assert a lot of my point of view into the
writing. Craig never did any of the writing _ that will be one big
change.''
 &HT;    The cable-deprived can catch Stewart at their neighborhood
multiplexes in ``The Faculty,'' as a teacher whose students suspect
him of being an alien monster.
 &HT;    ``I was definitely not one of the high-school kids,'' he jokes.
``This isn't `Beverly Hills 90210,' where the guy with gray hair is
still in 11th grade. I think one of those kids on `90210' will have
a hysterectomy before they go to college.''
 &HT;    In ``Playing By Heart,'' Stewart co-stars with Sean Connery and
romances Gillian Anderson. Classy company, but the comedian remains
unimpressed with himself.
 &HT;    ``Working with Gillian I felt like the poor man's Mulder,'' he
jokes. ``Put me next to Sean Connery in the film, and everyone will
be going, `Who is the skinny young guy?'''
 &HT;    Things don't go well with Anderson in the film _ in fact, it's
more or less the date from hell, with a huge mastiff playing a key
role. In reality, though, Stewart says he's never had a date that
was even not-so-good.
 &HT;    ``They've actually all been magic,'' he says. ``You know, I
don't really date. I get a sense that I'm attracted to someone and
that's just it. And we don't date.
 &HT;    ``We mess around for a little bit and leave it at that, or we go
out for a long time.''
 &HT;    His current girlfriend, a graphic designer named Tracey, is
someone he actually met on a blind date three years ago.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, it was just after my show on MTV had been canceled,
so I was just happy to get the action,'' he says, laughing. ``My
days of hitting on Jennifer Aniston were over. I was happy to be
back in the world.''
 &HT;    That world began in Lawrence, not far from Princeton University,
where Stewart grew up as the son of a physicist and a teacher.
 &HT;    ``I was very pleasant,'' Stewart recalls. ``Smallish. I don't
think I was a troublemaker. Nah, I had a lot of pretty good
friends. I played a lot of sports.
 &HT;    ``This was back in the days when kids played outdoors and used
their arms and legs to run,'' he adds. ``We didn't have Nintendo.''
 &HT;    Even more than now, he says, he was a cutup.
 &HT;    ``The problem I had in high school is that I didn't want to
abide by what I thought were unreasonable rules,'' Stewart says.
``I wasn't stealing cars, but as a senior I thought being in school
for such a long time was a waste of my time. That's why I got that
job.''
 &HT;    One thing was clear by the time he graduated.
 &HT;    ``I was voted `Best Sense of Humor' in high school,'' he
recalls. ``That was about the only accreditation I have as far as
being funny _ otherwise you have to take my word for it.''
 &HT;    After earning a psychology degree from the College of William
and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., Stewart returned to nearby Trenton,
N.J., where he worked as a waiter and as a bartender while trying
to break into the world of stand-up comedy.
 &HT;    ``My first gig ever was at The Bitter End club,'' he says. ``I
followed four Doors cover bands. You felt the history, that Woody
Allen once performed there, Bill Cosby was there. But, believe me,
they were long gone by the time I arrived!''
 &HT;    He was driven to succeed, Stewart says, if only to escape being
a waiter.
 &HT;    ``Waiting tables made me feel like the ultimate `Nothing Man,'''
he says. ``I would grumble, `Just tell me what you want. I'll go
and fetch it to you, and hopefully this will all work out.'
 &HT;    ``I liked being a bartender,'' he adds. ``I was like, `You want
booze? You gotta come to the J-Man.' I also got to ply the pretty
girls with shots.''
 &HT;    Don't picture Tom Cruise in ``Cocktail'' (1988), though.
 &HT;    ``No, I was more like Zero Mostel in `The Front' (1976),'' he
deadpans, evoking the shambling, desperate comedian on the brink of
suicide.
 &HT;    Doing ``The Daily Show'' won't keep him off the big screen,
however, despite his insistence that ``I think I will pace myself
to do one film every 35 years.'' He's currently filming a role in
the Adam Sandler vehicle ``Big Daddy,'' set for release next
summer.
 &HT;    The plot, he says, is basically ``One Man and a Baby.''
 &HT;    ``I play Adam's best friend,'' he explains. ``I go to China for
a few weeks to work. Someone drops a kid, supposedly mine, on our
doorstep, and Sandler has to keep him alive until I get home.''
 &HT;    It's no stretch for Stewart and Sandler to play best friends,
since they're pals of long standing.
 &HT;    ``Adam's still the same guy he has always been in terms of being
funny and original,'' Stewart says. ``He's really sticking to his
guns and doing what got him here. What makes him so successful is
that he's staying to what he knows and what he thinks is funny. He
hasn't changed it _ he just made it better.''
 &HT;    Which, as it happens, is pretty much what Stewart has in mind
for himself, as well.
 &HT;    ``It's either keep it the same and keep it funny,'' he says,
``or go back to Zero Mostel time.''

PATRICIA ARQUETTE: ACTING TO THE BEAT OF A DIFFERENT DRUMMER 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Patricia Arquette with Woody Harrelson in
a scene from ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Talk about peer pressure.
 &HT;    Patricia Arquette is from a family of actors _ grandfather
Cliff, father Lewis, sister Rosanna and brothers Alexis and David
inclusive _ and, though she says she never felt competitive toward
her siblings, it was never easy.
 &HT;    ``I caused myself a lot of grief not knowing if I could or would
be able to act at all,'' she recalls. ``But our parents always
raised us feeling very different from each other and special in our
own ways.
 &HT;    ``I was just worried about what I would do, who I would be,''
she says by telephone from a Los Angeles hotel. ``I realized that
you just have to educate yourself about as many things as you can
and, later, you'll figure out what you're going to do. You want to
be well-rounded, talk to a lot of people, so that you have as many
choices and chances as you want in life.
 &HT;    ``But I just felt incredible pressure to do something.''
 &HT;    ``Something'' turned out to be acting, but it could have been
marine biology or midwifery.
 &HT;    ``Marine biologist was weird, because I always loved the look of
underwater, but I didn't know that much about fish and didn't
really want to go into the ocean,'' she says, laughing. ``I was
very interested in being a midwife, though. I knew a lot about the
birth process, and was always fascinated by that.
 &HT;    ``What I decided to do was to try acting for a year, from 18 to
19,'' she recalls. ``Then I could say I tried one of my dreams and
it did or didn't work out. I didn't want to spend 30 years trying
to follow a dream and then be bitter about it.
 &HT;    ``I thought if the acting didn't work out, I'd just try to
realize one of my other dreams.''
 &HT;    Twelve years later, it's still working out. Arquette graduated
from television work to such features as ``A Nightmare on Elm
Street 3'' (1987), ``The Indian Runner'' (1991), ``Ethan Frome''
(1993), ``True Romance'' (1993), ``Beyond Rangoon'' (1995),
``Flirting with Disaster'' (1996) and ``Lost Highway'' (1997). She
may not be a superstar _ like, say, her husband Nicolas Cage _ but
she's working regularly, which not every actress can say.
 &HT;    Her latest film, ``The Hi-Lo Country,'' opens around the country
throughout January. A sprawling western directed by Stephen Frears,
it's set in post-World War II New Mexico, where Arquette's Mona is
married to one man while attracted to two others, small-time cattle
ranchers played by Billy Crudup and Woody Harrelson.
 &HT;    Frears, director of ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' (1983) and ``The
Grifters'' (1990), is much admired in Hollywood, and Arquette
admits that she didn't want the role when she initially agreed to
discuss it with him.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to meet him so that someday I could work with
him,'' she says. ``I didn't think I was right for Mona. She's so
enigmatic, and I didn't understand how to play an enigmatic
personality. I also didn't particularly like the choices she was
making in her life.
 &HT;    ``Stephen and I talked about it,'' the actress recalls, ``and I
said, `I see her as this woman who has this little smell coming out
of her skin, that men and women notice, that draws people to her.
She's not rich, but she knows how to dress and how to do her nails
and hair.'''
 &HT;    To her surprise, Frears agreed, and Arquette found herself in
the film.
 &HT;    ``I had to break the role down, little by little,'' she says.
``I had to find Mona's concept of femininity, her daily rituals,
and then I had to think about her love and her hate for each of the
characters, and their love or hate for her.
 &HT;    ``At the end of the day, she's a woman who needs a lot of
attention and love. Even if she's being mad and quiet, she wants
you to hear, very loudly, that she's mad and quiet.''
 &HT;    Working with Frears was everything she'd hoped, the actress says
_ though the Englishman, best known for his intimate, small-scale
films, wasn't the obvious choice for a prairie-set story.
 &HT;    ``He surpassed my expectations of him being a gentle and
generous director,'' Arquette says. ``He's always been good with
his female leads. He's mystified by women because, to him, they're
enigmatic.
 &HT;    ``Also, Stephen loved westerns as a boy,'' she adds, ``and you
can feel that nostalgic beat in the movie, that sort of
old-fashioned flavor and romance.''
 &HT;    Arquette giggles.
 &HT;    ``But he did have to tutor himself about `What is a rodeo?'''
she says. ``He had to ask, `How do you lasso something?'''
 &HT;    The actress has three other films due later in 1999. Roland
Joffe's black comedy ``Goodbye Lover'' casts her as a
``realtor/homemaker/slasher,'' while she plays a party
girl/hairdresser in ``Stigmata,'' a ``psycho/spiritual/detective
horror movie.''
 &HT;    Especially dear to her heart is the just-wrapped ``Bringing Out
the Dead,'' which co-stars her husband and was directed by Martin
Scorsese, who co-produced ``Hi-Lo Country.'' It's about a troubled
paramedic (Cage) and a woman he meets on a call.
 &HT;    ``It's been interesting to work together,'' Arquette says.
``It's heavy material, so it takes a lot of concentration. It's
nice at the end of the day to have him around.''
 &HT;    Cage recently said he plans to work steadily for the next five
years, to strike while the $20-million-per-film iron remains hot,
even if that means squeezing other areas of his life, family
included. Obviously this affects Arquette's career, but if she has
any problem with it, she's not talking.
 &HT;    ``I'm not as aggressive about my career now as I have been at
different moments,'' she says. ``I've never really been a gigantic
go-getter.''
 &HT;    Movie stars or not, she says, everyone has to go through periods
when their careers take center stage.
 &HT;    ``All people work hard,'' she says, ``especially when they're
young. Why should we be exempt from that? In the old days, a guy
would go off to war for 10 years. We certainly have a lot more
communication and a lot more time together than some people.
 &HT;    ``So I don't feel so bad for us.''
 &HT;    After all, if one of the two is going to earn the megabucks, it
figures to be Cage. Arquette's filmography attests to her penchant
for independent features with riskier stories and more challenging
characters. ``Indian Runner,'' ``True Romance,'' ``Ethan Frome''
and ``Beyond Rangoon'' rank among her favorite films, even though
collectively they didn't make any money to speak of.
 &HT;    ``I say `Yes' to something if I like it when I'm reading it or
if I'm really intrigued by a director or a cast,'' she says. ``I
say `Yes' if I meet a director and he's got an interesting take on
the story.
 &HT;    ``I say `Yes' if the film is different from things I've done
before, if the role is different from me or even similar to me. I'd
do more mainstream films if I liked the scripts.''
 &HT;    Either way, it looks as if the world will have to get by without
one more marine biologist or an extra midwife.
 &HT;    ``I never thought I'd be here now,'' she says, ``so I'm
surprised, pleasantly surprised with what's happened for me.
 &HT;    ``But there's more I want to do,'' she continues. ``I want to do
a goofball comedy, and I don't want to be the straight man. I want
to be really goofy, really silly. I do so many serious movies ...
''
 &HT;    Arquette sighs.
 &HT;    `` ... I just want to do one that's funny and happy.
 &HT;    ``I want to make a movie called `The Happiest Movie on Earth,'''
she says, laughing. ``It's going to be the happiest movie of all
time.''

 Includes a color slide of Barry Watson in a scene from ``7th
Heaven.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a question of edge.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what constitutes that ill-defined quality is hard to
say, but it's important in Hollywood. And it's causing Barry Watson
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out in his trailer between scenes on his film ``Killing
Mrs. Tingle,'' due out in July, the ``7th Heaven'' heartthrob says
that he almost didn't get the part, which is his first major
big-screen role.
</P>
<P>
   ``My character in this is kind of edgy, and just before I read
for this part, I'd read for another movie and they said I wasn't
edgy enough,'' he recalls. ``And that character wasn't even as edgy
as this character.''
</P>
<P>
   A young woman passing his trailer pauses and does a double take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Jared Leto?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently a starstruck fan has somehow gotten onto the studio
lot and mistaken one hunky young actor for another.
</P>
<P>
   Watson gets a good laugh out of that. Earlier, he had talked,
not entirely happily, about how much people are recognizing him
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he answers, smiling. ``He's the one that's edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson may or may not be edgy, but he and ``7th Heaven'' are
definitely hot. How hot? The WB network is already running weekly
repeats of the series on Sunday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Watson plays Matt Camden, the oldest son of the sizable brood
being raised by Eric (Stephen Collins), a minister, and Annie
(Catherine Hicks). Though the show is produced by Aaron Spelling,
noted jigglemeister and teen-soap impresario, by his standards it's
downright wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   So is Watson, who came to Hollywood in 1989 at age 15 _ and
promptly turned tail and returned to his Texas home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too young,'' he admits today.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, he gave acting another shot
and, after appearing on shows such as ``Malibu Shores,''
``Baywatch'' and ``The Nanny,'' landed in ``Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is just a lead-up to the real scoop on Watson,
which is the matter of Bucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got everybody calling me `Bucky' on `7th Heaven,''' he
explains, ``because Stephen Collins and I kind of get away from
what's scripted sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this whole thing for a spin-off called `Bucky and the
Rev,''' he continues deadpan, ``where he and I are on the streets
fighting crime. He calls me Bucky and he's the Rev, so it's Bucky
and the Rev. And this is a story line I would like to get on the
show _ when the cops can't get it done, they call Bucky and the
Rev.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson brought Bucky with him to the set of ``Mrs. Tingle,''
written and directed by Kevin Williamson, creator of ``Dawson's
Creek'' and screenwriter of ``Scream'' (1996) and ``Scream 2''
(1997). ``Dawson'' debutante Katie Holmes stars as an honors
student alternately menaced by and menacing an uptight teacher
played by Helen Mirren.
</P>
<P>
   Mirren may be a highly respected veteran of the prestigious
British stage _ and the popular ``Prime Suspect'' television series
_ but she got the point of Bucky immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been called Bucky on the set, Helen is now Lulu,''
he says. ``And don't tell Stephen Collins this, but she wants to do
a spin-off called `Bucky and Lulu.' And I kind of like it better,
because I think that Helen could kick Stephen Collins' ass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing a big struggle scene with her, and Helen was
slapping me around,'' he adds, laughing. ``My jaw is just finally
feeling better from a week and a half ago. So maybe I might say,
`Screw Stephen,' and have `Bucky and Lulu.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, who wants to see a reverend fight crime?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there was ``The Father Dowling Mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' he admits. ``Actually, you know what? I think
Tom Bosley might kick Stephen's ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, you might gather that Watson would be something
of a handful on a wholesome, religious-themed show such as ``7th
Heaven.'' And he does seem to bristle at its conventions, though he
admires its sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ```7th Heaven' is what it is, and it's a great show,'' he says.
``We've done some really, really great episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it can only go so far,'' he adds. ``You can only go so far
with certain scripts, because the audience wants to laugh or they
want to cry, and they want to see something sweet at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ministers have kids,'' Watson says, ``and their kids are going
to act wild and do stupid things. I haven't got to the point yet
where my character's doing stuff that's really rebellious, even
though I'm supposed to be the rebel of the show. I'm still
waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebellious like what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to kill the dog,'' he says deadpan. ``I wanna kill. I
want Matt Camden to kill Happy and not care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have all these letters from animal-rights activists, and I
love animals _ but I just think it'd be funny if I killed the
dog,'' he says gleefully. ``I see Emmy-award-winning show right
there, all over the place!''
</P>
<P>
   It might even be edgy.

by clicking on and discovering that it hasn't even left Albuquerque
yet.

 By WILLIAM SAFIRE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``Even in survival,'' wrote Jim Hoagland of The Washington Post,
``Clinton will emerge from this experience chastised if not
chastened, humiliated if not humbled.''
 &HT;    Now there is a serious challenge to synonymists by a serious
foreign-affairs columnist (even though he uses the reader-friendly
``Jim'' in his byline, which would raise the eyebrow of a bygone
era's Walt Lippmann).
 &HT;    Chaste is from the Latin ``castus,'' or ``pure,'' and chasten
means ``to make pure'' by some mode of discipline, with the
positive connotation of being strengthened by moral correction
(``whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth''). Chastise, as well as
castigate, comes from the Latin ``castigare,'' which adds the force
of ``-igare,'' or ``agere,'' or ``to drive'' to the purifying.
 &HT;    Although both verbs mean ``to correct by punishment or
reproof,'' ``chastise'' adds coercion or severity to the moral
instruction in ``chasten.''
 &HT;    In the synonymy of censure, then, punish implies ``to penalize
for disobedience to authority''; the verb discipline suggests ``to
subjugate or bring under control''; chasten means ``to strengthen
by setting straight''; chastise, ``to inflict some coercion in
correction''; correct, ``to straighten for the purpose of reform'';
and castigate, ``to tongue-lash or rebuke severely.''
 &HT;    As I parse the subtle Hoagland, his ``chastised if not
chastened'' means ``corrected but not truly purified,'' or
``punished but not made chaste.''
 &HT;    What about ``humiliated if not humbled''? If you're a gardener,
you know what ``humus'' is: that deliciously decomposed plant or
animal manure that, mixed with your backyard's flavorless dirt,
gives an organic boost to the roots of your flowers. It is also the
Latin word for ``earth, ground,'' and is the root of both
``humble'' and ``humiliate,'' words that suggest the bringing of
someone down to the ground, sometimes to the extent of figuratively
grinding his face in the dirt.
 &HT;    The verb ``to humble'' originally meant ``to make meek,'' as in
Valentine's profession of awed affection in ``The Two Gentlemen of
Verona'': ``O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,/And hath so
humbled me, as, I confess,/There is no woe to his correction.''
Now, however, it is part of the lingo of abasement.
 &HT;    Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms has an uplifting entry
on ``abasement.'' After running through ``demean'' (loss of
dignity), ``debase'' (deterioration in value) and the Pentagon's
favorite new word, ``degrade'' (``conveys a strong implication of
the shamefulness of the condition to which someone or something has
been reduced'' _ take that, Saddam), M-W comes to ``humble.''
 &HT;    ``Frequently used in place of `degrade','' synonymizes the
philological hairsplitter, ``in the sense of `demote' when the
ignominy of the reduction in rank is emphasized ... but often
suggests a salutary increase of humility or the realization of
one's own littleness or impotence.''
 &HT;    But ``humiliate,'' which used to be a synonym of ``humble,'' has
gained a more forceful meaning of taking someone down: ``comes
closer to `mortify,' for it stresses chagrin and shame.''
 &HT;    Therefore, when Hoagland writes that Mr. Clinton has been
```humiliated' if not `humbled','' I think he's saying that others
have ``demeaned, debased, degraded'' the president, but he remains
neither ``defeated'' nor newly possessed of a sense of meekness and
humility.
 &HT;    Whew! What a spectrum of meaning some columnists can pack in a
single burst of alliteration.

 FULSOME APOLOGY  
 &HT;    When Sen.-elect Charles Schumer of New York told the Judiciary
Committee that the president had already made a ``fulsome apology''
_ intended to mean ``copious, complete, full'' _ usagists like
Alistair Cooke winced.
 &HT;    Throughout nine decades of speaking good English, the former BBC
commentator knew that the word meant nothing of the sort. On almost
the contrary, he and other incensed hearings-watchers told me on
voice mail, ``fulsome'' means ``excessive, cloying,'' even
``disgusting.''
 &HT;    Centuries ago, the original meaning of ``full'' in that word had
been influenced by ``foul.'' Surely the Clinton defender could not
have intended to leave the impression that the apology reeked. Had
the senator-elect erred?
 &HT;    Two great dictionaries disagree. Webster's New World, now
published by Macmillan, has as its first definition, ``disgusting
or offensive, especially because excessive or insincere (fulsome
praise).'' But then it reports a second meaning: ``(apparent
revival of the original sense, obsolete since 16th century) full;
ample; abundant: usage objected to by some.''
 &HT;    Now to Merriam-Webster, whose patron saint, Noah himself,
defined it in 1828 as ``gross: disgusting by plainness, grossness
or excess; as fullsome flattery or praise.''
 &HT;    In the 10th Collegiate Edition, M-W turns the tables. Its first
definition is ``characterized by abundance: copious.'' Only in its
second sense do we get ``esthetically, morally or generally
offensive.'' It then gives other pejorative senses as ``effusive''
and ``overdone'' before swinging back to ``generous in amount.'' A
usage note is added: ``Unless the context is made very clear, the
reader or hearer cannot be sure whether such an expression as
'fulsome' praise'' means ``copious'' or ``offensive.''
 &HT;    This commentator says: If you mean ``full,'' say ``full,' or if
you want to put your thumb on the upscale, ``copious.'' But if you
mean ``gross,'' say ``gross'' or ``yucky,'' or try an expletive
like ``feh!'' Never refer to a ``fulsome'' bosom unless you want to
get slugged by an intelligent female. Indeed, cross ``fulsome'' off
your list entirely. Phooey on ambiguity. Never be of two minds
about ambivalence.

 By SILVANA PATERNOSTRO  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Driving down 23rd Street, Havana's main strip, in a Volkswagen
convertible with David Calzado at the wheel is a little like
cruising Sunset Boulevard with Puff Daddy.
 &HT;    Every man, woman and child waiting for the bus, pedaling a
Chinese bicycle or just walking waves, smiles, screams or tries to
touch the leader of Charanga Habanera, the hottest and most
controversial dance band on the island. Even the lucky few with
cars honk.
 &HT;    Calzado takes his stardom in stride. He blows kisses. He waves
and honks back. He high-fives with a man in a pre-Castro American
jalopy and accelerates his silver convertible with the fat mag
wheels. His VW is 10 years old, but hip, rare and luxurious in
Havana. His new red-white-and-blue Tommy Hilfiger shirt sticks to
his chest.
 &HT;    ``I love this country,'' he says. ``If it weren't for the fact
that I have to play outside to make money, I would never leave. But
you know, I have gotten used to expensive things.''
 &HT;    He likes to dress in ``ropa de marca,'' designer labels, such as
the new Pelle Pelle jeans and the black Nikes he is wearing. He
would like to buy a Mitsubishi four-door and install three TV
miniscreens inside. ``It would be the first car with television in
Havana,'' he says.
 &HT;    Fidel Castro's government insists that Cuba is a socialist
society. But with the blessing of the Central Committee, a small
number of musicians today have more _ much more _ than the rest of
the 11 million Cubans who live on the island. They are the first
professionals in almost four decades _ since Castro drove out the
tobacco and sugar barons, the mafiosi and the American corporations
_ to accumulate wealth, the first Cubans allowed to be independent
businessmen and rich capitalists, even if they are not allowed to
invest in their own country.
 &HT;    This preferential treatment coincides with the country's loss of
Soviet support. Before 1989, musicians were allocated good houses
and had the possibility of traveling abroad and earning a per diem,
but at home they were paid as ``workers of the Revolution,'' just
like sugar-cane cutters, high-school teachers or tobacco rollers.
 &HT;    Today a handful of them, particularly those who, like Calzado,
play popular dance music, are treated like stars. Paulito FG, a
self-taught singer and dandy who is turning Cuban teen-age girls
into screaming fans, Manolin Gonzalez Hernandez, known as the
Doctor of Salsa, a 33-year-old physician turned salsa star; and
Calzado himself are living extravagantly _ in Cuban terms, at
least.
 &HT;    In Havana, the billboards still proclaim ``Socialism or Death,''
but the streets seem more like an incipient Hollywood.
 &HT;    Calzado is taking me to El Aljibe, his favorite restaurant,
where an all-you-can-eat meal of delicious chicken in orange sauce,
rice, beans, salad and flan costs $14 a head, the monthly salary of
a heart surgeon. It is the lunch spot of high-ranking government
officials, foreign businessmen, journalists and tourists. The
waitress kisses him on the cheek and directs us to his regular
table.
 &HT;    Calzado removes his sunglasses and places them next to his car
keys and a leather billfold. His cell phone does not stop ringing.
His manager calls several times. The Music Institute wants Charanga
to play twice this week _ first for the employees of the Ministry
of the Interior and then at Pabexpo, the convention center where
the government is concluding the First International Construction
Fair.
 &HT;    These duties fall under the band's job description as state
musicians, for which they are paid a monthly salary of about $30.
But what Calzado really wants to know is whether the band is
confirmed to play at El Palacio de la Salsa, the hot dance club
where the cover charge is $20 and the patrons are, mostly, foreign
men and Cuban women.
 &HT;    Calzado, at 42, is almost precisely as old as Castro's
revolution. He grew up pledging at school every day to be a
``pioneer for communism'' and promising ``to be like Che.'' He
fought in Angola.
 &HT;    While he has a third serving of the chicken and asks the
waitress for extra yuca sticks, I ask him how he feels about the
noticeable differences between him and his fans, about reconciling
his revolutionary education with his newly acquired life style.
 &HT;    He answers by quoting his Spanish producer, from whom he learns
his capitalist cues: ``We have to get used to the fact that some
have and others have less. Equality doesn't mean that we all have
the same but that we each have what we deserve, that we have what
we work for,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``Plus, I have to be on top. My admirers want me to be the best,
and that means I have to be the best dressed, to drive the best
car. I cannot let them down.''
 &HT;    The check arrives and I insist on paying.
 &HT;    ``Please,'' he insists. ``This is nothing for me. Look, it's
just $30. You should see what I pay when the music producers come
from abroad and we are a big table. I like to do that. I don't like
that everyone thinks that Cubans can't pay for their own lunches.''
 &HT;    He opens his wallet with the mystery and mysticism of someone
about to reveal something very illegal or very precious. ``I always
pay with one of these.''
 &HT;    ``A check,'' I say. ``Not very many people in Cuba have them,
right? I bet, fewer than those with cell phones.''
 &HT;    He nods with satisfaction. ``Yes,'' he says. ``Next I would like
a credit card. But, I don't really understand yet how they work.''
 &HT;    Cuba has always been a musical cradle. It was here that the
traditional ``son,'' as well as the mambo and the cha-cha-cha that
took dancers by storm in the '50s, were born. Beny More, Arsenio
Rodriguez and Perez Prado, the forefathers of what is today known
as salsa, were all Cubans. The famous Havana nights of the '50s,
usually associated with gambling, prostitution and cigar-smoking
mafiosi, were also filled with great music.
 &HT;    One of Fidel Castro's first acts after seizing power was to
undermine dance music, hoping to erase the image of Cuba as a party
place for Americans. But communism was not able to kill music, and
it might be the only thing left for many. The Special Period _
Castro's euphemism for the years since the loss of Soviet subsidies
_ has brought hardship and discontentment. Gone are the days of
Bulgarian baby food and cans of ``carne rusa,'' the Russian Spam
that Cubans today recall with nostalgia.
 &HT;    A recent Mexican poll reports that 76 percent of Cubans feel
their economic situation has never been as bad as it is now. There
may be blackouts, shortages of gasoline, even rationing of rum, but
there is still music. News is scarce on TV but there are plenty of
music shows. Paychecks are meager but state-organized afternoon
parties with live music abound.
 &HT;    Calzado tells me that when his band plays in the countryside the
only people who stay home are the elderly and the newborns.
``Charanga drags as many people to the Revolution Square of
Santiago as Fidel Castro,'' he says.
 &HT;    The music that Charanga plays is called timba, and it is a
combination of jazz and rumba spiced with reggae, funk and hiphop.
Although rooted in the traditional elements of the ``son'' (a
guitar-driven, brass-laced Cuban rhythm), it sounds as different
from the music of old Havana as rap does from the Ronettes. Timba
is the modern mambo, a hard-edged cha-cha-cha, designed to make the
stiffest of dancers want to get up and try.
 &HT;    ``It is based on `son,' but it is more African, more
percussive,'' says Ned Sublette, a Texas-born singer-songwriter who
started one of the first American record labels for Cuban music.
``It is sophisticated dance music.''
 &HT;    Timba is the sound of the new post-Soviet Cuba; the music of the
Special Period. It is the voice of average Cubans, of those who
allow their ``cubania'' _ the Cuban identity that combines a joy of
life, a sensuousness, a macho attitude _ to seep out.
 &HT;    ``We are about `la alegria' that Cubans have even when they do
not have anything,'' says Paulito FG as he puffs on a midmorning
cigar and crosses his legs to display Mickey Mouse socks. ``Here
people sing all the time, even while they clean.''
 &HT;    While Granma, Cuba's official newspaper, fills its pages with
Castro's long speeches, party memorandums and articles about the
future of the sugar harvest, timba depicts everyday life in this
new Cuba where dollars now compete with dialectics. Forty years of
Marxism have not been able to strip the Cuban soul of its
Afro-Cuban musical essence. Timba is playful, joyous, sensual.
 &HT;    ``The revolution wanted to make a new country, even with our
music,'' says Manolin, the Doctor of Salsa, one of the most
outspoken and political of the timberos. ``They tried to take away
the `son' and impose on us `trova.'''
 &HT;    He is referring to nueva trova, '60s-vintage folk-type music
with messages of loving the revolution and hating ``yanqui''
imperialism. A society that once sang songs praising universal
brotherhood, that inspired a whole generation from Mexico to
Argentina, today sings superhits about women who prefer being kept.
 &HT;    ``Trova is the music of intellectuals, not the music of the
people,'' Manolin says. ``Here we have to erect a monument to the
`son.' The queen of this country is our traditional music. Here
most people don't have the mind to decipher what the trovadores are
trying to say. We do it in our street language _ straightforward
and direct.''
 &HT;    The timberos sing about neighborhood gossip, about couples
fighting, about consumption and materialism. One popular timba song
is titled ``The Shopping Maniac.'' Another is ``The Supertourist,''
about a Cuban girl who only likes to go to expensive places, places
that only a tourist can afford to take her to.
 &HT;    In another, Charanga advises young women to find themselves a
sugar daddy _ ``like Calzado, so that you can have, so that you can
enjoy. A `papirriqui con wanikiki''' _ a sugar daddy with dough.
``I changed the name of money in Cuba,'' Calzado says. Today, when
Cubans refer to dollars, they call them wanikikis. When I asked
18-year-old Michel M. Marquez, Charanga's lead singer, what he
thought about Che, he shrugged his shoulders. ``I can't think
anything,'' he said. ``He was dead when I was born.''
 &HT;    That is very much the sentiment of the new generation, and timba
songs reflect that apolitical attitude. But in a crucial way, these
salsa stars are quite political, subversively so. Manolin sings
about ``leaving behind the old mentality ... let's take a chance on
peace ... times are a-changing, you will see. I already have
friends in Miami.''
 &HT;    And Charanga uses an obvious metaphor in ``El Mango'': ``Hey,
you mango, we all loved you when you were green. Now that you are
yellow and old, isn't it time to fall from the tree?''
 &HT;    Still, in the inchoate political atmosphere of '90s Cuba, where
free enterprise is supported one day and savaged the next, lyrics
of nonconformity and protest, no matter how cleverly couched,
eventually create problems, as Charanga was to discover.
 &HT;    In July 1997, as the most popular band of the moment, they were
invited to be the closing act for the XIV Youth and Students World
Festival, a gathering advocating ``solidarity, anti-imperialism,
peace and friendship.'' They played outdoors for thousands of young
socialists from around the world. They performed as always _ jokes
with sexual innuendoes, Michel threatening to take off his pants,
allusions to drug-taking.
 &HT;    The next day, the curtain fell on Charanga. Cuba's hard-liners
were furious: the Federation of Cuban Women was appalled, the Union
of Young Communists was ``deeply offended'' and ``greatly
disappointed'' and the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television
banned them. They were labeled the ``kings of vulgarity'' and
forbidden to perform for six months.
 &HT;    ``They tell me that it was because it was a very capitalist
concert,'' Calzado says. ``But I don't know, when it comes to
putting together a show, what makes a capitalist or a Communist
show?''
 &HT;    Maybe the fact that they paid $5,000 to arrive at the concert in
a helicopter, or maybe the way the lanky Michel was moving.
 &HT;    ``But 4-year-olds in Cuba move their pelvis that way,'' Calzado
protests.
 &HT;    Charanga Habanera now charges up to $18,000 a week to perform in
Europe and is said to have signed a six-figure recording contract
with Universal in London. Most likely, Calzado, Paulito and Manolin
are not millionaires yet. But they make upward of $40,000 a year,
which is a lot more than the $2,000 the Doctor would have made in
his former profession.
 &HT;    Last fall, the government shut down the dollar-based night
clubs, including El Palacio de la Salsa. Just before that, I went
to hear Charanga play.
 &HT;    Housed in the Hotel Riviera, which was once owned by Meyer
Lansky, the Palacio in fact was a dark room with old red-and-white
checkered tablecloths and metal chairs, reeking of cigarette butts
and stale beer.
 &HT;    The lobby hustled and bustled with women of astonishing beauty
wearing more bright Lycra than I've ever seen outside of a gym. The
men were mostly middle-aged foreigners and a few Cuban men, dressed
in snappy clothes. One of the Cubans flashed a gold front tooth;
another wore a thick gold chain with a dollar sign dangling on his
chest.
 &HT;    That night the songs had no political double meaning, no
provocative allusion to money or drugs. It was one of Charanga's
first performances after a six-month suspension.
 &HT;    ``Charanga is not operating at full speed,'' Calzado told me.
And in a press statement he proclaimed that they ``profoundly
regret that our performance created a disagreeable image, because
that was not our intention.''
 &HT;    This was the equivalent of Marilyn Manson apologizing to Tipper
Gore. But there were reasons to defer. With everything boiling down
to money, not being able to tour in Europe would destroy the life
style to which Calzado so rapidly accustomed himself.
 &HT;    He would have to survive on the $30 _ 360 pesos _ he receives
from the government every month, which at the moment he just turns
over to his mother.
 &HT;    ``She still lives in pesos. I live in dollars,'' he said.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Driving down 23rd Street, Havana's main strip, in a Volkswagen
convertible with David Calzado at the wheel is a little like
cruising Sunset Boulevard with Puff Daddy.
 &HT;    Every man, woman and child waiting for the bus, pedaling a
Chinese bicycle or just walking waves, smiles, screams or tries to
touch the leader of Charanga Habanera, the hottest and most
controversial dance band on the island. Even the lucky few with
cars honk.
 &HT;    Calzado takes his stardom in stride. He blows kisses. He waves
and honks back. He high-fives with a man in a pre-Castro American
jalopy and accelerates his silver convertible with the fat mag
wheels. His VW is 10 years old, but hip, rare and luxurious in
Havana. His new red-white-and-blue Tommy Hilfiger shirt sticks to
his chest.
 &HT;    ``I love this country,'' he says. ``If it weren't for the fact
that I have to play outside to make money, I would never leave. But
you know, I have gotten used to expensive things.''
 &HT;    He likes to dress in ``ropa de marca,'' designer labels, such as
the new Pelle Pelle jeans and the black Nikes he is wearing. He
would like to buy a Mitsubishi four-door and install three TV
miniscreens inside. ``It would be the first car with television in
Havana,'' he says.
 &HT;    Fidel Castro's government insists that Cuba is a socialist
society. But with the blessing of the Central Committee, a small
number of musicians today have more _ much more _ than the rest of
the 11 million Cubans who live on the island. They are the first
professionals in almost four decades _ since Castro drove out the
tobacco and sugar barons, the mafiosi and the American corporations
_ to accumulate wealth, the first Cubans allowed to be independent
businessmen and rich capitalists, even if they are not allowed to
invest in their own country.
 &HT;    This preferential treatment coincides with the country's loss of
Soviet support. Before 1989, musicians were allocated good houses
and had the possibility of traveling abroad and earning a per diem,
but at home they were paid as ``workers of the Revolution,'' just
like sugar-cane cutters, high-school teachers or tobacco rollers.
 &HT;    Today a handful of them, particularly those who, like Calzado,
play popular dance music, are treated like stars. Paulito FG, a
self-taught singer and dandy who is turning Cuban teen-age girls
into screaming fans, Manolin Gonzalez Hernandez, known as the
Doctor of Salsa, a 33-year-old physician turned salsa star; and
Calzado himself are living extravagantly _ in Cuban terms, at
least.
 &HT;    In Havana, the billboards still proclaim ``Socialism or Death,''
but the streets seem more like an incipient Hollywood.
 &HT;    Calzado is taking me to El Aljibe, his favorite restaurant,
where an all-you-can-eat meal of delicious chicken in orange sauce,
rice, beans, salad and flan costs $14 a head, the monthly salary of
a heart surgeon. It is the lunch spot of high-ranking government
officials, foreign businessmen, journalists and tourists. The
waitress kisses him on the cheek and directs us to his regular
table.
 &HT;    Calzado removes his sunglasses and places them next to his car
keys and a leather billfold. His cell phone does not stop ringing.
His manager calls several times. The Music Institute wants Charanga
to play twice this week _ first for the employees of the Ministry
of the Interior and then at Pabexpo, the convention center where
the government is concluding the First International Construction
Fair.
 &HT;    These duties fall under the band's job description as state
musicians, for which they are paid a monthly salary of about $30.
But what Calzado really wants to know is whether the band is
confirmed to play at El Palacio de la Salsa, the hot dance club
where the cover charge is $20 and the patrons are, mostly, foreign
men and Cuban women.
 &HT;    Calzado, at 42, is almost precisely as old as Castro's
revolution. He grew up pledging at school every day to be a
``pioneer for communism'' and promising ``to be like Che.'' He
fought in Angola.
 &HT;    While he has a third serving of the chicken and asks the
waitress for extra yuca sticks, I ask him how he feels about the
noticeable differences between him and his fans, about reconciling
his revolutionary education with his newly acquired life style.
 &HT;    He answers by quoting his Spanish producer, from whom he learns
his capitalist cues: ``We have to get used to the fact that some
have and others have less. Equality doesn't mean that we all have
the same but that we each have what we deserve, that we have what
we work for,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``Plus, I have to be on top. My admirers want me to be the best,
and that means I have to be the best dressed, to drive the best
car. I cannot let them down.''
 &HT;    The check arrives and I insist on paying.
 &HT;    ``Please,'' he insists. ``This is nothing for me. Look, it's
just $30. You should see what I pay when the music producers come
from abroad and we are a big table. I like to do that. I don't like
that everyone thinks that Cubans can't pay for their own lunches.''
 &HT;    He opens his wallet with the mystery and mysticism of someone
about to reveal something very illegal or very precious. ``I always
pay with one of these.''
 &HT;    ``A check,'' I say. ``Not very many people in Cuba have them,
right? I bet, fewer than those with cell phones.''
 &HT;    He nods with satisfaction. ``Yes,'' he says. ``Next I would like
a credit card. But, I don't really understand yet how they work.''
 &HT;    Cuba has always been a musical cradle. It was here that the
traditional ``son,'' as well as the mambo and the cha-cha-cha that
took dancers by storm in the '50s, were born. Beny More, Arsenio
Rodriguez and Perez Prado, the forefathers of what is today known
as salsa, were all Cubans. The famous Havana nights of the '50s,
usually associated with gambling, prostitution and cigar-smoking
mafiosi, were also filled with great music.
 &HT;    One of Fidel Castro's first acts after seizing power was to
undermine dance music, hoping to erase the image of Cuba as a party
place for Americans. But communism was not able to kill music, and
it might be the only thing left for many. The Special Period _
Castro's euphemism for the years since the loss of Soviet subsidies
_ has brought hardship and discontentment. Gone are the days of
Bulgarian baby food and cans of ``carne rusa,'' the Russian Spam
that Cubans today recall with nostalgia.
 &HT;    A recent Mexican poll reports that 76 percent of Cubans feel
their economic situation has never been as bad as it is now. There
may be blackouts, shortages of gasoline, even rationing of rum, but
there is still music. News is scarce on TV but there are plenty of
music shows. Paychecks are meager but state-organized afternoon
parties with live music abound.
 &HT;    Calzado tells me that when his band plays in the countryside the
only people who stay home are the elderly and the newborns.
``Charanga drags as many people to the Revolution Square of
Santiago as Fidel Castro,'' he says.
 &HT;    The music that Charanga plays is called timba, and it is a
combination of jazz and rumba spiced with reggae, funk and hiphop.
Although rooted in the traditional elements of the ``son'' (a
guitar-driven, brass-laced Cuban rhythm), it sounds as different
from the music of old Havana as rap does from the Ronettes. Timba
is the modern mambo, a hard-edged cha-cha-cha, designed to make the
stiffest of dancers want to get up and try.
 &HT;    ``It is based on `son,' but it is more African, more
percussive,'' says Ned Sublette, a Texas-born singer-songwriter who
started one of the first American record labels for Cuban music.
``It is sophisticated dance music.''
 &HT;    Timba is the sound of the new post-Soviet Cuba; the music of the
Special Period. It is the voice of average Cubans, of those who
allow their ``cubania'' _ the Cuban identity that combines a joy of
life, a sensuousness, a macho attitude _ to seep out.
 &HT;    ``We are about `la alegria' that Cubans have even when they do
not have anything,'' says Paulito FG as he puffs on a midmorning
cigar and crosses his legs to display Mickey Mouse socks. ``Here
people sing all the time, even while they clean.''
 &HT;    While Granma, Cuba's official newspaper, fills its pages with
Castro's long speeches, party memorandums and articles about the
future of the sugar harvest, timba depicts everyday life in this
new Cuba where dollars now compete with dialectics. Forty years of
Marxism have not been able to strip the Cuban soul of its
Afro-Cuban musical essence. Timba is playful, joyous, sensual.
 &HT;    ``The revolution wanted to make a new country, even with our

 By LYNN HIRSCHBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's around 2 o'clock on Halloween morning, four hours outside
of Cleveland on Interstate 80, and Sean Penn, who is behind the
wheel of a rented Olds 88, is saying what he has been saying for
days, weeks, years.
 &HT;    ``This is it,'' he says. ``I'm not going to act in movies
again.''
 &HT;    In Hollywood, which is the place where he has said this the
most, it is understood less as an announcement of a retirement he
never quite sticks to than as a frequently repeated existential
declaration of his unhappiness with the movie business and the
films it makes now.
 &HT;    Jack Nicholson, a close friend of Penn's, says: ``He won't quit.
But let him whirl around, saying he's quitting. Sean is brilliant,
but, of course, we know that's no solace for anybody.''
 &HT;    Warren Beatty, another close friend, says: ``He's not going to
give up acting. What Sean means is that he would like to give up
the thought of making the brand of picture that opens big on a
Friday night.''
 &HT;    Many in Hollywood also understand that Penn _ who, for all his
world-weariness, is only 38 _ may be the best actor of his
generation, and also the most influential, a role model for the
likes of Matt Damon and Edward Norton. And for all his talk of
quitting he has been very busy this year, with roles in two new
movies _ ``Hurlyburly,'' a dark drama about the male psyche, based
on a play by David Rabe, and ``The Thin Red Line,'' the
much-heralded return of the director Terrence Malick, whose last
movie was ''Days of Heaven,'' in 1978.
 &HT;    Penn is also starring in a Woody Allen movie now being completed
in and around New York, a period piece in which Penn plays a jazz
guitarist. Penn, who has never played the guitar, learned the
fingering for 30 songs in two months.
 &HT;    ``I have these nightmares,'' he says, lighting an American
Spirit cigarette somewhere in Pennsylvania in the middle of the
night. ``I'm trying to play a solo and my fingers can't find the
strings.''
 &HT;    Penn drags on the cigarette, opening the window slightly so he
can blow out the smoke. When Penn is bothered, his features seem to
narrow _ his bright blue eyes become small pinpoints; his mouth
sets in a clench. It's an expression he has often worn in his
movies.
 &HT;    From the guilty murderer on death row in ``Dead Man Walking'' to
the corrupted son who betrays his vicious father in ``At Close
Range,'' from the misfit, would-be spy in ``The Falcon and the
Snowman'' to the lovesick, half-crazy husband in ``She's So
Lovely,'' Penn has made a career of playing complicated and, more
important, unredeemed characters.
 &HT;    He is, in all ways, the opposite of the Toms. Where Cruise and
Hanks take only parts in which they are likable or heroic or both,
Penn is attracted to darkness _ men who are caught up in the sort
of struggles that will never be resolved neatly or with a
million-dollar smile. He likes to play messy guys, even if today's
audience prefers a simpler approach, a happy ending.
 &HT;    ``Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks are a symptom, a sign of a
demographic study,'' says one famed Hollywood actor, who would love
to work with either. ``They are giving the public what they want.
And that's not bad. But Sean is a genius. He gets it in a different
way. And I don't think it's important that they get him.''
 &HT;    ``The climate is always changing,'' says Nicholson, who is
probably the only big box-office actor who can play an unrepentant
jerk, as he did in ``As Good as It Gets,'' and still be considered
lovable. ``And, sure, there are always going to be limitations on
the popularity of any theatrical event. But it comes in all shapes,
and Sean knows that. My own sense is that these big melodramas,
these action films, would have peaked with the conservative
movement, but I was wrong about that.
 &HT;    ``Sean gets discouraged, but all this will change. Just as
fashion moves, the movies will move. And any worthwhile actor isn't
thinking about melodramas anyway. They want to have a body of
work.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    ```He's one part cowboy,'' says Madonna, whom Penn always refers
to not by name but as ``my first wife.'' ``Sean is a cowboy poet.''
 &HT;    He is also a throwback to the sort of men _ tough, thoughtful,
somewhat dangerous, full of inchoate feeling _ who haunt the songs
of Bruce Springsteen and the writings of Charles Bukowski.
 &HT;    Penn is romantic about America and the kind of questing spirit
that finds solace driving fast on an open highway or crashing in a
small-town motel room or drinking late in an all-night bar. He also
seems to go out of his way to cultivate this image, perhaps to
build for himself a place he'd rather be than late-'90s Hollywood.
He is dismayed by the marketplace, by directors he has worked with
and by talented actors who, Penn says, have sold their talent on
the cheap by appearing in sure-fire megablockbusters for the
payday.
 &HT;    People say that Penn could be making $6 million, $8 million a
picture _ not the money the Toms make, but big money _ if he had
constructed his career with that in mind. Instead, people in the
industry believe, he worked for scale _ probably $150,000 _ in
making ``Hurlyburly'' and was probably paid around $300,000 for
``Thin Red Line.''
 &HT;    ``Nic Cage is no longer an actor,'' he says. ``He could be
again, but now he's more like a ... performer.'' Penn lights
another cigarette. ``Don't get me wrong, I would like to get paid,
but I don't know what you do with anything over $10 million. After
that, it doesn't make any sense to me.
 &HT;    ``And at a certain point,'' he continues, ``it's just, do you
want to be around the people? There's times when it's just
excruciating.''
 &HT;    Mostly Penn doesn't sense a lot of passion, not in mainstream
Hollywood now.
 &HT;    ``It's a bad time for acting,'' he says. ``Movies break down
into the expressive and the impressive. And the impressive has
pretty well taken over the box office. The thing film actors of my
generation are most afraid of is being found out to be a fraud.
Even the ones that aren't frauds think they are.
 &HT;    ``That's why so many people succumb to a mass embrace. It makes
them feel protected against the anxiety that they may not have
anything to share. Some of them do have something to share, but
they've given it up.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    Penn did most of his growing up in Malibu. His mother, Eileen
Ryan, is an actress (she played his grandmother in ``At Close
Range''), and his father, Leo Penn, who died in autumn, was a film
and television director. Penn went to Santa Monica High School,
where he met, surfed and hung out with Emilio Estevez and Charlie
Sheen. He began directing Super 8 movies in high school, never
intending to act.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't get enough people to fill out the casts,'' Penn
explained to me one afternoon more than four years ago. ``And then
I really started getting into acting _ I would call it an
obsession. I started to see the craft of it and I wanted to get a
handle on that craft.''
 &HT;    But he was disillusioned by the movie business, he said. He was
emotional; it wasn't a cool sort of unhappiness.
 &HT;    ``When I started out, I thought anything was possible, but now I
realize the studios don't know anything. These are not literary
minds. They don't recognize anything that's not on their computer.
Every single person who works for the studios is stupid. I've never
heard an intelligent comment on a script or a movie. Not one. It
makes you angry.''
 &HT;    But now, driving on the Interstate, I ask: ``What was the most
extreme time of your life?''
 &HT;    Penn smiles. ``I fear answering that question on the grounds
that I might become romantic about villainy.'' He's a little
distracted _ he's actually looking to see if there are signs about
passing lanes.
 &HT;    ``Look,'' he continues, ``I had a couple of stages of tempting
fate, as it was. I was lonely. It's that thing _ you're never
lonelier than when you are in a crowd and you're never in a crowd
more often than when you're lonely. And that's the epitome of
self-destruction.''
 &HT;    In 1987 Penn served 34 days in jail for punching an extra on the
set of ``Colors'' who was trying to take his picture. The incident
was not unusual: Penn spent most of his marriage to Madonna
aggressively shielding her from the paparazzi. Since Lady Diana's
death, Penn believes, his assault has been vindicated. The Screen
Actors Guild invited him to appear on a panel about privacy and the
press.
 &HT;    ``I'm not out there like some kind of madman, but just have
somebody follow you around all the time,'' he says. ``When somebody
with a prettier face than mine gets killed in a tunnel then it's,
ooh, we have to do something. But, bottom line, the paparazzi's
abusive freedom of the press will be protected more enduringly than
the individual's.''
 &HT;    Most of Penn's press skirmishes occurred when he was with
Madonna. During their wedding, he took out his rifle and shot at
the helicopters.
 &HT;    ``People started to think I was a jerk,'' Penn says now. ``The
court forced me to go for therapy. It was ridiculous. I was
supposed to go there for alcoholism and a tendency toward violence.
The psychiatrist told them she couldn't treat me for those things.
I'm not an alcoholic _ I'm just a big drinker, and there's a
difference. Now my actions wouldn't be seen the same way. But,
then, I was a pariah. I was diminishing my position.''
 &HT;    During his time in jail, Penn says he read, in one two-day
stretch, the essays of Montaigne, a novel by William Burroughs,
some Raymond Carver short stories and the collected works of James
Thurber. ``I recommend Thurber for everyone in jail,'' he says.
 &HT;    When his time was finished, two friends drove up with a pizza to
pick him up. ``I was married to my first wife,'' Penn says. ``The
pizza was the nourishment on the ride home to the wife.''
 &HT;    ``She must have been happy to see you,'' I say.
 &HT;    Penn smiles. ``Not particularly,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``Were you happy to see her?''
 &HT;    ``That night?'' Penn jokes. ``Or the next morning?'' He laughs.
``Listen, it's not a comment on her. Just a comment on the state of
the marriage at the time. Going to jail is not good for any
marriage.''
 &HT;    Penn smiles. He may be calmer now, better able to spot trouble
on the horizon and hold his temper, but there's a strain of anger
in Penn that will never be completely quieted.
 &HT;    ``Sean's this mix of angry and funny,'' Nicholson says. ``I say,
'Sean, it's easier to be happy.'''
 &HT;    But Penn is happy. He likes to maintain a certain sense of
outrage. It's his way of being someone he can like; it's his way of
staying pure. This is the character he is most comfortable with,
the role he never tires of playing.
 -0- 
 &HT;    Penn's mobile phone rings. ``Speak to me of love,'' he says into
the receiver. It's his wife, Robin Wright Penn, calling from
California to check on the drive. She and their two children are
home in Marin County, north of San Francisco.
 &HT;    Penn and his wife, whose best-known role, perhaps, was playing
Jenny in ``Forrest Gump,'' met in 1989 on the set of ``State of
Grace.'' They fell in love and then battled for years, separating
for long periods of time. During one of those separations, I
happened to be at a party in New York, and Penn took over the room.
 &HT;    When the phone would ring, he'd answer and chat for 10, 15
minutes with the caller. He'd pretend to be a character, and he was
very funny. At one point he left the party, returning with an Irish
singer. The man was a poet and serenaded the room while Penn leaned
back in his chair, content. Penn left with the most beautiful girl
at the party.
 &HT;    ``Oh, yeah,'' he says, when I reminded him of the evening.
``That was then.''
 &HT;    He was always close to his kids and reunited with Robin in 1995.
``We got married at Art Linson's,'' Penn recalls. Linson has
produced two movies Penn has starred in, ``Fast Times at Ridgemont
High'' and ``Casualties of War,'' and is a good friend. ``He was
the best man, but my brother said, 'This isn't a wedding, this is
an HBO special,' because so many drunk actors got to talk.'' The
men Penn looks up to as role models were there _ Beatty, Marlon
Brando, Nicholson _ to toast their favorite son.
 &HT;    About two years ago, Penn and his wife decided to leave Los
Angeles for Marin County. ``It was good,'' Penn says of the move.
``I had a ghost on every corner at that point. There wasn't a
building in the city of Los Angeles I hadn't gone in at night and
walked out of in the daytime, shaking.'' Penn looks pensive. He
says, ``It's nice to go back and look at a corner and smile and
say, 'I lived through that one too.'''
 &HT;    At moments like this, as Penn is speeding through the night for
no particular reason and talking on and on like this, he is his own
movie. It must be hard to subsume all this for a film director, or
for anyone. You can see why Penn would be more attracted to writing
and directing his own films. He is planning to direct his next
movie in the spring. It will star Eddie Vedder, the lead singer of
Pearl Jam, on a road trip.
 &HT;    ``Is it autobiographical?'' I ask.
 &HT;    ``Isn't everything?'' he replies.

COMEDY MARKS ITS GOLDEN AGE ON TELEVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television is lame. There is nothing new. Been there, seen that.
The half-hour comedy is dead.
</P>
<P>
   All true, to a point. But there are fleshed-out sitcom
characters; they're just not flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
   We are, in fact, in a comedic golden age. With all due apologies
to Walt Disney, Chuck Jones and the giants of the 1930s and '40s,
we are now in an unsurpassed time for animation. This goes for
television as well as the movies.
</P>
<P>
   And we mean prime-time television, not the hyped-up Saturday
morning fare for the Cocoa Puffs crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoons allow writers to go to bizarre yet cogent extremes to
either make a point or get a laugh. Although the hyper-realism is
effective in animation, these outer limits just wouldn't work in
live-action comedies. Really, would you like to see the same
character savagely murdered and eaten by rats in a sitcom week
after week?
</P>
<P>
   Yet it works on ``South Park.'' To the list of worthy prime-time
animated comedies you can add two more: ``The PJs,'' which debuted
Sunday night on Fox and will run Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. Eastern
(check local listings) starting this week, and ``Dilbert,'' based
on the classic comic strip, which instantly becomes one of UPN's
best shows when it debuts Monday, Jan. 25, at 8 p.m. Eastern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJs'' is a funny, acerbic look at inner-city life using
the technology of foamation puppets and created by Eddie Murphy.
Murphy stars as the voice of Thurgood Stubbs, the cranky
superintendent of the Hilton-Jacobs Projects. And the
three-dimensional characters themselves sort of look like the
``California Raisins'' from those commercials of a decade or so
ago, especially since they come from the same production company.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Dilbert,'' if you ever read the comic strip about
office-life dysfunction, you will be up to speed on this animated
show. The comic strip and half-hour cartoon are virtually the same
_ except it is a lot harder to clip out a television show and tape
it to your cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   The two new shows join an already formidable list of nighttime
animated/Claymated offerings (arguably) being made for adults.
Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``South Park'' (Comedy Central): Crude, rude, and, at its
best, the funniest show on television. The show is struggling to
retain its first-year brilliance of last season.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' (Cartoon Network): My favorite
childhood cartoon (after, of course, my favorite actor ever, Bugs
Bunny) is now my favorite late night talk-show host on Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Celebrity Death Match'' (MTV): Hanson and the Spice Girls
literally eviscerate one another. Now that's entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``King of the Hill'' (Fox): You know Hank Hill. He lives down
the street from you, on the left. Yeah, that guy.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Bob and Margaret'' and ``Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist''
(Comedy Central): Cartoons for adults who really are adults.
</P>
<P>
   And we haven't mentioned the grandaddy, a show that has been
around since few in the country heard of Bill Clinton. Not only is
this comedy legendary animation, but it should now be examined in
the historical context as one of the greatest comedies in
television annals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'' has been around nine years now, five years past
the expected lifetime of a sitcom. What makes the run astonishing
is that the show has gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Sunday night staple, which grew out of a ``Tracey Ullman
Show'' skit, is now in syndication. Compare its new episodes with
ones of say, 1996: It's no contest. Today's Homer and crew win.
</P>
<P>
   There really is no time comparable to today: the 1962 season
comes closest with ``The Flintstones,'' ``The Jetsons,'' and the
lesser ``Beany &AMP; Cecil.''
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, for us nostalgic types, we have the whole Cartoon
Network, while Nickelodeon scores big with ``Rugrats'' (which
premieres a new season, and new baby Dil Jan. 18 at 8 p.m.
Eastern), ``Doug'' and ``Hey Arnold!''
</P>
<P>
   So remember that great television comedy is not dead. It's just
not real _ yet more realistic.

CORRUPTION SCANDAL JOLTS EUROPEAN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ Throughout its history, the central government of the
European Union has been one big yawn.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Today, staid Brussels is simmering with scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission, the bureaucracy that runs the EU, has
been rocked by charges of corruption, nepotism, and sleazy politics
reminiscent of New York City's Tammany Hall machine or Boston's
city government under James Michael Curley. About $5 billion of
last year's $107 billion budget cannot be accounted for. There are
assertions that untold billions have been squandered in fraud and
contracts to companies cozy with or related to some of the 20
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the European Parliament will vote whether to
dismiss the 20-member commission over the issue. The balloting
ensures that this situation will be considered the first major
corruption scandal to hit the European Union since the French
visionary Jean Monnet dreamed it up over 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, members of the European Parliament demanded that
two of the commissioners at the center of the allegations step down
to avoid Thursday's vote. Under European Union guidelines aimed at
avoiding factionalism, the Parliament cannot fire individual
commissioners but can vote out the entire commission.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Cresson, the former French prime minister who is now in
charge of education for the European Union, and Manuel Marin, who
heads the European Union's Third World development arm, refused to
resign, saying they have done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has been bubbling for months, but it exploded last
month when a Dutch auditor working for the commission sent a
34-page report to the Parliament charging that commissioners were
awarding contracts to friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament responded by refusing to approve the European
Commission's account of how it spent its 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners created even more enemies when they responded by
suspending the whistleblower, Paul van Buitenen, a civil servant
who says his only motivation is being an ``honest man.''
Commissioners said van Buitenen violated rules by leaking the
information.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension infuriated most of the 626-member Parliament,
though it remains unclear if there exists the two-thirds majority
necessary to get rid of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The timing could not be worse, with the European Union just
embarking on its most ambitious effort yet to create a United
States of Europe: the launch of a single currency in 11 of the 15
European Union countries. Already, those Britons opposed to Britain
joining the single currency have pointed to the scandal as evidence
that the nation would be unwise to surrender more of its
sovereignty to a bunch of corrupt bureaucrats in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Denman, the Englishman who served as the European
Commission's representative in Washington, said it would be foolish
for his countrymen to avoid further European integration because of
the scandal. If anything, Denman said, it is extraordinary that
there has not een a major scandal before.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the former lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government
at Harvard University does not dismiss the seriousness of the
scandal. He considers it, however, an inevitable part of the
maturation process of the European Union. And he sees the scandal's
roots not with Jacques Santer, the current European Commission
president, but with Santer's predecessor, Jacques Delors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delors was very good at politics. He wasn't good at
administration,'' said Denman.
</P>
<P>
   Denman said the scandal is a warning to the EU that it had
better implement tough sanctions for fraud and mismanagement found
within national governments or forego popular support for the
assumption of more responsibilities currently held by the national
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   This unfolding saga is as intriguing as Edwin O'Connor's ``The
Last Hurrah,'' the novel based on Curley's corrupt machine in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buitenen, who emerged from obscurity when he became the
whistleblower, asserted last  &UR; week &LR;  that his telephone was tapped
and that he was being followed by European Commission security
guards who trained rifles with telescopic lenses on him. He said he
fears for his life and has moved his family out of their home here.
</P>
<P>
   Cresson, 65, has always been mired in controversy. She once
suggested that most Englishmen are homosexual, and compared the
Japanese to ants. She dismisses allegations that staffers in her
department were routinely awarding contracts to friends and family
are part of a smear campaign against her.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the normally mild-mannered Santer was stunned
when the press conference he called here to defend his commission
was turned into an inquisition on his wife's real estate holdings.
A Belgian reporter asked if he had any comment about reports that
police in Luxembourg, where Santer was once prime minister, were
looking into claims of financial improprieties surrounding three
homes that the Santers own in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   At that same press conference, Finnish commission member Erkki
Liikanen defended his wife against charges that she is benefiting
from a contract she secured on behalf of the Finnish government
from the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Santer dared members of Parliament to censure him
and the commission. Now, his planned address to the Parliament may
be the only way to prevent the dismissal of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's defenders, including Alan Donnelly, leader of
the British Labour delegation in Strasbourg, insist that this is a
case of sloppy administration, not greed-driven corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Donnelly acknowledges that the commission has reform
itself. ``The commission,'' he said, ``has to realize that it has
to make a substantial improvement in its procedures.''

STARR SINKS EVEN LOWER IN SLEAZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- It is sick enough that Kenneth Starr has not only
advertised but actually timed a ``garbage'' indictment to influence
President Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But it is mind-boggling that Starr would do so while trying to
bury testimony by a witness who shreds the credibility of Kathleen
Willey, especially since Starr and House impeachment managers have
been bending heaven and earth to get Willey's allegations of a
presidential semi-assault into the Senate proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Starr got his headlines last week by arranging for the
indictment (on perjury and obstruction charges) of former Willey
close friend Julie Hiatt Steele on the same day the Senate
proceeding had its ceremonial commencement. And House Judiciary
Committee chairman Henry Hyde's impeachment minions used the
indictment to claim that the Willey case belongs in the Senate
trial and that it is another reason why a ``full'' trial with
witnesses is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is Hyde's credibility that is undermined by the
Willey case. There is an emerging, bipartisan consensus in the
Senate that Hyde should bear a heavy burden to show that he has
developed a case worthy of a full trial and that it is
well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   What Starr has tried to bury, ever since he received it last
April, is the grand jury testimony of a witness who puts the Willey
and Steele matters in a dramatically different light. The witness
is another former close friend of the Virginia woman, Harolyn
Cardozo, whom Willey called on her cellular telephone on the day in
question in 1993, when Willey later claimed she had been virtually
assaulted by the president in a hallway next to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had Willey's phone records, which showed the call was
placed to Cardozo and lasted 47 minutes, 4 seconds; and the records
resulted in a subpoena from the prosecutor's office. They did not,
however, result in the story that Starr wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with her testimony last April 4,
Cardozo contradicts Willey's story of an incident that left her
supposedly shaken, fearful, and full of fury and disgust as far as
Clinton was concerned. To the contrary, there was no story of
assault, but one about a woman who sounded pleased and anxious to
see the president as much as she could.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the testimony is that Willey was actively plotting over
the phone about how she could find ways to see him, including ways
of obtaining Mrs. Clinton's schedule in order to learn when she
would be away from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a seamy JFK reference, Willey was also alleged to have
said that if she played her cards right she could be the Judith
Campbell Exner of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Cardozo's testimony is especially significant because of the
length of the phone call. It is Steele's story that Willey _ in
addition to asking her to lie about her encounter with the
president _ also asked her to say that she had called Steele on her
cellular telephone to tell her what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   It is also significant because it corroborates the sworn
statements about the same, pleased Kathleen Willey that were made
by Linda Tripp, who appears to have been present for everything
that happened at the White House during Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   Cardozo was hauled back before the grand jury last month. At
this point, however, Starr was trying fruitlessly to develop dirt
on her father, bigtime Democratic Party fund-raiser Nathan Landow,
who also knew Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, however, has never tried to use her Democratic
connections (her husband is another prominent Democrat, Michael
Cardozo, who at one point chaired Clinton's defense fund) to
impeach her testimony. She was, after all, his witness, and his
investigators confirmed her close friendship at the time with
Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he tried to bury her testimony, while focusing his
oppressive resources on Julie Hiatt Steele in an invasive
investigation that included the circumstances of her child's
adoption in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   I'm convinced a first-year law student could smash Starr's case
against Steele, but its flimsy nature is irrelevant anyway. Its
real purpose is to pad the weak impeachment file.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if Starr had ever found anything directly culpable,
it would have been put into an official referral to the House
instantly. But as the entire history of his investigation shows,
not having a case does not prevent him and his House friends from
trying to make one anyway.

GUAM CAVE SCENE MAY BE ANCIENT CALENDAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Newly discovered cave paintings on the Pacific
island of Guam show what may be the earliest depictions of
astronomical knowledge recorded in that region, an astronomer
reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings, discovered just six weeks ago during a hike in
the countryside by University of Guam astronomer Rosina Iping, show
people gazing at specific constellations of stars and at what may
be a depiction of a unique 16-month calendar used by some early
Micronesian navigators.
</P>
<P>
   Iping described her findings here at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings are of particular interest because they represent
a separate and unusual development of astronomical knowledge and a
calendar very different from those developed in other early
cultures in China, Europe, and the Middle East. For one thing,
these early navigators, who routinely crossed wide stretches of
open ocean, developed a highly unusual calendar based on the
positions of stars. Most other peoples around the world based their
calendars on the movements of the sun or moon.
</P>
<P>
   The cave paintings have not yet been dated, but certainly were
made before the first Spanish ships arrived in the region five
centuries ago and may be far older, Iping said. Anthropologists
estimate that Guam was first populated at least 3,500 years ago by
the Chamorro people, whose paintings have been found in numerous
caves on the island and on other islands in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The cave that Iping stumbled upon while hiking on Guam's north
coast turned out to be one that was apparently used as an ancient
burial site, and she found some small fragments of human bone in
the dirt of the cave floor. There were also fragments of pottery of
a style that is known to predate European contact, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A laboratory at the University of Georgia is now working on
dating pottery fragments from the cave, which were found close to
the newly discovered paintings. Archeologists have already examined
the paintings and confirmed their authenticity as ancient Chamorro
art, Iping said.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Chamorro 16-month calendar was part of a body of
secret navigational lore that was passed along from father to son
for centuries by the Chamorros. Historian Vince Diaz of the
University of Guam has recorded many of the details of this ancient
lore through interviews with a present-day traditional navigator,
one of the last of his kind, on the nearby island of Puluwak, where
the ancient methods are still practiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old navigators never wrote anything down,'' Iping said.
``It was a secret knowledge passed along to the sons,'' in a series
of lessons, known as ``unfolding the mat,'' that led to becoming a
palu, or navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Their unusual calendar included a year divided into 16 months of
unequal length, based on the different constellations that were
visible above the eastern horizon just before dawn. Similarly, it
was the constellations seen rising or setting over different parts
of the horizon that provided key directional information to the
traditional navigators to guide them to specific islands. This was
combined with a knowledge of currents, marine animals, reefs, and
waves and methods for estimating distance traveled and the effects
of drift to guide the ancient navigators to their destinations
across vast stretches of ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Among the paintings Iping found in the cave were a series of 16
circular markings across the cave wall and 16 more arranged
vertically. Because the number 16 had such significance for the
local people's reckoning of the passage of the year, Iping said,
``it's clear to me that it's a calendar.'' In the 16 unequal months
of their system, she said, the year began with the winter solstice,
marked by the constellation of Aquarius above the eastern horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Another painting in the cave, close to the calendar markings,
depicts a person looking at the clearly depicted constellations of
Cassiopeia and the Southern Cross.

 &HT;    It's time to pay piper for your holiday spending
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three steps to debt-control: Assess your situation, know your
resources, create a recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The beginning of the new year, when credit card bills
reflecting holiday spending start showing up in the mail, marks the
finale of the December holidays.
</P>
<P>
   For too many people, it's a crashing end to a season of riotous
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, we see fresh studies showing Americans have piled on
huge amounts of debt, that a high percentage will take months to
pay it off, and some don't even expect to pay it off by the next
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough to get in over your head. Interest rates on
credit card debts average 14.1 percent. That's enough to have banks
and retailers elbowing each other to give you a card _ and the
opportunity to borrow a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   They call that opportunity a line of credit. But when you use
it, it becomes a debt.
</P>
<P>
   Coping with those consumer debts is a process of making a plan
and having the gumption to stick to it. The planning is fairly
simple. Execution is the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake: You are the one who must do the work. Sure,
there are loud ads on TV for debt consolidation loans and home
equity lines of credit. But those are ways to rejigger the problem,
not to solve it.
</P>
<P>
   You must take three steps to get your debts under control:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Find out exactly how bad things are.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure that you have a complete picture of your
situation,'' said Suzanne Boas, president of the Consumer Credit
Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta. ``You need to get all your
bills together and make sure you know the total.''
</P>
<P>
   When you make your list, also write down the interest rates you
are paying on each card.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Find out what resources you have.
</P>
<P>
   This brings up the word a lot of people don't like to deal with
_ budget. Go through your checkbook for recent months and sort out
how much you are spending for housing, food, transportation and
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Also write down your income for that period. The difference
between income and spending for necessities should give you at
least a rough idea how much discretionary income you have to work
with.
</P>
<P>
   The counseling service's Web site (http://www.cccsatl.org) has
an excellent interactive calculator to help you do the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Build your recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a reasonable plan, one that you can stick to,''
said Boas. ``It's like weight loss. Saying I'm going to lose 50
pounds won't make it happen. You have to lay out a step-by-step
plan and make sure each step is manageable.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ways to go about it:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pay off the cards with the highest interest rates first. Think
of the interest rates as penalties you are trying to mitigate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Consider transferring your balance to lower-interest-rate
cards. But shop carefully _ ultra-low rates often are teasers that
will change to a higher rate in just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get rid of most or all of your existing credit cards. Some
people just lock them away. But you're better off cutting them up.
It's a commitment, in a way, and a recognition that cash or checks
will still work just fine.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use a debit card for purchases such as mail orders. It won't
add to your debt load, because the purchase is deducted directly
from your checking account.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For emergencies, carry a few travelers checks rather than
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Consider using your savings to pay down debt. If you are
earning a few percentage points on a passbook savings account but
paying 14 percent on a debt, you come out ahead by eliminating the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Put some bills on autopilot. Once you know how much you can
afford to pay each month, you can direct your bank to make an
automatic transfer to the credit card company each month. The big
advantage: You never get your hands on the money, so you're not
tempted to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make your payments as soon as the bill comes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If all of this sounds overwhelming, look around for help from
experts. CCCS, for example, offers free counseling and will help
develop a plan for repaying your creditors.

BRIGHT LIGHTS, DIM HOPES IN THE CITY OF LITTLE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Why is it that most observers thought Mayor Thomas M.
Menino was off his rocker last year when he suggested that Boston
should host the Democratic National Convention in August 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of events always go to other cities, people thought.
Bigger cities, ones with more clout, like New York, Chicago, or Los
Angeles, itself a strong candidate to get the convention. Or,
displaying a certain smugness, people said the big events go to
cities like Atlanta, Miami, or Houston that need the convention
trade to distinguish themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But many Boston natives, longtime residents, and pundits still
wisecrack that this city is either incapable or unworthy of hosting
such an event.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention, which is to be awarded next month,
will propel the host city into the national spotlight for nearly a
week. As many as 40,000 people will spend about $150 million on
hotels, food, drink, and transportation. About 15,000 attendees
will be members of the press. If the convention comes, the focus on
Boston will be very different from other times the press has
descended on the city in recent years, to cover the trial of Louise
Woodward, murders at women's health clinics, or the Charles Stuart
case.
</P>
<P>
   This time there'd be little negativity, just the
well-choreographed celebratory glow of warm summer downtown days
and cool waterfront nights in arguably Boston's best season.
</P>
<P>
   Menino, in fact, argues that this city is a laboratory for the
Democratic programs pushed by President Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore. He says the city can show off lower crime rates due in
part to community policing, can boast a cleaner harbor, improved
schools, and an entrepreneurial zeal in everything from software to
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   But our civic psyche is so downbeat that we don't dare to think
that Boston will get the brass ring (any more than we think the Red
Sox will win the World Series or the Patriots stay in
Massachusetts), even though the city has gone from being one of 28
wannabes to one of three finalists; even though the city upped its
ante by $1 million last week in an effort to knock the competing
bids by LA and Denver out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Boston needs to get the Democratic convention for a reason
that has nothing to do with money or publicity. Maybe it needs it
so that Bostonians can feel better about their own city. If others
come to Boston and revel in its beauty, its accessibility by foot,
its tidy neighborhoods, as thousands of curious visitors do in
every season, then maybe we will start to value more highly what we
have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that we are in the same league, if
not as New York and Los Angeles, then certainly as San Francisco,
New Orleans, and Philadelphia,'' says Jerome Rogoff, a Newton
psychiatrist. ``We are a very big city in terms of population and
the money that is here, but it is very curious why we shy away from
these things. I know from my own experience with the American
Psychiatric Association, I go to all of their conferences and they
have been in every major city but Boston. Why do we hide like that?
I wonder if there is some kind of mass inferiority complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Grossman, a lifelong Massachusetts resident and outgoing
national chairman of the Democratic National Committee _ which,
with Colorado Governor Roy Romer, its general chairman, and with
input from party politicians _ will decide where the convention is
held, said Boston just does not think of itself as ready for prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the weather, maybe it's the long shadow cast by New
York City, but Boston doesn't expect to win. We get baseball's
All-Star Game this summer, but it's been so long since it was here
last (39 years), even that seems like a mirage. And, we all know
the only reason Major League Baseball decided to come back to
Boston was to say goodbye to Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, Boston has not seen itself as a city that
could compete and win at the highest levels for some of the biggest
prizes,'' says Grossman. ``It was often `When we have a new
convention center . . .' and `If we have a new stadium . . .' When
and if.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Hynes Convention Center is considered too
small for many conventions, and the old Boston Garden was not
air-conditioned, which made holding a summertime convention there
highly improbable. And when the bid to host the convention was
announced last January, Boston was considered a longshot because of
its lack of hotel rooms and the scars of the Big Dig (another
program that shows government money in action).
</P>
<P>
   While Boston is filled with history and many firsts _ from the
telephone to the US subway _ our Puritan heritage may make it
unseemly to extol those facts. But there may be more to Boston's
traditional reluctance to vie against other cities for convention
riches and positive publicity: fear of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why so many people think the convention will go to
Los Angeles for political reasons. Massachusetts, after all, is an
unchallenged Democratic stronghold; California, on the other hand,
is the nation's richest electoral prize with 54 votes _ and its
first Democratic governor in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a natural tendency to sort of prepare yourself for
the worst,'' says Philip Levendusky, a psychologist and vice
president of network development at McLean Hospital in Belmont.
``If we are rejected, it can be a real slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   And if, by chance, Boston does happen to win, conventional
wisdom locally has it that our good fortune will not be because the
city is a jewel that deserves to host such an event, but rather
because Grossman and US Senator Edward M. Kennedy somehow pulled
the requisite strings.
</P>
<P>
   Levendusky says that logic comes from avoiding presenting the
city as a wonderful, livable place with friendly inhabitants and
great architecture and natural beauty, because if we are rejected
after that kind of promotion, then it would be almost too much to
bear. Yet Hollywood, that beachhead of trendiness, has found the
Boston area plenty attractive recently, setting _ and shooting _
films here ranging from ``Good Will Hunting'' to ``Next Stop
Wonderland'' to ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also that aspect to the legendary provincial smugness
of some Bostonians that states the Athens of America doesn't need a
National Football League franchise nor a Democratic National
Convention to prove how great we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smugness like that often is defensive,'' says Rogoff. ``It can
mask an inferiority feeling: that we don't quite measure up to the
big time. We are not in the big time and may not want to be in the
big time, because it is so much better to be small, and excellent
and pure.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino, however, the ultimate local mayor, is out there leading
with his heart and his chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sometimes sell ourselves short,'' Menino says. ``I visited
Atlanta, and they were so boastful about what they had. But then
they tell you not to leave the hotel and walk around at night
because it is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really opened my eyes that any convention for Boston is
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino says he felt initial reluctance from various businesses
and groups whose support he needed to make Boston's bid viable.
``It was like they had to do this, because the mayor was asking
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That Boston could host such a big event seemed to many, well,
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought it was beyond belief,'' says Patrick
Moscaritolo, president of the Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau. ``It was more hype, more political rhetoric. I actually
think that many of the people from the on-site selection committee
probably felt that as well. Well, guess what? Boston is still in
the running.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said Menino had a stroke of brilliance in promoting
Boston during the site commitee visit. He took members on an early
morning walking tour of the city and ``they were blown away by the
experience,'' Grossman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   If Boston should get the convention, the boost to civic pride
would be incalculable. And perhaps our appreciation of history and
who we are would grow as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our claims to fame are relatively subtle and highly
sophisticated,'' says Levendusky. ``There is our education system,
particulary the universities, and no one can rival us. But after
that, the list sort of runs out. We have a nice coastline and we
are near Cape Cod, and it is a pretty city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bragging rights that would come along with'' landing the
convention, he says, ``the self-esteem and personal pride, it would
buoy people's moods and put a spring in our step. Anytime a city is
able to garner that positive notoriety, it has a tremendous effect
on the populace.''
</P>
<P>
   For some observers, just competing hard and getting this far has
resulted in a more positive, congenial attitude in Boston's
business community, where turf wars often have impeded progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of how we view ourselves and how we compete, this
will go down in the books as a high point, at a time when Boston
looked at itself and said, `The mayor is right. We can do this,' ''
says Moscaritolo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the ultimate outcome,'' says Grossman, ``Boston
is already a winner because this has thrust Boston into the highest
rank of American convention cities.''

 BOSTON: ... Beckett plays.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Just to pin down your aesthetic. Some people have said that
the Huntington is more of a writer's theater and ART more of a
director's theater. Is that a simplification?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think there's any truth in it. We wouldn't have a
permanent company of actors if we were a director's theater. Our
actors are not here simply to serve directors, they're here to
expand their artistry and insofar as directors can help them,
that's great. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, if you look at the roster of playwrights that we have
both produced and discovered, I think you'll find that we have a
fairly distinguished group of writers in our stable as it were.
Writers love to be produced here and are welcome here and we
cherish playwrights supremely and we exist as a theater to serve
playwrights, and to serve texts. There's never been any question
about that. . . . We've done plays by most of the major playwrights
and we've never done ``A Christmas Carol'' or Gilbert and Sullivan,
so I don't think that's an accurate way of describing us.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Talk a little bit then about how directors have freedom to
play with the text.
</P>
<P>
   A. Our main function with classical text, which I assume is what
you're talking about, our main function is to get to the spirit of
the work. The worst way to (do that) is to put on a traditional,
literal rendering of the work from another language or another age.
That's what's known as deadly theater. That's what Peter Brook
called it, and that's what it is. You ought to have your detectors
out when you see it, too, because it's deadening all of us, it's
destroying our souls. I find bad theater, deadly theater, is more
destructive of my spirit than almost anything I can think of. I
think that's why people have so little tolerance for theater as
opposed to the movies. The movies are very rarely deadly in the way
that theater is deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Theater is deadly when it is too respectful, when it is too
orthodox, when it is too conventional, and when it thinks it's
performing a good deed when it thinks it's sticking to the absolute
letter as written. I just don't believe this. I think the way to
bring a text to life is to treat it as if it has just been written,
to ignore all previous productions, to act as if a play of
Shakespeare or Moliere or Racine had just come across the literary
desk for the first time and you're looking at it and think it's
terrific and you want to find a way to put it on. That means
cutting through all the contrivances and all the conventions and
all the orthodox ways it had been done in the past and trying to
imagine what the playwright had in mind when he wrote it. That
comes out differently than most classical productions do. As far as
taking liberties with works from another language, I think the same
thing is true.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So would you position yourself 180 degrees from Harold Bloom,
who says that high-concept directors are the curse of Shakespeare?
</P>
<P>
   A. It depends on which director. There are high-concept
directors who I think are the curse. But he said that he saw two
dreadful productions of ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' in his life.
One was Peter Brook's great circus production, and the other was
Alvin Epstein's and I know you saw that and approved of it. For
Harold to go to that production and say it was one of the two worst
productions he'd ever seen in his life, he must be bats. He's
theater-deaf. I had this conversation with him actually down in
Princeton (N.J.). I pleaded with him to realize that Shakespeare's
not Shakespeare until he's acted on the stage. He's not meant for
reading, he's meant for the stage . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was on a cable TV show with Elliot Norton and he singled
you out for going beyond naturalism and demanding more of
audiences. I think he speaks for a lot of people for whom ART
symbolizes excitement and daring. There are a lot of other people I
talk to who say they've canceled their subscriptions because of
some of the things we've just talked about, the liberties taken
with classics, or a style that might be too avant-garde or
emotionally detached. What are your critics missing?
</P>
<P>
   A. &UR;  &LR; With us, audiences are always going to have split opinions.
If they don't, we're not doing our job. Any work that has any
ambitions, that's advanced in any way, is going to divide an
audience. Any new idea divides an audience. We have to accept that
as a faith. It's not something I want. I would prefer unanimous
praise and a full house and a wild box office. But if we're going
to be true to our calling, we have to accept the fact that some
people are not going to like what they see. And other people are
going to be ecstatic about it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we do a play that gets middle reactions, and that
makes me think we're not doing our job, if everyone's mildly
amused; the word ``middle'' just bothers me. I don't like
middle-brow theater. I don't like middle-class theater. I don't
like middle-age theater. I just don't like the word ``middle.'' I
think it's got to be either high or low. Or both. Shakespeare mixed
his genres. He had low clowns and he had kings and queens and
aspiring heroes and he didn't see anything wrong with mixing these
two. The one time he wrote a middle play was ``Merry Wives of
Windsor,'' and he wrote a real middle-class play because Elizabeth
wanted him to write another play about Falstaff and it was a
disaster. It was the worst play he ever wrote because his heart
wasn't in it. So I think it's inevitable that we're going to have
our critics, as you say, and I would just hope that they would
reflect on what's getting them so upset and see that maybe we've
touched something in them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have a number of distinguished alumni, Cherry Jones being
the obvious one. Will we see her back at the ART?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh yeah, she'll definitely come back. She's a very beloved
friend and she almost came back for ``How I Learned to Drive.'' She
was originally cast in that. We chose it for her. She loved the
play, but she got this movie and she couldn't do it. . . . We'll
find ways of getting all the alumni back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How about directors? Have &UR;  &LR; people like Robert Wilson and
Julie Taymor priced themselves beyond . . .
</P>
<P>
   A. No, we're talking to Robert Wilson right now about a
production of (Strindberg's) ``A Dream Play,'' which we hope he'll
be able to do next season. I had talked to him about it some years
ago and he's done it now in Stockholm and he wants to do it for us.
He's the perfect director for that play. Julie Taymor probably has
a schedule that's full now until the third millennium, but she
remains a very close friend and I'm sure if she has something open
in her schedule, she'll come up here and do something with us.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Reflect on the productions that you're most proud of.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's like asking which of your children you love the most.
But I think `` 'night, Mother'' is a play I'm very proud to have
produced. It was turned down by about 30 theaters before we got it.
There was every reason in the world for us not to do it. It was a
kitchen play, a realistic play, but it was a damn good play and I
thought it had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   I like a lot of the work that Bob Wilson has done for us,
particularly ``the CIVIL warS'' and ``Alcestis.'' (Andrei) Serban's
productions for us are some of the best classical productions done
in this country, sometimes in the world. I know that sounds
hyperbolic, but I think he is a world-class director, particularly
of Shakespeare. His ``Twelfth Night'' was exquisite, his
``Sganarelle'' was marvelous, his ``King Stag'' was terrific. I
thought his ``Taming of the Shrew'' was great. Richard Eder said
his ``Merchant of Venice'' was the best Shakespeare he ever saw. I
know you didn't like it (laughs).
</P>
<P>
   I like (Andrei) Belgrader's work. He's a great farceur, he finds
that area where farce and dreams meet. . . . I thought Ron
Daniels's ``Henry'' trilogy was stunning. ``Henry V'' was as
beautiful as anything I've seen, although the GI analogy was stupid
and exactly the kind of Shakespeare I don't like, that tries to set
it in a different time. Serban's Shakespeares sometimes seem to be
set in modern time, but they're not, they're set in panhistorical
time. They may be modern clothes, but there are also traditional
clothes or historical clothes as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Jungle of Cities'' was a very powerful production. The
first ``Waiting for Godot'' we did, Belgrader's, was an
extraordinary young ``Godot'' in the same way that David Wheeler's
was an extraordinary old ``Godot.'' It was nice to be able to do
those two versions. I'm very proud of the new plays we've done.
(Novelist) Don DeLillo's ``Day Room'' was as good a first play as
any that's been done since Sheridan's ``The Rivals.'' It's very
hard to write a good first play. That was a beauty. It's wonderful
to get a writer to move out of his normal field of accomplishment
and into the theater. Because we need the best writers we can get,
and there are certain novelists who are instinctive dramatists.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet's work with us is something we're very proud of and
cherish. We're happy we've become his first home. This was the
proper place to launch ``Oleanna,'' with that wall of political
correctness; it was perfect as far as starting that talk, that
debate. We also value Anna Deavere Smith's presence here. It's not
yet produced any works of art, but it will.
</P>
<P>
   (Brustein later added to the list of favorite productions the
pairing of ``King Stag'' and ``Six Characters in Search of an
Author'' that the company takes on tour as well as the operas of
Philip Glass.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What happens to the ART after Robert Brustein?
</P>
<P>
   A. It will be in good hands . . . I've been just the caretaker
of this place and it needs a younger caretaker at some point, not
in the immediate future, but soon. I hope I'll have some say in who
that person is, and I hope whoever it is will maintain the idea of
a company and obviously will have a whole aesthetic of her own or
his own to express. But I hope it will be a challenging one that
will continue to ask a lot of audiences and will draw on the great
good will that we've been experiencing for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   I'm full of gratitude to this area for effectively being the
best audience we ever hoped to play to. We go places where we get
standing ovations and we get this cyclical applause in Russia that
signifies you've got something terrific. This audience is not
demonstative, but it is as brilliant, as intelligent in its
responses, and as in tune with what you're doing as any in the
world. We've found our audience and I'm full of praise for it.

</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe column by Adrian Walker stated incorrectly that
former Senate President William M. Bulger was among a number of
legislators fined in 1992 by the Massachusetts Ethics Commission,
and that the commission's budget was then promptly cut. Bulger has
never been fined by the Commission. Fourteen past and present
legislators were fined as a result of activities in 1992, but the
fines were imposed in 1994 and 1995. Although the House attempted
to cut the commission's budget in 1995, the Senate, then headed by
Bulger, resisted the cut. The funding was restored by a
House-Senate conference committee.

IMPROVED QUALITY, HIGHER SALES FUEL VHS, DVD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtually everyone in the movie business is smiling. Theatrical
releases for 1998 reached an all-time high of $6.97 billion, as
estimated by the Hollywood Reporter. Ticket sales nearly reached
the 1.5 billion mark, the highest since the late '50s.
</P>
<P>
   And the home video business is doing even better. Early last
year, the gross revenues for movies on home video surpassed the
income generated by a film's release in theaters. Now, the home
market is leading the way. Sales and rentals of VHS and DVD for
1998 are now estimated at nearly $9 billion and that figures to
climb exponentially this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the home video business, long the
evolutionary inferior to its big screen brother, is asserting
itself _ in a big way. And they plan to ride a new technology into
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, about a half-dozen industry analysts and
officials said that no one believes home video will ever replace
cinemas. But the additional financial clout may create shorter
windows between a theatrical release and availability on home video
with some suggesting that there may come a day when a film is
released simultaneously in theaters and on home video.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, theater owners took the patron for granted,
refusing to upgrade their houses,'' said a retired studio executive
who asked that his name not be used. ``Because of the pressure from
home video, many new megaplexes come with stadium seating and
terrific sound. It's like the early days of TV when the wide-screen
was used to get people out of the house. The success of the home
market has really helped everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   To add a further boost to the burgeoning marketplace, DVD
(digital versatile disc) has taken the industry by storm.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Truman Show'' comes out on home video on Tuesday , it
will be sold on VHS with a price tag in the $90 range. But, on the
same day, it will be released on DVD for sale in the $25 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of the DVD format caught everyone a little bit
by surprise,'' said David Miller, marketing head for MGM.
``Everyone from the filmmakers to film buffs are excited by the
format. It took a while to get started, but it's now the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is particularly excited because it puts MGM in an
enviable position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a terrific library with all the MGM wide-screen
classics and musicals that look and sound great on DVD,'' he said.
``And the added features help as well.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, technology restrained the home video market. The VHS
soundtracks couldn't match the Dolby digital and Surroundsound of
megaplexes, and images were mushy compared to their theatrical
counterpart. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   DVD, the visual equivalent of an audio CD, has a superior image
and sound but what really enhances the format are the additional
features. Most titles come with subtitles in Spanish and French, so
they can be shipped internationally at no additional expense.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two versions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock's ``Strangers on a Train'' features the shorter
American version on side A of the disc while the British version,
with a different ending, is on side B. Take your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick's ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' looks and sounds
clearer on DVD than its original release in Cinerama. The disc,
picking up 40,000 bits of information per second, actually exposes
some of the process shots used in the Dawn of Man sequence. The
faraway mountains look like painted backdrops so, sometimes, too
much additional information can break down cinema's illusory
powers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hitchcock's ``Psycho,'' Universal includes an in-depth
documentary with extensive interviews with screenwriter Joseph
Stefano and star Janet Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing that makes DVDs so attractive is the price,''
said Miller.
</P>
<P>
   While many retail video stores feature DVDs, including HMV,
Tower, and Best Buy, the Internet's Amazon.com, Reel.com, and
Netflix.com are also ready to serve and ship with a credit card and
a click of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   While many titles retail for $29.95, the Internet providers
offer deep discounts. Reel.com, for example, has many titles for
$14.95 plus $3.95 for shipping. They also included a $5 gift
certificate with several recent orders. They also use Priority mail
so discs arrive within 2 to 3 days.
</P>
<P>
   The initial fears that consumers wouldn't welcome a new
technology, especially those who invested in laser discs, have been
put to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to collect these movies,'' said Miller. ``Like
books and music they want to display them as an indication of who
they are _ as an extension of their personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, when you factor in the price of a movie theater ticket at
around $15 a pair plus popcorn and a soft drink and parking, the
price of a DVD can be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect sales to be up at least another 50 percent by the
end of the year,'' said Reel.com CEO Julie Wainwright. ``It's hard
to keep up with the demand. Frankly, the success of the DVD has
taken everyone by surprise. Thirty-five percent of our December
business was in DVD. The only problem we have now is a
manufacturing one. We stock every title, very deep, in our
warehouse. But the manufacturer can't manufacture them fast enough
to meet the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Divx format
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about Divx?
</P>
<P>
   This format, pushed by the mega-retailer Circuit City, has
encountered some early technical and marketing problems. Originally
designed as an alternative to the video store, the format (which
stands for digital video express) allows the consumer to order a
movie title on a disc that's time-based. The consumer can watch the
movie during a specified period before the content is erased. The
disc also can be purchased if the consumer wishes to add it to his
library. It's a variation on pay-per-view that, so far, lacks
widespread support in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a confusing format that requires a ton of text support
and not one of our customers has ever asked for it,'' said
Wainwright.
</P>
<P>
   DIVX aside, the film industry from top to bottom is smiling. The
time between when a film opens in a theater and is available on DVD
will be shrinking this year and, given the burst of enthusiasm for
the format, thousands of additional titles will become available in
the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The money is pouring in from all sides. Even the most cynical
commentators don't see it stopping soon.

RAP HAS MALAYSIANS SINGING A NEW TUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Malaysia's paternalistic prime
minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has received a lot of bad press lately
for harshly suppressing dissent. Many outsiders, then, might be
surprised to hear the lyrics of Huzir Sulaiman, 25, an actor,
playwright, and rapper who performs at local nightclubs:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm mad as hell, I refuse to shut up
</P>
<P>
   The country I love is totally (expletive) up
</P>
<P>
   If you march in the streets 'cause you can't keep quiet
</P>
<P>
   They'll bash your (expletive) brains out and say that you riot
</P>
<P>
   I am a Malaysian, I love this land
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion the problem is the old man.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strong stuff only months after Mahathir crippled a fledgling
opposition movement by arresting his rebellious deputy, Anwar
Ibrahim, and putting him on trial on sex and corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time when artistic ferment seems to run parallel to
popular expressions of dissent or unhappiness,'' Sulaiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's guilt or innocence is beside the point to the
middle-class audience listening to Sulaiman at All That Jazz bar.
At issue to them are the rights of average people in Malaysia. If
Anwar, once the nation's second most powerful politician, can be
hauled off in handcuffs, brought to court with a black eye, and
held without bail while a docile press toes the government line,
what could happen to regular citizens?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Malaysia is full of contradictions. Although it has fewer
freedoms than many would like, it has more than Mahathir's critics
acknowledge. It tolerates barbed political satire and, on occasion,
officially sanctions it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Malaysian opposition figures and protesters have been
recently silenced, their calls for greater democracy have found a
powerful voice through art, music, theater, and writing.
</P>
<P>
   An evening of political songs and readings at an upscale pub
hardly seems a petri dish for revolution. The sedate, well-dressed
audience chose the club rather than a protest rally held across
town on this particular night. But programs like this, repeated in
hotel ballrooms, art galleries, and film cafes across the capital
over the past months, reflect a growing discontent among Malaysia's
elite with the political status quo. And that, more than street
protests, could lead to change.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaiman cautioned that artists involved are not necessarily
Anwar supporters. ``Even people staunchly in favor of the prime
minister. . .have concerns about the independence of the judiciary
and the conduct or misconduct of the police; about the increasing
autocracy of the government and the use of Draconian laws,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the art inspired by recent political turmoil is
trenchant and angry, more of it is playful and ridicules authority.
Singer Rafique Rashid spoofs Anwar's ouster over a sex scandal in
``Fifty Ways to Lose Your Leader,'' by adding politicians to his
version of Paul Simon's classic:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just dig up some smut, Mat
</P>
<P>
   Buy a little time, Daim
</P>
<P>
   Don't mess with him, Lim
</P>
<P>
   Just set yourself free.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even allies of greater democracy are not exempt from mockery.
Take Rashid's ``Al Gore Rap,'' inspired by the US vice president's
controversial speech at a dinner here in which he praised
Mahathir's critics:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well I'm the vice president of the United States
</P>
<P>
   My name is Al Gore and I'm here to aggravate
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if you think I'm rude
</P>
<P>
   I got my batik shirt and I'm a real cool dude. . .
</P>
<P>
   So do your `reformasi' now and have no fear
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the satay, I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rashid said it is easy to make his work humorous with material
to work with such as the introduction at Anwar's trial last month
of a purportedly semen-stained mattress. ``You want some real
entertainment?'' he asked. ``Go to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashid and Sulaiman acknowledge that if they tried to perform at
a ``reformasi'' rally or publish in a newspaper, they would
probably be silenced or arrested for sedition. But because their
audiences are mostly sedate professionals, the special police who
monitor their shows have not explicitly tried to gag them.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy provides protection, Rashid said. ``Politicians don't
want to be seen as not having a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Others think the government tolerates them to disprove those who
charge that Malaysia stifles free expression. Even as authorities
detained Anwar's top associates and cracked down with water cannon
and batons on street protesters, officials hired an irreverant
comedy troupe to entertain delegates at a recent international
conference _ with the government as the butt of the jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from 21 nations, including the United States,
were flabbergasted when the Instant Cafe Theatre lampooned their
Malaysian hosts at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
November. The delegates all knew of the arrest of Anwar, a
free-marketeer who has many friends in Western governments, and of
the suppression of his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows raised when, to the tune of Gloria Gaynor's ``I Will
Survive,'' performers lambasted Mahathir _ and much of the nation _
for blaming foreign fund managers, such as George Soros, for
Malaysia's economic problems:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We must believe, we are the best
</P>
<P>
   And don't listen to the nasty rumors from the Western press. . .
</P>
<P>
   So we don't cry, 'cause we deny
</P>
<P>
   We'll blame the Jews, La Nina, and we'll tell ourselves more
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When angry Malaysian lawmakers raised in parliament the audacity
of the Instant Cafe Theatre, Mahathir is said to have dismissed the
issue, saying the government has more important things to worry
about than an acting company.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, recounted Jo Kukathas, the Instant Cafe Theatre's
director, the troupe has been summoned by officials who say, ``We
love your show, but maybe you shouldn't mention politics or the
economy.'' But, she said, ``That doesn't make sense, since satire
is what we do. We feel we must do what we do or people will regard
authority as sacred cows, rather than as servants of the people.''

RUSSIAN ROADS CAN EXACT A TOLL ON DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOTMA, Russia _ The captain was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   He frowned at the documents strewn on the tiny desk of his
checkpoint: the US passport, Russian press accreditation, Russian
car registration, and US driver's license. The captain did not like
this. It reeked of an international plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where'd you say you were going again?,'' the captain asked,
again.
</P>
<P>
   The American explained, again: to Veliky Ustyug, a picturesque
12th century town, a 650-mile drive northeast of Moscow and 150
miles east of Totma. The captain mulled this over, again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get there from here,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   New Englanders may remember that as the punch line from an old
joke about Yankees. In Russia, the joke is often reality. Over 40
percent of Russia's 135,000 towns are not connected to the rest of
the world by roads, according to Russia's transportation ministry.
Over 40 percent of the roads that do exist are considered
``substandard.''
</P>
<P>
   Vast tracts of Russia's nine time zones have no roads at all and
have to depend on supplies that come by rail, river, and air. And
since railways are also far from ubiquitous, air travel is too
expensive, and most Russian rivers freeze, lots of these places go
cold and hungry in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Veliky Ustyug no longer has this problem. Last year, a direct
road from Totma was finally completed. But apparently no one had
told this captain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The boxy Czech-built Skoda had journeyed some 400 miles from
Moscow, the last 100 on one of those ``substandard'' roads _ in
fact, an obstacle course of potholes with wickedly serrated edges.
One crater had just cost the Globe's Moscow bureau two steel-belted
radials a few miles back. We were proud of having made it this far.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, it seems, wanted a bribe for letting us go any
farther. Russian conventional wisdom dictates that when a Russian
traffic police officer, still known by the Soviet-era acronym GAI
(pronounced ``Guy-EE''), waves his white baton at your car, an
extortion attempt is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Our driver made an abstract comment about writing down his badge
number and reporting this as breach of international treaties. In
Moscow, that would have merely upped the price. Here, miraculously,
the bluff worked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why are Russian roads so bad? One popular theory blames Russian
generals, who remember how Hitler's Blitzkreig was slowed when it
ran into Russia's unpaved, muddy ruts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a more realistic explanation is that most Russian
regions cannot afford to build new roads. As a result, they remain
isolated from many goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The area around relatively prosperous Moscow has six-lane
highways with fluorescent lane markers, drive-in fast-food
restaurants, and spiffy 24-hour service stations. Farther from the
capital, such amenities deteriorate with the quality of the roads.
The last fast food we saw was at a McDonald's in Yaroslavl, 160
miles north of Moscow. The last gas station with plumbing was 140
miles farther north in Vologda, capital of the impoverished region
where Veliky Ustyug is located.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the route through the dark, snow-capped taiga has
only one lane that is plowed. As two oncoming vehicles approach,
the drivers flash their lights at each other to signal the other
car to yield. Rule of thumb: If the oncoming vehicle is a KaMAZ
lumber truck and you are driving a Skoda, you yield. Then you drive
with extra care to avoid the logs the KaMAZ has inevitably
sprinkled in its path. It is a harrowing trip.
</P>
<P>
   But in Veliky Ustyug _ until recently best reached the way
Russian settlers found it in 1147, by river _ people are happy to
have any road at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love our road,'' said Yevgeny Udachin, who works at a local
furniture company. ``It feels so much like . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He paused to search for the right word.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels so much like civilization.''

YES, KATYA, THERE IS A DED MOROZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE DED MOROZ RESIDENCE, Russia _ Outside the sauna room of the
rustic wood cabin deep in the snowbound northern Russian forest,
Maxim Schukin took a swig of sweet Moldovan wine and reflected upon
the daunting task before him.
</P>
<P>
   Can he bring smiles to the faces of dozens of children and touch
the hearts of their parents, every day? Can he instill a little
hope, good cheer, and national pride in a land where both are in
woefully short supply?
</P>
<P>
   And while he's at it, can he help reverse the fortunes of a
poverty-stricken lumber town and turn it into a national tourist
attraction?
</P>
<P>
   It all becomes possible when Schukin, a twenty-something
emergency-room anesthesiologist, puts on his white cotton beard,
red cape, and hat _ and becomes Ded Moroz, Russia's
eight-century-old scion of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Ded Moroz, Russian for ``Grandpa Frost,'' is equal parts Snow
Czar and Slavic Santa Claus, capable of making blizzards and
miracles. And Schukin, Russia's ``official'' Ded Moroz, plays the
part convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   While the Western St. Nick has ridden his reindeer back to the
North Pole until next Christmas, Ded Moroz (pronounced,
incongruously for English speakers, ``Dead Morose'') still has been
working. Wednesday was the Russian Orthodox Christmas, and that
meant another trainload of kids entertained at Ded Moroz's log
cabin a few miles outside of Veliky Ustyug, a picturesque village
perched on the confluence of three rivers in the dense taiga forest
500 miles northeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   This week Russians celebrate the Orthodox New Year, and that
should bring more youthful tourists and their parents to this
remote place in search of winter holiday cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Why will they come all the way out here? Because this year,
Veliky Ustyug, with a little prodding by a powerful Moscow
politician and a bit of inventive rewriting of local legends, has
declared itself the official hometown of Ded Moroz. Local
entrepreneurs have turned a children's summer camp into Ded Moroz's
official residence. And Schukin, a budding actor and a master
sportsman, has become Russia's official Ded Moroz.
</P>
<P>
   On a crisp, snowy afternoon Sunday, two days after the New
Year's holiday when Russians exchange gifts, Ded Moroz hit the
streets of Veliky Ustyug (pronounced ``Veh-LEE-key OO-stoog'') to
greet children and grownups. He thrilled the (adult) kitchen
workers at the town's only restaurant with a visit. He kept
visitors warm with an impromptu sing-along under a Christmas tree,
then finished it all off with a raucous sled party at The Ded Moroz
Residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done well today!'' Ded Moroz boomed in his wintry
baritone. He gulped down another mouthful of wine, smiled wearily,
and headed into the official Ded Moroz Residence sauna. ``Would
that tomorrow be the same!''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of turning Veliky Ustyug into a Russian Santa's village
belongs to Moscow Mayor Yury M. Luzhkov, a presidential hopeful who
thrives on populist campaigns to stoke national pride.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some Russians have expressed regret over the
Westernization of their winter holidays, and especially the
intrusion of the roly-poly Santa preferred by Western advertisers
over the more angular Ded Moroz. Russians point out that Santa
merely brings gifts, while Ded Moroz actually makes winter happen,
too. Make Santa mad, and you get coal in your stocking. Cross Ded
Moroz, and he'll freeze you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to mess with Ded Moroz!'' said Ded Moroz.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a new chance to make political capital, Luzhkov last
month announced that Ded Moroz was not to be confused with the
Western Santa from the North Pole or Finnish Lapland, but a ``real
Russian'' who came from Veliky Ustyug.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Veliky Ustyug set up a company, Ded Moroz Inc.,
and set about creating a legend that placed Grandpa Frost's arrival
in Russia at Veliky Ustyug in 1148, a year after the town was
founded. A sign reading ``Welcome to Ded Moroz's Homeland'' went up
on the outskirts of town. This month, local police issued a large,
kitschy version of the internal passport all Russians are required
to carry listing Veliky Ustyug as Ded Moroz's official residence.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Santa intruded here as well. The red-suited, white-bearded
character in the document's ``photograph'' _ in fact a cheap
printout of a computer graphic _ is holding a piece of paper that
says, in English, ``Santa's List.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine how upset I was,'' said Ded Moroz. ``But what
can you do? These days it's best to carry a document.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a sentiment shared by anyone who has traveled the road
from Moscow to Veliky Ustyug. The highway is lined with checkpoints
manned by gray-clad traffic police who routinely stop vehicles to
make sure drivers' papers are in order. They represent only one of
the obstacles faced by the tourist who would drive the icy,
pot-holed trail through the taiga.
</P>
<P>
   Getting here by train is not much easier _ the ride from Moscow
takes 24 hours. There are no direct flights.
</P>
<P>
   The locals say Veliky Ustyug's isolation is what saved its
marvelous 17th- and 18th-century churches from destruction by the
Bolsheviks after the 1917 Russian Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Once, thousands of tourists would visit Veliky Ustyug, not just
for the town's architecture, but for its famous crafts _ silver
jewelry, shoes, and intricately carved wooden furniture.
</P>
<P>
   But like many small Russian towns, Veliky Ustyug has suffered a
huge drop in living standards after communism. In fact, before
Schukin became Ded Moroz, he hadn't been paid at his day job since
August, except for a $5 end-of-year bonus.
</P>
<P>
   In this town, the only business that has thrived is the huge
lumber concern, Lespromkhoz, and that is only by stripping forests
to sell timber abroad at such a rate that soon there will be no
trees left, townspeople fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they don't sell all the timber they can, we will
starve,'' says Yevgeny Udachin, who works in the lumber industry.
</P>
<P>
   Udachin's wife, Tatyana, is director of the Ded Moroz Residence.
She hopes that tourism can lift the town out of the doldrums. Two
weeks ago the place was alive with adult tourists who had braved
the bad roads and slow trains to see Ded Moroz.
</P>
<P>
   Ded Moroz, meanwhile, was out of the sauna reading his letters.
Russian post offices have agreed to send all mail addressed to Ded
Moroz to Veliky Ustyug.
</P>
<P>
   The letters come in every day, and many are representative of
the times. ``A bike for me,'' writes 7-year-old Sveta, ``and my
Grandma's pension on time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please give me a new father,'' writes 4-year-old Masha.
``Preferably a healthy blond who doesn't drink.''
</P>
<P>
   But now and then Ded Moroz gets a message that makes him smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ded Moroz, I know you exist,'' writes 17-year-old Katya.
``Because there is nothing wrong in believing in good things.''

EXPERTS EYE ROSY TRENDS IN US CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the United States celebrates newly minted numbers about
safer streets, collared criminals, and a murder rate in startling
free-fall, criminologists warn that all crime _ as the late House
Speaker Tip O'Neill once said of politics _ is local.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, that local story is a civic leader's dream: the
nation's lowest homicide rate, sustaining a trend that has placed
the region among the country's least murderous areas for 12
generations.
</P>
<P>
   But specialists, wary of data blended from Bangor to Burbank,
say New England's sanguinity and the hopeful aggregate figures
nationwide mask pockets of regional violence that defy simple
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   While police commissioners in Boston and New York can trumpet
1997 crime statistics that evoke a 1950s' Ozzie-and-Harriet
tranquility, officials in Baltimore and New Orleans struggle
against a despair reminiscent of the shoot-'em-up '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cultures of violence in the United States,'' said
David Hackett Fischer, a history professor at Brandeis University.
``The difference in rates of violence among different American
regions is greater than those among many European nations.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Massachusetts is not without its share of violence.
According to the most recent statistics, the rate of violent crimes
such as rape, robbery, and assault is slightly higher here than the
national numbers, which declined 7 percent in 1997, extending a
six-year trend.
</P>
<P>
   But the striking disparity is a murder rate that shows that
homicide is more than three times as likely to occur in some
Southern states than it is in New England.
</P>
<P>
   New England's lower homicide rate has its roots in the 19th
century. Higher rates of bloodshed across the Southern highlands
have persisted for as long as crime statistics have been compiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen some dramatic improvements,'' said Dwayne Smith,
chairman of the criminal justice department at the University of
North Carolina at Charlotte. ``But in the final analysis, when you
talk about crime, you're talking about a very localized
phenomenom.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   --A recent US Department of Justice analysis of national
homicide trends from 1976-97 shows that murders, particularly those
involving guns, are especially high in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma, and Texas. They are relatively low in New England and
across the northern Great Plains.
</P>
<P>
   --While murders in Boston dwindled to 35 last year, its lowest
since 1961, the body count in Baltimore soared to 314, the ninth
straight year that city has recorded 300 or more killings, ranking
Baltimore with Gary, Ind., New Orleans, and Detroit among America's
deadliest cities.
</P>
<P>
   --According to a recent FBI report, 1997 crimes reported to
police dropped 3 percent in big cities but rose 1 percent in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists are nearly unanimous that upbeat statistics
suggesting homogeneous low-crime from coast to coast obscure
important, regional distinctions about what crimes are being
committed by whom. But there is little agreement about why those
differences linger, or, for that matter, why overall crime has
dropped so dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that there is no singular factor,'' said Eric
Monkkonen, a homicide expert and history professor at the
University of California at Los Angeles. ``It would be great if
there was one thing we could point to, but we can't. It's not just
policing. It's not just the involvement of the churches. It may be
random things that none of us understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients of Boston's success story have been
well-documented. Community policing, after-school programs, an
involved clergy, and a diminished appetite for crack cocaine have
made an unmistakable difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is geographically concentrated and it just doesn't have
the poverty that places like Gary, Ind., or New Orleans have,''
said Jack Levin, director of the Brudnick Center on Violence at
Northeastern University. ``The crime in Boston, no matter how bad
it ever was, never looked like it was unmanageable _ so people took
a chance and got involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in some places, say Baltimore, it looks overwhelming and
beyond human control,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts point to the graying of the Baby Boom
generation, a demographic colossus that helped drive crime rates up
in the '70s and early '80s, as the key factor in diminishing crime
rates, others say the answer is not much more difficult than
Economics 101.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that Cleveland and Baltimore and Memphis sort of
lead the pack not just in violent crime, but also lead the pack in
the poverty index,'' said James Alan Fox, dean of Northeastern's
College of Criminal Justice. ``If you improve the socio-economic
conditions, your crime rate will improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists who monitor regional crime rates say
socioeconomics goes only so far in explaining fluctations in crime.
History and geography, they suggest, offer other clues.
</P>
<P>
   Murder is often personal in the South, the climax of a lover's
quarrel or a barroom fight, the experts said. In other regions,
homicide more frequently occurs between strangers, resulting when
other crimes _ such as robberies _ are botched and take a fatal
twist.
</P>
<P>
   The murder rate in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas was
8.4 per 100,000 residents, according to the most recent FBI
statistics. That was 3 1/2 times the murder rate in New England,
where it was 2.4 per 100,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Murder rates in those two regions range from 1.4 in New
Hampshire to 15.7 in Louisiana. Massachusetts' murder rate was 1.9
per 100,000 residents in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty, reinstated by the Supreme Court in 1976,
seems to have played little part in the equation. In Texas, for
example, 165 people have been executed since the state reinstituted
the death penalty in 1982. The last execution in Massachusetts was
in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the 11 states of the Confederacy accounted for eight of
the 20 states with the highest murder rates among 14- to
17-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is a subculture of violence whereby using violence
to solve disputes is seen as more appropriate than in the rest of
the country,'' Fox said. ``Down South, you might take it outside.
Up North, you might take it to court.''
</P>
<P>
   As the specialists continue to analyze factors, including
effects in cities where the crack epidemic started after the
mid-1980s and lingered longer, that may explain regional crime-rate
swings, the larger and rosier nationwide picture also is under
rigorous review.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kenneth Land, a sociology professor at Duke
University who studies crime rates, said the decline in murder of
spouses has to do with the advent of battered women's shelters,
improved emergency trauma treatment, and the collapse of the
neighborbood barroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one drug for which there's well-documented evidence
of excitation to violence, it's alcohol,'' Land said. ``It used to
be you'd have a guy sitting there having his boilermaker and the
next thing you'd know there's be a trivial argument that would lead
to a death.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Zimring, a law professor and the director of the Earl
Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley,
said the newest nationwide statistics represent a watershed in US
criminology.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1964 and 1974, the national homicide rates roughly
doubled, said Zimring, who noted that in the 20 years following
1974, the rates fluctuated up and down by about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we're pushing beneath that bottom so that we have a
structural change in the level of homicide risks in American
cities,'' he said. ``It's a real turning point in American lethal
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Barnett, a statistician at MIT's Sloan School of
Management, said no one anticipated such a precipitous drop in
crime and, therefore, no one should rush to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really very startling,'' Barnett said. ``I'm
absolutely delightfully startled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never believed and can't think of a single
criminologist who would have suggested that Boston would have 35
homicides last year. It's something to be celebrated. And then
there are questions that need to be answered about all of this.''

STARR SINKS EVEN LOWER IN SLEAZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- It is sick enough that Kenneth Starr has not only
advertised but actually timed a ``garbage'' indictment to influence
President Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But it is mind-boggling that Starr would do so while trying to
bury testimony by a witness who shreds the credibility of Kathleen
Willey, especially since Starr and House impeachment managers have
been bending heaven and earth to get Willey's allegations of a
presidential semi-assault into the Senate proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Starr got his headlines last week by arranging for the
indictment (on perjury and obstruction charges) of former Willey
close friend Julie Hiatt Steele on the same day the Senate
proceeding had its ceremonial commencement. And House Judiciary
Committee chairman Henry Hyde's impeachment minions used the
indictment to claim that the Willey case belongs in the Senate
trial and that it is another reason why a ``full'' trial with
witnesses is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is Hyde's credibility that is undermined by the
Willey case. There is an emerging, bipartisan consensus in the
Senate that Hyde should bear a heavy burden to show that he has
developed a case worthy of a full trial and that it is
well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   What Starr has tried to bury, ever since he received it last
April, is the grand jury testimony of a witness who puts the Willey
and Steele matters in a dramatically different light. The witness
is another former close friend of the Virginia woman, Harolyn
Cardozo, whom Willey called on her cellular telephone on the day in
question in 1993, when Willey later claimed she had been virtually
assaulted by the president in a hallway next to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had Willey's phone records, which showed the call was
placed to Cardozo and lasted 47 minutes, 4 seconds; and the records
resulted in a subpoena from the prosecutor's office. They did not,
however, result in the story that Starr wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with her testimony last April 4,
Cardozo contradicts Willey's story of an incident that left her
supposedly shaken, fearful, and full of fury and disgust as far as
Clinton was concerned. To the contrary, there was no story of
assault, but one about a woman who sounded pleased and anxious to
see the president as much as she could.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the testimony is that Willey was actively plotting over
the phone about how she could find ways to see him, including ways
of obtaining Mrs. Clinton's schedule in order to learn when she
would be away from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a seamy JFK reference, Willey was also alleged to have
said that if she played her cards right she could be the Judith
Campbell Exner of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Cardozo's testimony is especially significant because of the
length of the phone call. It is Steele's story that Willey _ in
addition to asking her to lie about her encounter with the
president _ also asked her to say that she had called Steele on her
cellular telephone to tell her what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   It is also significant because it corroborates the sworn
statements about the same, pleased Kathleen Willey that were made
by Linda Tripp, who appears to have been present for everything
that happened at the White House during Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   Cardozo was hauled back before the grand jury last month. At
this point, however, Starr was trying fruitlessly to develop dirt
on her father, bigtime Democratic Party fund-raiser Nathan Landow,
who also knew Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, however, has never tried to use her Democratic
connections (her husband is another prominent Democrat, Michael
Cardozo, who at one point chaired Clinton's defense fund) to
impeach her testimony. She was, after all, his witness, and his
investigators confirmed her close friendship at the time with
Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he tried to bury her testimony, while focusing his
oppressive resources on Julie Hiatt Steele in an invasive
investigation that included the circumstances of her child's
adoption in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   I'm convinced a first-year law student could smash Starr's case
against Steele, but its flimsy nature is irrelevant anyway. Its
real purpose is to pad the weak impeachment file.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if Starr had ever found anything directly culpable,
it would have been put into an official referral to the House
instantly. But as the entire history of his investigation shows,
not having a case does not prevent him and his House friends from
trying to make one anyway.

FROM TRENT TO TROY AND BACK AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   TRENT LOTT: The Senate majority leader stuck his foot in his
mouth _ and later backpedaled _ when he questioned the timing of
last month's bombing of Iraq. But he redeemed himself in a big way
by pushing fellow senators toward a bipartisan approach to
President Clinton's trial on articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's insistence on devising trial procedures that Republicans
and Democrats could live with set him up for criticism, of course _
especially from members of the Mississippi senator's own party.
Unlike some congressional colleagues who have meekly caved in when
pressured by anti-Clinton zealots obsessed with drumming the
president out of office, Lott has shown _ so far, at least _ that
he can take the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who don't appreciate him now may one day thank him
for steering a statesmanlike course and saving the GOP from one
more self-destructive blunder in its pursuit of the president.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Political prognosticators are talking up
the first lady as a potential candidate for the Senate, guessing
that she might go after the seat held by retiring New York Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad idea when you stop and think about it. If she
starts campaigning right away, she can tell Bill that she's too
busy to help him pack if he gets booted out of the White House. If
Bill doesn't get booted, a Senate campaign will give Hillary an
excuse to get away from the bum for days and weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLINTON: Can the Comeback Kid survive the ``Trial of the
Century'' in the Senate? Can he talk his way out of one last jam?
Can the man whose motto is ``Never, ever quit'' hang on by his
fingernails just once more?
</P>
<P>
   Well, O.J. Simpson beat the rap in the last ``Trial of the
Century'' after leaving a trail of blood from the murder scene to
the foot of his bed. If it hadn't been for the stain on Monica
Lewinsky's dress, Slick Willie might have left no trail at all.
</P>
<P>
   STROM THURMOND: Give the ol' boy a round of applause. Acting as
president pro tem of the Senate, the 96-year-old senator from South
Carolina did a nice job presiding over the formal opening of the
impeachment trial. Yes, he had somebody feeding him the scripted
dialogue, but he delivered every line flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond was the perfect senator to get the ball rolling _ he's
darn near old enough to remember the last time a U.S. president was
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH DOLE: The former Cabinet officer/Red Cross chief is
gearing up to run for the Republican presidential nomination in
2000. As we saw when she stumped for hubby Bob Dole in the 1996
election, Mrs. Dole is a dynamic campaigner. If only Bob had been
half as dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN ASHCROFT: The sanctimonious senator from Missouri has
decided not to run for president. Good decision.
</P>
<P>
   TROY AIKMAN: Why is everybody picking on Troy? This guy is one
of the greatest quarterbacks who has ever played pro football, and
if he's had some rough times of late, it's because his Dallas
Cowboys teammates haven't been carrying their share of the load. No
quarterback _ not John Elway, not Dan Marino, not even ex-Cowboy
Roger Staubach _ can win a football game by himself.
</P>
<P>
   These people who keep screaming that Aikman is over the hill had
better hope that he doesn't decide to pack it in. If they think
their favorite football team is horrible with Aikman, wait till
they see what the Cowboys look like without him. Cowboys fans
everywhere will be begging him to return.
</P>
<P>
   NOLAN RYAN: If ever a baseball player deserved to be voted into
the Hall of Fame, Ryan is the player. Never mind the seven
no-hitters, the 5,714 strikeouts, the 53 major-league records he
set during a 27-year career that began with the New York Mets and
ended with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan isn't merely a Hall of Fame athlete; he's a Hall of Fame
human being, a role model for young and old alike. If there were
more Nolan Ryans in big-time sports, the sports world wouldn't have
an image problem.

IT'S A DEMOCRACY, STUPID 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On Friday, the day the members of the Senate got
together to work out procedures for Bill Clinton's impeachment
trial, I took an impromptu public opinion survey.
</P>
<P>
   At four stops during an afternoon snowstorm _ one for gas, one
for groceries, one at a drug store and one at a newsstand _ I asked
the people who took my money what they thought about what's going
on in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The woman at the gas station/convenient mart told me that she's
sick of hearing about it. The supermarket cashier observed that
they're all a bunch of creeps down there. The woman behind the
register at the drug store warned me not to get her started, so I
didn't. And the guy at the newsstand said it's all a bunch of
bullfeathers, that he would have lied, too, and that he was a lot
more interested in the NBA finally starting up because he has been
getting killed on his football bets.
</P>
<P>
   None of which should have surprised me, I suppose, but it did.
I'm a political junkie married to a high school government teacher.
This is about all we've talked about recently _ at the top of our
lungs, by the way. My bride and I have different views on all this.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, though, the potential removal of a president of
the United States by the Senate _ an event of truly towering
historical significance _ seems a matter of monumental
inconsequence. Hey, the weather is rotten and almost everybody has
a job these days, and who has time to worry about this political
stuff?
</P>
<P>
   I heard the same thing on television Friday morning from around
the country. A reporter in Chicago told some network interviewer
that heavy snow and Michael Jordan are much bigger news there than
Bill Clinton. A reporter from Kansas City was saying that George
Brett getting into the Hall of Fame was interesting to his
audience, not this.
</P>
<P>
   At century's end, then, we seem to be witnessing an intriguing
phenomenon _ a nation of 270 million mostly satisfied people
increasingly uninvolved in their country's democracy, no matter how
rowdy and bizarre that democracy might become. A recent Harris poll
found 91 percent of Americans feeling good about their overall
quality of life, 84 percent happy with their standard of living and
fully four in five feeling just ducky about the community they live
in.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their faith in the government that has
presided over the development of all this comfort has declined
dramatically since the 1950s and early 1960s, the nation's last
extended period of peace and prosperity. The Gallup organization
reports that only 8 percent of Americans believe that very few
politicians are crooks and that 3 percent believe they're all
crooked. Seven in 10 Americans think the country needs better
political leadership. Three in five Americans bemoan a collapse of
national moral values. Fewer than one in three Americans trust
government to do what's right ``most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of such disaffection, fewer people than ever
seen to be keeping up with the news. In this government town, two
of the four network affiliate television stations have more people
watching their prime-time entertainment programming than watching
the station's primary newscast. Fewer than half of Americans now
vote in national elections, fewer than a third in state elections.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Because, it seems, we're mostly fat and happy and more
interested in entertaining ourselves than in our civic
responsibilities. Yes, it's possible that, in a few weeks, a
president will be ejected from office for the first time in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not Oprah, and it's not the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   So, really, who cares?

EXPLOITATION SPOILING MARINE REFUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is called the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, a
grand-sounding name that suggests special protection for one of the
world's great whale feeding grounds and fish nurseries _ almost
like a national park on the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the animals that live on this plateau 25 miles east of
Boston, sanctuary is largely an illusion. Whalewatch boats heading
to or from the bank have struck at least three whales since 1997 _
without breaking sanctuary rules. Fisherman have been allowed to
scour almost every inch of the sanctuary floor with nets that
damage key elements of the bank's food chain.
</P>
<P>
   And a nautical highway splits Stellwagen, bringing hundreds of
Boston-bound cargo ships _ and countless smaller boats _ that steam
as fast as the captains choose through the heart of the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stellwagen Bank is about to become the first battleground
in a national push to make America's marine sanctuaries true
havens. Over the next two years, Stellwagen Bank's managers will
consider speed limits, areas where fishing is limited or banned,
and even entry fees to give meaning to the name `sanctuary.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we need to do is become the tourist council for
these areas,'' said sanctuary manager Brad Barr, who has watched
the growing popularity of Stellwagen with concern. ``We have a long
way to go before we can step back and say we're fulfilling the
mission of resource protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Scituate-based sanctuary technically is just
gathering opinions on how to proceed, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration chose to review Stellwagen first among
the nation's 12 sanctuaries for a reason: The collapse of New
England's fishing industry and the explosive growth of
whalewatching have made the environmental threats crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   And conservation groups such as the American Oceans Campaign and
the Gloucester-based Cetacean Research Unit clearly want to use the
review to expand the sanctuary's power to protect wildlife, setting
a national precedent in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctuary has made only marginal improvements in the way
the resources are managed out there, but you can't blame the
sanctuary because their hands are very tied,'' said Mason Weinrich
of the Cetacean Research Unit, a whale research group that supports
sanctuary speed limits and expanding the sanctuary's boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials are likely to face resistance as they try
to convince mariners and landlubbers alike that a 782-square-mile
patch of open sea shouldn't be so open any more. Barr's counterpart
in the Florida Keys was burned in effigy when he tried to ban
fishing in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll take over the natural resources and then they'll take
over our property rights and then they'll take our guns,'' warned
Carl Hagenkotter, director of the anti-sanctuary Conch Coalition,
in the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel recently.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the first meetings on Stellwagen's future, held
around the state last month, were cordial and low-key, but the
signs of trouble ahead are clear: Shipping companies dislike speed
limits, some whalewatch companies want to avoid regulations
altogether, and fishermen feel so beaten down by regulation that
they say more would be unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the environmental community, in their good
intentions, fails to bring in the ideas and the thoughts of the
marine community,'' said Capt. Jeff Monroe, until recently the
deputy port director at the Massachusetts Port Authority and now
port director in Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering storm over Stellwagen Bank's future could be quite
a contrast to 1992, when President George Bush created the
Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary with applause from almost
every quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Stellwagen, an unusually shallow region of the Atlantic fed by
nutrients from the deep ocean, is a national treasure, all agreed,
a playground for humpbacks and other whales and filled with an
uncommon variety of life from almost tropical-looking corals on the
bottom to prized bluefin tuna near the surface.
</P>
<P>
   But the perceived threats to Stellwagen Bank in the early 1990s
_ floating casinos, an old hazardous waste-dumping site, sand and
gravel mining _ were quite different from the issues confronting
the sanctuary today.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, US Rep. Gerry Studds, the driving force in Congress
for the sanctuary, opposed restrictions on fishing within its
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled, the sanctuary restricted only a handful
of activities, such as sand and gravel mining and gas pipelines.
Other than some new money for research and public consciousness
raising, business went on as usual on the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the modest limits in Stellwagen mirrored those in
other marine sanctuaries, such as Flower Garden Banks on the Gulf
of Mexico, where private companies have oil-drilling leases, and
Monterey Bay in California, where managers have fight an ongoing
battle with noisy personal watercraft operators
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctuary program . . . was very valuable in identifying
some important areas in the ocean,'' said Barbara Jeanne Polo,
political director of the California-based American Oceans
Campaign. ``However, their management plans didn't provide much
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Stellwagen Bank manager Barr believes that the known threats to
the sanctuary have changed much since conservationists first
proposed protecting Stellwagen Bank in the 1980s, making this the
time to increase the sanctuary's conservation work.
</P>
<P>
   New England's whale-watching industry has gone from a handful of
boats in the early 1980s to a $20 million industry _ on Stellwagen
alone _ that hauls 860,000 people a year out to see the breaching
humpbacks and other marine mammal displays, according to a study by
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   There's no evidence that whalewatching has reduced whale
populations _ the endangered humpback population has reached 10,000
and growing _ but even some whale-watch companies worry that the
industry is entering a more hazardous period when competition for
customers causes captains to take more risks.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, companies are buying high speed catamarans
that can go double the normal 15 miles per hour, allowing them to
deliver customers to Stellwagen quicker, but perhaps at the risk of
colliding with nearby whales. Last summer, the catamaran Millenium
struck and severely injured a humpback whale near Stellwagen as it
gained speed to head home.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 to 27 Stellwagen whale-watch boats are still governed
only by voluntary guidelines drafted by the industry, making
Stellwagen the least-regulated whale-watch site in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed limits need to be established on the sanctuary as well
as outside,'' said Capt. Steve Milliken of the Dolphin Fleet
whalewatch in Provincetown, at a conference on whale-watching
ethics at Massachusetts Maritime Academy in Bourne last week. ``We
should not balance the risk of a strike on the sanctuary for the
greed of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But most whale-watch companies, who regard themselves as
environmentalists, long have resisted regulations.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, Brian MacDonald of the New England Aquarium
said he prefers a stricter version of voluntary guidelines, arguing
that regulations cause ``red tape'' and are difficult to change.
</P>
<P>
   Just as whalewatching has grown, so has private boat traffic,
the so-called ``mosquito fleet'' that flocks to whales when they
break the surface. Though pleasure boaters may not be politically
well organized, the commercial shipping companies that cross
Stellwagen are, and they are sure to object to speed limits or
alternate route requirements on them.
</P>
<P>
   Because time is money, cargo ships take the fastest, most direct
course possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed limits do create a problem for the industry,'' said
Monroe, the Portland port director. He estimates that 250 cargo
ships pass through Stellwagen en route to Boston annually.
``Physically, unless you station someone at Stellwagen with a radar
gun, you can't enforce that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientific understanding of the effects of fishing gear on the
sea floor has also increased. Once regarded as a temporary
disturbance, heavy nets dragged across the ocean floor are
increasingly seen by scientists as a serious threat to the ocean's
health.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the journal Conservation Biology last month compared
the effects of fishing gear on the sea floor to clear-cutting the
forest, suggesting that bottom-dwelling creatures may take years to
recover from a single pass by a boat equipped with dragging gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the damage to the seabed with my own eyes, and it's
appalling,'' said Peter Auster, science adviser to the Stellwagen
sanctuary and director of the North Atlantic Undersea Research
Center at the University of Connecticut. ``I've seen bottoms once
covered with gardens of corals, sponges, mussels, and worms turned
into barren wastelands.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the sanctuary is considering conservation areas
within the sanctuary where fishing for bottom-dwelling fish is
either limited or banned outright. Auster will develop specific
restrictions in the months to come, but he said they will need to
be broad enough to protect the four major types of sea floor _ mud,
sand, cobble, and boulders.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, plans for conservation measures at Stellwagen
Bank come as New England's fishermen are already reeling.
Stellwagen Bank has been an important near-shore fishing ground,
providing about $12 million a year in seafood, including cod and
flounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had so many restrictions piled upon the industry in
the past several years with the shutdown of so many areas that it
is so hard to bring oneself to the point where you have to do
more,'' said William Amaru, a fishermen and member of the
regulatory New England Fishery Management Council.
</P>
<P>
   Amaru said fishermen would be more likely to go along with
restrictions in Stellwagen Bank if some of the 6,500 square miles
of closed areas were reopened.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the future of Stellwagen Bank hangs in the balance,
with some people arguing that the sanctuary should essentially
become a national park at sea, right down to charging admission.
</P>
<P>
   But sanctuary manager Barr said Stellwagen can't be compared to
a national park because of its continued commercial importance and
because the federal government cannot control access to the ocean.
Ultimately, he said, conservation measures need voluntary support
in order to work.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barr hopes that the very debate over Stellwagen's
future will get people thinking about the ocean in a new way, not
only as a place for private fishing and boating, but as a natural
wonder owned by the public. On that score, he said, New Englanders
have a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, the public will tell you that they own the
ocean,'' said Barr. ``In New England, there's no perception of that
at all.''

FROM GENTEEL BOOKSELLER TO CORPORATE GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last fall the university bookstore at which I
have worked for almost 15 years became the target of a possible
takeover by a big national bookstore chain.
</P>
<P>
   What a hypnotic moment when a long-dreaded prospect such as this
one comes to pass. The gates into the Roman Circus open, and there
they are, just as imagined _ lions.
</P>
<P>
   The new titan may be a wonderful company to work for. But in the
world of independent booksellers, the expectations for corporate
takeover are no different from any other business: lower pay, fewer
benefits, stricter rules, rigid adherence to the bottom line. To
say nothing of termination.
</P>
<P>
   And, please, let's say nothing of termination.
</P>
<P>
   A once-genteel profession, publishing and selling books is now
as rowdy a business as wildcatting for oil. Consider the turbulence
in the industry: soaring stock prices for the on-line book ordering
service Amazon.com, panic at major publishing houses over
record-setting returns of unsold books, contracts canceled, authors
dropped. And all the while, big media companies devour small
presses like hogs in a vineyard. For the executives who direct it,
this fiscal rough-and-tumble must be pure adrenalin; for those of
us at the retail level, it is excess stomach acid.
</P>
<P>
   The average bookseller does not thrive on risk. In a children's
story he would be the porcupine _ a prickly personality masking an
essentially docile nature. Many of us in the trade are aspiring
writers and artists, actors and musicians _ and never mind that
part about aspiring. Our creative temperaments are fully developed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us choose this line of work for the same reason people
choose to be cab drivers or fishermen: to steer clear of the
regular business world. What a rude trick that the global economy
now presses that world upon us.
</P>
<P>
   Rude trick or not, it happens. So here is a message for my new
corporate bosses. If this deal goes through, I'll be happy to
acquaint you with our shop's peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   I can explain, for example, my system of taping pieces of paper
_ unfinished business _ to the wall beside my desk, a wall which
now looks like one of those public bulletin boards in China. I can
explain why our senior buyer may need an extra minute to finish his
telephone orders _ so as to trade baseball stories with a
publisher's rep in Chicago he has known for years. I can introduce
you to the customer who insists on ordering books before they are
published and to the professor who requires for his class an
out-of-print textbook that he wrote himself.
</P>
<P>
   And I can help you with the scheduling _ most of us skip our
daily breaks, preferring to pause on the sales floor, now and then,
to chat for half an hour about hot new movies or the latest Cormac
McCarthy novel.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt you will wish to change some of these practices. No
doubt we will have no choice but to comply. On one point, however,
expect resistance: At our bookstore, we are not inclined to smile
upon a dress code.

MR. SMITH GOES AGAINST THE ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, N.H. _ Up here in the White Mountains, where the old
clapboard inns blend into the snowy landscape, some locals are
shaking their heads these days.
</P>
<P>
   The state's senior senator, Bob Smith, has decided to run for
president in 2000, entering what is sure to be a crowded,
high-octane Republican field. About the best some of his
conservative constituents can say is that he is over 35 and a US
citizen, the two constitutional requirements to hold the nation's
top office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a very good idea,'' said Ray Abbott,
Jackson's town moderator and the owner of a tractor business. ``I
don't think it's good for him. I don't think he can make it. I feel
very bad for him.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is from a man who counts himself a close friend of
Smith. In fact, Abbott has supported Smith in each of his races and
even says the two of them think alike when it comes to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's move may baffle some friends like Abbott, but in his
against-the-odds outburst of national ambition he is hardly without
company. Every four years, candidates seek the presidency for
reasons that are unclear _ at least to political professionals and
the media who tend to take it on themselves, even if no one asks,
to anoint candidates as viable or not.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago presidential contenders shared the campaign stage
with Alan Keyes, a former State Department official and talk-radio
host; Michigan businessman Morry Taylor; and Robert K. Dornan, then
a California representative. Each brought along a message and a
dream, and a taste for time in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   This year Smith is the first to attempt the breakthrough from
the fringes of conventional wisdom to the front of the pack. He
starts with a resume that is the match of many a presidential
hopeful _ senator, 15-year veteran of Congress, and a national
reputation for passionate conservatism, particularly on the
abortion issue. He also brings this asset to the campaign trail:
indifference to what doubters, however legion, think of his
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abraham Lincoln was criticized,'' Smith said. ``Babe Ruth hit
60 home runs but people said he was a drunk. I don't care about the
criticism. I know myself, I know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the fundamentals of a campaign, Smith starts short. He
has little money in the bank. His organization is embryonic. Many
Republicans around the state have been publicly lukewarm about his
intentions and privately pained, almost as if a friend had lost his
way. One measure of the expectations for Smith is whether he could
scare away the GOP field from the first-in-the-nation primary state
by virtue of his status as a native.
</P>
<P>
   That will not happen, said potential rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't change anything in New Hampshire,'' said Paul
Young, an adviser to publisher Steve Forbes. ``No one is going to
stay away from New Hampshire because most people believe they can
beat Bob Smith here.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, said Steve Duprey, New Hampshire's Republican chairman,
Smith has surprised his political opponents repeatedly over the
years, beginning with his first successful House race in 1984 and
most recently with his under 50 percent victory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political graveyard is littered with bodies of people who
underestimated Bob Smith,'' Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 57, said he got into this race to inspire people to do
better, to help solve the nation's problems, and to bring young
people into the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do identify with Jimmy Stewart in the movie `Mr. Smith Goes
to Washington,' '' he said. ``He was a good person who took on the
special interests and the power brokers. I believe in that, I know
it might sound simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a Vietnam veteran, is a former high school civics and gym
teacher from Tuftonboro, on Lake Winnipesaukee. His manner is not
lofty, like some Senate orators, and he towers like a bear over
most of his colleagues. On the floor, he is prone to thunder about
soldiers missing in action in Vietnam, about businesses forced to
clean up old pollution sites, and about the horror of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He once demonstrated a specific abortion procedure by bringing a
plastic baby doll to the floor of the Senate and stabbing it
repeatedly in the back of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Other pursuits that have raised eyebrows included an attempt to
keep circus elephants off the Capitol lawn and a motion to stop
NASA, on humanitarian grounds, from sending Russian monkeys up in
space for biological research.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the people who make their home in these mountains
share their senator's views against abortion, gay rights, and
anything that smacks of liberalism. They like his family values and
they like him. With the decision by Missouri Senator John Ashcroft
_ another powerful conservative voice _ not to run, there are few
choices for voters on the right of the conservative spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think his candidacy is ridiculous,'' said Brenda
Presby, the Carroll County commissioner who has long backed Smith.
But, she said, other strong candidates may leave Smith unable ``to
garner the support that he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Others question whether Smith has nationwide appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Hampshire, you don't know'' what will happen, said
Raymond Burton, the executive councilor who represents Jackson.
``But I don't think on a national level too many green lights are
blinking for him.''

CLINTON'S REAL CRIME ISN'T ABOUT MONICA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Late last month, Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., posed
a somber question to his congressional colleagues about the future
of American values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we a nation based on truth or moral relativism?'' he
asked. ``Does the truth matter?''
</P>
<P>
   Inglis was talking about the only issue to which Congress has
given its full attention, not to mention its most impassioned moral
rhetoric, for months now: Should the president of the United States
be removed from office for lying under oath about whether, where
and why he touched Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   Would that Inglis were talking about the truth in Iraq, where
hundreds of thousands of children have died as a result of our
morality-spewing nation's economic sanctions on their country.
</P>
<P>
   Economic sanctions. Such a benign sounding term. As harmless and
antiseptic as a plastic pocket protector. It conjures up images of
inconvenience: They can't export all the oil they want to or get
their hands on any iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, eight years of economic sanctions means the slow,
thoroughly preventable deaths of an estimated 5,500 Iraqi children
each month. These estimates come, not from Saddam Hussein and his
God's-on-our-side lunatic henchman, but from a host of
international relief agencies. Chief among them is UNICEF, one of
the oldest, most credible organizations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Other than question some of the numbers _ maybe only a million
Iraqis have died since the end of the Gulf War instead of 1.5
million _ no one in authority in the United States has bothered to
deny the truth of the dead and dying Iraqi kids.
</P>
<P>
   No one has to deny. The American people don't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the evidence, we refuse to take any responsibility for
the genocide in the Persian Gulf. We refuse to acknowledge that no
amount of ``humanitarian aid'' can sustain a once-developing
country for eight years, that a country's people survive through
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we are satisfied with the lame (and morally relative)
platitudes of our stumbling, policy-poor president, Congress and
the departments of Defense and State. We actually swallow the sort
of rationalization that Defense Secretary William Cohen offered
during the last round of bombing: ``Our fight is not with the Iraqi
people, it is with Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Iraqi children have simply starved to death,
particularly the ones under 5 who are the easiest to kill. Thanks
to a crippled national infrastructure and the toughest sanctions
ever imposed on any nation, their mothers' malnourished, anemic,
diseased bodies set the stage.
</P>
<P>
   As for the kids who managed to survive, at least 28 percent of
those who were born since the end of the Persian Gulf War are well
below minimal standards for healthy height and weight. Humanitarian
aid does not include animal protein, vitamins and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the little Iraqi dead have succumbed, however, to the
kinds of diseases and infections that parents in the modern world
no longer fear: Diarrhea. Typhoid. Pneumonia. Whooping cough.
</P>
<P>
   These maladies are nothing that antibiotics can't wipe out.
Nothing that rehydration tablets can't cure. Nothing that chlorine
can't purify.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad antibiotics and other medicines are not arriving or
getting through to Iraqi people in sufficient quantities. Tough
luck that chlorine, the cheapest, most efficient means of purifying
large amounts of drinking water, cannot be imported into Iraq
because of our sanctions; chlorine can be used to make biochemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like being in a war with an enemy willing to put
children on the front lines,'' said David Cortwright, president of
the 17-year-old U.S.-based Fourth Freedom Forum. ``Are you still
justified in firing, knowing you have an enemy so diabolical
they're willing to use children?''
</P>
<P>
   Based upon official assessments of last month's bombing of Iraq
by the United States and Britain, New York Times reporter Tim
Weiner concluded: ``Starving Iraq has not subverted Hussein.
Striking at his army and his spies with cruise missiles has not
toppled him. Sanctions have slowed but never stopped his drive to
build nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``As ordinary Iraqis scrounge for food and medicine, Hussein is
scouring the world for tools to build new weapons. He may be as
close to building a nuclear weapon _ perhaps closer _ than he was
in 1991, U.S. experts say.''
</P>
<P>
   Are we a nation based on truth or on moral relativism? Does the
truth matter? The answer, good citizens, is on passionate display
these days in the chamber of the U.S. Senate.
</P>

LAW PROFESSORS FIGHT MILITARY'S GAY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle over gays and lesbians in the military is about to
get new combatants: law professors across the country who complain
that their schools are being coerced into allowing Pentagon
recruiters on campus, thereby compromising their antidiscrimination
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the professors launched a drive to kill a federal
law that cuts off millions of dollars in student aid to schools
that bar on-campus military recruiters. The object, they said, will
be to simultaneously challenge the statute in court and try to
reverse it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law is an ingeniously evil piece of legislation that has
effectively pitted different constituencies of students and
faculties against each other,'' said Alan Minuskin, a professor at
Boston College Law School. He and several BC colleagues are helping
spearhead a national effort to give colleges and universities the
right _ without being penalized _ to ban recruitment because of the
armed forces' ``don't ask-don't tell'' policy toward homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to overturn the policy itself have consistently failed.
The Supreme Court has refused appeals from discharged gay soldiers
four times, and every federal appeals court that has ruled on the
issue has upheld it.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, any college or university can still prohibit
military recruiting. But a statute approved with little attention
two years ago, for which the final rules went into effect last
November, would cut off specific categories of federal student aid
to schools that treat Pentagon representatives differently from
other employers.
</P>
<P>
   Law school officials around the nation argued in interviews that
the stakes go beyond where the armed services can recruit. They
said they were offended that Congress was intruding into the
decision-making process of private educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, went further.
Pointing out that the law was championed by conservative
Republicans, Frank said: ``It's time for the rest of us to tell the
right wing that they can't run the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who intends to lead the fight on Capitol Hill, helped
formulate legislative and litigation strategy at a conference of
the Association of American Law Schools in New Orleans last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Law school officials and professors stressed they would not
object to on-campus recruitment if those involved signed the same
nondiscrimination promises required of other prospective employers.
The recruiters will not do that, however.
</P>
<P>
   Though the statute applies to all colleges and universities, it
is coming to a head at law schools because most either have
longstanding nondiscrimination regulations of their own or belong
to the Association of American Law Schools. Since 1990 that group
had barred its members from dealing with entities that
discriminate. It changed that rule last year, with words of
scathing protest, in response to the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great majority of schools have now complied, but they've
done so quite reluctantly . . . and clearly they hope to turn this
around,'' said Carl Monk, executive director of the law school
association.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Solomon, the former US House member who wrote the
legislation, said that he understands the law schools' concerns but
strongly disagrees with them. He said that a ``states-rights
advocate like myself'' doesn't like intruding on private
institutions, but believes that a more important constitutional
consideration takes precedence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providing for a common defense is most critical,'' Solomon, a
New York Republican who retired from Congress after its last
session, said. ``We can't do that if we don't offer a real
cross-section of Americans the opportunity to take up an honorable
career in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few law schools, typically ones that receive few federal
dollars in the targeted work-study and student-loan programs
anyway, have outright refused to comply with the law. Nearly all of
those that have complied, however, have also adopted ``amelioration
policies,'' as required by the law schools association as part of
its rule change on military recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   Those policies include simple procedures at law schools such as
those at Catholic University and Boston University, where notices
have been posted explaining that the recruiters' presence did not
constitute the schools' endorsement of Pentagon policy. And they
extend to far more aggressive demonstrations meant to create an
inhospitable atmosphere for the recruiters, even while abiding by
the letter of the law.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Miami Law School, which stood to lose
$200,000 in student aid, students who want information about
serving in the Judge Advocate General Corps can't simply turn to
their career-counseling office. Instead, they have to go to the
school's library and request a special binder that the Pentagon is
permitted to leave there, and only there.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law School did not join the protest against the law; it
simply declared that it was already in compliance. Harvard does not
allow its career-services office to arrange space or give
assistance for military recruitment, but individuals or
organizations on campus can act as sponsors and provide logistical
support.
</P>
<P>
   No military recruiters have yet asked for accommodations at BC
Law School, where a speech by Frank on the subject last November
drew an overflow crowd and helped launch the effort to reverse the
law. But the school, with $1.5 million in grants and loans at
stake, has adopted a policy comparable to Miami's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let it be known that we feel this technique is
deeply troubling,'' said James Rogers, the interim dean at BC Law.
``It's not a matter of law schools saying we have objections to the
military. . . . It's the pernicious fashion of holding students'
financial aid hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Told about efforts to fight the law, Solomon said he hadn't
known about the protests. ``I don't want to use terms like
un-American or anything like that,'' he said from the lobbying firm
in Washington where he now works. ``But I think they really are
trying to circumvent the law . . . and I resent it.''

TEXAS GEARS UP FOR SHOWDOWN OVER TOBACCO MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas lawmakers who begin a new session Tuesday
face a showdown over how to spend the $17.3 billion settlement
struck with the tobacco industry last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers will have their eyes on about $1.7 billion in tobacco
money for the upcoming session, the first installment of the
settlement that will be spread over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark settlement _ the largest negotiated between a
single state and the major tobacco companies _ averted what was
expected to be a drawn-out trial in federal court. Texas sued the
industry seeking to recover costs for smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Competing interests are revving their engines at the legislative
starting line, preparing for a race that could end in millions of
dollars to fund a host of pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of folks that want a piece of the pie that
are not a part of the piece of the pie right now,'' said House
Speaker Pete Laney, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is how much money the federal government will try
to get from the settlement as compensation for its share of the
Medicaid health program for poor people.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, for example, seeks money for a proposed children's
cancer institute at the University of Texas Health Science Center.
Former Attorney General Dan Morales, who helped lead the lawsuit
against the tobacco companies, helped tentatively negotiate $200
million from the tobacco settlement for the proposed center.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point ... the nickel is still in the air,'' said Dr.
John P. Howe III, president of the Health Science Center. The
ultimate outcome, he said, will only be available on the last day
of the legislative session, May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the state's leading lawmakers who control the purse
strings of the Legislature signed a memorandum of understanding
with Morales last year regarding the tobacco money. Rep. Rob
Junell, D-San Angelo, and Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant,
agreed to ``use their best efforts'' to secure funding for the
pediatric cancer center and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   While both lawmakers still say they plan to remain true to the
agreement, both cite ``the will of the Legislature'' as the
overriding factor in any talk of how state funds are spent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the memorandum of understanding, several other cities and
academic institutions will receive money for various health care
projects. These projects include $100 million to the University of
Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston; $50 million to the
Texas Tech Health Science Center; and $50 million to the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With an expected budgetary surplus and the windfall from the
tobacco settlement, those dependent on state funds are licking
their chops.
</P>
<P>
   Another big-ticket item dependent on the tobacco settlement is
the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which would help
cover the up to 1.3 million Texas children who are currently
uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative panels already have recommended that lawmakers agree
this session to give $151 million in state funds to help match
federal money for the program. CHIP allows states to craft their
own strategies for providing affordable health coverage to more
than 10 million uninsured children nationwide. The program targets
children who have fallen through the cracks of the Medicaid safety
net: those whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but
not enough to buy insurance.

WHO WILL BRING CASTRO TO JUSTICE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Encouraged, perhaps, by the chorus of approval that greeted the
arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London last October, a French lawyer
has begun legal proceedings against a different Latin American
dictator, one whose crimes began long before Pinochet seized power
in Chile and continue to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Lewisch represents two surviving victims of Fidel Castro's
machinery of repression and the widow of a third who didn't
survive. His lawsuit, filed in a Paris court last Wednesday,
accuses Castro of crimes against humanity, murder, torture, illegal
detention, and drug smuggling. That Castro is guilty of these
things is a plain fact, undisputed by honest men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the comandante will be brought to trial as a result of
Lewisch's efforts. Unlike Pinochet, Castro is an incumbent tyrant,
not a retired one. And he will have learned from what befell
Pinochet not to travel to countries where the rule of law is taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, it will be instructive to discover whether
Lewisch's attempt to bring Castro before the bar of justice is
supported by those who cheered Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish
magistrate who requested Pinochet's extradition from Britain. Kofi
Annan, for example. The UN secretary general hailed the arrest of
Pinochet as sign that ``international human-rights law is coming
into its own.'' Will he now say the same thing about the suit
against Castro?
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International (despite its name) favors putting Pinochet
in the dock and so testified before the British Law Lords. ``It is
vital now,'' says David Bull, Amnesty's director, ``that justice is
done.'' Does Amnesty consider it vital that justice be done in
Castro's case, too?
</P>
<P>
   Intellectuals have been especially insistent that Pinochet
answer for his felonies. Salman Rushdie, a novelist who knows
something about the tactics of repressive governments, celebrated
Pinochet's arrest for upholding ``the crucial principle of
universal accountability . . . . Atrocity is not to be excused by
the occupancy of high office.'' The noted Chilean writer Ariel
Dorfman, whose play ``Death and the Maiden'' deals with the
yearning of dictators' victims to see their tormentors put on
trial, saw the legal action against Pinochet as ``a gift to Chile .
. . a favor done to all Chilean citizens.'' Where do Rushdie and
Dorfman stand on calling Castro to account?
</P>
<P>
   We know where Bill Clinton stands. On Jan. 5, the administration
announced a series of changes to America's anti-Castro embargo. The
flow of dollars into Cuba will be increased; direct mail delivery
will be established; the sale of US goods to ``independent'' Cuban
farms and restaurants will be authorized; and cultural and athletic
exchanges will take place _ including a visit to Cuba by baseball's
Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is likely to have the effect not of making life
better for ordinary Cubans but of strengthening Castro's grip on
power _ and of eroding what little remains of the lonely US
campaign to isolate and exhaust the last dictator in the Western
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   This month marks the 40th anniversary of the putsch that
launched Castro's despotism. These four decades have been the worst
in Cuban history. Fidel-style communism, like all communism, has
produced an abundance of poverty, misery, refugees, oppression, and
death _ and a shortage of everything else.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, dissent is forbidden. It is a crime to engage in even
peaceful opposition that ``perturbs the socialist order.'' Hundreds
of political prisoners are behind bars for holding opinions of
which Castro disapproves. No one may leave the country without
permission. The government arrests people without warrant and holds
them without trial. There is no due process in Castro's courts, no
right to call defense witnesses, no guarantee of legal counsel.
Prisoners are beaten, malnourished, denied medical care, kept in
solitary confinement, forced into slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelismo at 40 is the ugliest thing in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the junta in Havana is no longer as homicidal as
it once was, but that is only because it no longer needs to be. The
Cubans who most hated Castro's communism, who most yearned to live
in a free democracy, are dead now. Or in exile. It is natural for
tyrannies to become less murderous as time goes on, for there are
fewer resisters left to murder. Brezhnev killed fewer people than
Stalin. Jiang Zemin has less blood on his hands than Mao did. And
Castro doesn't massacre innocents as frequently as he used to.
</P>
<P>
   He massacres when he wants to, though. And not only Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, three American citizens and one legal US
resident were massacred when Cuban MiGs blew their two tiny
airplanes out of the sky over international waters. Armando
Alejandre, Mario de la Pena, Carlos Costa, and Pablo Morales were
killed in cold blood as they patrolled the Florida Straits for the
humanitarian group Brothers to the Rescue, searching for Cuban boat
people in need of help.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of Castro's victims, these were real human beings, men
with families and friends and dreams for the future. In an earlier
era, the naked murder of four US civilians by a strutting dictator
would have ignited a terrible American fury. Today it ignites
nothing. After 40 years, we have grown so accustomed to Castro's
barbarities that we treat Cuba's enslavement as a normal fact of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Bring Castro to justice? We'll leave that to idealistic French
lawyers. Americans can't be bothered.

CALLING A FOUL ON MALDEN HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every schoolboy basketball player knows the rules: Commit too
many fouls and you'll be thrown out of the game. At Malden (Mass.)
High, it's the consequences for transgressions off the court that
aren't so clear.
</P>
<P>
   Leland Dean, an 18-year-old sophomore, is in Malden's lineup
this season despite his admission in court last May that he
sexually assaulted a 15-year-old classmate in a school stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   The judge continued Dean's case without a finding provided he
behaves himself for five years. That had little impact on the
defendant. A few months later, Dean was in trouble again, this time
for sexually harassing a classmate at Pope John XXIII Central High
School, a Catholic school in Everett where he transferred last fall
after Malden refused to let him play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, failing grades made him academically ineligible for sports
at Pope John, so last month Dean returned to Malden High, where
apparently all is forgiven if you can make a jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the basketball team had already been
chosen, room on the roster was found for Dean. He is playing on
orders from the school superintendent over the objections of the
new principal, Peter J. Lueke, the longtime athletic director,
Barry Fitzpatrick, and the arresting police officer, Kevin Molis,
who is assigned full time to Malden High.
</P>
<P>
   We'd like to hear Superintendent George E. Holland's reasoning,
but he did not return our calls. Others suggest that fear of a
lawsuit prompted the decision to let Dean play.
</P>
<P>
   That's hard to swallow. The school's athletic code of conduct
could not be more clear: ``It must be understood that participation
in athletics at Malden High School is a privilege, not a right. . .
. If an athlete, in any way, detracts from the image of the team,
school or community, whether it be on the field, the school, or
outside school, he/she will be dealt with by the coach or a higher
authority and punishment applied.''
</P>
<P>
   An athlete caught smoking for the third time, for example, is
off the team. But an admitted sex offender is eligible to play?
</P>
<P>
   Malden High also has a written policy against sexual harassment.
In capital letters, the school handbook warns: ``IF YOU DO IT, IT
WILL NOT BE TREATED LIGHTLY AND WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.'' It does
not say, ``unless you can set a pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps school administrators suffer from selective memory. It
has happened before in this case. Sister Kristin Hokanson says ``a
key factor'' in her decision to admit Dean to Pope John last
September was a glowing recommendation from his school adjustment
counselor at Malden High School, George Lyons. Lyons's letter made
no mention of the sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known Leland since he was a child. He has always
conducted himself as a gentleman with staff,'' Lyons wrote. I guess
he thought that as long as Dean was a gentleman to adults, it
wouldn't matter to Sister Hokanson that he was sexually abusive to
a student.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. The principal of Pope John understandably feels
misled by a letter that focused on Dean's ``passion for sports,''
which Lyons described as ``a definite plus,'' responsible for
Dean's ``positive attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not told. If I had known about that incident, the
outcome would have been quite different,'' Sister Hokanson says.
</P>
<P>
   She only learned of the sexual assault after Dean had withdrawn
from Pope John in November. That information might have been
helpful when a student and her parents complained that Dean had
made sexually explicit comments to her outside the school building.
``He was disciplined through our internal procedures,'' Sister
Hokanson says, ``but I do not understand why Malden withheld the
information about the prior incident.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a low rumble in Malden about the Dean case. Because no
one in authority has addressed the issue publicly, coffee shop
indictments are being issued against the principal and the athletic
director, the very people who objected to Dean's playing ball.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes at a time when residents were feeling optimistic
about the city's educational progress. Lueke is getting high marks,
even from those who supported a competing candidate to head a
school that has 28 countries and 17 native languages represented in
its student body.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the Massachusetts Education Reform Act is pouring
into the city; five new schools are under construction. But all
those shiny new facades won't represent real change if the old
lesson of tolerance of sexual assault is what's being taught
inside.

IMPEACHMENT'S SHAME BELONGS WITH CONGRESSIONAL ACCUSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt the rightward-leaning Republicans in the House of
Representatives believe they accomplished a huge part of their
agenda against President Clinton when their partisan effort
succeeded in making him only the second president in American
history to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   They believe, based on the history surrounding the other
impeached president, Andrew Johnson, that regardless of the outcome
of the Senate trial, the tag will become Clinton's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as difficult as it may be to set the record straight, the
wrong people are being relegated to history's political ``hall of
shame'' with the ``I'' label attached.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that historians and the media still write
impeachment beside the names of Johnson and Clinton as if they were
guilty of crimes so serious against the United States that they had
to be removed in order to restore democracy. But that was not the
case with either man.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, being impeached sounds far more serious than being
charged with a crime, particularly when the charge is against the
president. And it further suggests that they had to commit a
serious crime in order for the House to levy such a serious charge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite impeachment, history has proven in Johnson's case, as it
will eventually in Clinton's, that the shame of impeachment should
not be on the two presidents wrongfully charged with ``high crimes
and misdemeanors.'' Rather, it should be on the Republican members
of Congress who shamelessly manipulated the impeachment process to
achieve their own agenda _ removing the president who opposes their
views.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson had simply followed the post-Civil War agenda of the
radical Republicans to punish the South instead of following
through on President Lincoln's policy of reconciliation, he
probably would not have been impeached.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the radical Republicans also passed the Office of
Tenure Act, which forbade a president from removing any Cabinet
official during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson declared the act unconstitutional, as the US
Supreme Court later affirmed, and fired a radical Republican in his
Cabinet, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, the radical Republicans
began the impeachment process against Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Edmund G. Ross, the radical Republicans would have
succeeded in their plans to convict and remove Johnson and replace
him with one of their own, the Senate president pro tem. That would
have been a coup d'etat, posing more of a threat to democracy than
anything Johnson did. But Ross, a radical Republican, become an
unsung hero when he cast his vote against impeachment, resulting in
Johnson's acquittal by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   History and the media would better serve by more properly
describing this episode. The coup failure is more significant than
describing the event by saying ``Johnson was the only president to
be impeached'' until this year. That's a longer description, but it
is also historically more accurate and fairer to Johnson's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, many of those right-leaning Republicans are
saying almost smugly _ while some Democrats are saying sadly _ that
history will forever judge him through the taint of impeachment,
suggesting that what he did was serious enough to warrant a Senate
trial to determine whether he should leave office.
</P>
<P>
   But in Clinton's case, his affair with Monica Lewinsky is so far
removed from being a ``high crime and misdemeanor'' that the
resulting charges of ``perjury'' and ``obstruction of justice''
make a mockery of our Constitution and all three branches of our
government.
</P>
<P>
   The reason a private affair _ something more than a few
Republican congressmen are familiar with in their own lives _has
resulted in serious criminal charges against Clinton can be traced
easily and directly to the Republican right. It's no secret that
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, as disclosed in various news
accounts, is closely associated with the right.
</P>
<P>
   Spending more than $40 million in over four years of
investigating Clinton for everything from Whitewater to Travelgate,
and ending up only with a perjury trap set for the president
involving Lewinsky, suggest more was involved than a simple pursuit
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Senate moves into its trial mode, House Republicans
are pursuing with zeal an effort to further vilify Clinton at the
trial and push toward a vote for conviction and removal.
</P>
<P>
   As with Johnson, it would be far more accurate for history and
the media to portray this episode as the second attempt at a coup
against a president, using impeachment as the weapon. In both
cases, the coup attempts were led by extreme Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, as the Senate proceeds with the case, right-leaning
Republicans can be reminded that history, and the American people,
will treat them as these Republicans have treated Clinton.

COACH DESERVES A HIGH GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's not too early in 1999 to choose a hero of
the year. Let's nominate Ken Carter. He is the basketball coach of
the Richmond Oilers, a high school team dominant in the
Alameda-Contra Costa Athletic League and ranked third statewide in
their division.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers enjoyed a 13-0 record until the coach padlocked the
gymnasium and locked up the basketballs. Since he started
forfeiting games, players now spend their two-hour practice session
not shooting hoops, but studying in the library. They will do so
until their grades improve.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond, an industrial city of 92,000 across San Francisco Bay
from San Quentin, is a big basketball town and has been since
Carter himself set the school's all-time scoring record in 1977.
Ditching the Oilers' prospects for glory, the coach said, ``I want
young men to understand that basketball is just one small portion
of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this guy crazy or what? Naive? Old-fashioned? ``This is
really important to me,'' the coach said. ``How many of these young
men are going to make their living playing basketball?'' He
answered his own question when interviewed by the local media.
``About one in 500,000, maybe,'' he replied. ``It's more important
that we produce good citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Although just seven members on the roster were in academic
trouble, he benched the entire varsity and junior varsity squads, a
total of 45 players. The league requires a grade point average of
2.0, but Carter demands more. His son Damien, a sophomore, has a
3.5 GPA, but he's also logging extra library time because, coach
Carter says, ``This is a team sport.''
</P>
<P>
   A team sport? Coach, do you own a television set? Basketball is
now a solo endeavor. It's not the bounce pass or the rebound, but
the celebratory slam-dunk that hits the highlight shows.
</P>
<P>
   Carter did not participate in the historic struggle that ended
last week, when the billionaires and millionaires of the National
Basketball Association chose to inhabit a peaceable courtside
kingdom. Much like an Iran vs. Iraq war, their labor dispute
engendered public attitudes ranging from distracted apathy to an
earnest wish for heavy casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But diehard fans were edging toward despair. The prospect of
empty sofas and deserted divans was chilling in this winter of
discontent. How would NBA fanatics know which sneakers to buy?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Carter's benched players will, like casual fans, enjoy a
vacation from hoopster hype. This will allow time to sharpen the
focus on what's wrong with most major-league sports. Celebrating
too much over too little has reduced the importance of team in team
sports.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite athletes was Art Monk, a pass-catching
artisan at Syracuse University, then the Washington Redskins and
New York Jets. When he scored a touchdown, he did not gavotte,
pirouette, or implode in a paroxysm of choreographed glee.
</P>
<P>
   What did he do? Art Monk handed the ball to the referee. Like
Barry Sanders, the Detroit Lion running back, he treated the end
zone as a familiar place, which he'd seen before and which he
expected to see again.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, noncelebratory touchdown is rare precisely because it
is an eloquently unspoken tribute to 10 teammates who helped one
arrive there. The National Football League tried to ban end-zone
convulsions with penalties for unsportsmanlike conduct. This action
goaded cockier players into celebrating 10 yards before they
scored, accelerating the aging process of their coaches. One day a
brave coach will fine a premature celebrant $1,000 per inch.
</P>
<P>
   A self-conscious salute has become a scoring ritual for the
Denver Broncos in pro football and the Pittsburgh Penguins in the
National Hockey League. It looks as silly as sundry other versions
of the dance named for St. Vitus. Anyone seeking further
information on St. Vitus can check with coach Carter's benchees.
They can be found in the Richmond High School library.

SWF SEEKS TRULY HONEST PERSONALS AD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; read the personals. I'm not in the market for someone. Not at
the moment, anyway. I read the personals looking for clues to the
state of relations between the sexes. And I read them for fun too,
I admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, scanning the personals in the Globe's Calendar section,
I see there are fewer ``soul mates'' wanted than there were a few
years ago. And there aren't as many men as there used to be who use
the word ``gentleman'' as a self-description. What are we to make
of this? Or is it obvious? There are, however, more women who use
the term ``gentlewoman'' to indicate that they're . . . what?
Well-educated? Well-behaved? Not to be trifled with?
</P>
<P>
   Fewer women are looking for ``Prince Charming.'' And fewer men
are looking for their ``dream girl.'' Long, romantic walks are
still a personal-ad staple. But almost nobody wants to drink wine
in front of a fire anymore. They'd rather be golfing, or skiing, or
antiquing. Spontaneity is much sought after. Sensuality too. And
fitness. Both sexes continue to prize a sense of humor. But
kindness and caring are making inroads as desired qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never change. The overwhelming majority of men and
women who advertise describe themselves, variously, as attractive,
handsome, pretty, beautiful, adorable, awesome, striking, sexy,
gorgeous, cute, appealing, etc.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to all the people who aren't good-looking? Where do
they advertise? Is there a special place somewhere for those who
can't bring themselves to boast (or to lie) about their looks?
``Plain, portly SWM, peculiar habits, enjoys TV, pizza, beer,
sitting around doing nothing, seeks older woman who reminds him of
his mother, for mutual recrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't see ads like that, and for good reason, I suppose.
Although occasionally there's an ad like this one: ``Night
worker/DWF, 38, n/s, 5'7'' full figured, average looks, enjoys
traveling, camping. . .'' There's something very appealing about
that ad. If Diogenes were walking among us with his lamp, looking
for an honest woman, he'd find her on page 36 of last Thursday's
Calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Syatt, the local singles dance tsar, tells of two people
who found one another through the personals and arranged to meet.
They arrived at the appointed place but failed to recognize one
another because they'd both lied so extravagantly about their
looks. I wonder if this happens a lot. Maybe that's why so many
people who advertise are hoping to meet someone with a sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   I'm struck by how much more wildly creative men are than women
when it comes to describing themselves in the personals. Here's a
selection of words and terms in the Men Seeking Women section of
last week's Calendar. Housebroken. Gymnophile. Multifarious.
Overeducated. Spiritual humanitarian. Robert Redford type. Richard
Gere look-alike. Charlton Heston look-alike. Simply irresistible.
Diamond-in-the- rough. Litterateur. Controlling. Complete package.
Enjoys NPR, body surfing. Blue-blooded. Comfortable in the
wilderness or museum. Eccentric. Quippy. Aware. Bon vivant. A heart
three times bigger than other men.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, women seem to be somewhat less imaginative
in describing themselves, although there are those who take flight,
to wit: ``High Tech beauty . . . Danish version of Vivien Leigh . .
.''; or ``Dorothy by day, Catwoman by night. . .''; or ``Plymouth
Rockette. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Almost always there's the odd gem to be found in the personals.
My favorite from last week's is this: ``God's Teeth. Seeking Andie
MacDowell look-alike 40 to 60.''
</P>
<P>
   I wish him luck.

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE: DIALING UP DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Competition offers consumers some great benefits, but
unfortunately it tends to come with a lot of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Directory assistance is a good example. It used to be so simple.
You dialed 411 to find a local number and 1 plus the area code plus
555-1212 for long-distance numbers. Rates and service were
generally uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But all that's changed. Now prices and the quality of listings
vary dramatically from company to company and even within the same
company. AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom both offer two directory assistance
services and at both companies the more expensive service actually
delivers less.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, for example, charges $1.40 for up to two listings on its
traditional directory assistance service, which is reached by
dialing an area code plus 555-1212. By dialing 00, the same AT&AMP;T
customer would pay just 95 cents for the same two listings. And he
wouldn't need to look up the area code and could even get a free
connection to the number.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has a similar deal. Its 555-1212 service is
available only to its customers and costs $1.40 for up to two
listings. Its new, heavily promoted 10-10-9000 national directory
assistance service is open to anyone, costs 99 cents and provides
up to two listings and a free connection.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing? Just wait. Other companies are also eager to snare
some of the estimated 8 billion calls made to directory assistance
each year. And the market should grow, given the phone number
changes arising from the explosion of new area codes around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   By June, Bell Atlantic expects to begin offering its national
411 service in Massachusetts. For 95 cents, customers can dial 411
and obtain local listings or up to two long-distance listings.
</P>
<P>
   Although AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom, and Bell Atlantic all tell you
their directory assistance services can be used to track down local
and long-distance numbers, Bell Atlantic is the only cost-effective
choice on the local front.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom will charge you their full price for each
local listing, while Bell Atlantic is currently required to give
Massachusetts customers 10 free local listings each month and
charge 37 cents a call after that.
</P>
<P>
   The other cautionary note about 10-10-9000 is the ``free''
connection. If you're an MCI WorldCom customer, you're connected
and charged the rates provided in your MCI WorldCom calling plan.
But if you're not a customer, you'll be charged the highest rates
MCI WorldCom offers.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel A. Simon, chairman of the Telecommunications Research and
Action Center, a Washington-based consumer group, said he is
uncomfortable with the 10-10-9000 plan since it entices people to
use it when they might be better off elsewhere. His recommendation:
Use the Internet to search for numbers whenever possible and avoid
all charges. (TRAC offers access to many of the Internet directory
assistance sites at its web site: www.trac.org.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Internet approach is that many of the
databases are not up to date. We checked listings for a couple that
moved to Tucson in August and couldn't find their number on any of
the Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The same problem exists to a lesser degree with directory
assistance provided by phone companies. ``Your service is only as
good as your database,'' said Fred Voit, communications analyst at
the Yankee Group consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, local Bell companies have the best phone records,
since customers moving in and out have to contact them to obtain or
shut off local phone service. The Bells sell access to their
databases, but some companies have balked at paying.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T struck off on its own several years ago, setting up its own
phone number database. It went through a withering shakedown
period, when operators couldn't seem to find even the most basic
numbers. The situation has improved, but company officials
acknowledge their database could be better.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic says it will pay for access to other Bells'
databases in high-calling areas such as California and Illinois,
but not in many other parts of the country. MCI WorldCom says its
policy is to buy access to all the Bell networks, but spokesman
Brad Burns said that's not always possible because some of the
Bells charge excessive rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic spokesman James Smith said the long-distance
companies are blaming the local Bells to hide the fact that they
are making very large profits on directory assistance. According to
Smith, if a company hires Bell Atlantic to provide directory
assistance for the Northeast and uses Bell Atlantic operators, Bell
Atlantic charges 30 to 40 cents a call. If the company uses its own
operators and just uses Bell Atlantic's data base, the cost is
about 10 to 15 cents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With companies charging 95 cents to $1.40 for each directory
assistance call, ``there's an awful lot of margin built in there,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   CD deal
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one would call us hip when it comes to music. After all, one
of us listens to the ``Titanic'' soundtrack while driving a station
wagon and the other listens to Aretha Franklin in a minivan. But we
do know a good deal when we see it, and the latest CD and tape
offering from Columbia House is worth checking out.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get us wrong. Columbia House still offers ``free'' CDs
that aren't really free, doesn't disclose all costs to consumers up
front, and doesn't carry the latest releases. But it finally has
done away with the annoying requirement that club members mail in a
card each month if they don't want that month's featured release.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask our members what they don't like about the club,
it's that they get shipments they don't want,'' said Sharon Kuroki,
executive vice president of music marketing at Columbia House, a
joint venture of Warner Music and Sony. Columbia House has 8
million members.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``no-more-cards'' offer is being featured in TV ads, on
the back of last week's Parade magazine, and in direct-mail
solicitations. The direct-mail solicitation offers 12 CDs or tapes
for ``free'' with an obligation to buy five more over the next two
years at full price. You can also buy another CD at 60 percent of
the full price and get two more ``free.''
</P>
<P>
   We keep putting ``free'' in quotation marks because the CDs
aren't exactly free. Shipping and handling charges apply, although
Columbia House doesn't say how much they are in its ads or give a
number to call. Even Pam Marshall, the membership director who
signed Columbia House's direct-mail solicitation, doesn't exist.
The company operator said the name is a pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   On the initial order with the direct-mail offering, you have to
pay shipping and handling charges of $2.19 per item, which works
out to a total of $26.28 for 12 CDs or tapes. After that, the fee
is $2.59 per item.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these excessive fees, the deal is attractive. If you
buy the club's highest-priced CDs at $16.98, the basic offer nets
you 17 CDs for $124.13, or $7.30 apiece. If you take the additional
offer for three more, the average price drops to $7. And the price
drops even further if you buy lower-priced CDs, opt for tapes, or
take advantage of ubiquitous two-for-one deals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakes concerns
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doyle Kint of Ayer, Mass. asked us for help in getting a
long-awaited $600 refund from Travel Group International, a Florida
agency we wrote about last year involved in sweepstakes-related
travel scams. The group collects names from sweepstakes boxes at
major athletic centers, including the FleetCenter last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Later by phone, Travel Group calls participants to announce that
they ``won'' a vacation to Florida or the Caribbean. However, the
trip is hardly free after it assesses extra fees on your credit
card. Some customers even fail to get any tickets, while others are
disappointed by the arrangements once there.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Kint had agreed to pay $600 for a vacation for
two, but then never got any tickets. He demanded a refund and has
waited a year to no avail. After several phone calls to the group
on Friday, Carmen Torres, customer service manager for Travel
Group, said she personally has ordered the refund and provided us
with a reference number to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Odds &AMP; Ends
</P>
<P>
   --Discover fees go up. The folks at Discover Card notified
customers last week that fees for returned checks, paying late, and
going over the limit are increasing from $25 to $29. They also
reserved the right to make additional changes in the card agreement
in the future with 15 days notice rather than the current 30.

81-YEAR-OLD WIDOW SHOULD CASH OUT OF ANNUITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a widow 81 years old. My income consists of a pension
and Social Security totaling $12,936 a year, an interest in a
midwestern farm that brings me $6,000 to $9,000 annually, and the
yield from $52,000 in money market accounts and a short-term bond
fund. I also have an annuity which will be worth $296,00 in April.
I can then opt for a $2,400 monthly payment for life, (10 years
certain,) or I can cash out and face a 4 percent surrender charge.
Or I could wait two years, earning a lower rate than the 5.75
percent it now pays, and there would be no surrender charge. I have
spoken to a financial advisor, and he wants me to surrender the
annuity and transfer the proceeds to a variable annuity account
invested in a diverse portfolio of mutual funds. What do you think
of this plan?
</P>
<P>
   O.W., Chula Vista, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, let's consider what would happen if you were to cash
out. If you went with the variable annuity plan and withdrew $2,400
a month, how long would the money last? If your returns on a
variable annuity account of $284,160 (reflecting the surrender fee)
were 6.5 percent, it would be good for 15.4 years. If you had
average returns of 8.14 percent, it would last 19 years, taking you
to the century mark. Or you might decide to take a smaller monthly
payment, calculating to preserve your capital. For example, if you
withdrew $1,494 a month and realized 6.5 percent returns on the
total portfolio, you would have no erosion of your principal.
</P>
<P>
   Tempting as it is to wait through the two years so you could
bypass the surrender charge, I'm inclined to side with your
advisor. (If there were no decline in the earnings, you'd have to
realize investment returns of 7.93 percent to draw even with the
value which you would have if you waited out the two years. But the
decline in returns for those final two years probably is sufficient
to make it unattractive to wait.)
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not quite so enthusiastic about the fund portfolio the
advisor is proposing; you list a half-dozen suggested funds, but
give no projected allocation of your money among them. These range
from funds tracking the Standard and Poor's 500 Index and world
stock funds at one end to the kind of things I'm more comfortable
with for a person such as yourself _ government securities and
other fixed-income holdings _ at the other. I suspect that your
advisor put the proposed portfolio together so that it might have
the potential to achieve a considerably higher growth rate than the
6.5 percent I used in most of my calculations. If I were you, I'd
put the brakes on this thinking, settling for a likely lower rate
of return and a higher degree of safety. I suggest you direct that
the portfolio be no more than 35 percent invested in stocks, and
I'd be happier if the number were 20 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, I would cash out the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 59 and plan to retire at age 60. I have a total of
$800,000, mostly in money markets and the like. It's evenly divided
between taxable and tax-deferred accounts. I have to live off this
capital, but I don't know where to put it so I can have a steady
income every month. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   I.T., Irvine, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I wish I knew something about your standard of living _ how
much money you feel you need to be comfortable. In the ideal
situation, you could make do on about $38,500 a year _ which would
allow you to invest $650,000 so as to produce that income and leave
another $150,000 invested for growth, to protect you against the
very credible threat of future inflation. This presumes a portfolio
average return of 6.5 percent on the fixed- income side. If you
followed this plan, you would not only be well protected against
inflation, but your principal would be growing rather than receding
as you age.
</P>
<P>
   But you also could simply invest the entire $800,000 in a
fixed-income portfolio, drawing $50,000 a year with a reasonable
assurance that there would be very little erosion - - and more
likely a small appreciation _ of your principal. As for inflation,
if you adopt this plan you could simply rely on that sizable
$800,000 nest egg for protection; in later years, as your
short-term expenses increased through inflation, you could begin to
tap into capital, being fairly confident that there would be enough
money there to last you out.
</P>
<P>
   Or finally, you could take the bold step of projecting that
you'll last no longer than age 90 _ or any other number you select.
Using the example of age 90, you could then invest the entire
$800,000 in a 6.5 percent fixed-income portfolio and withdraw
$4,956 a month, or $59,472 annually. If you died precisely at age
90, you would die precisely broke. If you don't reach that age, you
could make some nice bequests. But it gets sticky if you have
underestimated your longevity. I've been trying for years to locate
a story I read some decades ago, probably by Somerset Maugham or
Joseph Conrad. It involves a philosophical middle-aged fellow who
bought a fixed annuity of ten years or so, using his entire life
savings for the purchase. He calculated that a decade of pleasure
without toil was all a man should expect of this world, and he
would take his while he was in good health _ and then bump himself
off. He began in stout resolve, but after 10 years of easy living,
he had softened, and the end was ugly. Does anybody out there
remember the name or author of that one?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, however you decide to proceed, I'd suggest a
fixed-income portfolio consisting 50 percent of a good GNMA fund
such as those offered by Fidelity or Vanguard, 25 percent in a
solid high-yield, or junk, bond fund, again widely available, and
the final 25 percent in a mixture of money market funds, CDs, and
short-term bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   You'd probably get more than 6.5 percent average returns, but a
margin for error is a nice thing, eh? And if you do decide to put
some of the money in stock as your hedge against inflation, I'd
take a plain vanilla approach, going with a fund tracking the
Standard and Poor's 500 Index and using a 36-month dollar cost
averaging discipline to establish your position.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 65 years old and my wife is 64. I have a company pension
and we both receive Social Security benefits. I also work
part-time, earning $5,000 a year. I have a 401(k) plan now worth
$370,000 and an IRA account of $75,000. My wife has an IRA worth
$50,000. We have never made any withdrawals, and I feel we should
start soon. What is the minimum we should start withdrawing in
order to avoid future penalties?

   A. There are no penalties per se involved with IRA withdrawals,
but rather a rule which stipulates that you must begin a sequence
of minimum withdrawals beginning after the owner of an IRA reached
age 70 1/2. Basically, the rule involves a calculation with one
figure based on the life expectancies of the owner and beneficiary
and other being the IRA balance. For example, if you were to wait
until you were 70 years old, you would be required to divide the
balance of the your IRA and 401(k) accounts by 21.1, withdrawing at
least that much as taxable income. Each year, as you and your
beneficiary grow older, the divisor gets lower, and the amount you
must withdraw tends to grow accordingly larger. I say ``tends to''
because that first withdrawal represents only 4.73 percent of the
balance. The odds are that if your money is invested well, the
internal growth of the account will exceed the amount of the
withdrawal in the early years _ although that wouldn't necessarily
be true if your investment returns are negative or low. But a
decade later the formula would call for a withdrawal representing
7.8 percent of the balance, and the withdrawal could well exceed
internal growth. Of course, if you have volatile holdings such as
stocks, all bets are off, since it's nearly impossible to predict
the year-end portfolio value with any precision.
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider what would happen if you waited until age 70 to
withdraw from your own tax-deferred accounts. Presuming 8 percent
average annual portfolio growth from now until then, your accounts
would be worth $649,737. Thus your first mandatory withdrawal must
be at least $30,793. For many people, this would be sufficient to
drive them into a higher tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider what would happen if you were to begin withdrawals
early. Suppose you were to take out $2,000 a month starting now.
The result, maintaining the assumption of 8 percent average annual
returns, would be that after five years the account would be worth
$503,745. With that balance, your first mandatory withdrawal would
be $23,874 _ which would at least suggest that there would be no
big bump in your taxable income once you reach the age of mandatory
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   These calculations, of course, are made without regard to your
overall tax situation, and they also don't include your wife's IRA.
You'll have to juggle with various figures to calculate the
withdrawal sequence that best suits your specific tax situation.

!!! 1/2 ``A Civil Action'' Based on the landmark Woburn toxic-waste
case in which two giant corporations were sued for poisoning well
water with toxins that eight families claimed caused the leukemia
that killed their children, this film is fascinating in proportion
to its departures from the familiar script for a Hollywood
courtroom thriller. Exchanging the usual clear-cut issues and
resounding triumph of justice for ambiguity, complication, and
darkness, it's powered by strong performances: John Travolta's
cocky ambulance-chaser turned humble; Robert Duvall's shrewd legal
antagonist; all the actors projecting the decency and dignity of
the family members. (PG-13)

!!! ``The Thin Red Line'' Terrence Malick's long-awaited film of
James Jones's epic World War II novel about a rifle company on
Guadalcanal is distinguished by its attempt to alternate the usual
hellish battle scenes with introspective moments depicting what's
going on the hearts and minds and memories of the GIs. As it
stands, it's most of the way toward being a great film. Had Malick
been given more time to trim and shape it, it might have seemed
more a classic, and less a screenful of the ingredients of one. (R)

   &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   From the 1940s to the 1960s, the 18-mile stretch of beaches,
coves and lagoons at the tip of western Mexico's Baja Peninsula was
an exclusive hideaway for the rich and famous, according to Bob
Schulman, an airline executive from Aurora, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he says, you could spot the silky set's private
planes and yachts everywhere. Erroll Flynn, Tyrone Power, Lana
Turner and the gang came down for a few days to fish in waters
teeming with marlin and sailfish. Some stars hunted; others cut a
quiet deal away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, a rutted dirt road linked the two main cities:
Cabo San Lucas (Cape of St. Luke) at the southern end of the strip
and San Jose del Cabo (St. Joseph of the Cape) at the northern end.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the region encompassing the two cities, as well as the
resort hotels dotting the stretch between them, is called Los Cabos
(the Capes), or Cabo for short. And mature travelers from the
United States now pour in from some of the top cruise ships, and on
the jets of a half-dozen major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   All told, about 22 different cruise ships stop at Cabo each
year, some once a week. Cabo typically hosts two to four ships a
week from Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Princess and Holland America.
They anchor a half-mile out on the bay at Cabo San Lucas. From
there, it's a 10-minute ride by ships' tender or water taxi to the
dock.
</P>
<P>
   On shore, visitors usually have the better part of a day to take
in as much of the city and surrounding areas as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman says it's easy to get around. Just sign up for a
four-hour motorcoach tour at the cost of about $15 a person. Or, he
suggests that several travelers share a rental car and reduce
sightseeing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a four-wheel motorbike called an ATV
(all-terrain vehicle), which can be rented for three hours for
about $45.
</P>
<P>
   To share a van with three or four others, the tab for a ride
from Cabo San Lucas to San Jose del Cabo and back runs about $8 per
person. Or for a closer look at how residents live, take a local
bus between the two towns with many stops along the way _ all for
about $1 per person one way.
</P>
<P>
   World-class fishing is still a big draw (200-pounders are
considered lightweights here), but rods and reels are fast sharing
the stage with mashies and putters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, developers have created four championship golf courses,
Schulman says. Each is a well-watered oasis surrounded by deserts,
spiky Joshua trees and breathtaking views of the Sea of Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   If cruise passengers return for longer stays, they can bed down
in one of the area's 30-plus resort hotels, which offer close to
4,500 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon are another 1,500 rooms that are being built by such
chains as the Ritz Carlton and Fiesta Americana. Local officials
predict growth to as many as 10,000 rooms _ half the size of
Mexico's premier resort at Cancun _ over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Among the luxury hotels that have sprouted on Cabo's beaches and
hillsides in recent years are the Westin Regina, Melia Cabo Real,
Las Ventanas al Paraiso, Pueblo Bonito and its all-suite sister
resort the Pueblo Bonito Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The two latter hotels, which look out on the bay from El Medano
Beach, typify the area's distinctive Mediterranean-style
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Cabo's dining spots range from fast-food franchises (McDonald's,
Domino's Pizza, KFC and so forth) to traditional Mexican eateries
to the gourmet offerings of fine restaurants with names such as
Alfonso's, Peacock's and Da Georgio's.
 &UR; ABOUT THE TOWNS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nestled along a mile-long bay, Cabo San Lucas (population
35,000, and growing fast) is where the action is. Shops, designer
arcades and dozens of lively cantinas line the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Baja Peninsula ends about a mile out from the city at a huge
rock formation called El Arco (the arch), Cabo's signature
landmark.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most awesome natural wonders, El Arco is
often shown in the TV series ``Land's End,'' which was taped around
Cabo.
 &UR; SAN JOSE DEL CABO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to upbeat Cabo San Lucas, San Jose del Cabo is a
laidback, pleasant city of meandering streets and lush palm groves.
It is home to 24,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose made the maps in 1730 when the Jesuits built a mission
there. It later gained some prominence as a trading center for
passing ships.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman says that despite a recently completed golf course and
seven resort hotels, San Jose still retains the charm of its
colonial heritage.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests a visit to the funky little town of Todos Santos
(All Saints) 75 miles up the coast where the 200-year-old village
offers a mix of some 3,000 locals, mostly farming families, and 350
or so North American expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   Their paintings, carvings, stoneware and other crafts are sold
in galleries that dot the village's pot-holed avenidas. With the
artists have come some toney restaurants, one of which, the Cafe
Santa Fe, is worth the trip, Schulman says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Todos Santos' best-known landmark, the Hotel
California _ the one in the Eagles' song of the '70s. Back then,
the inn was a favorite haunt for hippies wandering across western
Mexico. They rented hammocks for $2 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman spent an hour or so in the hotel's bar listening to _
what else? _ Eagles' tunes blasting away virtually nonstop on the
CD player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a time capsule from the '70s,'' said one pub
patron, a dentist from Mexico City who was playing hooky from a
convention in Cabo. ``I just can't wait to tell everyone I was at
the real Hotel California. And I've got a Hotel California T-shirt
to prove it.'' (At $20 each, no less.)

<P>
   &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   From the 1940s to the 1960s, the 18-mile stretch of beaches,
coves and lagoons at the tip of western Mexico's Baja Peninsula was
an exclusive hideaway for the rich and famous, according to Bob
Schulman, an airline executive from Aurora, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, he says, you could spot the silky set's private
planes and yachts everywhere. Erroll Flynn, Tyrone Power, Lana
Turner and the gang came down for a few days to fish in waters
teeming with marlin and sailfish. Some stars hunted; others cut a
quiet deal away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, a rutted dirt road linked the two main cities:
Cabo San Lucas (Cape of St. Luke) at the southern end of the strip
and San Jose del Cabo (St. Joseph of the Cape) at the northern end.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the region encompassing the two cities, as well as the
resort hotels dotting the stretch between them, is called Los Cabos
(the Capes), or Cabo for short. And mature travelers from the
United States now pour in from some of the top cruise ships, and on
the jets of a half-dozen major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   All told, about 22 different cruise ships stop at Cabo each
year, some once a week. Cabo typically hosts two to four ships a
week from Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Princess and Holland America.
They anchor a half-mile out on the bay at Cabo San Lucas. From
there, it's a 10-minute ride by ships' tender or water taxi to the
dock.
</P>
<P>
   On shore, visitors usually have the better part of a day to take
in as much of the city and surrounding areas as they can.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman says it's easy to get around. Just sign up for a
four-hour motorcoach tour at the cost of about $15 a person. Or, he
suggests that several travelers share a rental car and reduce
sightseeing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a four-wheel motorbike called an ATV
(all-terrain vehicle), which can be rented for three hours for
about $45.
</P>
<P>
   To share a van with three or four others, the tab for a ride
from Cabo San Lucas to San Jose del Cabo and back runs about $8 per
person. Or for a closer look at how residents live, take a local
bus between the two towns with many stops along the way _ all for
about $1 per person one way.
</P>
<P>
   World-class fishing is still a big draw (200-pounders are
considered lightweights here), but rods and reels are fast sharing
the stage with mashies and putters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, developers have created four championship golf courses,
Schulman says. Each is a well-watered oasis surrounded by deserts,
spiky Joshua trees and breathtaking views of the Sea of Cortes.
</P>
<P>
   If cruise passengers return for longer stays, they can bed down
in one of the area's 30-plus resort hotels, which offer close to
4,500 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon are another 1,500 rooms that are being built by such
chains as the Ritz Carlton and Fiesta Americana. Local officials
predict growth to as many as 10,000 rooms _ half the size of
Mexico's premier resort at Cancun _ over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Among the luxury hotels that have sprouted on Cabo's beaches and
hillsides in recent years are the Westin Regina, Melia Cabo Real,
Las Ventanas al Paraiso, Pueblo Bonito and its all-suite sister
resort the Pueblo Bonito Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The two latter hotels, which look out on the bay from El Medano
Beach, typify the area's distinctive Mediterranean-style
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Cabo's dining spots range from fast-food franchises (McDonald's,
Domino's Pizza, KFC and so forth) to traditional Mexican eateries
to the gourmet offerings of fine restaurants with names such as
Alfonso's, Peacock's and Da Georgio's.
 &UR; ABOUT THE TOWNS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nestled along a mile-long bay, Cabo San Lucas (population
35,000, and growing fast) is where the action is. Shops, designer
arcades and dozens of lively cantinas line the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Baja Peninsula ends about a mile out from the city at a huge
rock formation called El Arco (the arch), Cabo's signature
landmark.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most awesome natural wonders, El Arco is
often shown in the TV series ``Land's End,'' which was taped around
Cabo.
 &UR; SAN JOSE DEL CABO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to upbeat Cabo San Lucas, San Jose del Cabo is a
laidback, pleasant city of meandering streets and lush palm groves.
It is home to 24,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose made the maps in 1730 when the Jesuits built a mission
there. It later gained some prominence as a trading center for
passing ships.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman says that despite a recently completed golf course and
seven resort hotels, San Jose still retains the charm of its
colonial heritage.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests a visit to the funky little town of Todos Santos
(All Saints) 75 miles up the coast where the 200-year-old village
offers a mix of some 3,000 locals, mostly farming families, and 350
or so North American expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   Their paintings, carvings, stoneware and other crafts are sold
in galleries that dot the village's pot-holed avenidas. With the
artists have come some toney restaurants, one of which, the Cafe
Santa Fe, is worth the trip, Schulman says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Todos Santos' best-known landmark, the Hotel
California _ the one in the Eagles' song of the '70s. Back then,
the inn was a favorite haunt for hippies wandering across western
Mexico. They rented hammocks for $2 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman spent an hour or so in the hotel's bar listening to _
what else? _ Eagles' tunes blasting away virtually nonstop on the
CD player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a time capsule from the '70s,'' said one pub
patron, a dentist from Mexico City who was playing hooky from a
convention in Cabo. ``I just can't wait to tell everyone I was at
the real Hotel California. And I've got a Hotel California T-shirt
to prove it.'' (At $20 each, no less.)
</P>
<P>
   For information about Cabo, contact your travel agent or call
the Mexican Government Tourism Office at (800) 446-3942.
</P>
<P>
   Another source is a special fax line offering rundowns on Cabo's
hotels, attractions and shopping. Dial (541) 385-9282 and follow
the instructions to receive free faxes from various Mexican
destinations.

   &UR; By EVERETT POTTER &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The urge to suddenly hop on a plane and head for the mountains
of Utah or Colorado is the dream of many skiers and snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that with a bit of planning, any skier can head
for the hills at a moment's notice. In fact, with the exception of
Christmas and Presidents' week, the entire ski season is fair game
for a last-minute trip at a price that won't inflict bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clear advantages to traveling at the last minute is
having much more control over the weather. That's been especially
important during an early ski season like this one, when warm
temperatures and lack of snowfall made for less-than-ideal
conditions in the Rockies and New England but left Lake Tahoe
resorts like Squaw Valley and Northstar-at-Tahoe with a snow
bounty.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling last-minute allows skiers to seek out the optimum
conditions to make the most of their limited skiing time.
</P>
<P>
   Some ski tour operators have been known to promise skiers that
they can get them to the slopes within 24 hours. That's certainly
possible, but getting documents like airline tickets sent to a
skier via overnight mail makes such extreme short-notice trips
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Most ski tour operators, travel agents or central reservations
offices can't promise such a quick turnaround. The minimum amount
of time for last-minute Western ski trips, from either the East or
West Coast, is typically three days. The cost, remarkably enough,
is usually the same as it would be three months out plus whatever
the FedEx charges are.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in the age of Web travel, last-minute ski vacations
may be one of the last vestiges of an established system that
relies on travel agents, ski tour operators or a ski resort's
central reservations office to make travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is airfare. Try to get a domestic airline ticket from
the Web or directly from an airline without a seven-day advance
purchase or a Saturday night stay and the fares are prohibitively
expensive, often full-fare economy.
</P>
<P>
   But travel professionals such as ski tour operators negotiate
contracts for cheap, bulk-rate airfares with the airlines months
before the season commences. Provided that those seats are still
available, they have access to them up to 24 hours before a flight
leaves. What's more, bulk airfares are not subject to Saturday
night stay-overs or advance-purchase restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   To find these unsold fares, the best last-minute strategy is to
avoid flying weekends, to take whatever airline is available and to
be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ski tour operators, the central reservations offices of
major ski areas have access to these fares and packages as well.
One advantage to working with them is that they know their
properties inside and out. They're geared to act as a clearinghouse
for unsold rooms, which are generally sold for the same price as an
advance booking.
</P>
<P>
   They know which hotel or condo has a last-minute cancellation or
who may be offering a discount during a slow week. They can be
especially helpful to skiers who are driving to their destination,
whether it's Colorado's Summit County or Vermont's Green Mountains.
Without air to worry about, there's a lot more flexibility in days,
arrival times and location.
</P>
<P>
   Availability, of course, is the key. Skiers stand a much better
chance of getting into ski resorts with a large number of beds _
places like Vail or Killington _ than they do at smaller resorts
like Big Sky or Taos.
</P>
<P>
   And as the saying goes, money isn't everything. Even skiers who
want and can afford pricier lodgings such as The Sonnenalp in Vail
or The Little Nell in Aspen may find that they're in such demand
that they're all but impossible to get into at the last minute. But
with flexible expectations, it's possible to find accommodations in
a place that's comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are flying, and assuming cost is a consideration,
the cheapest flights are usually to the larger airports that serve
multiple resorts, such as Denver, Colorado Springs, Salt Lake City
and Reno. All of these airports benefit from direct flights and
airline competition.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to ski areas like Aspen, Jackson Hole or Telluride is
more problematic. A two-flight destination means purchasing two
last-minute tickets, perhaps on two different airlines, which
sharply reduces the odds of getting a good price and actually
getting on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the time factor to consider. Many last-minute trips
are just three or four days long. An extra flight eats into skiing
time and greatly increases the chance of weather-related delays.
</P>
<P>
   To optimize last-minute travel options, think seasonally. In the
late season, count on going after April 1 to take advantage of a
season's worth of snow, not to mention empty airline seats and
hotel rooms. Here are some ski tour operators to contact:

   BOSTON _ Robert Brustein set up shop at the American Repertory
Theatre at Harvard 20 years ago after his departure from the Yale
School of Drama. At 71, he shows no signs of mellowing, continuing
to present plays in an uncompromisingly modernistic and
postmodernistic style. Not only do the plays often divide
audiences, but his theater criticism, mostly for The New Republic,
has sparked debates about multiculturalism and any number of other
issues facing the contemporary theater world. Following is an
edited transcript of an interview with the ART's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you define Robert Brustein's and the ART's aesthetic,
and do you sense that it has changed over the 20 years you've been
here?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me sum it up this way. I think my whole career as an
artistic director, and as a critic, has been devoted to try to
persuade people that theater can be something more than
entertaining, that the theater is worthy of the same kind of
serious attention as classical music and the novel and dance,
ballet, the opera. This seems fairly obvious, but there was a time
when it wasn't obvious, when the values of theater were being
determined by Broadway and it was a Broadway of much higher
achievement than today's Broadway. So it included everything. It
included serious drama, but it was also primarily commercial. And
people, most Americans, really have a sense that the theater is
commercial and that they go there to have a good time and it's not
a vehicle for art, and I believed it was. . . . I'm really talking
about a theater that tries to break frontiers and push past
boundaries and enter new terrain, where possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This may be the same way of asking the same question, but
what would you like your legacy to be?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's a tough question to answer. As artistic director one
legacy I hope would continue is the idea of a resident company of
actors and designers and directors and, sometimes when we can
afford it, playwrights, because I continue to believe that's where
the most valuable work is done. The company work is the best, most
sensible way to create theater and I'm full of regret that there
are so few companies left in the country. I think that theater
without a company is nothing that interests me very much.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So, you don't feel, as Peter Altman at the Huntington said,
that when you have a permanent company you end up programming for
that company, so if you have an all-white company you would never
do &UR;  &LR; a black play because you have a predominantly white company?
</P>
<P>
   A. But the object is to have an integrated company and if your
purpose is, when you speak of a balanced season, (to do) a black
play and a Chinese play and an Asian play or a white play . . .
that kind of season doesn't strike me as very creative unless you
find very good plays. To me, if you find a play by a black person
that's brilliant, then you get a cast to do it, but the play has to
generate the interest rather than vice versa, rather than the need
to do a black play to balance multicultural concerns. So my answer
would be if we come across a great black play as we did with ``The
America Play,'' for example, we bring in a black company or work
with members of our own company who are black.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Huntington has championed the works of writers like Tom
Stoppard and Brian Friel, August Wilson, Athol Fugard, writers who
if I'm correct you're not terribly fond of . . .
</P>
<P>
   A. I like Fugard. I like him more as a saint of the theater than
I do as an artist of the theater. I like some of August Wilson. Tom
Stoppard I think of, as I've said before, as a university wit, a
very clever fellow. But the kind of deeper resonances that I look
for in the theater he doesn't have. He may develop as he gets
older, he's still a young fellow (laughs). But, right now, he's
interested in verbal and artistic tricks and they're very amusing,
but to me they're not worth the time of rehearsal, and with all
that effort that goes into producing, you better believe in what
you're doing and you better believe that it has a deep bottom or
else there's no sense in doing it. This community loves Stoppard
and I wish I could be more responsive to that attraction, but I
just wouldn't feel happy with myself. Yet. He hasn't produced that
play yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There isn't an aesthetic then that all those writers point
to, a naturalistic aesthetic that turns you off?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not naturalism that bothers me. I think that, to be
really honest, naturalism is to be sought after. It will never die.
It's a very important expression of the theater. It's a kind of
middle-brow realism that turns me off. The values _ the ethical and
social and political values of many playwrights don't interest me
right now, they seem rather flat and obvious. I'm much more
interested in the values of an Irish writer like Martin McDonagh,
for example. Maybe because he's a bad boy, he's not a good boy like
Brian Friel. He's a bad boy, so he gets at things that Brian Friel
doesn't get at and I'm much more interested in Caryl Churchill, for
example, than I am in Tom Stoppard because she has a metaphysical
aspect to her work and she goes into strange subterranean areas
that . . . Stoppard's mind is entirely intellectual and his
achievements are entirely intellectual, whereas she's on to
something unconscious and dreamlike. That appeals to me more.
</P>
<P>
   I guess if you want to know what my aesthetic is, it can't be
summed up in a single sentence, but certainly it has to do with
plays that do touch on the dream life in some way and that don't
leave us alone after they're over. They follow us home and invade
our dreams, invade our sleep and haunt us, and I don't think the
more intellectual, witty dramatists do that. I love Shaw but I
don't think Shaw did that except in one play, ``Heartbreak House,''
and I don't think Stoppard does that and I don't think Brian Friel
does that. Friel is a very able writer who just doesn't touch my
nerves. August Wilson is potentially a very profound poetic writer.
I think he was, frankly, misled by directors into more prosaic
areas, that if he is given latitude he will write very beautiful
and pointed plays. ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' for example, I
think is probably his best play. ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone''
does turn on these haunting, mysterious areas of life that the
others don't. The others are quite predictable and as a result
prosaic, which I think is a shame, because he's a poet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Looking back over that whole debate with him (August Wilson)
_ literally the Town Hall debate (in New York) and the whole
artistic debate over black separatism _ do you think you've been
misinterpreted on that score?
</P>
<P>
   A. I was really quite astonished at the incompetence of a good
number of the reporters that reported on the event. There were one
or two that got it right; most of them didn't. They completely
misunderstood what they saw or heard and that's why it was
important to me to republish in my own book, ``Cultural
Calisthenics,'' what I had actually said because the Times had four
different stories on it and only one story was correct.
</P>
<P>
   . . . Truly, I am very much in favor of good black theater and
very much in favor of what Wilson's in favor of, identifying those
theaters and channeling foundation money to them instead of bribing
white theaters to do black plays, which is what a lot of
foundations are doing. The real issue that was the core of that
debate was the issue of segregation, which was no longer the
segregation of blacks by whites but now the segregation of blacks
by blacks, in the case of Wilson, who was really demanding that no
black actor should ever appear in plays written by whites. I
thought that was an outrageous thing to say and very damaging to
the spirits and to the careers of very good black actors, many of
whom love playing Shakespeare and love being in Ibsen and love
doing Beckett plays.

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Out of Sight'' _ George Clooney and Jennifer
Lopez sizzle in this crime melodrama directed by Steven Soderbergh
and costarring Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames, and a remarkable Albert
Brooks. Both the National Society and Boston Society of Film
Critics voted this as the Best Picture of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' _ Jim Carrey's rubbery performance as the
ultimate TV star goes a long way toward assuring this satiric
comedy's success. The problem is that virtually every movie fan
knows the premise _ Carrey lives his whole life in a TV show
without knowing it _ so there is no real sense of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``p'' _ Darren Aronofsky directs this low-budget film with great
imagination. Shot in eerie black-and-white, it merges the suspense
thriller with mathematical probabilities and comes up with a
winning formula, without being formulaic. Sean Gullette's
performance, as the mathematics genius, deserves Oscar
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Fool'' _ Independent film favorite Hal Hartley, whose
previous films include ``Flirt'' and ``Amateur,'' directs James
Urbaniak in this dark family comedy. It wears its art on its sleeve
but, nevertheless, it has some wonderful moments. Where else are
you going to find an introspective garbage collector in a movie?

CARELESS LOVE 
The Unmaking of Elvis Presley 
By Peter Guralnick. Little, Brown. 768 pp. Illustrated. $27.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like all epic tragedies, this one involves a magnificent central
character _ a king, no less _ and a terrible fall from grace. The
fall, as in the most compelling tragedies, is uniquely human _ as
maddeningly preventable as it is, finally, inevitable. And just as
the truest tragedies, no matter how thoroughly analyzed, are
somehow unfathomable, in this one there is no moment of truth, no
defining act of undoing, but rather a convoluted tangle of needs
and neglect, aspirations and acrimony, brilliant possibilities and
rampant misunderstanding that combine into a decline of
unparalleled proportion.
</P>
<P>
   That the hero was Elvis Presley, and his kingdom rock 'n' roll,
imbues the story with the sheer potency of music. There is no
difference, after all, between how Elvis made people feel and how
people felt about Elvis. With an intoxicating pump of the pelvis
and a guileless feel for how gospel and rhythm 'n' blues and rock
could collide, he reshaped the popular culture. Suddenly, the
astonishingly intimate and grandly mythic merged in the space of a
song; it was, like all truly monumental events, delirious and
irreversible. And although his shining moment was brief compared
with the painfully protracted descent into self-medication and
self-caricature and just about every other form of
self-obliteration, Elvis changed the world.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the bloated spectacle that Elvis became during the
last years of his life that stuck like an overstuffed jumpsuit, and
that has colored the spectacular way he has been remembered since
his death in 1977. For every academic paper there have been a dozen
tell-alls. For every thoughtful essay, a hundred references to the
gold pajamas around Elvis's ankles as he lay lifeless on the
bathroom floor. In a pool of vomit. Fourteen pharmaceutical drugs
in his blood stream. Yes, we have a hearty appetite for dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Guralnick, however, has an appetite for something
altogether different: the truth. ``Careless Love: The Unmaking of
Elvis Presley'' is the second volume of Guralnick's two-part
biography; ``Last Train To Memphis'' (1994) chronicled young
Presley's remarkable rise to fame. ``Careless Love'' recounts the
downhill slide, beginning in 1958, in equally painstaking,
clear-eyed detail. And while there's little to celebrate,
artistically or otherwise, in Elvis's post-tour-of-duty decades,
Guralnick tells the grim tale with abiding respect _ and with a
fullness of heart and seriousness of purpose that his subject sadly
lost along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The book's subtitle encapsulates Guralnick's astute, measured
perspective. Elvis wasn't destroyed by his huckster manager,
Colonel Tom Parker, or the indiscriminate doctors who prescribed
endless supplies of drugs, or the coterie of yes-men who enabled
him by virtue of their silent indulgence. One can't even lay blame
on the fallout of stupendous celebrity _ although the impossible
task of reconciling his public image with his personal life took an
incalculable toll. Rather, Guralnick, in the simple and
compassionate retelling, recognizes a more fundamental human
condition at play in the unmaking of Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   What possessed this innovative, passionate musician to sell his
creative soul for a string of cheesy Hollywood movies and
bargain-basement recordings? Guralnick, to his credit, offers no
pat psychological interpretations; a life as complex and oversized
as Elvis's offers up its own explanations. Elvis's love for the
music _ the thing that sustained him in the deepest sense _ was
overshadowed by the fearful, insecure boy whose desire to please
and fear of failure paralyzed him, personally and professionally.
The death in 1958 of his beloved mother, Gladys, when Elvis was 23,
left a void that couldn't be filled with an endless stream of
lovers or spiritual literature. His isolation was profound, and the
ensuing alienation complete.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick's narrative remains faithful to Elvis's extraordinary
self-absorption and mounting insulation, and as a result the book
is short on cultural context. The rare references to the Beatles,
or Led Zeppelin, come as a shock in the thick of Elvis's padded
existence _ much as the swift evolution of pop music must have
shocked Elvis himself. The world increasingly went on outside of
him, and more importantly, without him. While the myth of Elvis
thrived, however grotesquely, on a steady diet of base
merchandising, the man himself grew dimmer and dimmer. By telling
the story as much as possible from Elvis's point of view, Guralnick
conveys a palpable sense of ``the vanishing of Elvis Presley,'' as
he puts it.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his bravado and charisma, in spite of _ or perhaps in
reaction to _ his phenomenal popularity, Elvis let go the rudder of
his own ship early on. It's startling to remember that he peaked at
23. The pills, the girls, the vapid movies, and wretchedness in
Vegas that followed were all part-and-parcel of Elvis's absurd
mission: to simultaneously preserve and escape the legend he had
become. The very duality that ignited his musical fire _ the
tension between sweetness and sexuality, convention and rebellion,
piety and profanity _ seems to have set him adrift in a sea of
self-doubt, then paranoia, and what would surely be diagnosed today
as a life-threatening depression.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows how the tragic tale ends. By the end of
Guralnick's nearly 800-page chronicle of Elvis's ugly decline,
we're frankly ready for the king to topple off his porcelain
throne. And that's when Guralnick exits the evenhanded narrative,
and reminds us to pack up our cynicism and moral judgment and
remember the young maverick who touched people with ``the
proclamation of emotions long suppressed, the embrace of a
vulnerability culturally denied, the unabashed striving for
freedom. . . . for all his doubt, for all his disappointment, for
all of the self-loathing that he frequently felt, and all of the
disillusionment and fear, he continued to believe in a democratic
ideal of redemptive transformation, he continued to seek out a
connection with a public that embraced him not for what he was but
for what he sought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the great triumph of ``Careless Love.'' It celebrates,
amid an unflinching portrait of personal and creative
deterioration, the immutable innocence of Elvis's aspiration. The
music, after all, won't be dashed by human frailty. And our memory
of the force of nature that was Elvis won't, if Peter Guralnick has
anything to say about it _ be colored by anything other than the
truth.

SUBTLE SATIRE PUNCTUATES `JEW OF NEW YORK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE JEW OF NEW YORK 
By Ben Katchor 
Pantheon, 97 pp., illustrated, $20 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If any cartoonist since Charles Schulz can be said to capture
the spirit of Everyman, then Ben Katchor can. But unlike the
creator of ``Peanuts,'' the New York-based underground comic-strip
artist makes his Everymen adults, vaguely middle-aged and largely
middle-class working stiffs who wander a world populated by lost
souls and misplaced Old World remnants. His character Julius Knipl,
who figures in Katchor's two previous books (``Cheap Novelties''
and ``Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer'') and various
alternative newspapers, pounds the pavements questioning the great
little mysteries of the city: How, for example, sign letterers
convince upper-story commercial tenants to buy their services for
signs clearly not legible from the street, and why the men who sell
8-foot balloons on street corners invariably pick the wrong
corners. In his latest book, ``The Jew of New York,'' Katchor uses
the same sense of the absurd to explore various religious and
theatrical subcultures of the 1830s _ simpletons, con men, and all.
</P>
<P>
   Sound weighty? Despite its undercurrent of social satire, ``The
Jew of New York'' is not particularly heavy stuff: In Katchor's
scratchy drawings, men imitate beavers, slapping the water with
bare feet instead of tails, and a master plan is laid for
carbonating Lake Erie. But it is far from the usual comic strip,
relying on angular, Ben Shahn-style illustrations and quirky,
interlocking plot lines for its appeal. Often compared to film
noir, Katchor's drawings evoke a nostalgia for the way the city
appeared to us as children: towering, dark, and mysterious. His
stories follow suit, noting the detail (the buttons on a suit, the
smell of herring) that a child would, particularly if that child
was raised in (or raised on stories of) New York's Jewish Lower
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   With his Pulitzer-winning retelling of a Holocaust story,
``Maus,'' Art Spiegelman should have laid to rest the notion that
comic strips (excuse me _ ``graphic novels'') cannot be art. But
Spiegelman's fellow underground comic-strip artists _ including
Katchor _ had been laying the groundwork for years before the 1986
``Maus,'' using thought balloons to encapsulate Existentialist
thought and crosshatching to evoke darkness of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   With this third book, Katchor takes the next step, following
almost literally in Speigelman's footsteps. ``The Jew of New
York,'' in fact, came about in 1992 when the Jewish weekly The
Forward finished its serialization of Spiegelman's ``Maus II'' and
was searching for a replacement. For the weekly, Katchor wove a
fictional tale around a real character, Mordecai Manuel Noah, who
in 1825 bought a small island in the Niagara River between New York
and Canada and tried to establish it as a Jewish homeland, a
proto-Israel in the New World. Katchor, who had created pieces for
Spiegelman's Raw magazine, spun the convoluted story (in which Noah
is a minor, but catalytic, character) into 52 installments, each of
which was ``passionately followed,'' The Forward's cultural editor
told The New Yorker after the series's completion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of its genesis in serial format, ``The Jew of
New York'' also resembles a Charles Dickens work, albeit with a
Yiddish accent. Its cast of misfit characters goes through the same
kind of adventures and strange meetings designed to keep readers
hanging on, and the added visual element shores up the wilder and
more exotic plot twists. Will Maurice Ketzelbourd, the baptized Jew
turned beaver-pelt trader, ever meet Miss Patella, the one-legged
actress whom he idolizes? A playbill from one of her shows floats
between panels, and a pamphlet on the dangers of onanism punctuates
a chapter. Will Nathan Kishon, the disgraced kosher butcher, wander
through the wilds of upstate New York forever? Graphic (but not
disgusting) illustrations make his shame clear as they compare
kosher and non-kosher beef tongues. Will Isaac Azarael's shipload
of mother-of-pearl buttons ever come to shore? And who exactly is
the man in the India-rubber suit?
</P>
<P>
   The answers to these questions wrap up ``The Jew of New York''
in a marvelously satisfying denouement, its subtle satire bringing
about some amusingly moral endings. And if the day looks too
bright, too modern, after the book is done, Katchor's work is rich
enough to invite a second and a third read.

GAIL HARRIS GETS SPIRITUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BODY &AMP; SOUL 
Host and executive producer: Gail Harris 
On: PBS (check local schedules) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five years ago, with workplace demands multiplying so
fast that her professional life was bursting at the seams, veteran
broadcast journalist Gail Harris did something that not every
skeptical reporter would make time to do.
</P>
<P>
   She began to meditate.
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, that daily half-hour of self-willed tranquility
helped her cope with the stress of ``absolutely going at 190 miles
an hour all the time.'' It also got Harris thinking more
systematically about a subject that had intrigued her for some
time: the connections between mind and body, and the alternative
approaches to medicine built upon those connections.
</P>
<P>
   So after leaving WABU-Ch. 68, Harris formed a production company
and spent two years making a 13-part series on holistic health and
spirituality, ``Body &AMP; Soul,'' which began in Boston Jan. 10 and
will air on 60 other PBS stations across the country, a number
expected to grow to 120 by spring.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, Harris will explore nontraditional routes to healing
and ``wellness'': lowering blood pressure through the ``relaxation
response'' of meditation, enhancing well-being through ``mindful
eating'' and slowing down the pace of life, using tai chi to combat
the ravages of age, augmenting traditional cancer treatments with
acupuncture and massage (an episode that focuses on Leonard Zakim,
executive director of the Boston branch of the Anti-Defamation
League).
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of the series is really to ask: How can we stay
healthy? And how can we live our lives in a way that's more
satisfying?'' said Harris. ``I'm trying hard to demystify this
stuff, to demarginalize it, to say `Take a look.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With a longstanding reputation as a serious journalist,
including a national news Emmy for a documentary on Hiroshima,
Harris has solid credentials for the task she has set for herself:
to do the sort of ``serious, credible reporting'' on alternative
medicine she feels has been absent since Bill Moyers's 1993 series
``Healing and the Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so easy to give this the once-over-lightly that
television is famous for,'' she said. ``I felt strongly that if I
could get there first, I could raise the bar for anyone who comes
behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after arriving at WBZ-Ch. 4 as a reporter in 1977, Harris
joined Shelby Scott on the anchor desk, creating one of the first
female anchor teams. Five years later, after picking up a master's
degree in public administration from Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government, Harris began a four-year coanchoring stint with
Christopher Lydon on Channel 2's ``10 O'Clock News.'' She moved on
to become a correspondent for ABC's ``Nightline,'' then in 1990
signed on as anchor of the nightly newscast of the Monitor Channel
(only after she was guaranteed she could write her own copy).
</P>
<P>
   After that channel shut down in 1992, Harris began
executive-producing a nightly show of news and analysis for
BU-owned Channel 68 and hosting a half-hour interview program. (She
also moderated the nationally televised debate in 1994 between Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy and GOP candidate Mitt Romney, and ``The People's
Voice'' series of specials cosponsored by the Globe and WBUR-FM in
1996).
</P>
<P>
   Along with those roles, Harris was also director of special
programs at Channel 68. At one point, the station had 30 hours a
week of local programming _ and Harris had begun to meditate in her
off-hours.
</P>
<P>
   She makes clear that she believes meditation and other
``complementary therapies'' are just that, and not substitutes for
traditional medicine. ``If I break my arm, I'm not going to stand
on the corner and hum,'' she said. ``I'm going to get myself to
Mass. General.''
</P>
<P>
   In exploring the intersection of spiritual-emotional health and
physical well-being, ``Body &AMP; Soul'' takes a determinedly how-to
approach. For instance, the first episode ends with a ``guided
meditation'' for viewers; episode two illustrates ``mind-body''
exercises designed to prevent age-associated memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``These concepts can be difficult to explain on television; I do
not believe anyone has attempted to do a guided meditation
before,'' said Harris. ``But I wanted to show people how accessible
these techniques are.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``New Age'' has been applied to some of the techniques
Harris tries to illustrate, but it's not a term she embraces. ``To
me, this is not New Age as much as it is ancient wisdom,'' she
said. ``Meditation and acupuncture and massage have been around for
centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternative medicine is rapidly growing in popularity: Harris
cited studies showing that 83 million Americans resorted to such
therapies last year. She believes that baby boomers in particular
are receptive to alternative medicine because ``we are starting to
realize it's possible to stay healthy as we get older,'' and are
consequently drawn to medical approaches that ``look at the whole
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomers may also turn to alternative therapies because they feel
overwhelmed by the onrush of technology and the hectic pace of
contemporary life, according to Harris. ``So many of us, we're
stuck in fast-forward. Everybody I talk to says, `I've got so much
going on; my life is out of control.' What we're trying to show in
these programs is: `Guess what? You can regain control of your
life, in time-tested ways,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, however, Harris herself is scrambling to finish
writing a 300-page book, ``Body &AMP; Soul: Your Guide to Healthy,
Happiness and Total Well-Being,'' the series' companion publication
that is due out early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I get this book done, I'm going in for a good
massage,'' said Harris with a laugh. ``I've promised myself that.''

JUDITH WEIR EXPERIMENTS ON UPSHAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A piece that doesn't in some way experiment isn't being brave
enough,'' says Judith Weir, a composer noted for her imagination,
her originality _ and her bravery.
</P>
<P>
   This week soprano Dawn Upshaw, conductor Sir Simon Rattle, and
the Boston Symphony Orchestra present the world premiere
performances of Weir's new orchestral song-cycle ``Natural
History.''
</P>
<P>
   The work represents another stage in a long ongoing series of
collaborations among Weir, the orchestra and the conductor. Weir
entered the orbit of the BSO in 1975 when she was 21 and became a
composition fellow at Tanglewood. Later she wrote an overture for
the BSO, ``Music, Untangled,'' which Grant Llewelleyn conducted at
Tanglewood and in Symphony Hall. She has served as
composer-in-residence for Rattle's City of Birmingham Symphony
Orchestra and has written many works for that orchestra and its
individual members; she is currently composing a large work for
chorus and orchestra that will be a feature of Birmingham's season
in 2000 and a culmination of Rattle's special millennium project.
</P>
<P>
   Weir was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and came to music through
playing the oboe in youth orchestras. ``In the end, I did earn a
music degree,'' she said in a recent telephone conversation from
her home in London. ``It was only then that I formulated any clear
idea that being a composer was what I really wanted to be. In my
teens, I had many interests in all the arts, the way so many
teenagers do, but music was the one that took over. My family was
very fond of music, but the idea of having a professional career in
the arts was not something any of us were familiar with, and
becoming a composer isn't the sort of ambition I would have spoken
to anybody about.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir came to Tanglewood because of a chance meeting with a
legendary Tanglewood figure, composer Aaron Copland. ``I had
vaguely heard of Tanglewood. Then Copland came to my hometown of
Aberdeen for a big festival of youth orchestras. I was still a
student, but had a piece of mine played, and Copland somehow heard
it. I had a short conversation with him and asked him about
Tanglewood, and he ended up by very kindly writing me a reference
for the entrance procedures.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Value of Tanglewood &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weir says although she had strong training in Scotland and
England, she found the Tanglewood experience particularly valuable.
``I was studying at Cambridge University, which at that time was a
very old-fashioned academic environment; fugue and counterpoint
were taught, but not contemporary music, and there was no
opportunity to hear your music played. I came to this environment
at Tanglewood where I was surrounded by my contemporaries, some of
them very much further on with their ideas than I was, and music
was all around. Olivier Messiaen was the composer-in-residence that
summer. I idolized his work, but didn't even know he was still
alive! My teacher was Gunther Schuller, to whom I still feel very
grateful because he is such a practical thinker about music. I
would like to stress how grateful I am for this experience _ the
whole thing was paid for, including my airfare. You can't imagine
how much it means to a young person to receive that kind of
hospitality. It does sow a feeling of lifelong connection with
Boston and the orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir's music has been regularly performed by two of Boston's
leading new-music ensembles, Richard Pittman and the Boston Musica
Viva and Dinosaur Annex, whose artistic director, composer Scott
Wheeler, was a Tanglewood classmate of Weir's. The Music Production
Company has also produced performances of her work. She spent a
term studying computer music at MIT (``computers were very
different back then''), and has held residencies at Harvard
University and the New England Conservatory of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Weir has established herself as one of the
principal composers of her generation. She has won a particular
reputation for dazzling achievements in chamber opera, but there is
something vividly theatrical about nearly all her music.
</P>
<P>
   Weir says she doesn't really know how Dawn Upshaw came to be
interested in her music. ``The commission came from the orchestra,
and with her blessing, though she hasn't sung any of my other music
as I know. Nevertheless, when I met her, she seemed quite familiar
with my work; she does her homework. It was through the commission
that we got together _ her summer as a Tanglewood fellow was long
after mine. . . . Long before I had any idea of working with her, I
owned some of her CDs, and out of sheer choice and for the pleasure
of it I had been to a number of her concerts. Among the qualities
of her singing I was thinking of when I wrote the cycle was how
incredibly clear she is with text _ she tells stories in music. So
obviously I had to choose a text that has interest and intellect in
it. Dawn also has a very opulent voice, so obviously the piece had
to give expression to that as well. My choice of texts from
Chuang-Tzu allows her do do story telling, these are little
stories, but they also express heightened philosophical states, and
that's where the tonal qualities of her voice come in. I think of
these four pieces as recitatives and arias, and she is one of the
few singers who is as good at one as she is at the other.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The BSO in her ear &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weir also had the sound of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in her
ear as she wrote. ``I've heard them for more than 20 years now, and
I've also been working regularly with Simon Rattle. Simon is a
great enthusiast for all the orchestras he conducts, and from time
to time he would say to me, `You simply must write something for
this or that BSO player. It is very typical of him to point out
things that he enjoyed hearing.'' Like all composers, Weir also
takes a longer view. ``Of course I hope all the other wonderful
sopranos and orchestras will want to do this piece too!''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Weir's works have been inspired by Chinese and
specifically Taoist works; in her program note for ``Natural
History'' she writes that she thinks of the piece as a kind of
Taoist ``Carnival of the Animals.'' The four songs are called
``Horse,'' ``Singer,'' ``Swimmer,'' and ``Fish/Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have for some time considered Taoism to be the most helpful
of established philosophies in the conduct of modern life,'' Weir
says. ``I've been interested in Chinese thought for a very long
time. I've studied t'ai chi, and I started reading Chinese
literature in translations in the Penguin Classics. I've tried at
various times to start learning Chinese, but there isn't a big
enough space in my life to do that properly. I suppose (composer)
John Cage was another route to this. Even in my teens, I got
interested in the way he used the ``I Ching,'' and I still have my
copy of that from those years.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir has written many works of specifically Scottish character,
but even more that are not. ``I have lived both in England and in
Scotland. After I was a student, I lived and worked in Scotland for
some years, which was a bit different from going immediately to
London. I had more of a sense of being a pioneer, of trying to get
things going. Also I have a big interest in folk music, not just
Scottish folk music, but Scotland is a country with a living
vernacular tradition that isn't phony. Without having to work very
hard, I had access to a very different side of music that fed into
my own work. I wouldn't want to suggest that my music is entirely
Scottish, but you can't escape your upbringing and breeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir has no trouble with characterizing herself as an
experimental composer. ``When I was growing up in the end of the
'60s and through the '70s, it was a time of great experiment; there
was no alternative really. I still admire what I call experimental
music in all its possible guises, and one of the things I would
hate the most would be to be thought of as a conservative composer,
as one who simply upholds old values''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, for her, in ``Natural History'' was reconciling
the large orchestra with the solo singer. In her program note, she
says she hopes that the orchestra will provide ``the natrualistic
scenery'' for the stories the soprano is singing. ``Really, I
couldn't think of too many examples in music history of successful
pieces for solo singer and orchestra _ Mahler and Strauss brought
it off, and so did Berlioz. I love `Nuit's d'ete.' For me the
problem was to find a way of using the bigness of the orchestra
without overwhelming the singer, to have a big orchestral sound and
an intimate sound from the soprano, who has her own space in the
composition. The experiment in this piece is the extreme
juxtaposition between those two things. I didn't want to cheat and
make the orchestra play quietly all the time!''

`CYBERLEARNING' CAUSES DIVISION WITHIN THE IVORY TOWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 63 students who enrolled in Peter Navarro's
introductory macroeconomics course at the University of California
at Irvine last spring had a choice: Take a seat and listen to the
lectures, or take off and on your way out grab a multimedia CD-ROM
containing lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro, who teaches in the Graduate School of Management, had
been listening to the endless debate over the use of new technology
in learning. Is ``cyberlearning'' an educational fraud or the wave
of the future? He wanted to answer that question for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Of Navarro's macroeconomics students, 31 chose to be traditional
learners and 32 cyberlearners. At the end of the quarter and after
wading through a statistical analysis, Navarro concluded: ``In
general, there was no significant difference in academic outcomes
when cyberlearners were compared with traditional learners.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual universities are never going to be for everyone.
Critics, such as political scientist Kenneth Ashworth of the
University of Texas at Austin, decry the absence of conversation
and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students probably learn more from each other on a campus than
they do from the faculty there,'' Ashworth said. ``E-mail may be
communication, but it is not conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Navarro study helps bolster the case for
long-distance learning in California advocated by former Gov. Pete
Wilson through the California Virtual University program
(www.california.edu), and separately by a coalition of other
Western governors through the Western Governors University
(www.wgu.edu).
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Navarro said, the study may help solve a
bricks-and-mortar problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the first to say that this is only for certain courses,''
Navarro said. ``It's ideally suited for core introductory courses.
But California is facing a tidal wave of (public college and
university) students, and there are not enough seats for everybody.
Unless they develop alternative strategies for delivering course
content, they'll have to ration seats. Some students will be left
out in the cold.''

   California Virtual University offers a catalog of 1,750 on-line
courses and degree programs offered by 102 accredited California
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson created CVU in 1997, proposing it as a marketing tool for
colleges and as a career and skill booster for employers and
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he turned down an offer from the Western Governors
Association to join in its virtual university, which, having begun
operations Sept. 3, offers some 300 on-line courses from 26
colleges and universities and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The key difference between CVU and WGU is that the California
students can earn degrees from participating colleges, while WGU
students earn degrees only from WGU.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Chodorow, who was recruited by Wilson in 1997 to head
CVU, is a convert to cyberlearning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is having kids push me'' to learn the new
technology, said Chodorow, 55, a medieval historian and
administrator at the University of California at San Diego for 25
years and former provost at the University of Pennsylvania. ``They
regard me as `Techno Peasant.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``To take a course on the Web means you as a student must be
active. There is a certain percentage of students whose only action
is to get themselves to class. Then they sit there dead silent, and
they may or may not be absorbing the material,'' he said.

   At Irvine, Navarro found that students using the CD-ROMs
appreciated learning at their own pace and being able to hear
lectures more than once. They liked the convenience and flexibility
of studying on their own times and not having to take notes.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight percent thought they had enough opportunities,
through e-mail and other electronic means, to question Navarro,
although fully half of the 32 cyberlearners noted that, even though
they had absorbed the material, they were disadvantaged by lack of
interaction with the professor and other students. They also
thought they may have missed some important material.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely, said Ashworth, who teaches policy development at the
Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning through keyboards and screens is not the way to
learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have conversation, you have got to have
face-to-face relations,'' he said. ``You can call up data or
library resources, and that may be clever, but it's not doing
analysis. You can consult on-line contemporary articles in a hurry,
but you ignore 99 percent of the recorded knowledge of mankind. If
that is an adequate college education, we are certainly abandoning
our standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ashworth believes cyberlearning is being promoted by
advocates bent on saving money by reducing teacher ranks and
controlling classroom construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to find out a way to expose students to
so-called learning, without having the expense and trouble of
having a faculty involved,'' Ashworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro, however, still has a teaching job. He is now also the
star of his own interactive macroeconomics CD-ROM, published by
Irwin/McGraw-Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a better mousetrap. A lot of the
long-distance learning courses offered are simply Web sites with
digitized textbooks. They're not real interesting,'' Navarro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``CD-ROM lectures are only as good as they are. But if they are
good, they never get tired. They never digress. They never have a
bad day.''

WEARING SHOES MAY BE A SHOCK IN SOME HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY MARTINEAU  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, N.Y. _ First, there were no hats in the house. Now
there's a move afoot to shed shoes at the doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans become exposed to other traditions through shifting
immigration patterns and increased travel abroad, the foot has come
under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Shoeless houses are not new or uncommon in the rest of the
world. For hundreds of years, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists have
taken their footwear off in the home and at the temple or mosque to
show humility before God. They also remove their shoes to keep both
places free of germs and dirt. But those who aren't familiar with
Eastern customs are discovering that walking around the house
barefoot or in shoes and slippers has its perks, from comfort to
cleaner carpets.
</P>
<P>
   As the trend gathers converts, debate has erupted in American
foyers, mud-rooms and entrance halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just an Asian custom,'' insists George Gmelch, a
shoeless advocate and anthropologist at Union College in
Schenectady, N.Y. ``Most of the world doesn't wear shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gmelch acquired the habit nine years ago, after teaching in
Japan for one semester. He now leaves a basket of socks and
slippers at the door for his guests.
</P>
<P>
   Some are treading with suspicion, though. Gmelch's colleague,
fellow anthropologist Estellie Smith, calls the practice
``appallingly bad manners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's East Coast versus West Coast,'' she said. ``I can't
imagine walking into someone's house in New York, Boston,
Washington, D.C., and someone greeting me with `Take your shoes off
please.' It boggles the mind. It reminds me of hillbillies.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has added to the anxieties some guests face when
paying a social visit.
</P>
<P>
   What if your feet smell? Or your socks have holes in them? What
do you do when recalcitrant guests simply refuse to toe the line?
The Gilmans just shrugged when one reveler at their shoeless New
Year's Eve party insisted on keeping her loafers on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not militant about it,'' explained Ted Gilman, a
political science professor at Union College. The Gilmans, Gmelches
and others say that foot odors and socks with split seams have
never been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, it's second nature to remove, or at least change, your
shoes in private and public places.
</P>
<P>
   But the tradition seems to have a practical side, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to keep your house clean if you're not
tracking in dirt and detritus from outside,'' said Gilman, who
spent three years in Japan. ``It hasn't been long in most countries
that we've been walking on pavement all day.''

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE: DIALING UP DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Competition offers consumers some great benefits, but
unfortunately it tends to come with a lot of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Directory assistance is a good example. It used to be so simple.
You dialed 411 to find a local number and 1 plus the area code plus
555-1212 for long-distance numbers. Rates and service were
generally uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But all that's changed. Now prices and the quality of listings
vary dramatically from company to company and even within the same
company. AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom both offer two directory assistance
services and at both companies the more expensive service actually
delivers less.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, for example, charges $1.40 for up to two listings on its
traditional directory assistance service, which is reached by
dialing an area code plus 555-1212. By dialing 00, the same AT&AMP;T
customer would pay just 95 cents for the same two listings. And he
wouldn't need to look up the area code and could even get a free
connection to the number.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has a similar deal. Its 555-1212 service is
available only to its customers and costs $1.40 for up to two
listings. Its new, heavily promoted 10-10-9000 national directory
assistance service is open to anyone, costs 99 cents and provides
up to two listings and a free connection.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing? Just wait. Other companies are also eager to snare
some of the estimated 8 billion calls made to directory assistance
each year. And the market should grow, given the phone number
changes arising from the explosion of new area codes around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   By June, Bell Atlantic expects to begin offering its national
411 service in Massachusetts. For 95 cents, customers can dial 411
and obtain local listings or up to two long-distance listings.
</P>
<P>
   Although AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom, and Bell Atlantic all tell you
their directory assistance services can be used to track down local
and long-distance numbers, Bell Atlantic is the only cost-effective
choice on the local front.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom will charge you their full price for each
local listing, while Bell Atlantic is currently required to give
Massachusetts customers 10 free local listings each month and
charge 37 cents a call after that.
</P>
<P>
   The other cautionary note about 10-10-9000 is the ``free''
connection. If you're an MCI WorldCom customer, you're connected
and charged the rates provided in your MCI WorldCom calling plan.
But if you're not a customer, you'll be charged the highest rates
MCI WorldCom offers.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel A. Simon, chairman of the Telecommunications Research and
Action Center, a Washington-based consumer group, said he is
uncomfortable with the 10-10-9000 plan since it entices people to
use it when they might be better off elsewhere. His recommendation:
Use the Internet to search for numbers whenever possible and avoid
all charges. (TRAC offers access to many of the Internet directory
assistance sites at its web site: www.trac.org.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Internet approach is that many of the
databases are not up to date. We checked listings for a couple that
moved to Tucson in August and couldn't find their number on any of
the Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The same problem exists to a lesser degree with directory
assistance provided by phone companies. ``Your service is only as
good as your database,'' said Fred Voit, communications analyst at
the Yankee Group consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, local Bell companies have the best phone records,
since customers moving in and out have to contact them to obtain or
shut off local phone service. The Bells sell access to their
databases, but some companies have balked at paying.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T struck off on its own several years ago, setting up its own
phone number database. It went through a withering shakedown
period, when operators couldn't seem to find even the most basic
numbers. The situation has improved, but company officials
acknowledge their database could be better.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic says it will pay for access to other Bells'
databases in high-calling areas such as California and Illinois,
but not in many other parts of the country. MCI WorldCom says its
policy is to buy access to all the Bell networks, but spokesman
Brad Burns said that's not always possible because some of the
Bells charge excessive rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic spokesman James Smith said the long-distance
companies are blaming the local Bells to hide the fact that they
are making very large profits on directory assistance. According to
Smith, if a company hires Bell Atlantic to provide directory
assistance for the Northeast and uses Bell Atlantic operators, Bell
Atlantic charges 30 to 40 cents a call. If the company uses its own
operators and just uses Bell Atlantic's data base, the cost is
about 10 to 15 cents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With companies charging 95 cents to $1.40 for each directory
assistance call, ``there's an awful lot of margin built in there,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   CD deal
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one would call us hip when it comes to music. After all, one
of us listens to the ``Titanic'' soundtrack while driving a station
wagon and the other listens to Aretha Franklin in a minivan. But we
do know a good deal when we see it, and the latest CD and tape
offering from Columbia House is worth checking out.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get us wrong. Columbia House still offers ``free'' CDs
that aren't really free, doesn't disclose all costs to consumers up
front, and doesn't carry the latest releases. But it finally has
done away with the annoying requirement that club members mail in a
card each month if they don't want that month's featured release.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask our members what they don't like about the club,
it's that they get shipments they don't want,'' said Sharon Kuroki,
executive vice president of music marketing at Columbia House, a
joint venture of Warner Music and Sony. Columbia House has 8
million members.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``no-more-cards'' offer is being featured in TV ads, on
the back of last week's Parade magazine, and in direct-mail
solicitations. The direct-mail solicitation offers 12 CDs or tapes
for ``free'' with an obligation to buy five more over the next two
years at full price. You can also buy another CD at 60 percent of
the full price and get two more ``free.''
</P>
<P>
   We keep putting ``free'' in quotation marks because the CDs
aren't exactly free. Shipping and handling charges apply, although
Columbia House doesn't say how much they are in its ads or give a
number to call. Even Pam Marshall, the membership director who
signed Columbia House's direct-mail solicitation, doesn't exist.
The company operator said the name is a pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   On the initial order with the direct-mail offering, you have to
pay shipping and handling charges of $2.19 per item, which works
out to a total of $26.28 for 12 CDs or tapes. After that, the fee
is $2.59 per item.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these excessive fees, the deal is attractive. If you
buy the club's highest-priced CDs at $16.98, the basic offer nets
you 17 CDs for $124.13, or $7.30 apiece. If you take the additional
offer for three more, the average price drops to $7. And the price
drops even further if you buy lower-priced CDs, opt for tapes, or
take advantage of ubiquitous two-for-one deals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakes concerns
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doyle Kint of Ayer, Mass. asked us for help in getting a
long-awaited $600 refund from Travel Group International, a Florida
agency we wrote about last year involved in sweepstakes-related
travel scams. The group collects names from sweepstakes boxes at
major athletic centers, including the FleetCenter last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Later by phone, Travel Group calls participants to announce that
they ``won'' a vacation to Florida or the Caribbean. However, the
trip is hardly free after it assesses extra fees on your credit
card. Some customers even fail to get any tickets, while others are
disappointed by the arrangements once there.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Kint had agreed to pay $600 for a vacation for
two, but then never got any tickets. He demanded a refund and has
waited a year to no avail. After several phone calls to the group
on Friday, Carmen Torres, customer service manager for Travel
Group, said she personally has ordered the refund and provided us
with a reference number to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Odds &AMP; Ends
</P>
<P>
   --Discover fees go up. The folks at Discover Card notified
customers last week that fees for returned checks, paying late, and
going over the limit are increasing from $25 to $29. They also
reserved the right to make additional changes in the card agreement
in the future with 15 days notice rather than the current 30.

HO-HUM SESSION COULD TAKE SURPRISING TURNS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Regular legislative sessions traditionally begin
with a lot of fanfare in Texas, partly because they are held only
every other year.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial excitement of the Legislature's opening day may
be even more feverish than normal this week, fueled by the
Republican takeover of the state's executive branch, a new
presiding officer in the Senate, Gov. George W. Bush's second
inauguration and his anticipated launch of a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   This session will doubtlessly make some kind of mark on Texas
because it will produce several hundred new laws and make spending
decisions affecting the quality of education, health care and other
life essentials for millions of people. Every session does that.
</P>
<P>
   But after the adjournment gavels fall May 31 in the House and
the Senate, this legislative edition may be best remembered for
being unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   A few pending issues _ or a surprise controversy or two _ could
put this session on the map. But, so far, the high anticipation and
sense of drama that hovered over the past two legislative sessions
are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Bush's arrival in the governor's office and his
four priorities, which he often recited in mantra-like fashion,
dominated lawmakers' workload. And, thanks to the cooperation of
Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and House Speaker Pete Laney, the new governor
got what he wanted _ tougher restrictions on damage lawsuits,
tougher laws against juvenile crime and significant changes in
public education and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasn't as successful during the 1997 session, when his
property tax relief proposal inspired legislative leaders to
attempt an overhaul of the entire state tax structure. The reform
effort failed, and the governor managed to salvage only a modest
amount of property tax savings. But the effort itself dominated
lawmakers' debate and made for a memorable session.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is beating the drums for tax relief again this year, and
legislators, yielding to his overwhelming popularity and aided by a
budgetary surplus, will probably give him a lot of what he wants.
But even the governor is already indicating that other spending
needs probably will force him to scale back the $2.6 billion in tax
cuts he proposed during his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A tax reduction of that size, which may sound huge collectively,
would hardly be an earth-moving event for most Texans. Broken down
by individual taxpayers, the typical savings would probably be only
a few dollars a month _ not the sort of tax relief that would put
this legislative session in the hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   The tax debate could be more significant if the Legislature
attempts again to restructure the tax system. But there may not be
much stomach for that kind of ordeal two sessions in a row,
particularly since the governor won't be encouraging it.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few issues, however, that, if successfully
addressed, could make a significant difference for many Texans and
rescue the upcoming session from the also-ran category.
</P>
<P>
   One is the proposal, strongly supported by Bush and Rick Perry,
the new lieutenant governor, to establish a program that would
allow some students to use tax-supported vouchers to attend private
school.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher proposals have been hard fought _ and killed _ in
previous sessions, with Republicans leading the fight for the
program. Bush and Perry say they would create a limited program
with vouchers restricted to children from low-performing public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of the limits imposed _ and regardless of one's
opinion of the idea _ the establishment of a program allowing tax
dollars to be used to pay tuition and other charges at private
schools could have major effects, sooner or later, on taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential earth trembler is the effort, unsuccessfully
brought before the Legislature two years ago, to deregulate the
electric utility industry. A resolution of this issue could have
far-reaching effects on how consumers and businesses obtain
electricity _ and how much they pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   A successful effort to rewrite the 123-year-old Texas
Constitution, a difficult proposition proposed by two key
legislators, would be a huge legislative achievement and, of
course, make this session anything but unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   So could a surprise issue, the kind of thing that suddenly
becomes a big deal for lawmakers, wakes up a sleepy session _ and
reminds everyone that pre-session predictions can be, oh, so
premature.
</P>

LETTERS OF TEXAS FOUNDER TO BE AUCTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARINA PISANO  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A cache of rare Texas artifacts going on sale
Friday indicates that the father of Texas, Stephen F. Austin, was
no Betsy Ross.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 4, 1836, letter, Austin proposed and sketched a
somewhat convoluted flag design to David G. Burnet, the future
provisional president of the fledgling Republic of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It included a depiction of the British Union Jack (in red), 13
stripes (in green and white), the sun, the head of George
Washington within the sun, the words ``In his example there is
safety'' below the sun and the Texas national motto, ``lux
libertatis'' (light of liberty) over the sun's rays.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Lone Star flag _ a white star on blue with
red and white blocks _ would win the day.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's letter to his fellow revolutionary remains one of the
most fascinating papers to emerge from Texas' fight for
independence from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of 13 Austin letters, including 12 to Burnet, written
between 1830 and 1836, available for sale at the 45th Annual Winter
Antiques Show. The event opens Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the Austin collection: $1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth every penny, said Kenneth W. Rendell, a noted dealer
in rare and historic letters, diaries, manuscripts and documents
who is handling the sale.
</P>
<P>
   But a Texas historian said the letters may be worth that much to
collectors of signed originals, but not to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenneth Rendell knows his market. He undoubtedly feels he can
sell them to someone at that price, but they are not worth $1.25
million to us, even though we would love to have them,'' said Don
E. Carleton, director of the Center for American History at the
University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The center recently was named the recipient of the de la Pena
diary, which is being donated by financier Charles Tate and Thomas
O. Hicks, owner of the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Stars hockey
team.
</P>
<P>
   The two Texans bought the 1836 diary of Mexican army officer Lt.
Col. Jose Enrique de la Pena for $350,000 at an auction in Los
Angeles in November.
</P>
<P>
   The seller was John Peace III, whose father acquired the memoir
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell rated the Austin letters more highly: ``In my 40 years
doing this work, I can't actually think of a more exciting
collection in terms of the spirit of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what struck me right from the beginning. It really
captures the spirit of what became Texas. In reading the originals
_ in holding the originals _ you really get a sense of Texas
happening, of it emerging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, you get a great Lincoln letter or a great George
Washington letter. But you don't see a whole country emerging the
way it does in this correspondence,'' Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   The letters trace the evolution of Austin's thinking about Texas
independence as events in and out of Mexico changed dramatically.
The words convey excitement, doubts and resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first Austin is pro-Mexican, and he's sure he can work
within the framework of Mexico,'' Rendell recounted. ``Then, he
goes to Mexico City, and he wants more independence for Texas, but
still as an independent state within Mexico. He pins his hopes on
(Gen. Antonio Lopez de) Santa Anna, of all people. Then he starts
talking about the spirit of independence and how Texas really has
to go its own way.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1833, Austin carried a petition of grievances to Mexico City
from Texas. Not only was the petition ignored, but Austin was held
there for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anna gained supreme power in Mexico in 1834. He led the
siege on the Alamo at San Antonio two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend _ all goes well and glorious for Texas _ the whole
country is in arms and moved by one spirit, which is to take Bexar
and drive all the military out of Texas,'' Austin enthusiastically
wrote to Burnet when armed conflict erupted in October 1835.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who settled hundreds of families in Texas didn't
enjoy independence for long. He died of a fever at age 43 in
December 1836, while serving as the Texas republic's secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   After tracing the provenance of the 13 letters, Rendell said
they are the only major group of Austin correspondence to change
hands in 100 years. They belonged to Burnet's descendants until the
mid-1950s, when they were sold to an ``assiduous'' collector, as
the sale literature puts it.
</P>
<P>
   The collection has remained in that person's family until now.
In a field where discretion and confidentiality are paramount,
Rendell would not disclose the seller's name.

a 90-minute Frontline episode on PBS stations. Relying mainly on
horror stories of low-level drug suspects who are serving long
prison terms on evidence supplied by more culpable pals and
collaborators, the show makes a case that the war on drugs is being

   SCI-TOILET-TRAINING (Undated) _ Toilet training is not rocket
science, says John Rosemond, a syndicated columnist and
best-selling author of parenting books. He considers it ``a slap to
the intelligence of a human being that one would allow him to
continue soiling and wetting himself past age 2.'' The process, he
says, should be as simple and straightforward as housebreaking a
four-month-old puppy. Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the noted
pediatrician, says there is more to it than that. Parents who force
toilet training, he says, can cause lasting problems. ``Don't rush
your toddler into toilet training or let anyone else tell you it's
time. It's got to be his choice,'' Brazelton advises in a
television commercial for Pampers ``Size 6'' diapers. What does he
think about Rosemond's arguments? ``They sound very logical _ for
puppies.'' Welcome to the newest round in the toilet training wars.

   SCI-SCALING (Undated) _ Biologists and physicists recently
joined forces concerning a problem that has bothered scientists for
decades: the origin of biological scaling, or explaining the subtle
ways in which various characteristics of living creatures _ their
life spans, their pulse rates, how fast they burn energy _ change
according to their body size. 2800 words. By George Johnson. (With

</P>
<P>
   SCI-PSYCH (Undated) _ Once the undisputed rulers of American
psychiatry, analysts now stand at the margins of a field where drug
treatments and short-term talking therapies predominate. Analytic
patients are in short supply: without insurance reimbursement, even
those who still desire the four or five sessions per week typical
of full-fledged psychoanalysis can rarely afford to pay for them.

plastics and light composite materials are flying at altitudes
where few airplanes have soared. Following a recent round of
successful test flights, engineers are modifying an unmanned flying
wing called Centurion for an attempt at becoming the first aircraft

   SCI-COURT-DISPUTES (Undated) _ Court-appointed panels of

of certain ideas. 1600 words. By Alice Dreger.

medicine, female physicians still suffer in terms of pay. According
to the latest Physician Compensation and Production survey, the
average incomes of female doctors continue to lag behind those of
their male counterparts by tens of thousands of dollars, in some
specialties by over $100,000 a year. 825 words. By Natalie Angier.

<P>
   SCI-SINUS-SURGERY (Undated) _ Sinus surgery within a millimeter
of the brain is easier now with new technology, a machine called
the StealthStation, which follows a map of a patient's sinus much
the way Global Positioning Systems guide a cruise missile to its
target. 1400 words. By Gabriel Glaser. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Obstetricians and perinatologists who
study childbirth say that anxiety about the well-being of the fetus
during labor usually overrides concerns about the cost or
consequences of Caesarean surgery and even whether surgery is truly
necessary. But some doctors now are questioning the effort to push
down the rate for Caesarean sections, especially when economics is
the prime factor in that effort. 1300 words. By Jane Brody. (With

</P>
<P>
   SCI-ALIEN-TISSUE (Undated) _ New findings are beginning to
explain how the body's reaction to alien tissue can enhance
survival of donor grafts after transplantation surgery yet give
rise to some disorders not only during pregnancy but many years
later. 1200 words. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>

older adults, often the cause of serious injury, can be prevented

NESSIE KEEPS 'EM GUESSIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE BEAST OF LOCH NESS 
part of PBS ``Nova'' series 
When: Tuesday, Jan. 12, 8 p.m. 
On: PBS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest known creature to swim its waters is the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, there's Nessie. Perhaps. Nessie: the serpentine
monster lurking in the murky depths of Great Britain's largest body
of water, Scotland's Loch Ness. First ``discovered'' in 1933 and
brought to international fame with a ``photo'' taken the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   Does she live and breathe? Have she and/or her offspring been
there 60 million years? Is she the dinosaur that time forgot? Or is
she but a figment?
</P>
<P>
   Yet another expedition _ again helmed by Nessie-hunting vets,
MIT-trained investigators Robert Pines, 72, and Charles Wyckoff, 81
_ was mounted in 1997. The searching techniques, photographic and
sonar, are more sophisticated. Their obsession is countered by
hopes that are measured.
</P>
<P>
   Nova was there for the week-long journey and broadcasts ``The
Beast of Loch Ness'' Tuesday at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And . . . as you may have gathered: No sighting, no confirmation
of beast on videotape. (If there had been one, you would have known
about it long before now.) The local witnesses swear they've seen
something; the sonar turns up unexplained, large moving images . .
. But, alas, they acknowledge the ``tracking and imaging'' requires
resources beyond their means and luck.
</P>
<P>
   The two main theories are that Nessie is a pleasaur, a
preshistoric creature _ a snake-like whale _ that escaped
extinction or a large sturgeon or eel passing in and out of the
loch. Each theory makes sense; each has some holes.
</P>
<P>
   The show, beautifully photographed, begins with the search, then
backtracks for a historical overview of Loch Ness. This is one
murky body of water, with visibility severely limited. There are
interviews with a variety of scientists, chats with locals who
claim to have seen Nessie, and a debate over the authenticity of
Dr. R. Wilson's photo. Local folks who are interviewed don't seem
fanatically possessed by Nessie. There seems to be no conspiracy.
They say simply they've seen what they've seen and you can take it
at that.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of repeated testimony can certainly tip the scales in
a court of law. But in science, corroborating eyewitness accounts,
no matter how convincing, are not proof. A sonar reading of a large
mobile object, while encouraging _ something is out there _ is not
proof. Wyckoff, who died last year, 10 months after the expedition,
and Pines hope at the least they inspire a new generation of
explorers. That seems likely. Hope springs eternal.

`SNITCH' A TALE OF SLEAZY LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SNITCH ON PBS's FRONTLINE 
When: Tuesday, 9 p.m. 
On: PBS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Snitch,'' a ``Frontline'' offering, is a distressing and
depressing 90-minute program about the nation's so-called war on
drugs. It's about the pressure to convict _ the guilty and the
highly criminal at best, the innocent or the lowly criminal, if
that's the way it shakes down. It's about the mandatory sentencing
laws hastily enacted during the crack cocaine wave of the late
1980s. It's about the overwhelming power that someone's _ anyone's
_ word, truthful or not, has if the government has placed a target
on your chest. It's about how the screws are turned on drug users
or low-level dealers, and how their families are drawn into the
case and destroyed. It's about the collateral damage _ the
inevitable innocent casualties. It is, of course, about race.
</P>
<P>
   In a better world, the entire nation would watch ``Snitch,'' and
tomorrow those viewers would raise such a clamor that Congress
would have to take notice. (Tape ``NYPD Blue'' while you watch
this.)
</P>
<P>
   We all know jail construction is a growth industry. We've all
seen the statistics that jails are overrun with people convicted
for drug use or sale. How do they all get there?
</P>
<P>
   Producer-interviewer Ofra Bikel delves into the dubious world of
those who inform for a price, that is, snitches. The price is not
money, but freedom _ or reduced prison time. The deals threaten to
turn us into a ``society of informants,'' suggests Jonathan Turley,
a law professor at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snitch'' begins with Tony, who was convicted of selling drugs
several years after he had left that business. But people in the
drug business ratted him out. In jail, he says he found out, ``you
have a prison population _ guys that are doing life sentences who
will do anything to get out of prison. In my case, there were
actually people who were reading the newspaper . . . called the
government and said, `Hey, I can testify against this person.'''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the lawyers says, snitches lie only when their mouths
are moving.
</P>
<P>
   How did the laws get this draconian? Eric Sterling, a former
counsel to the chairman of the US House subcommittee on crime,
calls it the politics of hysteria. ``The whole thing is kind of
cobbled together with chewing gum and baling wire. Numbers are
picked out of the air. And we see what the consequences are of that
kind of legislating.'' When Len Bias, a star basketball player at
the Univsity of Maryland, died from a cocaine overdose when he was
celebrating being drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1986, it hit the
late Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill close to home. His zeal to
get a bill approved set off a stampede. According to ``Snitch,''
mandatory sentencing was tacked onto the bill just before the House
recessed. There were no hearings. The Drug Enforcement Agency was
not called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the sentencing, Sen. Orrin Hatch says mandatory
minimums were necessiated because of ``these soft-on-crime judges
we have in this society.''
</P>
<P>
   Says attorney Dennis Knizley: ``We're trading our paranoia to
get rid of thse drugs for our consistitutional rights.'' Knizley
defended Clarence Aaron, who is serving three life terms for
selling cocaine. It was his first offense. He was ratted out by a
self-avowed drug kingpin, who bargained for a more lenient
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Still in jail is Joey, languishing for 10 years because he sold
$500 worth of LSD to an undercover policeman. Prosecutors suggest
his time might be reduced if his father could turn in some drug
dealers. An entire town, Uniontown, Ala., is decimated as a big
dealer testifies against family, friends and neighbors. Homes and
farms are forfeited.
</P>
<P>
   There's the case of a prominent California lawyer, Patrick
Hallinan, whose client turned against him and told police he ran
the marijuana smuggling business. ``You know, when you have a war
there's only one point of a war: that's to win. So whatever impedes
victory, you throw out of the way . . . And so this war on drugs
has led to corruption of the American justice system. It's led to a
corroding of the moral fiber of this country. I don't mean the
drugs, I mean the kind of things where you can call the wife to
testify against the husband. When you can threaten the child to
testify against the father.''

A TICK OFF THE OLD BLOCK: `60 MINUTES' SPINS OFF INTO WEDNESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Officially, it's ``60 Minutes II,'' and it
premieres Wednesday. The question is whether it's ``60 Minutes II
Much.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because in an act of uncommon delicacy, CBS News is
placing its stout but slightly shopworn image on the line as it
attempts to duplicate ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, cluck the journalism priests, there could be a ``60
Minutes III'' and ``60 Minutes IV,'' along with overheated stories
about homicidal husbands and the latest sextuplets. You know, the
``Dateline NBC'' disease.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were palpable at a weekend press conference in which
the ``60 Minutes II'' executive producer and correspondents
preferred instead to spout such language as ``cathedral of
journalism'' and ``the ghost of Edward R. Murrow.''
</P>
<P>
   (The ghost of Edward R. Murrow, for the record, smokes
Chesterfields and watches C-SPAN.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, ``60 Minutes II'' ought to be a perfectly
respectable newsmagazine. But if it does ever come to a ``60
Minutes III,'' watch out. The jig is up.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Junior will be a chip off the old block _ the ticking
stopwatch, three stories a week and, usually, letters and
commentary. It's just that the names are changed. Instead of Mike,
Morley, Ed, Steve, Lesley and Andy, we'll get Dan, Charlie, Bob,
Vicki, Carol and Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dan Rather, the ``CBS Evening News'' and ``48 Hours'' anchor
who is possibly overextended and forced to rely heavily on news
producers. No problem, the onetime Texas ditch-digger said at the
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked stripped to my waist in 115-degree temperatures
for minimum wage with no benefits, thank you very much,'' Rather
said. ``And that was work. We worked from early dawn 'til way well
after dark moving dirt. Now that's real work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This passion of mine, this joy of mine, it takes hours, it
takes time, it takes some juggling the schedule around. But listen,
I have worked for a living, and this beats working any day of the
week.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlie Rose, the late-night PBS interviewer, who is notable
largely for not being Bryant Gumbel. CBS is paying upwards of $5
million a year to Gumbel, who is supposed to be one of television's
top interviewers, and omits him from ``60 Minutes II''? Clearly
Gumbel is in bad odor at his adopted network. The view is that
Gumbel would benefit from a lot more self-motivation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bob Simon, a tough and cosmopolitan reporter in the classic
``60 Minutes'' mode. Simon covered the Vietnam War, was jailed by
the Iraqis and has even endured a preliminary screening session
with legendary ``60 Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt, who is pitching
in with ``60 Minutes II.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon recounted, ``When the lights went on in the screening room
after my first piece was screened, Don Hewitt said, `The woman who
you touted as your central character _ I hate her. Get her out of
the piece. Your on-camera close _ it's the open. Your narration
sounds like you were singing in the shower and got soap in your
mouth.' And that was just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was over, and I was wandering through the corridor,
looking for a window that opened more than two inches, Josh Howard,
a senior producer, came up to me and said, `You know, Bob, that was
a really good screening.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ Vicki Mabrey, whose fortunes have been propelled by tragedies.
That's the news biz. She was a not-so-prominent correspondent in
the CBS Dallas bureau when the Branch Davidian standoff developed
outside Waco, Texas. She was also involved in reporting the Midwest
floods of 1993, the crash of TWA Flight 800 and the death of
Princess Diana. Mabrey is the only black correspondent on the new
program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carol Marin, on the roster as a ``contributor,'' has a satchel
of local and national reporting awards. But she earned her
sainthood as a co-anchor at WMAQ-TV, the NBC-owned station in
Chicago. In 1997, the station foolishly hired Jerry Springer as a
sweeps-month news commentator. Marin quit. Her courage vaulted her
to a Peabody Award and to CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jimmy Tingle, a comedian and commentator who will be the new
program's version of Andy Rooney, presumably with less scary
eyebrows. Tingle, who wasn't at the Pasadena press conference,
specializes in political humor and has been seen on the MSNBC cable
channel. He could prove to be the riskiest addition to ``60 Minutes
II.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the three stories each week will be a ``60 Minutes
Classic'' piece, an old segment from the original show that's been
updated for the new program.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Classic'' segments will save some wear and tear on the new
correspondents, but executive producer Jeff Fager acknowledged that
they'll serve another purpose, too. They will be a reminder to the
viewer, a visual link between the original ``60 Minutes'' and its
knockoff.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; CBS' labored decision to clone ``60 Minutes'' was all too
conspicuously unpopular with Hewitt in the beginning and spawned
what Rather calls ``scenes that were reminiscent of some Verdi
opera'' as news stalwarts beat their breasts and protested the
heresy of the new program.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Fager as the executive producer calmed the internal
critics, Rather said. Fager was executive producer of the ``CBS
Evening News'' from 1996 to 1998, a period when the program was
rediscovering hard news.
</P>
<P>
   Fager, at the press conference, tried diplomacy when he was
asked about possible frayed tempers and competition for stories
between the Sunday ``60 Minutes'' team and the Wednesday ``60
Minutes II'' team. There will be times when the two programs chase
the same story, he said, and he left it at that.
</P>
<P>
   In stepped Rather, leaning forward onstage in his blue-and-white
striped shirt, red tie and broad suspenders. Unlike his colleagues,
Rather had shed his jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me try to be helpful to my friend,'' Rather said. ``He
just gave you an answer he has to give you. Here's the way it
works. At my age and stage, I no longer have to give those answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, look, Mike Wallace gets what he wants, and the rest of us
get the right to fight over it. And that's the way it should be,
because he's earned that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, that's the way it works. If Mike wants to do it,
he gets to do it. The ones he doesn't want to do or doesn't know
about, then the rest of us have the right to squabble over it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, to quote another eminence grise of CBS News, that's the way
it is.

COULD THE BODY TAKE DOWN THE HAMMER?

<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the 20th century, it seemed the sobriquet was in
decline. These nicknames of affection or derision, from the French
slang  &UR; soubriquet &LR; , ``a chuck under the chin,'' enlivened the
political language of a previous era. From  &UR; the American Fabius &LR; 
(Washington) to  &UR; the Machiavelli of Massachusetts &LR;  (John Adams) to
 &UR; the Sage of Monticello &LR;  (Jefferson), American presidents sported
these monikers. Jackson was  &UR; Old Hickory &LR; , and Grover Cleveland was
 &UR; the Man of Destiny &LR;  to some,  &UR; the Stuffed Prophet &LR;  to others.
Teddy Roosevelt was  &UR; the Rough Rider &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Then the long night of innocuous desuetude set in. Only in
sports and crime were heroes and villains immortalized with
sobriquets. Honus Wagner, the great Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop in
the first two decades of the century, was called  &UR; the Flying
Dutchman &LR;  for his speed and Germanic background (based on the 1841
Richard Wagner opera, ``Der Fliegender Hollaender'').
</P>
<P>
   According to Brenda Wilson and James Skipper Jr., making a case
for socio-onomastics in the December 1990 Names, the Journal of the
American Name Society, Honus Wagner was responsible for the
nickname of his Pirate teammate John Barney ( &UR; Dots &LR; ) Miller. When a
sportswriter asked Wagner the name of the rookie trying out in the
infield, the heavily accented Dutchman replied, ``Dot's Milla.''
Miller proudly carried the nickname  &UR; Dots &LR;  through a 12-year career
in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a change in cultural orientation during the
past century,'' note the onomastic linguists, ``from one where
there was a sense of solidarity and common identity rooted in
tradition and personal relationships.'' Military leaders tried to
keep it going: from the Civil War's Gen. Winfield Scott _  &UR; Old Fuss
and Feathers &LR;  _ to World War I's  &UR; Black Jack &LR;  Pershing, to the
Second World War's  &UR; Old Blood and Guts &LR; , applied to Gen. George
Patton.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball in midcentury preserved the tradition: After Babe
Ruth's  &UR; the Sultan of Swat &LR;  came  &UR; Joltin' Joe &LR;  DiMaggio, also known
as  &UR; the Yankee Clipper &LR; , and Stan ( &UR; the Man &LR; ) Musial. And today, we
have Mark ( &UR; Big Mac &LR; ) McGwire and Frank ( &UR; the Big Hurt &LR; ) Thomas. In
football, Elroy ( &UR; Crazylegs &LR; ) Hirsch was succeeded by Jerome ( &UR; the
Bus &LR; ) Bettis. You can find more sobriquets in popular music: Frank
Sinatra was  &UR; Ol' Blue Eyes &LR; , Billie Holiday was  &UR; Lady Day &LR;  and
Benny Goodman  &UR; the King of Swing &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But it was in organized crime that the dwindling practice of
awarding a title based on a quality best held on. A previous
century's Billy ( &UR; the Kid &LR; ) Bonney and Jack  &UR; the Ripper &LR;  led to
 &UR; Scarface &LR;  Al Capone and Frank ( &UR; the Enforcer &LR; ) Nitti.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas B. Kirkpatrick, president of the Chicago Crime
Commission, sent me his latest report on leader profiles in the
``Chicago outfit'' once headed by Tony Accardo. It includes the new
boss, John ( &UR; No Nose &LR; ) DiFronzo, his adviser, Joe ( &UR; the Clown &LR; )
Lombardo, and area boss John ( &UR; Johnny Apes &LR; ) Monteleone. Crime
figures in other ethnic groups cannot boast such colorful
nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, sobriquets have been making their way back into
politics, often based on modifications of first names:  &UR; Landslide
Lyndon &LR;  Johnson,  &UR; Tricky Dick &LR;  Nixon,  &UR; Slick Willie &LR;  Clinton (that
last stolen from the bank robber  &UR; Slick Willie &LR;  Sutton, from his
habit of slicking down his hair as well as his smooth way with
safes). Ronald Reagan had a good run as  &UR; the Great Communicator &LR; ,
but it was President Clinton who successfully styled himself  &UR; the
Comeback Kid &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   That reversal of trend, with all its socio-onomastic resonance
in a return to personalization of leadership, picked up speed late
last year with the election of James G. Janos to the governorship
of Minnesota. The former professional wrestler ran under, and
serves under, the service mark he registered in the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, ``Jesse ( &UR; the Body &LR; ) Ventura,'' which he
established as the exclusive ``nickname and not the name of any
other particular living individual.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that came the emergence, during the House of
Representatives' impeachment debate, of Majority Whip Tom ( &UR; the
Hammer &LR; ) DeLay. He's not happy with it: ``Sometimes I'm a little
blunt and forthright in what I believe, and that's created an image
I don't think I am, quite frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't knock it, Tom. Beats  &UR; the Screwdriver &LR;  or  &UR; the Monkey
Wrench &LR; , or as President James Buchanan described himself,  &UR; the Old
Public Functionary &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   PARADIGM SHRIFT
</P>
<P>
   The chastisement of the president continues to churn up quotes
that call for correction or amplification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I for one would have very strong opposition,'' Sen. Dianne
Feinstein of California told CNN, as reported in The New York
Times, ``to any kind of  &UR; star chamber &LR;  proceeding that's held in
private.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Squad Squad, spotters of tautologous
redundancies, landed heavily on that one.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Star Chamber &LR;  was a room constructed in 1347 in the royal
palace at Westminster, its ceiling decorated with ``starres
gilted.'' In the next century, Henry VII created the Court of the
Star Chamber in that room, and its tyrannous abuses under James I
and Charles I made it synonymous with oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Although some historians insist that it was as public as any
other criminal court, the  &UR; Star Chamber &LR;  _ abolished in 1641 by the
Long Parliament _ is now remembered for operating in secrecy.
Therefore, the Feinstein formulation of `` &UR; Star Chamber &LR;  proceeding
that's held in private'' is indeed redundant, and needlessly
verbose, superfluous, prolix and repetitive, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is we need to commence the trial,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky. ``Otherwise, it just completely makes short
shrift of the action of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   What is a  &UR; shrift &LR; , anyway, and aren't there any long ones?
</P>
<P>
   To  &UR; shrive &LR;  is a religious term meaning ``to give absolution to,
after penance.''  &UR; Shrift &LR; , the noun, varies in meaning from the
confession of sin to the penance offered or the absolution that
results.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Short shrift &LR;  was coined by Shakespeare to describe a brief
confession before execution. In ``Richard III,'' Ratcliffe tells
the condemned Hastings: `` &UR; Make a short shrift &LR; ,'' because the duke
``longs to see your head.''
</P>
<P>
   It has lost its confessional sense and now means only ``make
quick work of.'' Surely McConnell could not have been thinking of
his phrase's macabre origins.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When my twin sons were born 29 years ago, fetal monitoring was
not a routine part of labor and delivery, and there was no way to
be certain the babies were doing OK while my uterus tried in vain
to expel them. So when the doctor announced after many anxious
hours of unproductive labor that he was going to have to deliver
them by Caesarean, my response was, ``I don't care if I cough them
up as long as they're alive and healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Obstetricians and perinatologists who study childbirth say that
such feelings are widely shared by mothers-to-be and their doctors.
Anxiety about the well-being of the fetus during labor usually
overrides concerns about the cost or consequences of Caesarean
surgery and even whether surgery is truly necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine years ago, only one birth in 20 was by Caesarean and
there was little reason to question whether some of these
operations could be avoided. In most hospitals, they were done only
when a surgical delivery was deemed necessary to preserve the
health of the mother or her baby.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1980s, things had changed drastically. Fetal monitors
came into wide use that could indicate, sometimes wrongly, trouble
for a fetus awaiting birth, prompting doctors to intervene with an
emergency Caesarean. Malpractice suits, too, were on a precipitous
rise, prompting doctors to be overly cautious about fetal
well-being during labor and a baby's chances of withstanding a
vaginal delivery undamaged. And, as more women had surgical
deliveries for first births, still further surgeries were scheduled
for subsequent deliveries because sometimes the same reason that
prompted the first Caesarean was still present and because there is
a small but real risk of uterine rupture if a woman with a scarred
uterus has a vaginal delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Caesarean rates _ and, consequently, costs of childbirth _ were
soaring in most hospitals, peaking in 1988 at a quarter of
deliveries. In some hospitals two of five babies were born by
Caesarean. Then came pressures from consumer groups, insurers and
government agencies to curb unnecessary surgery and the risks it
entailed. Guidelines were issued to help doctors more accurately
assess the need for Caesareans, and dozens of studies were done
demonstrating that most women who had one Caesarean could safely
deliver vaginally in later pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Caesarean rates nationwide have only inched down _ to 21
percent at last count, far from the target of 15 percent that the
government and many experts believe is appropriate. They point out
that quite a few hospitals, including some with a fair number of
high-risk patients, already have rates at or below 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, four
obstetrical specialists from Boston, headed by Dr. Benjamin Sachs
of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, questioned the wisdom of
pressing toward a numerical goal without adequately monitoring the
consequences to mother and baby of doing fewer Caesareans. They see
economic pressures, not concern for maternal and fetal well-being,
as the driving force behind efforts to lower Caesarean rates, and
maintain that rates should be determined by risks to mothers and
babies of vaginal delivery, not by insurance companies' efforts to
cut costs. They say much more research is needed to assess the
safety of vaginal versus Caesarean delivery under various
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, pregnant women are not equipped to be the sole
determinants of how their babies should be delivered. While they
should be encouraged to express preferences, the final decision
should be made in consultation with the attending doctor and
sometimes by the doctor alone. To participate intelligently, a
woman must be well-informed before she goes into labor about the
benefits and risks of the various delivery options under various
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Caesarean rates are necessarily higher in high-risk pregnancies.
These might include mothers with serious health problems like heart
conditions or diabetes or with infections that could be spread to
the baby during a vaginal delivery. Another consideration is the
mother's age. Older women tend to have less efficient labor and
more complications. The risk of stillbirth is greater, too. Then,
too, many older women having first babies had great difficulty
conceiving and can ill-afford to risk losing a baby and having to
try again to get pregnant. Thus, doctors might be more inclined to
push for a Caesarean in an older first-time mother than to risk
damaging the baby in a vaginal delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems with babies, such as extreme prematurity,
multiple births, breech presentation and poor performance on a
fetal monitor, also have to be factored into the delivery decision.
Even though obstetricians know that monitors often make mistakes
and indicate trouble when the baby is fine, it is hard for a doctor
to ignore a monitor that signals that the baby is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Women who previously had a Caesarean have different
considerations. Most doctors and hospitals now encourage such women
to attempt a vaginal delivery the next time. And studies have shown
that 60 percent to 80 percent of such women who do try to deliver
vaginally can do so without mishap. (The babies of those who try
and fail are delivered by Caesarean.) However, even in the best of
circumstances, in 1 percent of cases where vaginal delivery is
attempted following a previous Caesarean, the uterus ruptures along
the weakened scar line, resulting in a hemorrhage and sometimes a
hysterectomy for the mother and emergency Caesarean to deliver the
baby.
</P>
<P>
   In most hospitals that offer courses in natural childbirth,
there are also courses in vaginal birth after Caesarean, which goes
by the acronym VBAC. Introductory sessions outline the benefits and
risks of vaginal birth for these women and can help them decide
whether they want to attempt it. The Boston experts, among others,
insist that the decision to attempt a vaginal delivery after a
Caesarean should be made by the mother, not the doctor, hospital or
insurance company. And if that attempt is to be made safely, the
hospital must be prepared to act instantly if uterine rupture
occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Women also need to be flexible about their childbirth decisions.
Generally, women should strive for a vaginal delivery but never
insist on it when the attending physician recommends against it.
While a Caesarean clearly has risks, during and after the surgery
(anesthesia, infection, pain and longer post-birth recovery), so
has a complicated vaginal delivery. When, for example, labor gets
sluggish and the baby fails to progress at a reasonable rate
through the birth canal, doctors often try to assist the process
with a contraction-stimulating drug that has its own potential
complications.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the baby has inordinate difficulty getting through the
narrowest part of the pelvis, doctors may assist with forceps or,
increasingly now, with a vacuum suction device applied to the
baby's head. In a small percentage of cases, these instruments
cause cranial bleeding or hairline skull fractures and may even
damage the baby's brain. So, every procedure has a risk that must
be weighed against the benefits to mother and baby.

   &UR; A Cloud Over Air Travel &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By enabling millions of people to go places they never could
before, air travel is changing society.
</P>
<P>
   It may be changing the weather as well.
</P>
<P>
   The hot, humid exhaust produced by jet engines forms
condensation trails, a familiar sight high in the sky, particularly
near air travel corridors. Under certain conditions, satellite
images have shown, these contrails can spread into thin layers of
cirrus _ those wispy clouds of ice crystals that occur above 20,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Now a French researcher, studying cloud reports from land and
ship stations over 10 years from 1982 to 1991, has shown that the
occurrence of cirrus clouds increased by an average annual rate of
1.1 percent over land, and 3.5 percent over oceans. (During the
same time, air travel, as measured by consumption of aviation fuel,
increased at an annual rate of 3.2 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the increase was particularly marked in
parts of the world, like the North Atlantic, that are heavily
traveled air corridors. But an increase was also noted in the
lightly traveled North Pacific. The researcher, writing in the
journal Nature, notes that this region is downwind from the east
coast of Asia, which has heavy air traffic. He suggests that tiny
particles of soot in the jet exhaust may be traveling downwind and
becoming the seeds for ice crystals elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Those crystals reflect sunlight during the day. And cirrus
clouds may trap some warm air at night. So all that jetliner
traffic might be contributing, however slightly, to daytime cooling
and nighttime warming.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fossil Find Ages Whales &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A fossil find in the foothills of the Himalayas in northern
India has pushed back the earliest known date when whales walked
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil, a jawbone and three molars found in a layer of rock
that is 53.5 million years old, is about 3.5 million years older
than any other whale fossil, and represents a new species,
according to the American and Indian scientists who described the
find in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. They
named it Himalayacetus subathuensis.
</P>
<P>
   Whales are thought to have originated as land mammals on the
edge of the Tethys Sea, an ancient body of water that separated the
Indian subcontinent from the rest of Asia. Whales, the theory goes,
slowly ventured into the water in search of food, eventually
evolving into the sea-dwelling creatures we know (losing their legs
and nostrils, among other things, along the way).
</P>
<P>
   Other whale fossils, including one from Pakistan that was
previously the oldest-known one, have been found in deposits that
were associated with land mammals. The new fossil was discovered in
an oyster-bearing marine deposit. That, and analysis of the oxygen
isotopes found in the tooth enamel, indicate that himalayacetus
spent time on land and in the sea. This reinforces the idea that
early whales were amphibious and fed on fresh- and saltwater fish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preserving a Population &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Populations of many vertebrates go through cycles, building
steadily and then crashing spectacularly, again and again. There
has been much speculation as to why this happens, but no firm
answers.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Britain, for example, populations of red grouse
regularly crash every four to eight years. Now, researchers from
Britain and the United States have determined that a common theory
as to why this happens _ that the birds become infected by a
parasitic worm, which affects breeding _ is correct.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who wrote about their work in the journal
Science, performed a classical test of the theory. If a parasite is
causing the population to crash, they reasoned, removing the
parasite (by treating captured birds with a worm-killing drug)
should allow the birds to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened, in four local populations studied
and treated over four years. Predicted cyclic crashes did not
occur. The researchers found that in order to prevent a crash, only
about 20 percent of a population needed to be treated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Adding Illusion to Sound &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Listen to a favorite recording on a stereo system, and the
sounds appear to originate from the speakers across the room. But
listen to the same performance through headphones, and the sounds
seem to come from inside the head.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is due to several factors. For one thing, an
outside sound usually reaches the two ears at slightly different
times and intensity levels, allowing the brain to determine the
source.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered in recent years that the external
ear, known as the pinna, also provides important cues by acting as
a filter, increasing, reducing or delaying sound waves before they
hit the ear drum.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon, which scientists dryly refer to as the
``head-related transfer function,'' is lacking when the sound
enters the ear directly from a headphone. But it can be simulated
by electronic filtering that creates ``virtual auditory space,''
that is, the illusion that the sound is coming from outside the
head. Such filtering could have applications in simulators and
computer games, for example.
</P>
<P>
   One question is how much the filtering has to match that of a
human ear in order to maintain the illusion. The answer, according
to a study by researchers from Boston University, is not much. The
researchers, reporting in Nature, showed that listeners could not
distinguish a virtual external sound from a real one even when most
of the fine detail of the filtering _ the amount of increase or
reduction over the full range of frequencies _ was removed.

   &UR; Evergreen or Not? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do evergreens keep their leaves?
</P>
<P>
   A. Evergreen trees do not keep their leaves indefinitely, but
rather may grow new ones before the old ones fall, or keep some and
drop others over a period of time.
</P>
<P>
   As any Southern gardener can tell you, some broad-leaf
evergreens, like Magnolia grandiflora, drop their heavy leaves in a
staggered cycle over the course of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like the live oak, may show a heavy leaf loss in early
spring, but retain a few old leaves while the new ones develop.
</P>
<P>
   There is also seasonal needle loss with evergreen species of
conifers, like pine, spruce and fir trees, according to the plant
pathology department of Iowa State University extension service.
The leaf drop is a normal process, not a disease.
</P>
<P>
   The older, inner needles senesce, or grow old, turning yellow or
brown, and drop from the tree after one to several years, depending
on species.
</P>
<P>
   By November of most years, for example, white pines may have
only a year's worth of needles attached to the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian and Scotch pines usually retain their needles for three
years, according to the extension service. Spruce and fir needles
also yellow and drop with age, but these trees retain their needles
for several years, so needle drop is often not noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Arborvitae and some cedar needles usually turn brown rather than
yellow with age.
</P>
<P>
   These general patterns of needle drop may vary from tree to tree
and year to year; adverse conditions in the summer and fall may
lead to a more pronounced needle drop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Amniotic Fluid &LR;

   Q. What is amniotic fluid made of?
</P>
<P>
   A. Fetal urine is the main component of the amniotic fluid that
bathes the developing fetus. It is excreted into the fetal sac
inside the womb as the fetus develops. Normally, the fetus
``breathes'' this fluid into its lungs, and it is essential for the
normal development of the lungs. The fluid contains some fetal
cells, which can be drawn out in the process called amniocentesis
and analyzed to find out whether the fetus has some genetic
diseases.

 &HT;    Wake up a room by adding new accessories _ or just rearranging
what you have
 &HT;    (Resending for those who need it.)
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Take a long hard look at your living room.
</P>
<P>
   That new sofa and armoire you got for Christmas look great but
seem cold and barren. Something's missing.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe your end tables look less like the perfectly decorated
ones in House Beautiful and more like something from ``The Odd
Couple,'' cluttered with remote controls, CD cases, candy bar
wrappers and month-old newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   If either case sounds familiar, your room may qualify for the
next episode of ``Jerry Springer'' _ ``People Who Need Treatment
for Accessory Disorder Syndrome.'' You know the internal disease _
too few decorating touches, such as pillows, pictures, books and
collectibles, or to the other extreme, too much stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, people usually just have the wrong
things displayed in the wrong places,'' said Jillian Pritchard, an
Atlanta interior designer.
</P>
<P>
   They may own beautiful furniture, but without the right accents
their rooms look flat, she said. Accessories are the crowning
touches _ the necklace or earrings that make that little black
dress come to life. Touches that give interiors personality by
reflecting the things you like, your hobbies and interests. Touches
that inject color and texture into a room, making it intriguing and
inviting.
</P>
<P>
   So you say you're broke after buying that new sofa and armoire
and can't afford any of these precious jewels. Not to worry: Not
all accessories are expensive; a lot depends on your decorating
tastes. Designers contend clients typically already have most of
what they need; it just needs to be moved around. Other things may
just need a little spiffing up _ a new shade for that lamp, a new
fabric for that pillow, new frames for those family photos _
especially ones you suddenly inherit through marriage or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother died, I was overwhelmed as I began the process
of cleaning out her home. It was full of possessions from the late
1930s on,'' Martha Jo Katz said. ``Then I found ones from my
grandmother's home that were packed away from years before.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Marietta (Ga.) resident wanted was to regret
getting rid of something special. And because she loves
contemporary art, Katz also was concerned about mixing the old with
the new. So she resolved to make the experience fun by opening her
mind to new and unconventional ways of displaying accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many ideas to take advantage of what some people
would just consider throwing away or putting in a closet or giving
away,'' she said. ``Plus, it's so nice to be able see and use so
many of these special things every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz was determined to make the emotional experience of sorting
through a parent's belongings a fun adventure, and it paid off. The
additional pieces made her home so attractive that friends have
asked Katz, a catering director for Swissotel Atlanta, to help them
arrange their own accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The point is to experiment. If you don't move things around from
time to time, you become immune to how your rooms look, Pritchard
said.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to start is to remove all the accessories from your
tables, mantles, bookcases and walls and put them on your kitchen
or dining room table. This accomplishes several things: It allows
you to assess your inventory and the things you lack, it gives you
a clean slate for creating new displays and finally, permit themes
to emerge among accessories (You may discover you own a collection
of things, which had been strung out all over the house).
</P>
<P>
   If no categories emerge, ``A lot of times, it's good to spend
$10 or $15 on some little things that can create a collection,''
Pritchard said. ``These become the 'golden thread' that creates
some consistency in your displays.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard recommends:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Treating each tabletop, mantle or bookcase as a vignette,
striving for a design that takes into account color (pick up hues
in your furnishings), texture (contrast the smooth surface of a
plate, for example, against the rough foliage of a plant), scale
(relate sizes of the items to each other proportionally) and
balance (arrange some things symmetrically, others asymmetrically).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Striving for a three-dimensional effect, placing items in the
foreground, middle and background. Be practical, though, by placing
often-used ones where they're accessible; books should be lined
along the shelf edges ``supermarket style'' so their spines are
legible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Categorizing items with something in common _ candlesticks
made of various metals, picture frames in several finishes, cut
glass in different forms _ and grouping them to create more impact.
Go for odd numbers of items. Alternate groups of books among
shelves, for example, to create movement for the eye.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mixing the old with the new _ hang a contemporary painting
over an antique chest _ and the formal with the informal _ combine
fine porcelain vases with casual clay flower pots. ``It's nice to
mix periods and let pieces play off each other,'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Using some accessories as displays, such as books as platforms
for giving other items height or large plates placed on stands as
backgrounds for a grouping.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Emphasizing special accessories with lighting, either overhead
task fixtures or accent lamps.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remembering that less can be more. ``You're better off
accenting a fabulous fireplace by putting no tools on the hearth
and just adding simple logs,'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lean a painting on a mantel to lend informality.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Balance pairs of accessories, such as large hurricane lamps,
to give this vignette symmetry. The natural texture of topiaries
softens the hard look of stone.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use furniture as an accessory _ in this case, to make the
fireplace more inviting.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use candlesticks too small for so massive a mantel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be without anything to draw you into the fireplace. ``It
should play host to your home's best pieces since it's the focal
point of a room,'' Pritchard says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Have too many competing types of items with nothing in common.
``There's no golden thread that ties the accessories together,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use larger pieces to add scale and create impact.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Organize elements by categories into small collections, such
as photos, crystal and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make old encyclopedias into convenient display platforms. Line
treasured books along the shelf's edge ``supermarket style'' so
their spines can be read.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrict movement among the pieces. The scale of the items is
too similar.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be without uniformity. No one element plays off another.
``It's just a lot of stuff,'' Pritchard says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be without any color to draw you to the bookcase.

INTERNET BANKING RIFE WITH POTHOLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trim) 
 
By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Banks have won a public trust that few other
institutions can claim.
</P>
<P>
   When you open an account, you probably don't spend time
wondering about the safety of the institution. But if you are
considering an Internet bank, you have to be extra careful.
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate Internet banks out there, such as
Houston-based CompuBank.
</P>
<P>
   However, there have been cases where con artists have set up
what looked like a legitimate bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet banking is one of the easiest frauds to perpetrate
because it takes nothing to put up a home page,'' said Catherine
Ghiglieri, Texas banking commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have found as many as nine fraudulent bank Web sites,
said David Barr, spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which insures deposits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FDIC SITE PROVES TROUBLESOME &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The FDIC has an online site for checking out banks, but it may
be more trouble than it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that when I tried to verify the legitimacy of
Net.B(at)nk in Alpharetta, Ga., a federally insured online bank
that shows up regularly on lists of institutions with high interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   I started by going to the FDIC's Web site at www.fdic.gov. From
there I clicked on ``Consumer News'' and then ``Suspicious Internet
Banking,'' which allowed me to reach my goal _ the ``FDIC
Institutions Search Engine.'' This is supposed to tell you whether
a bank has a legitimate government charter to conduct business and
is insured by the FDIC.
</P>
<P>
   Don't automatically presume that a bank is fraudulent because it
doesn't quickly show up on the FDIC's list. My experience is a good
example.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be sure you are doing everything just right or else
you won't find any information.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into trouble there with Net.B(at)nk, because I used the
letter ``A'' rather than the ``at'' sign when I typed the name into
the search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Even when I corrected that mistake, I was unable to find
Net.B(at)nk on the FDIC's list. I called Barr for guidance and even
he couldn't pull up the thrift. He finally confirmed it is on the
FDIC's list of insured institutions by e-mailing a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   I was able to find the institution on the Web site only after
Barr e-mailed me Net.B(at)nk's FDIC certificate number.
</P>
<P>
   I then entered the name and the certificate number. Still no
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Barr suggested I type in just the certificate number.
Voila! The bank pops up. Of course that won't work for the average
consumer because few people even know banks have certificate
numbers. (A later search using the bank's name did bring up the
information.)
</P>
<P>
   There is another way to use the FDIC's site for checking an
online bank. Check the ``Inactive'' list of institutions. If the
name of the bank shows up on the inactive list, someone may have
lifted the name and used it to name the so-called Internet bank,
Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   A better alternative is to check the legal status of the entity
you are questioning by calling the FDIC's Consumer Call Center at
800-934-FDIC.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the online bank is based in Texas, check the Web site of the
Texas Department of Banking. To do that, go to the Web address,
www.banking.state.tx.us, and click on ``Institutions the department
supervises.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also has information on how to file a complaint
about a bank. You also can call the banking department in Austin at
512-475-1300.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A DEFINITE RED FLAG &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steer clear of commercial banks and savings associations if they
are not chartered by either the federal government or a state
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely won't want to send money to a bank that's not
even licensed to conduct banking business,'' Ghiglieri said.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid institutions making outlandish claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest red flags is unusually high interest rates
on their deposits,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing can be said if a company is offering abnormally
low rates on loans.
</P>
<P>
   Another red flag is if an entity that claims to be an Internet
bank has no physical address, Barr said. Look for a phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to the bank's Web address.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's something like `www.geocities.irstinternetbank.com,'
that may be a clue that it's somebody in their basement using
Geocities' free Web page to set something up,'' Barr said. ``If
there is a bank operation on the Internet, it's going to be
`www.firstinternetbank.com.' There won't be a prefix between the
two.''

SIMPLY BUY TRAVELERS CHECKS AND EURO READY TO GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KRISTIN N. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't straighten euro bills in your wallet or clasp a euro
coin in your hand for three years. But you can spend the new
European Monetary Union's currency in 11 countries by buying
American Express traveler's checks in denominations of 50, 100 and
200 euros.
</P>
<P>
   The checks are embossed with pastel-colored world maps with
instructions in English, French and German, and have been available
since the Jan. 1 start of the European Monetary Union. The official
currencies, however, won't begin circulating until Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, euros are already hot. The topic of a special fall
Newsweek edition and lengthy pieces of prose in The Wall Street
Journal, euros are dominating discourse among Europe's shopkeepers,
who must make the transition to the new currency without turning
off tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of using a euro-denominated travel check is that
you can use it in any of the 11 euro-affiliated travel zone
countries,'' said Victoria Handwerk, an American Express
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read every day that restaurants in Paris are starting to do
their menus in euros, and I think a lot of places in the travel
industry are already doing dual pricing. How quickly that spreads
to the small towns remains to be seen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Euro traveler's checks are good in Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   For now, governments in Britain, Denmark, Greece and Sweden have
opted against joining the European Monetary Union. Greece didn't
meet the economic standards to qualify, according to The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   But while traveling among the 11 participating countries, euro
checkholders won't have to waste time standing in foreign-currency
exchange lines or risk losing money on exchange fees.
</P>
<P>
   And Americans returning home who otherwise might be left holding
extra German marks or guilders not spent in Amsterdam could simply
hold onto their extra euro traveler's checks until they get back to
one of the participating countries.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-year transition period, clerks at France's
supermarkets, for example, are expected to mark everything from
potatoes to toothpaste in francs and in euros.
</P>
<P>
   If countryside taverns haven't followed suit, euro traveler's
checks may be cashed for national currencies at local banks or
American Express travel offices, Handwerk said.
</P>
<P>
   American Express also plans to continue to offer traveler's
checks in foreign currency denominations for participating euro
countries until the individual currencies are phased out in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have warned that the lengthy transition time will cause
monetary confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's financial leaders, however, have argued that the
unified euro will result in a stronger currency that competes well
against the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   To buy American Express traveler's checks in euros, contact your
bank or local exchange bureaus, travel agencies or the American and
Canadian Automobile Associations. American Express card holders
also can order the checks by calling toll-free (800) 221-7282. The
checks will arrive by mail.

A FEW GOOD WORDS FOR BILL CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the grinding accusations, may we hear just a few kind words
for Bill Clinton, man and president? The mortal mix of good and
bad, vice and virtue, whom we've twice picked to lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Our instincts did not betray us. He is what we saw. A basically
generous person. Big of mind and heart. Prodigious physical
energies and unrelenting drive. He hasn't used his talents or
office to enrich himself, and he is far kinder to his critics than
they to him.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, faults for sure! And they are well-publicized. But we were
never blind to these when we thought he could help our country in
its troubles. And help us he surely has!
</P>
<P>
   Do Clinton's good deeds count for naught? I discern in him more
good than bad. Let's see him whole and weigh the balance before
pronouncing final, fatal judgment. Wouldn't we wish such treatment?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a reflection of us from whom he came. Nurtured in the
bosom of our humanity, brought up in the culture of an indulgent
generation, he is flawed and imperfect, as are we all _ a microcosm
of modern America with all its contradictions. It is we, as well as
he, who are on trial.
</P>
<P>
   We chose him. Polls say two-thirds of us still want him. And
they presume a mighty, almost godlike power, those 100 mortals in
the U.S. Senate, if they pronounce the American people wrong,
decree that we may no longer have the president we chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, but he lied!'' I hear accusers say. And have they never
stretched the pure, harsh truth of their own most private thoughts
and deeds? Not once concealed a secret failing of theirs to protect
the ones who love and trust them? Then let these sinless choose.
</P>
<P>
   But wait! May they not first consider the good the man has done?
The positive examples that he's set?
</P>
<P>
   They speak of truth. Then weigh the truth of his promises to us,
the people. Clinton said he'd try to balance our national budget.
And this he's done. First time in 30 years! Since Lyndon B.
Johnson! Other presidents pledged this result quite solemnly but
didn't bring it off. Clinton did.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd promote the nation's economic growth. During his
six years, we've enjoyed the longest period of continuous economic
growth in America's history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to hold inflation down, and cost-of-living
indices have been steadier in these six years than in any
comparable period in statistically recorded memory.
</P>
<P>
   He and Vice President Al Gore promised to reduce the federal
bureaucracy. Critics scoffed in cynical disbelief. But they've done
it. There are fewer federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the plight of the working poor, Clinton swore to
raise the minimum wage and pursue policies that create more jobs
for people cast off by corporate downsizing, mergers and
globalization. At least partly as a result of his efforts,
employment numbers are higher than ever in American history.
Unemployment has been lower _ for longer _ than ever before!
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, on balance, has made good on his word to the
American people. In the big things. The things related to his job.
In his contract with us.
</P>
<P>
   Some who now clamor for the president's public humiliation on
grounds of lying have been out to destroy his presidency since he
first took office. A persistent remnant have accused him of
assorted crimes from Day One. They tried to prosecute him legally
over Whitewater, over poor Vince Foster's suicide, over personnel
files, over replacing travel office employees, over campaign
donations.
</P>
<P>
   No president in my personal recollection has been so
relentlessly hounded and verbally abused as has Clinton. Rep. Newt
Gingrich called him and the first lady ``enemies of normal
Americans.'' Rep. Dan Burton referred to the president as a
``scumbag.'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey said ungentlemanly
things about Hillary Rodham Clinton. A cottage industry floods the
Internet with outrageous accusations implicating the president
personally in the deaths of countless individuals. Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott hinted that the president ordered military action
against Iraq for partisan political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not responded to any of these in kind. He has been
patient, gentlemanly, restrained, rising above the scatological
level of almost unbearable personal calumny. Even now, he continues
working steadily, daily, on the public business to which his oath
of office commits him.
</P>
<P>
   Is all this not a decent example for our children? A worthy
lesson in public civility and good manners? Clinton has been
consistently gentle and generous with even his most strident
critics. Bigger than vengeance. Never overbearing in victory. Last
year in a White House ceremony, he awarded the Medal of Freedom to
his recent presidential opponent, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   To those who insist that justice will not be done until Clinton
is publicly punished, let me ask: Do you really suppose he hasn't
been punished, probably more hurtfully than we can imagine?
Harassed for five years by a prosecutor with a huge staff and
unlimited public funds. Bled dry financially and driven deeply into
debt in his own legal defense. Publicly embarrassed by daily
recitations to all the nation of his most private sins? Now
publicly condemned and formally ``impeached'' by the House! Just
how many pounds of flesh must we demand?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is imperfect. But he has been a good president. I
marvel at his and Hillary Clinton's physical endurance and mental
stability. And I wonder how anyone other than a fool, a saint or a
masochist would ever want to be our president.

ONE GOOD SAMARITAN MIGHT HAVE SAVED THIS LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard not to think about James Richard Robinson and the way
he must have died. He was 14, poor and alone.
</P>
<P>
   That's how they found him on Christmas Eve, anyway. Shirtless
and face down in a creek of freezing water. A photograph of him
showed cheeks with traces of baby fat, but his eyes were not at all
the eyes of an infant or even a 14-year-old. They were much older
and sadder.
</P>
<P>
   The headline over the latest story of his life read ``Death of a
Dream.'' But you only had to look into his eyes to know that if
James ever had a dream, it died long before his body turned cold
that December day in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   To dream is to have hope for the future. But for too many kids,
the future is that short period of time between now and the moment
when they have to figure out where they'll get their next meal or a
place to sleep. Tomorrow doesn't figure into their thinking. And I
suspect that with a convicted child molester for a father and a
mother who allegedly struggled with drug abuse, that's how it was
when James died.
</P>
<P>
   I read his story, meet the people whose lives he touched, and I
can't help but remember the parable of the good Samaritan. You may
recall the story of the Jew who, on his way from Jerusalem to
Jericho, was stripped, beaten and left for dead.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the story goes, a priest came and passed without offering
help. So did a Levite. But when the Samaritan saw him, he bound his
wounds and took care of him. The Samaritan had such compassion, in
fact, that he prepaid the man's bill before going on his way.
</P>
<P>
   And so I couldn't help but wonder whether James would have met a
similar end had he had the benefit of a good Samaritan. What would
have happened, for instance, if one of the adults in his life _ his
mentor, a schoolteacher, a Child Protective Services official _ had
stayed around long enough to make sure he was provided the tools he
needed to survive? What if his parents had put aside their needs
for his?
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, I was struck by the Rev. Roosevelt Sutton's
scolding of James' parents on the day of his funeral. ``That's me
lying there!'' the reverend shouted. ``I'm lying there because my
parents started to neglect me!''
</P>
<P>
   As a news reporter, I've covered tragedies like this a million
times, it seems. For a time, local ministers, at least, were
calling news conferences with regularity to denounce crime in the
black community.
</P>
<P>
   But like the priest in the parable, they look on, they show up
at the funerals and do nothing. It is a lot easier to pass judgment
than to help.
</P>
<P>
   There were people, though, who did try to help James. People
like Vernon Newton, head of the Fort Worth chapter of a mentoring
group called the Buffalo Soldiers, and Patricia Scott Barron, a
grandmother who gave him a safe place to stay, who fed him on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the problem was that James didn't respond. I've met
teen-agers like that. I work with some in the Birthing Project,
teen-age mothers so needy they don't even realize they need help. I
also know adults who give up trying, who throw in the towel the
minute things turn tough, and I've heard people say you can't make
someone accept a helping hand if they don't want it.
</P>
<P>
   I tell these people they're right, but none of us has a right to
quit trying to help others help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, police were still trying to piece together the final
days of James' life. Even as he was buried, there was no official
cause of death. Blood tests are pending. So is a $1,000 reward for
information, provided foul play was involved.
</P>
<P>
   We may never know what happened to James Robinson, but we ought
to make sure it doesn't happen to another child.

SLICE OF TIME: WIND RIVER RANGE PROVIDES A TRIP THROUGH NATURAL
HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD MASON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In earth history, it was not long ago. The best general date
for it was ten million years ago _ when the central Rocky
Mountains, which had long since taken form as we know them, were
buried up to their chins. Only the highest peaks remained
uncovered. ... The summits of the Wind River Range were hills
....''
</P>
<P>
   _ John McPhee, ``Rising From the Plains''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming Rockies are no longer buried in volcanic ash, and
the Wind River Mountains are considerably higher than hills. Our
tiny backpacking expedition explored the question in exhausting
detail.
</P>
<P>
   On a memorable August day, we climbed above the tree line in
this unique part of the world, up past the remnants of ancient
glaciers, around boulders they left behind, back in time.
</P>
<P>
   When the glaciers lost their grip on west central Wyoming long
ago, the lazy, ash-choked rivers on McPhee's ancient plain
straightened and gathered speed, slicing down through rock and fill
alike. The result is a spectacular cross section of natural
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every period in the history of the world is represented in
Wyoming,'' McPhee writes in his book, which makes an excellent
traveling companion.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to be a rockhound to enjoy the wonder of Wind
River country, although you'll see them chipping away on rocks by
the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to shoulder a pack, either. Near Lander, Wyo.,
you can drive up Sinks Canyon to see the Popo Agie River disappear
into a limestone cave. Po-PO-zha, rhyming with ``ambrosia,'' is the
consensus pronunciation, but feel free to add your variation to the
multitude.
</P>
<P>
   The river reappears just down the road in a tranquil pool called
the Rise. In the most plausible explanation of its disappearing
act, limestone veins offered less resistance than the surrounding
granite when the glacial melt gathered speed.
</P>
<P>
   Sinks Canyon State Park hosts a speakers' series on Tuesday
evenings during the summer featuring geologists and other experts.
Call the Lander Chamber of Commerce for details at (307) 332-3892.
</P>
<P>
   Up the road a bit, past the University of Missouri geology camp,
turn off on Wyoming 131 and climb 2,000 feet to a broad sweep of
fill that survived the floods. Motorists can drive for miles along
this lush, forested plateau _ a striking contrast to the arid
plains below.
</P>
<P>
   Or drive through the Wind River Canyon on U.S. 20 north of
Shoshoni. Unique in the world, Wyoming rivers set their courses
with no regard for the mountains buried beneath them. Here, the
Wind River cut the Owl Creek Mountains in half as it sliced down
through thousands of feet of sediment.
</P>
<P>
   Signs along the highway identify the geologic strata it passes
through with the river boiling alongside, still working its way
down to the continental basement.
</P>
<P>
   The Wind River becomes the Bighorn River north of the mountains.
Settlers named it twice because they couldn't conceive of a stream
that flowed into the mountains and came out the other side.
</P>
<P>
   This is geology that shaped history. Travelers on the Oregon
Trail followed the Sweetwater River through this part of Wyoming,
in part because it blasts right through Wyoming's granite hills.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades later, the Union Pacific railroad exploited a thin
remnant of volcanic fill stretching east to Cheyenne. The
gangplank, as geologists call it, allowed UP to lay tracks to the
summit of the Rockies with nary a switchback. Interstate 80 follows
the same route today.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling, empty Wyoming is less blessed by air service. United
Air Lines offers an occasional bargain flight from Dallas//Fort
Worth Airport to nearby Riverton, Wyo. But plane fare is just a
down payment. Tourists need a rental car to see this country, and
the miles pile up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a car trip that links the Wind River country with
Yellowstone National Park 180 miles north. Yellowstone's fire,
added to the Wind River's wind, ice and rain, makes the trip a
grand slam in continent-building.
</P>
<P>
   We drove to Wind River country in a marathon spanning two days
and 1,100 miles. I'm too frugal to leave a rental car at the trail
head with the meter running.
</P>
<P>
   These trails are congested, by backpacking standards. The
National Outdoor Leadership School in Lander and the university
geology camps scattered through the area are spreading the word
about the Wind River Range.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't disappoint. The middle fork of the Popo Agie roars
down steep canyons in its lower reaches. Then it turns as peaceful
as the Trinity in August for long stretches above 9,000 feet in
elevation.
</P>
<P>
   The meadows and pine forests at this height rest atop remnants
of the ancient fill. At one spot, we gazed two miles across a
canyon to see the plateau continue on the other side like the
distant end of a collapsed bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there is no easy feat. The charm of Wind River country
is its surprising horizontal nature, but its trails seem to be
mostly up or down. Its canyons are young and steep by mountain
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Its peaks are old and weathered. The Wind River range lacks
soaring grandeur because glaciers ground the peaks to unimpressive
nubs. But there's still wonder above the tree line. The glaciers
carved out vast, barren bowls beneath the weathered peaks and
dotted them with lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Our destination on this trip was Ice Lake, the highest in a
string of lakes stretching west from Chimney Rock Mountain. Our
final push, above the glaciers, took the better part of a day.
</P>
<P>
   Cresting the rim above Ice Lake at 3 p.m., we paused to rest on
a slope strewn with boulders the size of cars. Mosquitoes rose from
the grass to greet us, flying groggily in what passes for the heat
of the day at 11,000 feet. Ice Lake doesn't thaw until August.
</P>
<P>
   Glistening below, silver threads linked the lake to the last
vestiges of ice on the mountain rim and to its sister lakes below.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to imagine that the glaciers melted yesterday.

GEOLOGISTS HOPE TO PREDICT QUAKE ACTIVITY IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Someday a big earthquake will strike the San
Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   When and where no one can know for sure. But geologists hope to
make a few intelligent guesses between now and October, when the
U.S. Geological Survey is scheduled to issue, for the first time in
almost a decade, an estimate of how soon, and on which faults, the
region is likely to seriously shake.
</P>
<P>
   To make the report as authoritative as possible, geologists have
launched one of the grandest research campaigns in the history of
geology, the Bay Area Paleoearthquake Experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists plan to dig numerous windows into the past: at least
15 deep trenches along major faults this year alone. With luck, the
trenches will enable them to learn how frequently quakes have
struck different faults over the past 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   And that might enable them to estimate where the next quakes
will strike and when. The experiment ``will be a major step forward
in our understanding of earthquake hazards in the San Francisco Bay
area,'' said geologist William Lettis, a leading figure in the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists will be able to identify and date signs of past
quakes on the dirt walls of the trenches. In this way, they hope to
learn whether quakes strike certain faults in cycles or clusters,
rather than randomly.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 72 scientists, geologists, and seismologists are
involved in this probability study,'' said David Schwartz, the
project coordinator for the USGS.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Cluff, another geologist close to the USGS study, said he
expected the research would show the likelihood of another major
quake in the Bay area ``may have increased to as much as 80 percent
likelihood over the next 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A magnitude 7.0 quake could occur at any time on any of the
eight or nine segments of big faults that traverse the greater Bay
area,'' said Cluff, who is the head of geosciences at the Pacific
Gas and Electric Co. PG&AMP;E, which is concerned about quake threats
to its power lines and facilities, is funding most of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff, the past chairman of the state Seismic Safety Commission,
said the likeliest faults to quake over the next three decades are
the northern part of the Hayward Fault, which runs through
Berkeley, Oakland and Richmond; the Hayward's northern extension,
called the Rodgers Creek Fault, which passes through Santa Rosa in
Sonoma County; and the segment of the Calaveras Fault that runs
from near Anderson Reservoir east of Morgan Hill to Danville.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists began digging the trenches in September. The study
aims to determine the dates of past quakes ``on the San Andreas,
Hayward, Rodgers Creek, San Gregorio, Calaveras, Concord-Green
Valley, Greenville and Maacama faults,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The next probabilities report is scheduled for release on Oct.
15, 1999 _ two days before the 10th anniversary of the Bay area's
last severe quake: the magnitude-7.1 Loma Prieta quake that killed
67 people and caused $6 billion in damage in San Francisco, Santa
Cruz and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the USGS issued a probabilities report estimating a
two-thirds chance of another quake with a magnitude of 7.0 or
higher anywhere in the Bay area between then and 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ``we've learned about the faults'' in the region,
thanks partly to new trenching, said USGS quake specialist Bill
Ellsworth. Hence, the 1999 report's forecasts of quake likelihoods
should ``be much more robust than they were in the past.''

FACING FEW CRISES, 76TH LEGISLATURE CAN FOCUS ON WINDFALLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Legislature, legendary for its fiery
political debates and wacky proposals, opens a 140-day session
Tuesday that will be marked by a conservative agenda and a liberal
amount of spending money.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and legislative leaders, relishing the
scarcity of crises and the record budget surplus, are setting a
tone of harmony, bipartisanship and preparation for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``My priority is public education, and my second priority is a
tax cut,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that this session, his third as governor, will be
cordial unless warfare erupts over the 2000-2001 state budget, how
to spend the surplus and &UR;  &LR; money from the state's tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a conflict, that's where the conflict will be,''
Bush predicted. ``I would hope that the session is a relatively
calm session. There's a chance that it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Several sources have said that Bush, a likely candidate for
president, and his staff have put out the word that this session is
to be one of affability.
</P>
<P>
   The 150 House members and 31 senators will attempt to grant some
tax relief, improve schools, toughen welfare rules and deregulate
electric utilities. When they're not tackling major policy issues,
they'll tinker with laws that affect daily life in Texas for at
least the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a healthy Texas economy and a windfall settlement with
tobacco companies, there will be enough money to maintain current
services, lower some taxes and make significant investments in
big-ticket items, including some of those promised by Bush in his
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership's wish list also includes new roads, better child
services and teacher pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   With a long list of campaign promises to fulfill, Bush vowed not
to ``disrupt'' the 76th Legislature as he tests the waters for his
possible presidential bid in 2000. He has yet to form a formal
``exploratory'' committee to raise money, but he might as early as
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will disrupt the process is if I'm not here,'' Bush said
in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit that I'm interested and I'm thinking about running for
president. I haven't made up my mind yet. And I'm certain there's
going to be _ particularly during this legislative session _ a lot
of speculation'' about his motive, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov.-elect Rick Perry, the first Republican to win the
office in modern times, plans to work with Bush and the Senate's
GOP majority on a conservative agenda built around improving public
schools and lowering taxes through cuts and credits.
</P>
<P>
   Perry joins Bush in supporting recycled proposals to limit
access to abortions and reimburse families that send children to
private schools. Perry will begin presiding in the Senate after he
and Bush are inaugurated Jan. 19. Then the new lieutenant governor
will appoint the Senate committees that will plow into the
session's work _ including the 700 measures that were already on
file last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate lends itself to a very bipartisan approach. You've
got to have 21 votes (a two-thirds majority) to get out a piece of
legislation,'' Perry said. About 5,000 bills are usually filed,
though only one in five meets final approval.
</P>
<P>
   While the GOP holds a narrow majority in the Senate, Democrats
still hold a dwindling majority in the House, where Speaker Pete
Laney, D-Hale Center, is expected to be re-elected Tuesday to a
fourth term. Unlike Perry, Laney said he isn't pushing an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   He said his top objective is representing his Panhandle
district, but he joins Bush and Perry in endorsing tax relief and
some version of electric utility deregulation if it lowers costs
for average consumers. Laney discourages members from treating the
budget surplus like a pie that must be divided and devoured. He
wants it allocated to necessary and lasting projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money needs to be an investment into the future,'' Laney
said. ``You've got to look down the road rather than just dividing
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that's what members have been doing _ in their dreams _ for
about a year. Last January, former Attorney General Dan Morales
announced a $17 billion settlement over tobacco-related health-cost
claims, and a few months later, then-Comptroller John Sharp
projected that on Aug. 31, 1999, the state would end the 1998-99
fiscal cycle with a hefty surplus, after spending the budgeted $85
billion. The Texas Constitution requires that the state ``pay as
you go,'' a rule that limits spending to projected revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The income numbers for the next two-year budget period _ which
as usual are tied to fluctuating economic factors including oil
prices, interest rates and spending patterns _ continue to evolve.
Last week, Sharp's surplus projection was cut by about $700
million.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander on Friday estimated that the
surplus _ excluding tobacco settlement proceeds _ would be $5.6
billion, with total income of $94 billion. Not all of the surplus
is up for grabs, however, because of projected increases in the
cost of some existing programs and a constitutional spending cap.
Only about $2 billion might be available, according to House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Rob Junell, D-San Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the projected income ``appears it's more than needed to
meet the basic needs of the state,'' Bush said. ``And the question
is, what'll we do with the money?''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has a detailed priority list for the cash pile. He
wants $2 billion devoted to property-tax relief and $600 million
worth of sales-tax and small-business franchise cuts plus new tax
credits for research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also is pressing for $1.6 billion for education, of
which $1 billion ``will go to local districts for teacher pay _ a
decision to be made by local elected officials.'' The remainder
would be divided among initiatives to boost school construction;
end social promotion; promote reading; and underwrite textbook
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Perry backs those spending priorities but emphasizes his support
of a program to fund master reading teachers and a statewide
database on gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Perry have also teamed to support two
conservative-backed measures that have repeatedly failed in recent
sessions _ private-school vouchers and new abortion restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   A pragmatic Bush said only a limited, ``pilot'' voucher program
has a chance in the Democrat-controlled House, where the issue
routinely fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to say as a society Texas is bold enough to try. If
it works, great. If it doesn't, we tried,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion proposals on file would mandate either parental consent
or notification when minors seek the procedure. ``Either one is
fine with me,'' Bush said. However, staunch House opposition
appears unabated this session.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional abortion and voucher issues are among scores that
will be addressed by lawmakers and promoted by the more than 1,400
lobbyists registered, with causes ranging from helping the elderly
to promoting specific businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hired advocates will be involved in the session's
most talked-about quandary _ how to deregulate the electric
industry. Utility titans are grappling with smaller competitors for
long-term stakes in the Texas power market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the big boys fighting the big boys, and we just
need to make sure that those of us on the receiving end of it still
have a dependable source of electricity at a reasonable price,''
said Laney, a cotton farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, endorses deregulation, but notes, ``We're not
interested in proposing a plan that raises the prices to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   While that battle is waged, the citizen legislature, dominated
by lawyers and people in business, will follow tradition by
pressing simpler measures as varied as life itself. Bills already
on file would affect Houston annexation efforts; stiffen
drunken-driving standards; toughen standardized tests for
schoolchildren; restrict telephone solicitors; increase teacher
retirement benefits; repeal the anti-sodomy law; and bolster
regulation of tattoo parlors.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals would abolish front license plates; create a
state parking permit for the handicapped; limit liability for year
2000 (Y2K) computer disruptions; bolster affirmative action; refine
open records and meetings laws; move primary elections from March
to May; update campaign finance laws; require more county-jail
inmates to contribute to their upkeep; and create the punishment
option of a life sentence without parole.

   SCI-TOILET-TRAINING (Undated) _ Toilet training is not rocket
science, says John Rosemond, a syndicated columnist and
best-selling author of parenting books. He considers it ``a slap to
the intelligence of a human being that one would allow him to
continue soiling and wetting himself past age 2.'' The process, he
says, should be as simple and straightforward as housebreaking a
four-month-old puppy. Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the noted
pediatrician, says there is more to it than that. Parents who force
toilet training, he says, can cause lasting problems. ``Don't rush
your toddler into toilet training or let anyone else tell you it's
time. It's got to be his choice,'' Brazelton advises in a
television commercial for Pampers ``Size 6'' diapers. What does he
think about Rosemond's arguments? ``They sound very logical _ for
puppies.'' Welcome to the newest round in the toilet training wars.
1800 words. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SCALING (Undated) _ Biologists and physicists recently
joined forces concerning a problem that has bothered scientists for
decades: the origin of biological scaling, or explaining the subtle
ways in which various characteristics of living creatures _ their
life spans, their pulse rates, how fast they burn energy _ change
according to their body size. 2800 words. By George Johnson. (With
photo and graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PSYCH (Undated) _ Once the undisputed rulers of American
psychiatry, analysts now stand at the margins of a field where drug
treatments and short-term talking therapies predominate. Analytic
patients are in short supply: without insurance reimbursement, even
those who still desire the four or five sessions per week typical
of full-fledged psychoanalysis can rarely afford to pay for them.
In turn, the threat of extinction has inspired a new vigor, a
frenzy of self-examination and the urge to reach out and connect
with the world at large. 1900 words. By Erica Goode. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CENTURION (Undated) _ Like giant feathers slowly rising on
the winds to impossible heights, large gossamer wings made of wispy
plastics and light composite materials are flying at altitudes
where few airplanes have soared. Following a recent round of
successful test flights, engineers are modifying an unmanned flying
wing called Centurion for an attempt at becoming the first aircraft
to achieve sustained level flight at 100,000 feet. 1800 words. By
Warren Leary. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PACZYNSKI-PROFILE (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Bohdan
Paczynski, born in Poland and now at Princeton. It is a knack for
generating excitement, and for sniffing out scientific openings
where others see impossibility, that has made Paczynski's mind one
of the world's leading engines of astronomical discovery. 2000
words. By James Glanz. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COURT-DISPUTES (Undated) _ Court-appointed panels of
dispassionate scientists don't necessarily solve the problems
associated with court disputes. In fact, sometimes passion counts
for a great deal: it can push people to finally recognize the truth
of certain ideas. 1600 words. By Alice Dreger.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TORTOISE-SHELLS (Undated) _ Archaeologists have come up with
an ingenious index for measuring the growth rate of early human
populations: counting tortoise shells. 1000 words. By Nicholas
Wade. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-WATCH (Undated) _ Short news items from the world of
science: air travel may be changing the weather; whales and
fossils; vertebrate population cycles; the nature of sound and
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WOMENDOCS-PAY (Undated) _ Despite progress of women in
medicine, female physicians still suffer in terms of pay. According
to the latest Physician Compensation and Production survey, the
average incomes of female doctors continue to lag behind those of
their male counterparts by tens of thousands of dollars, in some
specialties by over $100,000 a year. 825 words. By Natalie Angier.
(With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SINUS-SURGERY (Undated) _ Sinus surgery within a millimeter
of the brain is easier now with new technology, a machine called
the StealthStation, which follows a map of a patient's sinus much
the way Global Positioning Systems guide a cruise missile to its
target. 1400 words. By Gabriel Glaser. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Obstetricians and perinatologists who
study childbirth say that anxiety about the well-being of the fetus
during labor usually overrides concerns about the cost or
consequences of Caesarean surgery and even whether surgery is truly
necessary. But some doctors now are questioning the effort to push
down the rate for Caesarean sections, especially when economics is
the prime factor in that effort. 1300 words. By Jane Brody. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ALIEN-TISSUE (Undated) _ New findings are beginning to
explain how the body's reaction to alien tissue can enhance
survival of donor grafts after transplantation surgery yet give
rise to some disorders not only during pregnancy but many years
later. 1200 words. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SENIORS-BALANCE (Undated) _ Statistics show that falls among
older adults, often the cause of serious injury, can be prevented
in many cases with a program of exercises specifically aimed at
improving balance and posture. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Issues in science and health:
</P>
<P>
   A pro-and-con look at whether celebrities should advertise
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   New research shows that even mild adolescent depression may
signal problems as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study indicates that adding stretching to a
weight-training routine may actually improve strength, in addition
to increasing flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Why do evergreens keep their leaves?
They don't; they just grow new ones before the old ones fall off.
What is amniotic fluid made of? Fetal urine.

BLUE NITRO WORRIES POISON EXPERTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Touted by its promoters as a euphoric elixir
that can boost your mood, burn fat, rev up your sex life and send
you off into blissful slumber, a trendy new brew known as Blue
Nitro is also raising concern among the police and medical
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   After a few comatose patients started arriving at emergency
rooms across San Francisco, the police and health workers are
warning that the chemical composition of the liquid creates more
risks than benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, officials from the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the Food and Drug Administration and the Poison
Control Center plan an information session to describe the problems
some people have experienced after ingesting the green, minty fluid
being sold as Blue Nitro, or Vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Blue Nitro is legal to sell, recent tests in the
crime lab raised troubling questions about its safety, said Officer
Sherman Ackerson of the San Francisco Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found it has the same chemical composition as GHB, which is
against the law currently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GHB _ or gamma-hydroxybutyrate _ is a colorless, odorless
substance known as liquid ecstasy that became popular on the dance
club scene and has been documented as one of several date-rape
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Nitro is a chemical analog to GHB,'' said Jo Ellen Dyer,
a pharmacist with the San Francisco division of the California
Poison Control System.
</P>
<P>
   Commonly put in beverages, GHB gives users a feeling of
euphoria, but when combined with alcohol or in an overdose, it can
result in coma and other serious respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of Blue Nitro, Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that I don't want someone walking around
thinking this is the latest form of vitamin C that can cure the
common cold,'' she said. ``This is GHB, it can hurt people, and
they shouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though exact statistics were unavailable, Dyer said there had
been at least a half-dozen emergency room visits involving Blue
Nitro throughout the state since December, shortly after samples
were distributed legally to individuals and sex shops.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a 71-year-old man from Monterey said he mistakenly
swigged a few sips from the bottle he left on his night stand,
thinking it was water. He was hospitalize in serious condition,
though he has since recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Several other cases _ many involving patients who arrive
comatose and in need of intensive care _ have been recorded at San
Francisco General Hospital, Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially popular in gay circles because it heightens the
sexual experience, said Shawn O'Shea, the former editor of the gay
newspaper San Francisco Spectrum. It's also much less expensive
than ecstasy and other street drugs, often selling for around $10 a
hit, approximately two soda bottle capfuls of liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Alvarez is the exclusive distributor of Blue Nitro, which
is manufactured by a West Palm Beach, Fla.-based company called
Alpha Earth Inc. Alpha Earth is one of about 10 companies selling
similar products.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez defends the safety and legitimacy of his product _ which
was introduced five months ago _ and insists that Blue Nitro is not
a drug.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dietary supplement that must be used with great caution
to achieve the benefits with no negative side effects, he said,
explaining that that is why it is not to be sold to anyone under
age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the tricky part: While Blue Nitro does not contain GHB,
but it metabolizes into GHB inside the body, Alvarez said. The
company also says the substance should never be taken with alcohol
or any drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This product, when taken properly, does not have any negative
side effects,'' Alvarez said from his home in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you abuse it, there is a dark side, no question about
it, and we will never deny that. You're always going to find
somebody who abuses it, just like you can walk into a liquor store
and find someone who will abuse something there.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the handful of cases where the product guidelines have not
been followed that gain widespread attention from the news media
and law enforcement officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of people who regularly use the drug and
enjoy its benefits, Alvarez said, adding that he and his wife use
the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use it safely as recommended and have great benefits from
losing weight to sleeping in the deepest stage of sleep so we have
a lot of energy,'' he said, adding that it has also proved to be a
sexual enhancer.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez also points out that FDA officials in Florida, Alabama
and Georgia have purchased several bottles and sent inspectors down
to the manufacturing plant since the product was first created in
August and have yet to halt production.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the popularity of Blue Nitro continues to soar,
according to Alvarez, who heads a national network of 10
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he said, he sold nearly 5,000 bottles of Blue Nitro
and the numbers keep climbing every week.
</P>
<P>
   Even shop owners who don't sell the product are growing aware of
the demand for it.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Nevarez, who works at Great Earth Vitamins here, said his
store will not sell Blue Nitro but receives daily inquiries from
those looking to buy a bottle for the suggested retail price of
$64.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get lots of requests for it, sometimes as many as three
calls in a day,'' he said. ``I have tried it myself and it is the
nastiest thing in the world. I was sweating, cold, dizzy. It was
terrible.''

 By GABRIELLE GLASER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is early on a winter morning at the Massachusetts
Eye and Ear Infirmary here, and Dr. Ralph Metson is executing what
has been until now one of the most demanding, difficult and
dangerous procedures in the treatment of sinus disease.
</P>
<P>
   With a variety of drill bits, he bores into bone blocking the
frontal sinus, separated from the brain by one of the thinnest
bones in the body. One infinitesimally small slip by Metson could
result in leaked spinal fluid, impaired vision or lost sense of
smell for the 58-year-old patient.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Metson, a clinical professor of otolaryngology at Harvard
Medical School, seems completely relaxed as he calls for larger
bits and suctions, operating less than a millimeter from the brain.
His ease, on this day at least, is bolstered by a new tool that
makes this type of operation much less risky.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, otolaryngologists performing difficult sinus
surgeries had to inch a lighted tube called an endoscope to guide
them through the twisting sinus chambers. For guidance, the only
map was a CT scan, which the surgeon could glance at while trying
to navigate by feel, through the the walnut-size cavity above the
eye, near the olfactory bulb, the optic nerve and the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Metson is aided by a machine called the Stealth Station,
which follows a map of a patient's sinus much the way Global
Positioning Systems guide a cruise missile to its target. The
Stealth Station is one of several such machines in use around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes surgeons feel so much better,'' said Metson, who is
45. ``Before this, you couldn't ever be really sure. You didn't
always know where you were going.''
</P>
<P>
   For endoscopic sinus surgery, more than 70 Stealth Stations
systems operate around the United States; the Massachusetts Eye and
Ear Infirmary here was among the first to use them. The machine,
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1996, allows
surgeons to take standard CT scans and transform them into
three-dimensional images. It was first developed for use in
neurosurgery.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor atop the Stealth Station, a dishwasher-size box,
shows the CT scans of James Reardon, a retired pile worker from
Billerica, Mass., as well as a computer image of his face. On the
scans, the sinuses are clearly outlined, and Metson's surgical
probes are represented by red cross hairs. Reardon's head is held
in place by a curved headset outfitted with light-emitting diodes,
or LEDs, that transmit infrared rays that are captured by small
cameras in a bar above the operating table.
</P>
<P>
   Metson's instruments, too, are outfitted with LEDs. The Stealth
Station tracks the placement of Metson's instruments with an
.87-millimeter margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   A second monitor carries a magnified image transmitted by a tiny
camera inside the instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my kids I'm in here playing Nintendo all day,'' Metson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The product, developed by Sofamor Danek, a company in Memphis,
Tenn., is now sold by Xomed Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., under the
name of LandmarX. It costs $160,000, and requires extensive
training for surgeons already well versed in the use of endoscopes.
But it can help offset the likelihood of complications in the most
difficult cases. A similar machine, called the Insta-Trak, made by
Visualization Technology Inc. in Wilmington, Mass., uses
electromagnetic transmitters to track the surgeon's devices. It is
in use in 125 hospitals nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Reardon is among the 20 percent of cases serious enough to
require surgery, and his history, which includes two failed
procedures, made him a particularly good candidate for using the
new technology, Metson said.
</P>
<P>
   He is among 37 million Americans who suffer from chronic
sinusitis, an inflammation or infection, which has become the
nation's most common long-term disease. Defined roughly as having
three or more sinus infections a year, chronic sinusitis costs the
nation an estimated $2.4 billion a year in surgeries, office visits
and medicines. In 1992, the National Center for Health Statistics
showed that Americans missed 73 million workdays to sinusitis from
1990 to 1992, up from 50 million in 1986-1988.
</P>
<P>
   Intangible costs are just as great. A 1994 study showed that
those with chronic sinusitis reported more pain, depression and
fatigue in their lives than did patients with angina, chronic heart
failure and back pain. ``It's an epidemic with enormous impact in
this country,'' said Metson, who studies the subject extensively.
</P>
<P>
   Like clusters of grapes, the sinuses surround the carotid
arteries, as well as the optic and olfactory nerves. They are
separated from the brain by a fragile bone called the lamina
paprycia, thin enough to see through.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the sinuses is not fully understood. Experts
dispute whether they exist to equalize barometric pressure,
regulate air temperature going into the lungs, or whether they
simply evolved when humans began walking upright and needed a
lighter head. When they function normally, the cilia of the sinus
trap pollen, dust, viruses and bacteria and flush them out through
the back of the throat to the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   But when the sinuses are infected, they can cause problems.
Bacteria from the sinuses can spread to the lungs, eardrums and
even the brain. Meanwhile, pollution and allergies contribute to
the rising number of sinusitis cases. At the same time, diagnostic
tools like CT scans and endoscopes also make identifying the
disease easier.
</P>
<P>
   Medical treatment for chronic sinusitis includes antibiotics,
decongestants, antihistamines to control allergy symptoms and nasal
steroid sprays. In extreme cases, patients use oral prednisone.
</P>
<P>
   Until the advent of endoscopes, the only way to clear diseased
tissue surgically or create better drainage for the frontal sinuses
was to make external incisions just below the eyebrow. To operate
on the maxillary sinuses, which rest beneath the eyes and above the
teeth, surgeons had to make incisions in the gumline.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of the estimated 300,000 sinus surgeries performed
each year are done through the nostrils, with endoscopes. But many
are far from perfect: Some patients, like Reardon, must have
``revision'' surgery, to remove scar tissue left by earlier
procedures or extensive disease. Complications occur in about 6
percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of endoscopes and lasers, as well as improved
surgical tools, has revolutionized sinus surgery. But it is a field
in which new technology is sometimes viewed with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McNamara, 43, an otolaryngologist in Washington who is a
clinical professor of otolaryngology and neck surgery at Georgetown
University Medical Center, recalls his early days as a resident,
when he taped his patients' CT scans to an X-ray view box in the
operating room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me to just be common sense, but it wasn't
standard practice at the time,'' McNamara said. ``The old school
folks wondered what I was doing. The same thing happened when
monitors came in, to magnify that incredibly small space. I felt
better having better visualization. But a lot of them say they're
more comfortable by feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, McNamara uses the Insta-Trak system for extremely
difficult cases. ``But it is not below the standard of care to not
use them,'' he cautioned. ``You don't want to put capable people in
a position where if they don't use them, they're liable. These
machines are great, marrying computers with technology and allowing
the surgeons to know where they are. But you do have to be careful.
You don't want to have someone use this just because his hospital
has it. You want someone who's familiar with it.''

   SCI-TOILET-TRAINING (Undated) _ Toilet training is not rocket
science, says John Rosemond, a syndicated columnist and
best-selling author of parenting books. He considers it ``a slap to
the intelligence of a human being that one would allow him to
continue soiling and wetting himself past age 2.'' The process, he
says, should be as simple and straightforward as housebreaking a
four-month-old puppy. Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the noted
pediatrician, says there is more to it than that. Parents who force
toilet training, he says, can cause lasting problems. ``Don't rush
your toddler into toilet training or let anyone else tell you it's
time. It's got to be his choice,'' Brazelton advises in a
television commercial for Pampers ``Size 6'' diapers. What does he

puppies.'' Welcome to the newest round in the toilet training wars.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; Should drug companies use celebrities, like the Baltimore
Orioles' Cal Ripken, in advertisements for prescription drugs? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PRO: Until recently, pharmaceutical companies focused
advertising efforts on prescribing doctors, inundating them with
vast numbers of ``throw-away journals'' that invariably bypassed
their targets and ended up in the trash. More recently,
pharmaceutical companies have discovered that they achieve greater
success pitching products directly to the public. Recently, there
has been an explosion of several excellent drugs to treat
depression, migraine headaches, allergies, hypertension and stomach
disorders. In each class of these drugs, several more or less
equivalent versions have been introduced. The drugs are generally
safe and effective. Since the drugs are inherently good, there is
no reason celebrities should not be hired to promote a product,
since the intent is simply to raise market share. There is some
societal good in having celebrities pitch products because more
patients with hypertension or depression may present themselves for
treatments. Bringing more patients into the medical fold is
certainly good for my business.
</P>
<P>
   _DR. DARYL M. ISAACS, Internist, New York University Medical
Center and Beth Israel Hospital
</P>
<P>
   CON: Celebrity endorsements are effective because we begin to
believe that the product embodies whatever it is we admire most
about the celebrity. After all, Who doesn't want to be like Mike?
These products are drugs, not shoes or jockey shorts. In addition
to their benefits, They may carry a variety of side effects and
risks, especially if used improperly. It is misleading to feature a
famous person as a picture of health and attribute that to the
benefit of a drug, suggesting that a little pill could create those
qualities. To use celebrities to endorse products they do not use
is unethical. As my patients' advocate, I am offended for those who
do suffer from such conditions. However, neither do I see anything
redeeming in an advertisement that features a celebrity who uses a
pharmaceutical. To classify a particular person's benefit from a
drug just because he is famous is misleading. Treatment choices
should be made individually between a physician and a patient.
There are plenty of other products besides drugs to keep
celebrities in the money.

   &UR; BEHAVIOR: Following the Trail of Adolescent Angst &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers, traditional wisdom holds, are sullen, prickly
creatures, prone to mood swings and sudden outbursts of temper. But
new research suggests that for some adolescents depression _ in
particular, symptoms like lack of enjoyment in everyday activities
or frequent thoughts about death _ signals an increased risk of
serious depression in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 776 adolescents followed over a period of nine
years, researchers at the New York Psychiatric Institute found that
teen-agers who exhibited ``subclinical'' depressive symptoms _ that
is, symptoms not severe enough to warrant a psychiatric diagnosis _
were two to three times as likely to suffer episodes of major
depression in young adulthood. In particular, the symptoms of
anhedonia, or the inability to experience enjoyment, and thoughts
about death were associated with a higher risk of adult depression.
``If you're an adult with a psychiatric problem, there's a good
chance that your problem started in some form when you were a
kid,'' said Dr. Daniel Pine, an assistant professor of clinical
psychiatry who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects in the study, which appears in this month's
American Journal of Psychiatry, were interviewed in 1983, when they
were between 9 and 18, and again in 1985 and 1992. In 1983 and
1985, parents were also interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies demonstrated that teen-agers whose symptoms were
severe enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression
were more likely to suffer from depression as adults. But the
researchers wanted to find out if ``subthreshold depression'' _
what many parents might dismiss as normal moodiness _ also could
predict later illness.
</P>
<P>
   Not every teen-ager with depressive symptoms went on to develop
major depression, Pine said. But parents should consider seeking
professional advice, he said, if the symptoms are severe enough to
cause the teen-ager distress, or trigger problems in school or
social relationships. For example, chronic feelings of guilt,
changes in sleep or appetite, fatigue, poor concentration,
prolonged sadness, or a loss of interest in activities that were
once enjoyable, can all be symptoms of depression, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSCLES GROUPS: Stretches Make the Arms Grow Stronger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A recent study indicates that adding stretching to a
weight-training routine may actually improve strength, in addition
to increasing flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by Dr. Wayne Westcott, director of fitness
research at the South Shore YMCA in Braintree, Mass., followed 53
participants in a 10-week strength-training program. Each subject
worked out on 13 standard weight-training machines. After each
exercise, one group stretched the muscles just used before moving
to the next machine. A second group moved from machine to machine,
then followed with a separate session of six stretching exercises.
The third group did no flexibility exercises.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 weeks, all participants became more flexible and
stronger. What surprised the researchers was that the subjects who
stretched also showed marked increases in strength _ 37 percent and
54 percent differences compared with 29 percent. The most
significant gains were exhibited by the group that stretched after
completing the strength-training circuit. Westcott said he believed
this group benefited from the one-on-one stretching instruction
they received. While the other groups had an instructor present for
the initial run-through, subsequent sessions were not closely
supervised. ``Just the presence of an instructor motivates the
subject to work harder at an exercise,'' he said. The next step, he
added, will be to replicate the study without that variable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody pays lip service to stretching,'' Westcott said,
``but for most exercisers, myself included, stretching is the first
thing to go.'' While he cautions against reading too much into one
small study, Westcott is no longer cavalier about making stretching
a part of his own routine.

<P>
   Women in medicine have made phenomenal strides over the past 30
years. They are everywhere, in every specialty, and they account
for half of all medical students; women even play doctors on
television _ with their trusty husky male nurses, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the progress, female physicians still suffer from
what might be called stipendicitis: an acute failure of the wallet
to perform as expected. According to the latest Physician
Compensation and Production survey, the average incomes of female
doctors continue to lag behind those of their male counterparts,
not just by a few thousand dollars, but by tens of thousands, and
in some specialties by more than $100,000 a year. And, as the above
chart, published in Physicians Weekly, demonstrates, the gap lately
has widened for a number of specialties, rather than diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is an annual polling of the membership of the Medical
Group Management Association, the nation's largest organization of
doctors who work in group practices. It gathered responses from
group practices representing 36,000 physicians, about 5 percent of
the nation's total _ a respectable sampling by survey standards.
The doctors reported their total compensation for the year,
including bonuses and honoraria, how many patients they had seen,
the total amount they had billed patients and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, doctors' salaries appear to be remaining fairly flat,
with swells and troughs depending on specialty and region. Heart
surgeons are in great demand, and so ``cardiology (invasive)'' is
one of the most lucrative of all specialties, although for unknown
reasons their average compensation fell 8 percent in the last year
to $326,527. By contrast, urologists' salaries climbed an average
of 3.65 percent, to $230,339, itself a 4.12 increase from the year
before, buoyed, no doubt, by increased concern about the prostate
gland, and their ability to write Viagra prescriptions. Cities like
New York, Boston and Los Angeles are so glutted with the medically
pedigreed that median salaries of doctors on either coast are
considerably lower than those of practitioners in the South and
Midwest. And for female healers everywhere, their incomes have a
particularly saddle-shaped sag to them.
</P>
<P>
   There is no single or simple explanation for why women's average
compensation is uniformly so much less than the men's. Some of the
disparity is a result of statistical skewing, arising because for
many specialties the number of male practitioners far exceeds the
number of women. For example, in the category of invasive
cardiology, 513 men were included in the survey but just 26 women.
Even in a specialty like family practice, which has attracted many
women to its fold, the survey represents results from 2,914 males
but only 581 females.
</P>
<P>
   One big reason for the difference is patient volume. Most of a
doctor's income is based on the number of patients seen, and male
doctors generally see more patients per year than female doctors
do. Among noninvasive cardiologists, for example, the men reported
seeing an average of 1,645 patients; the women, 1,356. Yet patient
load alone cannot account for the salary gap. If the average
cardiologist's income is divided by the average patient volume, the
men end up earning $163 per case to the women's $144. In
obstetrics/gynecology, the men average $76 a patient, the women
$68.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this discrepancy the fact that female physicians usually
spend comparatively more time with each patient. One study found
that male physicians managed to dispense with the majority of their
patients in less than 11 minutes each, while female doctors could
manage such celerity with only a third of their case load. The
result? The women earn less for more.
</P>
<P>
   What the survey data do not reveal is whether the men have more
experience and seniority than the women, and thus are able to
charge more for their skills. Nor does the poll say whether men
earn relatively more because they are more likely to be
moonlighting as, say, high-paid biotechnology consultants or guest
speakers at pharmaceutical meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widening of pay gaps in many disciplines between
last year and this, researchers at Cejka and Co., the health care
consulting firm that sponsors the annual survey, said that the
apparent retrograde trend is probably spurious.
</P>
<P>
   They predict that women will soon return to the business of
catching up, particularly as more women enter the most lucrative
surgical specialties. Here is one suggestion: Women, follow the men
_ patients, that is. With all those male baby boomers on the brink
of prostate consciousness, the future of urology looks swell.

KEEPING HARMONY IN THE MARRIAGE OF CELLS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Wash., Pa.)   (af) 
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In mythology, fire-breathing monsters with lions' heads, goats'
bodies and serpents' tails are well-known chimeras.
</P>
<P>
   In humans, chimeras form when cells from two people live side by
side in one person, during and after such diverse events as
pregnancy, organ transplantation and blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   Now the effects of chimerism are attracting new notice, both for
their benefits and their problems. New findings are beginning to
explain how the body's reaction to alien tissue can enhance
survival of donor grafts after transplantation surgery yet give
rise to some disorders not only during pregnancy but many years
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new approach to human disease,'' Dr. Selim Aractingi in
Paris said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Aractingi's team at the Tenon Hospital may have solved a mystery
of why many women itch from a rash in the last weeks of pregnancy.
The rash apparently is caused by fetal cells that escape from the
mother's womb and lodge in the skin, Aractingi's team reported on
Dec. 12 in Lancet, a journal published in London. It is the newest
evidence of chimerism's role in human disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dr. J. Lee Nelson and her colleagues at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle reported the first
evidence linking cells that escaped from a fetus into the mother's
bloodstream to development of a disease in the mother years after
pregnancy. The disease, known as scleroderma, affects the skin and
other organs. It is an autoimmune disorder in which the body
mysteriously attacks its own healthy tissues. The condition strikes
women four times as often as men.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sergio A. Jimenez's team at Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia has extended the findings.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1992, Dr. Thomas E. Starzl's team at the University of
Pittsburgh showed that, in patients with transplanted organs, cells
that escaped from donor tissue migrated to the skin and persisted
up to 29 years after transplantation. The traffic is two way: The
patient's own cells migrate to the transplanted organs where they
continue to exist with donors cells. At the same time, donor cells
move into the recipient's tissues.
</P>
<P>
   The rash that the French team studied tends to develop over the
arms, abdomen, thighs and buttocks in about 1 percent of pregnant
women. The skin eruption usually comes on after the 34th week of
pregnancy and is transient, generally fading after the baby is
delivered. The rash can recur in subsequent pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The rash varies in severity but usually requires little
treatment: Steroid ointment for women with intense itching, and
awaiting delivery for those with a milder form.
</P>
<P>
   The rash goes by many names, usually long ones that describe
nothing more than itching and the type of rash. So doctors use
acronyms. The two most common are: PEP (for polymorphic eruptions
of pregnancy) and PUPPP (for pruritic urticaria papules and plaques
of pregnancy).
</P>
<P>
   Aractingi, a dermatologist, studied tiny pieces of skin taken
from two groups of pregnant women. One group consisted of 10 women
with the rash who were bearing male fetuses. The other group served
as a scientific control and was made up of 26 women without the
condition. Half of the women without the rash were carrying male
fetuses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Although the rash occurs in women bearing fetuses of both
genders, the French team chose to study only those bearing male
fetuses because it was easier to detect the DNA in the Y male
chromosome in laboratory tests.
</P>
<P>
   The French team found the male DNA in 6 of the 10 women with the
rash, but in none of the 26 women without the ailment. The
technique used may not have been perfected enough to detect the
cells in the remaining 4, the French scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Aractingi said his study of the fetal-cell link in the rash of
pregnancy began about three years ago before he knew of Dr.
Nelson's study. But the French study was slowed by ``disappointing
technical difficulties,'' Aractingi said.
</P>
<P>
   Aractingi said his team's next step was to try to identify the
type of fetal cell that lodges in the skin to determine how the
cell causes the itchy skin reaction. Identification is needed
because different cells presumably cause different kinds of
reactions in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the rash was thought to have little medical
importance. But in light of Dr. Nelson's findings in Seattle,
Aractingi's report raises intriguing questions about the long-term
significance of the rash. Do such chimerisms go awry to cause an
auto-immune disorder later in life? The answers might someday shed
light on this and other common ailments of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Aractingi also said that he intended to follow the women in the
study over time to determine whether nothing happens or whether
they develop auto-immune disorders.
</P>
<P>
   If such a long-term link is established, then scientists may
need to develop tests to identify people at risk for the long-term
hazards if chimerism goes awry. If so, scientists would aim to
develop immunizations and other therapies designed to stop
development of a disease in an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have likened pregnancy to transplantation because the
mother's body does not reject the fetus even though it is, in
effect, foreign tissue. Starzl and other transplant researchers
have learned a lot about chimerism from human and animal
transplants. Dr. Nelson said that she believed that transplantation
was directly linked to the immune system's role in pregnancy. That
role allows the mother's body to live in a chimeric condition.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson said she and other scientists were looking at four
sources of chimeric cells that might be factors in human diseases.
Two involve transfer of fetal cells to the mother and maternal
cells to the fetus. A third is from one twin to another. And a
fourth is from blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   Starzl said he now considers chimerism a prerequisite for
long-term organ acceptance. The transplant operation not only
replaces organ function but introduces a small piece of the donor's
immune system into the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, immunosuppressive drugs are required to control the
two-way traffic of cells and then allow donor and recipient cells
to coexist peacefully. Chimerism explains why some transplant
recipients can stop taking immunosuppressive drugs without
rejecting an organ, Starzl said.
</P>
<P>
   Groups elsewhere are experimenting with other forms of chimerism
in heart transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Starzl and Dr. Rolf M. Zinkernagel of the University of Zurich
in Switzerland reported in The New England Journal of Medicine last
month that the mechanisms by which certain microbes are able to
exist in humans closely resembles the chimerism that confers
permanent acceptance of a transplanted organ. The fate of the
microbes and the donor organ is largely determined by where the
cells migrate in the body, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   To direct further research in chimerism, Aractingi is organizing
a meeting in Paris in September. It would be one of the rare
meetings of scientists interested in the wide range of chimerism.

MULGREW LOOKS BEYOND `VOYAGER'

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Like her character, Capt. Kathryn Janeway,
Kate Mulgrew wants to go home.
</P>
<P>
   For Janeway, captain of the Starship U.S.S. Voyager on the UPN
series ``Star Trek: Voyager,'' home is planet Earth. For 4 1/2
years, Janeway and her crew have roamed the Delta Quadrant in
search of a wormhole or some other route home.
</P>
<P>
   For Mulgrew, single mother of two, home is freedom from 80-hour
workweeks and shoots that can go on until 3 a.m. It's obtaining
some sort of sensible life with her teen-age sons. Ian, 14, and
Alexander, 13, resent that their mother is never around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a mother, and they got a celebrity,'' Mulgrew told
an intimate gathering of TV reporters in a brief but unusually
candid chat here. ``They need milk and cookies, and they got a
housekeeper. There's just no question they'd like me to walk out
and never look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had no choice. First of all, I needed this job. My
career was not going well. I wanted it. I was determined to do well
by it and with it. And they, too, initially, loved it. But to have
their mother summarily lifted from the house as if by a spaceship.
...''
</P>
<P>
   One way Ian expresses his displeasure is by not watching the
show. Alexander will only watch now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business of being in the vanguard of the woman in the
'90s is very interesting,'' she said. ``I will write about this.
... I want a few months, even if they're not in the house, to be
able to cook them dinner and have them just walk in the room and
know that I'm there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I want this man that I'm in love with. And I'm going to
have him.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, Tom Hagen, lives in Cleveland and has children of his
own, two girls, 11 and 9. Mulgrew, whose marriage to Robert Egan
ended 5 1/2 years ago, said she hopes to marry this summer, maybe
in June, ``but it's crucial that the four kids approve. It's a
delicate situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulgrew's presence here, as part of UPN's winter session with
the TV press, was necessarily brief _ she was due back on the
Paramount set for more ``Voyager'' work. Despite her protests,
Mulgrew is committed to ``Voyager'' for another season after this
one, and ``probably'' will do one more after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dedicated to Janeway from the get-go,'' she said,
``but I didn't think I'd love her this much. I love this
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming is a two-parter, shot mostly in black and white, in
which Janeway is swept back to the 1930s and deals directly with
Lt. Tom Paris' ``holonovel'' character, the evil Dr. Chaotica.
She'll play the novel's powerful Queen Arachnea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Janeway, but she's the height of restraint and
dignity,'' she said. ``In this, I'm a complete vamp. The whole
thing is so extravagant, so outre and so funny. I was amazed they
allowed me to play it. It's a delicious departure for me because I
don't usually get to play parts like that. And it was so needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no end to the series is in sight, she can envision
``one season devoted to (the Voyager crew) reaching home and the
provocative things that develop.`` When the series finally wraps _
or Mulgrew's participation in it _ she'll shoot for old stomping
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been well-suited to this town,'' she said, ``and
it's high time I started to behave according to my soul. I'm going
back to the city that I love, which is New York, and leaving the
city that I have never trusted. I've made a good living and all
that; this is not a complaint. But I've never really trusted this
place.''
</P>
<P>
   She'd love to do more theater work _ Chekov, Shakespeare,
Friels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to play Lady Macbeth or Medea,'' she said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like giant feathers slowing rising on the winds to
impossible heights, large gossamer wings made of wispy plastics and
light composite materials are flying at altitudes where few
airplanes have soared.
</P>
<P>
   Following a recent round of successful test flights, engineers
are modifying an unmanned flying wing called Centurion for an
attempt at becoming the first aircraft to achieve sustained level
flight at 100,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Centurion is the latest in a line of solar-powered flying wings
that have steadily pushed up altitude records for remote-controlled
and propeller-driven aircraft. Last August, a predecessor aircraft
named Pathfinder-Plus, using sunlight to generate power for its
electric engines, set an unofficial world altitude record for
propeller planes of 80,201 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of these studies is to build a fleet of relatively
inexpensive drone aircraft that can routinely operate at these
extreme altitudes for scientific and commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Centurion and similar drones are part of a program sponsored by
NASA to develop remotely piloted aircraft that can loiter at the
edge of the atmosphere, far above normal air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made an enormous amount of progress in a relatively
short period of time,'' said Jeffrey Bauer, deputy manager for
NASA's Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology
Program. ``We have identified the technologies that are needed and
now have to figure out how to make them work together, but we don't
see any large showstoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several aircraft sponsored by the ERAST program, which was
established in 1994 and has an annual budget of about $20 million,
each had a successful series of test flights last year, including
the Centurion. ``We are close to making the transition from test
vehicles to vehicles that are ready for scientific and commercial
applications,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope that solar-powered versions of Centurion and its
successors will revolutionize studies of the upper atmosphere, a
crucial but difficult-to-sample region important to climate change.
</P>
<P>
   There, at altitudes from 12 to 20 miles above the Earth,
engineers envision aircraft that eventually will be able to stay
aloft for days or weeks at a time, performing jobs previously
relegated to space satellites, but cheaper and better. Such planes
could serve as communications outposts in the sky, relaying
telephone or pager signals, or follow hurricanes and other adverse
weather systems, constantly monitoring their progress and studying
their behavior, as well as performing surveillance, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   These aircraft, carrying a new generation of miniature sensors
and scientific instruments, would be able to linger in the lower
regions of the stratosphere studying chemical interactions many
scientists believe are damaging the Earth's protective ozone layer.
And scientists say flying such planes over the planet's poles could
provide valuable insight into the seasonal ozone holes that appear
each year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, such craft could help monitor and measure carbon
dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases accumulating in the
atmosphere that some scientists believe are contributing to global
warming and possible climate changes.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the wide range of potential jobs for high-altitude
robot craft, NASA is looking at developing a range of aircraft,
including more conventional designs than solar wings. Last summer,
Aurora Flight Sciences of Manassas, Va., conducted four successful
flights under the ERAST program with its Perseus B, a drone powered
by a turbocharged piston engine turning a propeller attached to the
plane's tail.
</P>
<P>
   The Perseus B, essentially a 2,200-pound powered glider with a
conventional wing-and-tail configuration, reached 60,000 feet with
a 180 pound payload, said Aurora president John Langford. In tests
planned for this summer, Aurora hopes to increase the plane's
endurance at this altitude to eight hours, and reach 24 hours or
more the following year. ``At that point, we can go into production
and offer leased flight services to the scientific market,
including universities, national laboratories and others,''
Langford said.
</P>
<P>
   Current methods of doing studies in the upper atmosphere have
severe drawbacks. Satellites can peer into this region with remote
instruments, but they orbit too high to do direct air sampling.
High-flying aircraft, such as the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes, can
operate at 70,000 feet or more, but they can only stay at these
altitudes for a few hours and are very expensive to operate. In
addition, some spy planes fly so fast that they disturb the air,
which interferes with direct sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Balloons have been a mainstay of high-altitude studies for
decades, but they can leak gases that pollute air samples and are
notoriously hard to control, as has been evident in recent years by
the many failed attempts by balloonists to circle the globe.
</P>
<P>
   These shortcomings call for new methods to study the upper
atmosphere and some scientists and engineers see slow-speed,
long-duration robot aircraft as the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Centurion has drawn a great deal of attention because a
solar-powered craft like this has the potential of becoming the
long-desired ``eternal airplane'' which seldomly has to land. And
Centurion is a steppingstone to an operational craft called Helios
that would be essentially an airborne satellite, according to its
builder, AeroVironment Inc., of Monrovia, Calif., a company that
specializes in electric-powered vehicles.
</P>

   Centurion is a giant, superlight wing with no tail that evolved
from smaller models AeroVironment started building 15 years ago. In
the early 1980s, the company got a secret government contract to
build a pilotless, solar-powered, propeller-driven craft that could
stay at high altitudes for weeks at a time. AeroVironment built a
prototype, called Pathfinder, which made nine, battery-powered
flights in the summer of 1983 before the project was canceled when
it failed to meet specifications.

HELLBENT RIDE USHERS IN A NEW PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Adirondack Mountains were cold, sullen, and
drizzly on that Friday the 13th in September 1901. It was the
middle of three such days that left the ground soaked, trails slick
and visibility measured in feet and fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   A thick mist drifted around Col. Theodore Roosevelt and his
guide, Noah LaCasse, who were resting briefly along the shore of
Lake Tear of the Clouds. It was there at 1:25 p.m., while leaning
against a rock and sharing a tin of ox tongue with his guide, that
the vice president saw a man loping up the trail toward them.
``That's Harrison Hall, isn't it?'' Roosevelt asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is,'' responded the guide.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months into a new century, the number of people in a vice
president's world was small enough that the recognition of a casual
acquaintance like Hall would not have been considered unusual. Just
as when Roosevelt, exactly a day later, stepped down from a
carriage in Buffalo into a huge, milling crowd anxiously awaiting
his arrival and called out by name a policeman he had met on a
previous trip.
</P>
<P>
   The message that the panting, 53-year-old Hall ran nine miles to
deliver was indeed a fateful one ... for Roosevelt and for the
nation. Arguably, the message _ that President William McKinley
would not survive an assassin's bullet after all _ set in motion
the modern American presidency and rushed the nation headlong into
the 20th century, whether or not its citizens were ready.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt certainly wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Theodore Roosevelt is placed among the handful of
our greatest presidents, he grew into the role and brought the
nation along with him.
</P>
<P>
   For all his achievements in conservation, regulating railroads,
refereeing big business and big labor, and giving working Americans
the ``square deal,'' historians give Roosevelt the highest marks
for bringing the power and prestige of the presidency up to today's
stature and expectation.
</P>
<P>
   At first Roosevelt could not imagine becoming president in such
a manner. But by the time he took the oath of office in Buffalo
before federal Judge John R. Hazel, he characteristically accepted
the situation as it was, then embraced its possibilities with all
the bristling vigor and dash that was his personal stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The note Hall gave Teddy was from William Loeb, Roosevelt's
secretary, who had remained in Albany to monitor McKinley's
condition by phone. He relayed the news to the last telephone on
the line closest to Roosevelt, at the Lower Tahawus Club. The news
itself was a shock, because McKinley's surgeon, Dr. Charles Burney,
had been persuasive the president was out of danger.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, on Sept. 6, as the opening strains of a Bach
cantata sounded at Buffalo's Temple of Music, the president,
standing at the head of a reception line at the opening of the
Pan-American Exposition, had been shot twice at point-blank range
by a self-described anarchist, Leon Czolgosz. An utterly bored and
politically trivialized vice president had been lunching at Isle
LaMotte in Lake Champlain, a guest of the Vermont Fish and Game
League, when he received the horrifying news.
</P>
<P>
   He and Loeb set out immediately by train for Buffalo, where
Roosevelt spent two deeply uncomfortable days trying to be gray and
quiet in the background as Mrs. McKinley and family and friends
fretted over the president. Not easy for an ambitious, energetic
extrovert once described by a friend _ not a critic _ as compelled
to be at the center of every stage, the bride at every wedding, the
corpse at every funeral.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley and Roosevelt were not friends.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt thought the lawyer-farmer from Canton, Ohio, merely
politically ``clever.'' Roosevelt had been foisted on McKinley as a
running mate by New York Republican boss Thomas Platt, who in turn
was eager to get the reform-minded governor out of the state,
pronto. So Roosevelt was made vice president and perfectly
miserable. Yet when he took the message from Hall at Lake Tear,
Roosevelt looked away and, shaking his head, muttered,
``complicated, complicated. But I don't want to become president
through a graveyard. I would rather work for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Without saying another word Roosevelt packed the lunch away and
started briskly down the trail. By 5:30 p.m., they were at the
comfortable Upper Tahawus Club. The vice president changed his
soaked and muddy clothes, ate a light supper and awaited more
information before setting out for Buffalo. His wife wondered why
he didn't set out immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been there once,'' he explained. ``And that shows how I
feel. But I will not go to stand beside those people who are
suffering and anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Word did come, at about 11 p.m., that the president was failing
quickly, and Roosevelt set right out in a pitch black, dreadful
night for a hellbent ride to the presidency that is the stuff of
lore and legend. David Hunter, who was superintendent of the Lower
club, drove Roosevelt by buckboard the 10 miles from Upper to Lower
Tahawus, pulled by a 1,400-pound bay that had been skidding logs
all day. That took two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin Kellogg then drove the next leg with his team to a
roadhouse, hotel and coach stop known as Aiden Lair. The rain
picked up, and Roosevelt, with one small overnight bag in tow,
covered his legs with Kellogg's raincoat to keep off the
splattering mud. Along that stretch, about an hour before reaching
the Lair, Theodore Roosevelt, six weeks shy of his 43rd birthday,
became the 26th president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   McKinley had died in Buffalo at 2:15 a.m. on Sept. 14. Mike
Cronin, legendary proprietor of Aiden Lair, drove the last and most
spectacular leg of Roosevelt's 35-mile ride from Upper Tahawus to
North Creek, the end of the Delaware and Hudson rail line, where a
special train waited to whisk him down to Albany and then over to
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Lair had a phone, so Cronin knew McKinley was dead but said
nothing to Roosevelt. ``It wasn't my place to tell him. I didn't
want to burden the man,'' he would later say. Roosevelt didn't find
out until North Creek, when Loeb told him.
</P>
<P>
   Three days of rain had left the 16-mile dirt road from Aiden
Lair to North Creek a treacherous, soupy quagmire of wheel ruts and
slides. Yet Cronin had his ``fast-stepping'' span of black Morgans
running flat out, careening down the mountainside. Roosevelt
insisted. There was no Secret Service escort, no media pack, no
aides. Just the new president holding a kerosene lantern that cast
a light as far as the harnesses, and Cronin gritting his teeth and
praying. Pitch black and slick as a weasel the whole way, an
exercise in pure faith. The horses would stumble, and all Roosevelt
would say was, ``Keep up the pace. Faster.''
</P>
<P>
   They fortunately encountered no other traffic, which in the
total darkness could have been disastrous. Cronin covered the 16
miles in one hour and 41 minutes, a record with buckboard and team
that stands to this day. Cronin, the president, and well-lathered
Morgans Frank and Dick thundered over the planks of the bridge at
North Creek just as dawn was poking a rosy finger.
</P>
<P>
   The train, complete with aides and entourage, was anxiously
waiting and pulled out moments later. America and the 20th century
were waiting.

 WASHINGTON: meet specifications. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The program was revived in 1994 by the Defense Department and
declassified. The Pathfinder prototype reappeared after being
stored for a decade in a secret location, but the new project, to
build a long-duration surveillance plane, was canceled shortly
thereafter when it lost funding. NASA then took over the project
and used new technology to make a larger version of the craft,
called Pathfinder Plus.
</P>
<P>
   W. Ray Morgan, an AeroVironment vice president who directs its
Design and Development Center, said that when the early Pathfinder
program was declassified, the only facts that remained secret were
the name of the original sponsor and the craft's intended mission.
``We have entertained ourselves endlessly around here speculating
on who and what they were,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   The original Pathfinder had six engines and a wingspan of 98
feet, while Pathfinder Plus grew to eight engines and a 121-foot
wing. Centurion dwarfs both with 14 engines _ each of which turn a
twin-blade 79-inch propeller _ and a 206-foot wingspan, wider than
that of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. The wing of the craft measures 8
feet from front to rear, is only about 11.5 inches thick and rests
on four fairings or pods that contain its landing gear and
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft, which has an empty weight of only about 1,175
pounds, so far has cost about $7 million to design and build. It is
so light because it is fabricated from tough carbon fiber and
graphite epoxy composite materials, as well as the Kevlar fabric
used in bulletproof vests, Styrofoam, and a plastic film covering.
The wing is built in five segments; a 44-foot-long center section
is flanked by two panels on each side that individually measure
slightly over 40 feet. The outermost panels have a noticeable
10-degree upsweep to help lateral stability in flight and a slight
upward twist at the tips of the trailing edge.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said each wing section is so stable it can fly on its
own, allowing the plane to get bigger, while still remaining
controllable, by adding new sections. ``It's an airplane you can
buy by the yard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works like several aircraft flying in close formation, but
they happen to be structurally interconnected,'' Morgan added.
</P>
<P>
   The plane flies at only 17 to 21 miles per hour. With no rudder
or tail, it turns and banks by slowing down or speeding up
different motors on the outboard sections of the wing.
</P>
<P>
   Centurion successfully made its first three flights this past
November and December at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at
Edwards, Calif., but the craft flew on its backup lithium-sulfur
dioxide batteries and not solar power. Engineers said they did not
want to risk damaging the craft's delicate and expensive solar
power cells on these low-level early flights designed to test
stability, handling and load carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, AeroVironment only has enough of these special solar
cells to cover one of the plane's five sections. The
high-efficiency silicon cell arrays, which convert 19 percent of
the sun's rays striking them into electricity, cost about $1.8
million per section and the company needs another $7 million that
has yet to be funded to finish four more panels.
</P>
<P>
   Centurion was airborne a total of about three-and-a-half hours
on its maiden flights, only venturing a few hundred feet off the
ground to check the craft's handling and its extensive automatic
control system. On its final flight, it carried a 600 pound
simulated payload that was about half its empty weight. ``This
flight went a long way in showing that even though solar-powered
airplanes appear delicate and fragile, they really have the muscle
necessary to do big jobs,'' said John Del Frate, Dryden's project
manager for solar aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers plan to add another section to Centurion, giving it a
span of almost 250 feet, for the next series of flights this spring
or summer. Although these trials also will be battery-powered,
Morgan said this configuration should be able to reach the
100,000-foot goal when solar cells are installed, perhaps in
another two or three years, depending upon funding.
</P>
<P>
   There is a debate over whether a robot drone really needs to fly
as high as 100,000 feet to meet most scientific objectives because
operating this high penalizes the aircraft's performance. For every
additional 13,000 feet of altitude, air density drops in half and a
plane has to fly 40 percent faster to stay up, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Helios, the ultimate solar plane, is being designed to work
between 50,000 and 70,000 feet and stay there for weeks using solar
power by day and a rechargeable fuel cell system at night.
</P>
<P>
   However, Morgan said, a goal of Centurion is to operate at
100,000 feet because of a 1996 challenge from NASA administrator
Daniel Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldin felt that if we could operate at 100,000 feet, it would
prove that NASA could fly a plane in the thin Martian atmosphere
under similar conditions, which they want to do,'' he said.

SOME GRIST FROM THE CYBERMILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Let's begin this week with a few notes, a few newsy
tidbits and a few interesting Web sites:
</P>
<P>
   - Ever wonder why so many companies lend their names to things
like college football bowl games? A recent press release from
Insight in Tempe explained one reason: Web page hits. The press
release said hits (visits by computer users) to the computer
marketing company's Web site (www.insight.com) soared 917 percent
after the televised Insight.com Bowl in late December.
</P>
<P>
   - So you want a wireless telephone but can't make heads or tails
out of all those confusing ads on television? Here's an answer:
Wireless Dimension. It's a cool Web site operated by a company out
of Washington state. It allows users to compare wireless plans
available in their areas. The site has won rave reviews from the
likes of ``Fortune'' magazine and the ``San Jose Mercury News.''
</P>
<P>
   Check it out at wirelessdimension.com.
</P>
<P>
   - Jupiter Communications says nearly $40 billion worth of
transactions were expected to have been made online during 1998. A
study of that estimate and of who's doing the selling has lead
another company, Internet Valley Inc., to develop what it's calling
the ``iFactor.'' This rating supposedly indicates a particular
company's chances for doing well _ or poorly _ in future e-commerce
activities. Internet Valley is big on Microsoft, giving it a high
iFactor rating of 6.91. But IBM, which had high sales, was
nonetheless given a low iFactor rating of 0.336. Go figure. If you
feel like diving into this business, check out the Web site at
www.internetvalley.com/sales97.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Gotta love that e-mail &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The recent motion picture ``You've Got Mail'' makes you want to
run out and send somebody e-mail, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   So many people are doing just that these days, it might be a
good time to remind ourselves that some caution is warranted when
it comes to sending and receiving e-mail and when participating in
online chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some basic things to remember:
</P>
<P>
   - Assume everything you write in an e-mail or chat room will be
made public and can live forever on the Internet. So think twice
before calling somebody a name or before revealing personal
information about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   - Take everything you read in e-mails or in chat rooms with a
grain of salt, especially if the information is from someone you've
never heard from before. People often assume false identities while
online and often tell lies just to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   - Keep those screen name profiles to a bare minimum if you don't
want to attract unwanted e-mail or intrusions into your personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   - Think it would be fun to meet an online ``friend'' in real
life? NEVER do it alone. Always have someone with you. And NEVER do
it in a secluded spot. Arrange the meeting somewhere very public,
such as a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   - NEVER give out your home phone number, address or online
passwords to someone online, even if they claim to be important,
such as an online security officer for America Online or some other
service. (The obvious exception to this rule is if you go to a
commercial Web site and purchase something.)
</P>
<P>
   - Do not respond to nasty, hateful, pornographic or otherwise
unwanted e-mail. Doing so can lead to more electronic junk, not
less. If it's really bad or possibly illegal, don't hesitate to
send a copy to your Internet service provider or local law
enforcement agencies. Anything illegal in real life is illegal
online, too.
</P>
<P>
   - Parents should be aware of how much time their kids are
spending online each day (or night). More than a few hours can be
an indication of a problem. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
More MP3 news to use &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week's column on MP3, the relatively new file compression
format that allows near CD-quality music to zip around the
Internet, prompted several e-mails from interested readers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian wrote to tell us of yet another format, VQF, which he
claims is even better than MP3. I haven't had a chance to check VQF
out, but anyone who's interested is encouraged to check out
www.vqf.com.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, John dropped me an e-mail to tell me about the ``CD
Streamer'' by Superplanet. ``CD Streamer provides the `ripper' and
playback features similar to MP3,'' John wrote. ``It creates
compressed audio files in a proprietary format and the compression
seems about the same as MP3. Playback quality, at least on my 400
mHz Pentium II (what else?) is CD quality.'' Check it out at
www.superplanet.com.
</P>
<P>
   One reader asked whether it's possible to invest in the MP3
phenomenon. I'm sure there are several avenues to do so, but one of
the most obvious is to invest in Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.,
which makes and sells the palm-sized MP3 player called Rio. The
company's stock (NASDAQ ticker symbol: DIMD) has been trending
upward over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   A reader named William appeared to disagree with my belief that
most MP3 titles sounded pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may think there is little difference in quality between
formats,'' William wrote, ``but played on a high resolution stereo
system, the compression in MP3 is VERY apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Tian wrote in to tell us about a new MP3-related Web site that
went online as recently as Jan. 3. It's called ShoutCast. Find it
at www.shoutcast.com. The site uses WinAmp (one of the shareware
programs that can be used to play MP3 files on your PC) as a
transmitter/receiver for news and music over the Internet. Check it
out!
</P>
<P>
   Frank, a Macintosh user, wrote to say that he's had trouble
downloading MacAmp (the Mac equivalent to WinAmp). I'm at a loss to
explain his problem. Anybody out there know of anything special Mac
users need to do in order to obtain a copy of MacAmp? Let me know,
and I'll pass it on.
</P>
<P>
   I'm excited about the possibilities made possible by MP3. But,
apparently, not everyone else out in cyberland agrees. A recent
online survey, for example, asked people what event they thought
made the biggest impact on music during 1998. More than 50 percent
listed the death of Frank Sinatra. Less than 10 percent named the
advent of MP3. Oh well. &QL;

 &HT;    PARIS _ Of course, there was never any doubt that it was coming,
but it's still hard to believe that this is really 1999. It's been
out there, waiting for us, for a long time, but more like one of
those things that are always to be expected but never actually
happen.
 &HT;    The year 2000 is something else, the start of a new century, a
new millennium, full of questions, predictions, new decisions. But
1999 is supposed to mark an ending, a long closure that after all
turns out to be uncertain and indecisive.
 &HT;    In terms of world affairs, the 20th century was particularly
short, from 1914, when the 19th century's balance of power and
faith in progress broke down, to 1991 when the Soviet Union and the
reign of ideology collapsed.
 &HT;    It was also particularly monstrous, and yet the very disasters
man wreaked upon man and nature provoked measures to break a
pattern of human horror. The illusion of the 1920s that war could
simply be outlawed was gone, but so was the myth of war as glory,
the noblest calling.
 &HT;    The failure of communism left democracy as the political system
and the market as the economic system _ in both cases, the clearly
preferred concepts. But the new doesn't just slip into place when
the old systems are gone. What is coming instead out of confusion
and greed in the afflicted countries looks totally unforeseeable.
 &HT;    Even democracy, if validated by the end of dictatorships, has
lost self-confidence. There are debates about whether or not it is
still relevant, in fact, about whether there's any need to be
concerned about government.
 &HT;    In the United States, 37 percent of voters cast ballots in the
last national election, slightly more than one in three, though the
Clinton sex scandal had provided all the spectacular drama that
crowd-pullers could wish.
 &HT;    Europe found a way to organize itself to make its worst
traditional enmities obsolete. Now, 11 Western European countries
have pooled their currencies in a single new one, the Euro. It is
not really the first because gold once served as the common measure
of value; yet the Euro is a huge step toward continued integration.
The participating nations will surely be joined by most of the
holdouts in a few years.
 &HT;    The idea that economies can and should be managed, born of the
savage excesses and wild cyclical swings in the rise of capitalism,
has been challenged once more by proof of the market's superior
performance. But at the same time, the market's arbitrary cruelties
spawn new demands for constraining limits, for protection of
workers and the environment. There has to be balance.
 &HT;    There was a vast increase in poverty, primarily because there
was such a vast increase in the world's population. And yet, like
war, poverty no longer seemed inevitable, decreed by nature and to
be endured. It has become possible to provide adequate food for the
world's population and to eliminate famine. It takes human will and
agreement, which exist in some measure, although far from enough.
 &HT;    In terms of changes in the way large numbers of people live, the
20th century was as long as the previous 500 or even 1,000 years.
People fly to outer space. They communicate, with sound and image,
in total defiance of time and space. They can conserve food and
make themselves comfortable despite the climate. They suppress much
disease and swallow pills so that the biblical old age of
threescore and ten is far less than the ordinary life expectancy in
the developed world.
 &HT;    Technological advance has achieved the momentum of a chain
reaction. People adjust surprisingly quickly. Change always has
costs and drawbacks, but it is welcomed for the extraordinary
improvements in material welfare and even just in convenience.
Science is admired and encouraged for its own sake, not only for
love of knowledge but because there's every reason to think that
sooner or later, new discoveries will bring new benefits.
 &HT;    Yet, science no longer provides the reassurance it once did that
the future can only get better and better. It poses weighty new
moral and ethical questions, about the beginnings of life and the
certainty of death, which it cannot even presume to answer. The new
capacities it offers are in many ways also new burdens, new
challenges that nothing has prepared the existing societies to
confront.
 &HT;    With the arrival of 1999, it is now clear where this century has
been, lots to be ashamed of, some things to be quite proud of _ a
lesson and a preparation, one has to hope, for doing better. It did
show that no invention, no trick, no blind belief will solve the
problems people face. For that, it takes people of good heart and
good will.
 &HT;    That seems so obvious that it's odd it took until 1999 for the
century to define itself.

WHAT IS THE UNION'S STATE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton insists he will deliver his State
of the Union speech as scheduled before the Congress that is in hot
pursuit of him, despite the awkwardness of it all and the urging of
some Republicans and Democrats to duck the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   If he sticks to the present timetable, he will deliver the
annual address to a joint congressional session on Tuesday, Jan.
19, the day his defense team will begin presenting its case to the
Senate. His aides have said he will consider shifting the date a
few days but will not postpone it until after a trial of unknown
length has determined his fate.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has he gone for the suggestion that he submit his report in
writing, as presidents did until Woodrow Wilson broke the pattern
by appearing in person.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is right to stare down the legislative branch and
demonstrate to the public that although Congress has him on the
run, he hasn't gone into hiding. Such a performance would reinforce
his repeated efforts all last year to reassure voters that he
continues to conduct the nation's business despite his personal
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene will be politically tense for all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who deplores
Clinton's behavior but believes he has been unfairly hounded by
partisan investigations, said it would be ``almost schizophrenic''
for him to try to sell his agenda in the well of the Senate at this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, a Republican who has been an
unrelenting Clinton critic since he arrived in the Senate four
years ago, said it would ``create acrimony within the chamber.''
Presumably he really meant it would deepen present Senate acrimony,
since partisan divisions are already apparent over issues of
witnesses, standards for conviction and trial duration.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it will be another bizarre chapter in an extraordinarily
bizarre saga that burst upon the world one year ago, shortly before
Clinton gave last year's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody realized then the extent of the scandal. The president
was full of beans, promising popular programs to improve education,
protect Social Security and expand Medicare, the Peace Corps and
child care subsidies. The upshot was he so dominated the public
agenda that the Republicans looked clueless all year and got dubbed
the `'impeachment party'' for want of serious policy alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   But now the president is preparing to discuss his plans and
hopes for future legislative achievements before a co-equal branch
of government that is simultaneously debating whether he should
have a future at all.
</P>
<P>
   What he has going for him is that he will give the speech on
television, where the drama is likely to attract a huge audience.
He will reach beyond the Capitol chamber to millions of viewers,
among whom a sizable majority is already inclined to root for him,
if the polls are correct.
</P>
<P>
   The president's continuing popularity is his strongest resource
as his disgusting sexual behavior is paraded daily in the national
media. And that popularity is based in part on the perception of
him as a fighter, a president who works at his job and has the
interests of ordinary Americans at heart.
</P>
<P>
   He has been at great pains throughout this period to convince
folks that his personal debacle has not weakened the presidency
itself or his ability to function within it. This requires him to
juggle a two-track life, one in public that seems normal and one in
private that struggles to fend off disaster.
</P>
<P>
   He goes through the public motions of being president with
amazing agility, recently entertaining Ohio Sen. John Glenn and his
fellow astronauts, attending a birthday party, making an upbeat
speech about economic prosperity. After his visit, Glenn observed
that Clinton was so engaging and cheerful that if you didn't
already know something was wrong, you wouldn't know anything was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Being essentially shameless, Clinton is likely to pull off his
appearance before Congress with aplomb. It will have little impact
on the trial, which has its own momentum and internal politics. But
at least nearly half the chamber will be on his side during his
performance. The Democrats have little choice if they wish to
retain the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clinton's accusers be as devious as he is? Can they contain
their hostility long enough to look serious about national issues?
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could walk out in a demonstration of
self-defeating partisanship that would drive their negative poll
numbers further into the basement. They could sit on their hands at
every presidential proposal, betraying a stubborn unwillingness to
work with him. They could jeer and scowl and look petty before a
national audience.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could put up a good political front, as he does. They
could listen politely. And they could ponder the fact that if the
Senate does not convict him, as now expected, they will have to
deal with him for two more years whether they like it or not.

ROBERT SILVERS ISN'T REVEALING THE SECRET OF HIS PHOTOMOSAICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From a distance, the faces on the posters or magazine covers are
familiar _ Abraham Lincoln and Princess Di, Marilyn Monroe and
Mickey Mouse _ images that in themselves are scarcely worth a
second look.
</P>
<P>
   But come closer. Inch by inch, Abe and Di, Marilyn and Mickey
begin to blur, while hundreds of other tiny images come more
clearly into focus. One of Lincoln's eyes, it turns out, is not
part of a single image, but a collage of photos _ somber, bearded
Civil War officers, or Union troops posing for the camera, or
Lincoln himself at the battle front, in a stovepipe hat. A photo of
John Wilkes Booth lurks somewhere on the image, too. Marilyn's
face, meanwhile, is actually a computer-generated mosaic composed
of past Life covers, shrunk into tiny tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the new pop art form dubbed photomosaics by its young
creator, MIT grad Robert Silvers, a form that has become almost
Warholian in its popularity. Silvers' Lincoln poster is the biggest
seller in the history of the Library of Congress gift shop, for
example. In the past four years, photomosaics have appeared on the
covers of Newsweek (Princess Di); Life (Marilyn); Playboy (Marilyn
again); and Sports Illustrated (Tiger Woods). Bill Gates received a
Silvers portrait as a birthday present. Al Gore has one on order.
Throw in two coffee-table books, music videos, posters, puzzles and
cereal boxes, and there's suddenly the makings of a pop art empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an aesthetic riddle,'' Michael Naumann, publisher of a
Silvers coffee-table book, said of the art form in Newsweek. ``It
asks two questions simultaneously: What is it, and how is it
done?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' Silvers says of his unlikely stardom. In
addition to his work, Silvers' Web site (www.photomosaic.com) now
depicts the young techno-artist hobnobbing with Playboy models and
Vice President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not the sort of popular renown expected for a guy
who once planned on the more cloistered existence of a corporate
computer programmer. But then Silvers, 30, who developed
photomosaics as a graduate student in MIT's media lab, has always
stood a bit apart from the techno-geek crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Plymouth, Mass., he is the son of a salesman and
therapist, neither of whom are technologically adept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got my mother an iMac,'' Silvers says. ``She has a hard
time doing the simplest things. Like copying a file. Same with my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   And from early childhood, computers were just one of two abiding
passions. Photography was the other. As a boy, Silvers says, he was
constantly seeking photo subjects, making shot after shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my father asking why I was wasting so much film,''
Silvers says.
</P>
<P>
   An ironic question, as it turns out. At the University of
Massachusetts, Silvers decided to keep photography as a hobby, but
pursue computer programming for a living. Then, while he was still
an undergraduate in 1991, an artist and scientist named Ken
Knowlton introduced Silvers to the concept that would eventually
allow a blending of his twin passions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a portrait (Knowlton) did of a man using seashells,''
Silvers says. ``He literally picked them off the beach and rotated
them and arranged them to look like a portrait. Up close you could
see only the shells and far away only the face. I became fascinated
with the image on two different levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowlton never divulged his method. But for Silvers, the idea
had taken root. At MIT four years later, while pondering ideas for
a class project and a master's thesis, Silvers returned to
Knowlton's premise, but replaced seashells with photographs. He
designed the photomosaic software over one sleepless weekend, then
in a single computer stroke produced the image of a friend from an
unrelated photo collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a chill,'' Silvers remembers. ``It was what I had
envisioned. It proved to me that I was going to be able to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvers refined the software during the rest of his time at MIT.
But his novel images found a broad audience even before he received
his master's degree in media arts and sciences. Early on, the media
lab newsletter published a photomosaic of a former MIT president.
Editors at Wired magazine saw the newsletter, and requested a cover
of their own, which caught the eye of editors at Life.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, both Silvers' art and his story have been
featured in a growing list of national publications and network
television shows: The tale of unlikely stardom, and of the
compelling marriage between technology and art.
</P>
<P>
   Silvers described his methods in a recent interview, using as an
example his recent Newsweek cover of Princess Diana, a mosaic
composed of floral photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Once he selected the image of Diana, Silvers turned to a more
daunting task, finding the photos to make up the individual mosaic
tiles. From a photo collection of 60,000 images, Silvers manually
culled 7,000, trimming each so that flowers filled each image. The
photos were scanned into his computer, and put to work by Silvers'
software program.
</P>
<P>
   Every individual photograph was considered electronically for
every spot on the face of Diana, which was also divided by computer
into a tightly gridded matrix. The computer sought the best
solution for each tile in terms of brightness, color and shape. In
the end, 900 images made up Diana's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then, when that's done, I may run the whole process over
again several times with different parameters,'' Silvers says.
``Finally I go over it by hand. Any tiles that look objectionable
to me, either close up or at a distance, I can replace with an
alternative. I designed the software to make certain decisions for
me, but to leave the rest of the decisions for me to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly spend a lot of time working on what I consider the
most important features of a person, which is their eyes,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Silvers now receives far more requests for mosaics than he and
his small company, Runaway Technologies, could ever entertain. But
he has found the time for a portrait of King Hussein of Jordan, a
present from his wife, Queen Noor. Silvers' portrait of actor Jim
Carrey adorned the publicity poster for ``The Truman Show.''
Silvers' rendering of the famous Marilyn Monroe nude was also on
display on last month's cover of Playboy's 45th-anniversary
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Each mosaic runs about $75,000, give or take, Silvers says. He
now drives a Humvee with bulletproof glass and night vision
capability, and can indulge himself when it comes to photo
equipment. He has filed for patents to discourage potential
imitators and has shown a knack for marketing. But despite the
Warholian popularity, Silvers says he disdains Warholian glamour.
He has lived in the same home for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't supposed to be a big commercial business, and I'm
not going to license everything I can,'' Silvers says. ``I'm not
going to crank out images as fast as possible, because I want it to
be done by me, as art.''

<P>
   Statistics show that falls among older adults _ often the cause
of serious injury _ can be prevented in many cases with a program
of exercises specifically geared toward improving balance and
posture.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Geriatric Society reports that
one-third of people over 65 fall at least once a year, many of them
incurring injuries like broken hips that may never properly mend.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that age-related falls are caused in part
by a reduced sense of balance and a loss of ability to judge body
placement. Aging causes a loss of sensitivity in special receptor
cells, called proprioceptors _ found in the skin, muscles, joints
and tendons _ that process information about the body's orientation
as it moves through space. As the sensitivity of these cells
diminishes with age, they provide the brain with less of the
sensory information it needs to maintain balance. Slower reflexes
and decreased muscle strength, combined with loss of eyesight and
depth perception, also contribute to a diminished sense of
equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   But there is evidence that older adults can reduce or reverse
some of these effects by including in their fitness regimen
exercises geared toward improving balance, and, as a result, become
less accident-prone. A 1996 study performed at the Department of
Neurology at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine in
Hartford looked at 110 elderly men and women. After three months of
regularly performing movements aimed at sharpening balance, the
vast majority of subjects restored a level of body control and
posture stability similar to those three to 10 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anything else balance is a skill,'' said John
Blievernicht, president of Sports Health CARE Inc., a Chicago
medical rehabilitation clinic. ``And like any other skill, you've
got to constantly practice it to preserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blievernicht recommends exercises like lunge or walking
movements on a low-standing balance beam, standing on one leg, and
abdominal crunches done while leaning backward over an oversized
plastic ball. Walking across a low wooden beam, for example,
requires a constant correction of knee, hip and head alignment. All
of the muscles from head to toe must work with proper
synchronization for a person to glide across the beam without
extending the arms for balance or teetering off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Blievernicht says this is a difficult task for many people at
first, but that with proper training and supervision, most can
master it _ and moves like it _ in just a few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, these exercises awaken reflexes and teach body
awareness and control on a subconscious level,'' he said. This can
translate into lasting improvements in posture and overall quality
of movement, Blievernicht added, regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes looking to improve performance, people recovering
from injuries, and anyone with postural problems should also
consider working on balance and body awareness,'' said Risa
Halpern, director of physical therapy at Plus One Physical Therapy
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This message is slowly beginning to make its way into the
mainstream: Many health clubs now offer classes that involve props
like Physioballs, a brand of the large plastic balls used in the
abdominal crunch exercise; balance beams; wobble boards, and other
devices designed to improve balance. At Crunch Fitness, a national
chain of fitness clubs, exercisers in the popular Rebounding class
jump up and down on a miniature trampoline for 45 minutes to
sharpen balance, coordination and agility.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Halpern thinks balance and posture-correction exercises
are best taught one-on-one or in small groups supervised by
trainers or physical therapists with extensive knowledge of anatomy
and proper body alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike many other forms of traditional exercise, this is about
quality rather than quantity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Allchin, general manager of the Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell
corporate fitness center, agrees. ``It's hard to teach subtle
nuances of body posture and movement in a classroom packed with
people,'' she said. Ms. Allchin advises starting out slowly, doing
no more than 10 minutes of balance work, two or three times a week.
``This type of training is deceptively challenging and can leave
you feeling exhausted and sore if you overdo it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   BALANCE BEAM WALK: Walk slowly across a low wooden beam while
maintaining tall posture, keeping the knees aligned forward and
hands relaxed at the sides.
</P>
<P>
   FULCRUM: With arms relaxed at the sides, stand on one foot with
the other leg held behind and a few inches off the floor. Lean
forward and maintain balance.
</P>
<P>
   BALL CRUNCH: Lie across a large ball with feet placed hip-width
apart. Do abdominal crunches while trying to keep the ball as still
as possible.

   NEW YORK _ Mikhail Baryshnikov has specialized in unearthing the
unusual in dance. Now he is branching out again. Tuesday night he
will perform choreography drawn from traditional Japanese forms in
``Dance With Three Drums and Flute,'' a new solo created for him by
the Kabuki star Tamasaburo Bando. The piece will be performed in
Baryshnikov's single performance at St. Mark's Danspace Project in
the East Village to raise money for Dancers Responding to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Baryshnikov put the program together after being asked for help
by Hernando Cortez, a dancer with Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance
Project who founded Dancers Responding to AIDS with Denise Roberts,
a former Paul Taylor dancer. They chose an intimate downtown space
to avoid ``all that uptown hoopla,'' Ms. Roberts said. Money raised
by the group is used to help people in dance with HIV, the AIDS
virus, and for grants to other groups that respond to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dance With Three Drums and Flute,'' set to music to be
performed live by Rosen Tousha, Baryshnikov takes a gradual
18-minute voyage from mystic near-stillness to the turbulence of an
impassioned Kabuki warrior. The dance grew out of collaborative
work he did this summer with Tamasaburo, a member of the honorary
Kabuki family of Bando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamasaburo-san and I have known each other for many years,''
said Baryshnikov, stretched out on the floor of a gleaming studio
at City Center as a physiotherapist gave his legs a prerehearsal
massage. ``I had the privilege of watching him putting his makeup
and costume on before performances. Then a mutual friend said, `Why
don't you guys try to figure something out together?' It took us
six years to nail our schedules down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamasaburo based the new dance on traditional forms from Noh to
Kabuki. ``He intentionally mixed them,'' Baryshnikov said, ``and
tried to put his own point of view into the perspective of this
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The solo is a rechoreographed version of a duet Tamasaburo
created for himself and Baryshnikov. ``There is no context or
story,'' Baryshnikov said. ``Some of the movements mean something
in Kabuki theater, like dancing with a fan or a hop on one leg.
That is a given. But in this dance they just mean movement. And
from my point of view it is close to modern dance, or mime, in the
purity of the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Tamasaburo for three months and remembering earlier
visits to Japan, Baryshnikov said, he began to see something of
Japanese dance in work by Martha Graham. ``There is a certain
stillness, a sculptural quality _ that deadness or shell that burns
from inside _ that is very Japanese and is projected in her work so
much,'' he said, talking of one similarity.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments in ``Dance With Three Drums and Flute'' that
recall the feeling of fatefulness in ``Heartbeat,'' a solo
Baryshnikov performed at City Center in 1997 in which electrical
impulses in his moving muscles were captured and amplified by
equipment created by the sound sculptor Christopher Janney.
Baryshnikov finds a similar mysticism in Tousha's music, based on
traditional Japanese themes. At times, performing the score, ``he
holds his breath and sends his spirit around the world,''
Baryshnikov said the composer told him, ``and when it comes back,
he knows to exhale.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is not for review, also features previews of
work by Neil Greenberg and Mark Morris that are to be performed
later by Baryshnikov and White Oak. Tickets are $1,000, which
includes receptions before and after the performance, and are
available from Dancers Responding to AIDS, at Broadway Cares/Equity
Fights AIDS. Information: (212) 840-0770.

<P>
   The tortoise and the hare, paired together in Aesop's fable,
have been reunited by archeologists in an ingenious index for
measuring the growth rate of early human populations.
</P>
<P>
   The index, based on the proportions of slow and fast-moving prey
in ancient trash heaps, shows that from about 100,000 to 50,000
years ago the first human inhabitants of the east and north
Mediterranean were extremely few, a mere handful of people who were
probably dispersing from an ancestral homeland somewhere in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The size of early populations figures in many discussions about
the genetic and cultural evolution of early humans. The new finding
is important because it confirms estimates derived on a quite
different basis _ from analyzing the DNA of living people around
the globe _ that the earliest human populations were extremely
small. Geneticists have calculated, for example, that the early
human population of sub-Saharan Africa was once as small as 6,900
people, and that the group that left Africa to colonize the rest of
the world may have numbered as few as 500.
</P>
<P>
   These estimates, based on variations in DNA, are better than
guesses but fall way short of hard fact.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Stiner, an archeologist at the University of Arizona in
Tucson, has now developed an alternative method of tracking early
human population density. The method does not yield precise numbers
but shows in a relative way how population density may have
changed. She and colleagues at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and
Harvard report their findings in the current issue of the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stiner's method is based on analysis of the bones of small
prey animals found at Paleolithic sites in Israel and Italy. She
and her colleagues find that slowing-moving animals like tortoises
predominate at the lowest level of the Israeli site, yielding to
hares, rabbits and partridges at later periods.
</P>
<P>
   The switch in prey was occasioned not by a desire for
gastronomic variety, Dr. Stiner says, but rather by the fact that
animals that were easier to catch were consumed first. Only as the
tortoises and shellfish became scarce did the Paleolithic people
start to go after the more evasive prey. The ratio of slow to fast
prey over time is thus a measure of the number of mouths round the
campfire, Dr. Stiner believes.
</P>
<P>
   Tortoises, which were baked in their shells, are slow to
reproduce and very sensitive to predation _ a tortoise population
will collapse when 7 percent have been eaten. ``People weren't
damaging these tortoise populations, yet half of the total game
brought to the site is tortoises,'' Dr. Stiner said. ``The
implication is that the number of people must have been very low.''
</P>
<P>
   The proportions of fast prey at the two sites shoots up, as if
reflecting an increase in human population density, at around
44,000 years ago at the Israeli site and 23,000 years ago at the
Italian site.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ian Tattersall, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum
of Natural History, said Dr. Stiner's article was the first
archeological attempt he had seen to get close to the issue of
early population change, even though it was not 100 percent proof.
Dr. Henry Harpending, a population geneticist at the University of
Utah, also said the article was ``one of the first to get a grip on
the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The earliest groups of humans may have numbered just a few
hundred each, according to Dr. Ofer Bar-Yosef, a Harvard
archeologist and co-author of Dr. Stiner's paper. ``The mating
system among humans requires 250 to 400 people so as not to cross
the incest taboo,'' he said. These early bands were mobile, moving
from one site to another when food got scarce.
</P>
<P>
   But as the landscape filled up with people, mobility decreased,
and the need to catch more elusive prey would have been a powerful
spur to innovation. This is the process presumably reflected by the
tortoise-hare index. The demographic packing ``contributed to the
rapid acceleration in human material culture, technology, and the
beginning of sedentary settlements that occur toward the end of the
Pleistocene,'' Dr. Stiner said. The Pleistocene, the period of the
last great ice age, ended around 10,000 years ago, shortly after
the first domestication of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Some archeologists, like Dr. Richard Klein of Stanford
University, believe a genetic change underlay the emergence of
behaviorally modern humans, marked by the flowering of art and
technology that occurred in the archeological record starting about
50,000 years ago. Tattersall, on the other hand, said it was ``hard
to imagine there was a genetic change that spread through the world
in a short period of time.'' He believes the agent of change was
the development of language, built on genetic abilities acquired
many thousands of years earlier but not put to use.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Yosef also favors the idea of a latent genetic ability in
the first anatomically modern humans that was not triggered until
much later. ``We have to assume the genetic changes happened at
around 100,000 years ago but the cultural change doesn't happen
before 48,000 years ago,'' Bar-Yosef said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he basically agreed with the proposals of the population
geneticists that anatomically modern humans all came from somewhere
in sub-Saharan Africa. ``I belong to the supporters of the
out-of-Africa hypothesis,'' he said, ``but my point is you have the
mutation early, so it's like old wine, with at least 60,000 years
of cultural evolution brewing. Even these early anatomically modern
humans are not making anything different from the Neanderthals
until the cultural change that happened 50,000 years ago. It was a
change in technology that responded to socioeconomic requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stiner plans to explore the tortoise-hare index at other
sites in Africa, Asia and Europe, with the hope of learning more
about early human demographics. ``The increase in human population
density was one of the factors contributing to the process of
evolutionary change, selecting those who applied new solutions to
old problems,'' she said.

CLINTON FACES DIVIDED LOYALTIES ON HIS HOME TURF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The waitresses in the International House of
Pancakes at University and Markham are supporting President Clinton
in his fight to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   The sign outside the IHOP read, ``Pancakes make people happy.''
Inside, waitress Katherine Lupiner was setting down plates of
chicken fried steak and short stacks in front of three generations
of a family dressed in Sunday best, talking about how good the sun
looked coming through the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the cash register, Lupiner shook her head over the
impeachment process. ``I think it's been blown up,'' she said. ``I
don't think Clinton has to explain everything he does, not to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment debate has drawn definite lines in Little Rock.
Letters to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette tend to support Clinton,
the state's former governor, but the newspaper's editorials have
been critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   Lupiner, who moved from Sacramento, Calif., to Arkansas ``to
slow down,'' doesn't think Clinton will be convicted and removed
from office by the Senate, saying, ``He's done a lot of good
things. I hope he stays.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted last month to impeach Clinton on charges that he
committed perjury and obstructed justice in an effort to cover up
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   IHOP Waitress Renee Watson said that Clinton should remain in
office. ``What happened was between him and Hillary and Monica,''
she said. ``It's none of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's cut back unemployment, brought a lot of jobs to
Arkansas,'' Watson said. ``He shouldn't be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Tom Adam, manager of the Guesthouse Inn, removing Clinton
from office makes sense. ``I don't like the man. I don't believe in
the man,'' he said of Clinton. ``I think they should impeach him
and get it over with. Stop jacking us around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got things to take care of that aren't getting done,
bridges, roads, Social Security, health care. I tell you, I don't
trust the system anymore, I don't trust what they're doing. It's
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hill from IHOP, Nina Freeman, a part-time van driver
for the Guesthouse Inn, said she's had more than enough of the
impeachment process. ``I think it's a bunch of garbage,'' she said.
``I don't like any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who Bill Clinton sleeps with; that's his wife's
problem,'' said Freeman, who also works as a secretary in the
state's pollution control department.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, people are caught between reluctant support
of Clinton and lingering embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat-Gazette, in a editorial, said: ``Some day, some
how, you knew this would all catch up with him ... and so, when it
does, even the most dramatic of scenes are drained of their drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the incessant use of the word `Historic' by the
television anchormen lacks color, conviction and suspense, the very
stuff of history ... the whole scene has the air of a Greek drama
dumbed down for the modern reader; stripped of its nobility, its
hubris reduced to calculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Neidhardt, a registered nurse, said the president's
conduct in the Lewinsky affair was ``not something they should
impeach him for, but Bill Clinton should have seen how this was
going to affect his family, how it would affect the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This not only hurts his wife, his child, but it hurts the
nation more than anyone can tell. I am so ashamed for Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Neidhardt said she hadn't voted for years out of disillusionment
with the government before she got caught up in Clinton's
gubernatorial campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got elected, I thought he'd be good for the state,
good for the country,'' she said. ``Now, I guess, I'm pretty much
back where I started.''

THAT '70S SHOW FOR PRETEENS RETURNS ON PBS WITH A NEW LOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   My son Jack, all of 8 years old, is staring at the TV. We've
just finished watching the first two episodes of ``Zoom,'' the new
show for kids 6 to 12 that debuted last week on PBS, and this is
all that comes out of his usually far more active mouth. He's not
reaching for the PlayStation, though. I take this as an encouraging
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Jack, would you watch it again?''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about it. ``Yeah. If I knew when it was on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack may never have seen anything like it, but I have.
Something, in fact, almost exactly like it. Twenty-six years ago,
the first cast of the first Zoom'' show brought to public
television a message of kids-can-do-anything, preteen empowerment.
``Zoom'' zoomed to the top of the PBS charts, becoming its second
most-popular show, right behind ``Masterpiece Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's young fans were called Zoomers. They spoke in
Ubbi-Dubbi, wanted to do a Zoom Do, became hooked on games like
Miss Mary Mack and Fannee Doolee and sent an average of 10,000
letters per week to the seven kid-hosts, suggesting games, riddles,
recipes, skits and topics for discussion that actually became the
content of the program. ``Zoom'' was for kids and by kids, and
members of the cast, in their matching striped shirts, became the
viewers' virtual TV friends.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Zoom,'' produced once again by WGBH in Boston (yes,
Zoomers, it's got that same famous 02134 address) is remarkably
like the old ``Zoom.'' Some details have changed, and thanks to
better technology, the interactive opportunities for viewers have
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   But the old ``Zoom'' never faced the competition of all-fun,
all-the-time private cable networks with their marketing mavens and
high-dollar budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Why re-''Zoom'' now? Will kids care?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Keiko, with two dark Baby Spice-style ponytails gathered in sky
blue scrunchies, smiles into the camera, her braces reflecting
lights from the set. ``Ed L. of Marblehead, Massachusetts,
challenged us to see how long we could keep a feather up in the air
without letting it touch the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   She turns to the other ``Zoom'' cast members, who are loosely
gathered near one of the tall, neon orange and yellow letters that
spell out the name of the show against the set's black background.
Seven identical pairs of black canvas tennis shoes start moving as
the kids work out a system that goes from random cries of ``I've
got it!'' to directives on whose turn is next. The game goes on,
untimed, until the red feather nests in the crook of Jared's neck.
Zoe reaches forward and sucks her breath in to draw the feather
out. But she goes too far. The feather is in her mouth. Game over.
Giggles abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zoom'' rolls merrily, almost quietly, along. There's a short
video on a kid who likes to ride in hot-air balloons with his
uncle. Keiko makes a bunny cake in cafe Zoom. Alisa introduces a
Zoom Zinger from Jenna M. of East Bridgeport, Conn., a word game
that requires kids to actually remember what homonyms are.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Kate Taylor of WGBH knows her ``Zoom.'' Her first job was as the
contributions editor for the show in the '70s, which meant she got
final say on which of the 10,000 viewer letters would become part
of each show. Now she's the executive producer of the new ``Zoom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's kids are looking for more substance,'' she begins.
``This is a show that challenges them to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Nickelodeon channel's The Big Help
environmental challenge to kids is some proof that kids today
indeed are looking for activities with meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Zoom'' not only challenges kids to do good, but also to do
something radical _ ``if you like what you see, turn off the TV,''
the cast croons in the opening song.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Taylor and other WGBH executives, along with those at
PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which provides
part of the funding for the show), all hope that the turn-off isn't
permanent and that viewers will re-''Zoom'' _ fast. Over the years,
the public broadcasting network has done fewer and fewer programs
for school-age kids, and the hardest part may be ``getting them to
PBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Once kids are there, though, Taylor points out that the new
``Zoom'' has a huge advantage over the old one. ``The interactivity
is so much more exciting with the advent of the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. On the ``Zoom'' site (www.pbs.org), kids can find
the secrets of Ubbi-Dubbi and play Zoom Zingers. They can download
instructions for science experiments and recipes like Dirt Pudding,
read poems and stories, and check out movie reviews from other
kids.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   With a click, they can even add their own poems, stories, games,
riddles and reviews to the mix. If they do, they'll get their names
listed in the Limelight, like Ali M., age 13, of Arlington; Whitney
F. of Keller; and Walker S. of Colleyville, just a few of the 2,930
kids who had sent in stuff before the third episode of the series
even aired.
</P>
<P>
   The new interactivity goes beyond the home computer. Ten museums
across the country, including the Fort Worth Museum of Science and
History, have Zoom Zones, where kids are supplied with materials to
complete the problem-solving activities from the show's new Habits
of the Mind curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Taylor _ and I _ eventually acknowledge this fact: It may simply
be time for ``Zoom'' again because the Zoomers of the '70s are
today's moms and dads.
</P>
<P>
   I set my VCR for Day Three of the show. Jack hadn't asked me to,
but the truth is that as a former Zoomer, I hope that maybe he'll
connect with the show the way I did. Having watched a ``Zoom: Best
of the 70s''video that WGBH produced to help kick off the new show,
I was shocked and only slightly embarrassed to find how much I
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Hubi, frubiends! A skinny girl appeared on the screen, and the
name Tracy formed itself in a dusty part of my brain. And then
there was the tall blond girl next to her. Ah, Nina. If only she
would sing ``The Cat Came Back'' ... And there was Bernadette, with
that swinging arm thing she did that looked so cool.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jack will watch ``Zoom.'' Maybe other kids will, too.
After all, the average child now watches about 31 hours a week of
TV, according to the 1998 PBS Roper Youth Report.
</P>
<P>
   It's an $8 million-a-season gamble on the part of public
television. Even now, ``Zoom'' execs are trying to get funds for
next season while they continue to edit the 40 episodes shot this
summer. ``The second season is the hardest sometimes,'' says
Taylor, who undoubtedly remembers that the first ``Zoom'' survived
into its second year only after a viewer letter-writing campaign.
</P>

   The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History is one of 10 sites
nationwide chosen to be a part of a community outreach pilot
program for the new ``Zoom.'' Here, and in the other Zoom Zones,
kids have access to the show's Web site, where they can get ideas
for science experiments, games and riddles _ or send in their own
ideas for possible inclusion on the PBS show. They'll also find
materials to do some of the Zoom projects and a computer to enter
data from experiments so that it can be collated on a national
basis.
</P>
<P>
   While directors at each site have some leeway in how to
interpret the activities of the Zone _ as a full-outreach van
program, a complete gallery, or an area within an existing museum
exhibit _ the concept is the same: Give kids more ways to interact
with the TV show as they explore principles of math and science. In
Fort Worth, a group of middle-schoolers from Fort Worth's Applied
Learning Academy are Zone volunteers, designing exhibits and
facilitating games and experiments with museum visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the Zone through the end of ``Zoom's'' first season
comes from a grant from the National Science Foundation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Psychoanalysts, it would seem, have reason to be gloomy: These
are difficult times for the couch.
</P>
<P>
   Once the undisputed rulers of American psychiatry, analysts now
stand at the margins of a field where drug treatments and
short-term talking therapies predominate. Analytic patients are in
short supply: Without insurance reimbursement, even those who still
desire the four or five sessions per week typical of full-fledged
psychoanalysis can rarely afford to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   In managed-care circles, analysis has become a synonym for
treatment that costs too much and achieves too little. And the
profession fares little better in the public forum, where Woody
Allen remains an icon of endless self-absorption, and Freud-bashing
enjoys unflaggingly popularity as an intellectual sport.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the psychoanalytic community these days, there is little
hand wringing and only an occasional foray into nostalgia. In a
field notorious for its insularity and resistance to outside
critique, the threat of extinction has inspired a new vigor, a
frenzy of self-examination and the urge to reach out and connect
with the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a retrofitted psychoanalysis that is humbler,
hipper, more communicative, and considerably more tolerant than it
has been since Freud first floated his revolutionary notions in
Vienna. The rigid neo-Freudian orthodoxy that long held a lock on
American psychoanalysis has gradually given way to a gentler
theoretical pluralism, and, in a major sea change, analysts are no
longer required to have medical degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In an echo of the early days of the profession, when Melanie
Klein, Karen Horney and others were leading figures, women are once
again a strong presence, offering a feminist perspective on
traditionally male-oriented theory. And the old figure of the
silent, austere, authoritarian psychoanalyst is slowly being
replaced with a new model who is just another human being and not
averse to uttering a word or two.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such shifts will succeed in rekindling public interest
and replenishing the dwindling supply of patients is anyone's
guess. But they represent a new determination to stick around for
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a field that in its most vital aspects is changing,
wants to change, and is trying to think about what it is and what
it wants to be,'' said Dr. Kimberlyn Leary, associate director of
the University of Michigan's Psychological Clinic and a trainee at
the Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Dr. Leary _ as a woman, an African-American and
a psychologist rather than a medical doctor _ at the annual
meetings of the American Psychoanalytic Association, held in
Manhattan recently, in itself was proof that much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Even a decade ago, the yearly gatherings of the association,
which was founded in 1911 by American followers of Freud and
remains the dominant psychoanalytic organization in the United
States, were populated by gray-haired men in dark suits, the
atmosphere one of sober formality.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings included no press room because, in the view of many
members, the less psychoanalysis appeared in the press the better.
Discussions focused narrowly on psychoanalytic technique and
practice, with little acknowledgment of events in the outside
world. And the tenor of the annual meetings, like that of the
discipline itself, was exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the attendance roster at the recent meetings
included many younger analysts, a large group of women, and at
least a few minorities. Panels addressed issues like race,
adoption, homophobia and sexual abuse. A session on ``Intuition,
Unconscious Communication and Thought Transference,'' vied with a
discussion group on the ``Applications of Psychoanalysis to
Sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts spoke of their work in atypical settings: with baseball
teams, in nursery schools, with police departments trying to combat
community violence. And different theoretical perspectives _
including the British school of object relations, Heinz Kohut's
self-psychology and Lacanian analysis _ were listed in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps the most striking difference was in how the analysts
at the meetings talked about their interactions with patients.
``The degree of certainty in the way we talk has changed,'' said
Dr. Marvin Margolis, a former president of the association. ``We're
a little more modest, more hypothetical about our interventions and
how we frame them.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once the analyst was seen as an authority who took charge
of treating the patient's pathology, most analysts now describe the
analyst-patient relationship as a collaborative endeavor, in which
the patient is a full partner. Many practitioners have abandoned
the notion that the analyst should be an entirely blank screen,
revealing no emotions or personal details.
</P>
<P>
   And while most analysts embrace the fundamentals of Freud's
``talking cure,'' _ the power of unconscious images and fantasies
to influence behavior, the importance of childhood experiences in
shaping development and the central role of transference, or the
replaying of early patterns of relating to others within the
analytic treatment _ few adhere inflexibly to a unified theory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they practice a kind of utilitarian eclecticism,
drawing upon different psychoanalytic schools as needed in the
treatment of individual patients.
</P>
<P>
   In any field, a transformation of this magnitude does not take
place overnight, and the changes in Freud's ``impossible
profession'' began long before the managed care revolution. In the
1960s, psychoanalysis, ascendant in psychiatry departments across
the country, was hugely successful _ and enormously over-confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a monopoly,'' said Dr. Arnold Richards, a New York
analyst who is editor of the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1980s there were increasing signs of malaise. In
academic departments, psychoanalysts were rapidly losing ground to
psychiatrists with a more biological approach to mental illness. In
the public arena, interest in Freud's legacy was declining.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of the psychoanalytic association, which now has 3,200
members, about a third of the psychoanalysts in the United States,
came to a standstill, while the average age of members rose.
Enrollment in training institutes, which peaked at 1,194 students
in 1980, had dropped to 909 by 1989.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, a generation of American-born analysts
began to chafe at the conservatism and restrictiveness that
characterized the field's elders, many of them Europeans who
immigrated to the United States just before or after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   One antidote to these complaints, many believed, would be an
injection of new blood, and it came in 1988, when, in response to a
restraint of trade suit by psychologists, a settlement agreement
overturned the psychoanalytic association's longstanding policy of
restricting analytic training to candidates with medical degrees,
opening the field to lay analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal was a vindication of sorts for Freud, who did not
believe a medical degree should be a prerequisite to becoming a
psychoanalyst. And the past decade has seen an upsurge of
applicants to psychoanalytic institutes from a variety of
non-medical disciplines, including social work, psychology,
history, literature and sociology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, the latest year for which the association
has figures, 381 of 990 candidates training in 29 psychoanalytic
institutes around the country did not have medical degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps the biggest transformation in the way psychoanalysis
views itself and its place in the world came with the arrival of
new leaders, armed with a sense of urgency about the plight of
psychoanalysis and a determination to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Pyles, president of the psychoanalytic association,
is one example. Unlike his predecessors of a few decades ago, who
prided themselves on a scholarly detachment and made no attempt to
promote their profession's image, Pyles is a political activist.
</P>
<P>
   He urges his colleagues to learn how to walk into a
congressman's office and explain what psychoanalysis is and why it
is important in under five minutes, in an effort to win support for
issues like the protection of patient privacy and insurance
coverage of long-term therapy.
</P>
<P>
   He has broken down traditional barriers, reaching out to other
mental health organizations like the American Psychiatric
Association, and calling for ``a new vision of ourselves as
psychoanalysts of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   And with other leading psychoanalysts he is shepherding a
variety of projects designed to increase public knowledge and
broaden the field's influence. ``Ever since I was in training, this
attitude of psychoanalysis having to exist in some isolated
hothouse has driven me nuts,'' Pyles said recently. ``I think it
damn near killed us.''
</P>
<P>
   No amount of reform is likely to please the field's harshest
critics. And within the analytic community itself there are some
who argue that the changes have come too fast, that politics have
been substituted for scholarship, and that the core of the
discipline is being diluted by competing theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good deal of uncertainty where there used to be a
lot of conviction about the way psychology worked,'' said Dr.
Nathan Hale, a historian and author of ``The Rise and Crisis of
Psychoanalysis in the United States'' (Oxford University Press,
1995). ``The whole theoretical structure is up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   But if, as the slogan goes, attitude is everything,
psychoanalysis in its new incarnation probably has a better chance
of surviving than it once did.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a Prozac-smitten society, where quick fixes are the
rule, Freud's emphasis on deeper meaning and the unconscious mind
still exerts an appeal. Psychoanalytic patients may be scarce, but
psychoanalytic ideas inform a variety of academic disciplines and
provide the basis for a wide range of ``psychodynamic'' therapies.
</P>
<P>
   And psychoanalytic training still attracts newcomers: Dr. Leary,
for example, said she was drawn by the rather antiquated notion
that an encounter between two human beings could produce healing
and change. ``It's about as low tech as you can get,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Vaughan, a trainee at the Columbia University Center
for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, said, ``You do analytic
training because you can't not do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first look at it,'' Dr. Vaughan continued, ``it
doesn't make sense, but if you really value seeing how people's
minds work in depth you get addicted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, what will ultimately keep the field alive, said Dr. Owen
Renik, a San Francisco analyst who is chairman of the
psychoanalytic association's program committee and the author of a
forthcoming book chapter, ``Getting Real in Psychoanalysis,'' is
not the enthusiasm of practitioners but the ability of
psychoanalysts to help their patients, and to persuade the public
that they are able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what you call yourself,'' Renik said, ``if you
help people feel better, word gets out. If you don't help people, I
don't care how good your marketing is, you'll go down the tubes.'' &QL;

COURT-APPOINTED SCIENTISTS ARE NO PANACEA 
</HEADLINE>

studies at the Lyman Briggs School of Michigan State University.)

 By ALICE DREGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember that television advertisement for some over-the-counter
pain medication in which a soap-opera actor announced at the start
of his endorsement, ``I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV''?
This is just the sort of conflation of acted-science and
real-science that led a federal judge overseeing lawsuits over
breast implants to appoint a panel of four scientists to decide the
central factual question of the case: Do implants cause immune
disorders?
</P>
<P>
   The panel studied relevant scientific research and found no
statistically significant difference between the incidence of
immune disorders in women who have had implants and those who have
not.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Angell, the executive editor of The New England Journal
of Medicine, has hailed this process as a solution to the ``junk
science'' that often floods court cases that hinge on scientific
facts. Angell correctly noted that typically in these cases
``experts are hired by lawyers on both sides to present their
opinions. But they are not required to cite scientific evidence _ a
vague reference to their own `experience' or `unpublished research'
will often do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Angell has long argued that in such cases we need ``a
dispassionate panel of experts'' with ``no stake in the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   While I share with Dr. Angell a concern over ``junk science''
and a concern for justice, I think she is too quick to envision the
court-appointed scientist as St. Peter at the gates of heaven,
judging true from false, superhuman, above earthly affairs. Let me
make clear that I am not disagreeing with the findings of the panel
in the implant case. But I wish to point out some serious problems
with this imagined ideal.
</P>
<P>
   First off, it is a damaging myth that passion merely clouds the
vision, with no compensatory effects. In fact, passion can allow a
scientist to surge past the clouds formed by accepted wisdom and
reach new discoveries tamer colleagues would not.
</P>
<P>
   We should not assume that people who exhibit little passion in
fact have little, nor should we assume that people who are
passionate could not possibly be right, or better at figuring out
what is right than the next person.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Dr. Barry J. Marshall, the young Australian
physician who discovered that peptic ulcers are caused by a
bacteria, Helicobacter pylori. Marshall's colleagues, stuck firmly
in the received wisdom that ulcers are caused by psychological
stress, thought his idea absurd. They ignored for years the
evidence for a bacterial cause of ulcers _ evidence Marshall was
able to see.
</P>
<P>
   So convinced was Marshall that he was right, he used himself as
a guinea pig, drinking the bacteria to prove that it turned his
once-healthy stomach diseased. Passionate? Yes. Passionate enough
to push until his colleagues finally recognized the truth of his
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the charge of being ``too passionate'' (translation:
``too passionate to be right'') is usually held against people
advocating change _ intellectual, social, institutional _ and
rarely against establishment scientists.
</P>
<P>
   I know a senior physicist who is so passionate about quarks that
he probably has erotic dreams about atoms, but no one doubts his
ability as a physicist. On the contrary, his passion wins him
awards and financing, and it probably should. But if an activist or
upstart points to scientific evidence that, say, an established
industry is harming people by burning toxic chemicals, he or she is
very often written off as ``too passionate,'' and up springs the
admonition that real scientists are dispassionate.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem of discounting certain voices stems from a
general inability we seem to have as humans to attribute more than
one major identity to any given person. Just as schoolchildren are
sometimes astonished to discover that their teacher is a parent,
too, people are often astonished that one could be an intellectual
and a person with a social and political identity as well, and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   So we prefer to think of ``good'' scientists as disembodied,
dispassionate. And we tend to assume that the only people who
contribute usefully to scientific matters are those specifically
trained and working as science professionals, but neither is this
so.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the late Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Ms. Douglas' formal
education was in English and she made a name as a writer, yet she
was best known for her careful observation and fierce advocacy of
the Florida Everglades. Her obituary in May in The New York Times
noted that she made her case for saving the Everglades ``with a
rare blend of science, local lore and history, and shimmering
writing.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A move toward court-appointed scientists could have the effect
of shutting out people like Ms. Douglas and Marshall, minority
voices that often turn out to lead the way. The value of people
like these _ the kind of challengers unlikely to be appointed by a
judge _ is that they see where others have blind spots.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, recognizing the fact that all people have biases and
blind spots, the judge in the implant case appointed four
scientists instead of only one. If scientists were St. Peter, we
would have needed only one. This is why I prefer the term ``courts
of scientists'' to ``science court'' _ the former recognizes the
human factor brought to any court case, whether or not adjudicated
by scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that all people have biases and blind spots,
appointing a panel of many scientists certainly seems better than
appointing one. Our scientific system has worked so well because it
often requires peer (group) review of studies and claims.
</P>
<P>
   But a science court could interpret very narrowly the term
``peer'' and leave out people who disagree with the scientific
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   A science court might also, given that scientists continue to be
mostly white and mostly male, tend to represent only part of the
population, and this would raise the question of whether a ``jury
of one's peers'' means something entirely different scientifically
than legally. (In the implants case, three of the four appointed
scientists were women, a gender ratio that _ perhaps purposely? _
did not reflect the scientific community at large.)
</P>
<P>
   All good scientists strive for accuracy and fairness, but
historians of science have repeatedly shown that a scientist's
background shapes his or her vision. The ever-passionate Louis
Pasteur conceived his brilliant experiment to disprove spontaneous
generation because he was a Catholic who found spontaneous
generation heretical.
</P>
<P>
   I offer this example specifically because Pasteur was right
about spontaneous generation; biases are necessary and often good _
we just need to be aware of them and to balance them whenever
possible. Otherwise we assume too much is ``fact'' set in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistical significance'' is a good example of something that
looks to many people like simple fact. Statistical significance _
the cut-off point scientists use to say ``more than this much
evidence counts as proof, and less than that much doesn't'' _ when
you get right down to it is arbitrary. Scientists use that cut-off
line because it has worked pretty well. But that does not mean
someone (like an upstart or activist) cannot or should not question
a particular conclusion that something is or is not proved.
</P>
<P>
   The question ``Does it work well?'' is really the ultimate test
in science. We use statistical significance because when we do we
tend to develop, for example, effective, safe drugs. So I hope we
will keep asking the question ``Does it work?'' as we move toward a
science court system.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, without a built-in test that allows us to see whether or
not the new system is working, its use will be unscientific. My
question, then, to Dr. Angell and to other proponents of science
courts is this: How will we know whether science courts are really
working for justice?
</P>
<P>
   In her editorial, Dr. Angell correctly noted that what led to
our needing court-appointed scientists was the fact that ``judges
are not trained to evaluate scientific testimony.'' As a
consequence, judges tend to let in anyone claiming to be
scientific.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of going in the direction of science courts, why not
solve the basic problem? Why not require that judges who sit on
cases dependent on scientific facts have training in scientific
reasoning? Turning to science courts instead of educating judges
seems to be the equivalent of throwing up one's hands in the face
of scientific illiteracy. And more problematically, it assumes
literacy comes (only) with a degree in science.
</P>
<P>
   Given all these considerations, science courts will, I predict,
tend to be inherently conservative, that is, more likely to believe
the claims of the established, and more likely, when in doubt, to
rule in favor of the establishment rather than risk having the
public realize that scientists cannot immediately answer every
question put to them.
</P>
<P>
   If this does happen, ultimately science courts will feed into
the lazy public assumption that scientists are St. Peters (or
worse, devils), instead of very smart, often wonderfully passionate
people.

RARE NIGHT SKIES LEAVES US MOONSTRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are halfway between blue moons, so-to-speak, in one of those
rare months with two full full moons.
</P>
<P>
   Which could account for the recent actions of Congress, the
Midwest's terrible winter weather and the National Basketball
Association's expectations that we're going to accept an
abbreviated season.
</P>
<P>
   It's not very often we get two full moons in one month _ the
first one this month was Jan. 2, and the next is Jan. 31 _ which
some scholars suggest is the import of the saying ``once in a blue
moon,'' or rarely.
</P>
<P>
   And this year is all the more rare in that we are to have two
months in which there are pairs of full moons. March 2 and March 31
also will be full moons. And we'll have a partial lunar eclipse
July 28, as well as a total eclipse of the sun Aug. 11. Observing
all that happening in the night sky should be a whole lot more
interesting than watching still one more
asteroid-headed-toward-Earth doomsday movie.
</P>
<P>
   There are as many explanations, all of them vague, about the
derivation and meaning of blue moon as there are asteroids now
heading toward earth. Originally, it was meant as a complete
absurdity. A 16th-century proverb stated: ``Yf they saye the moune
is beleue, We must believe that it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the meaning became closer to ``hardly ever,'' such
as those rare months in which there are two full moons.
</P>
<P>
   If this be a month of moonings, so to speak, perhaps we need
consider how our moon has proved to be an odd metaphor, indeed.
Apollo astronaut Frank Borman was no poet, but he pretty much said
it: ``The moon is a different thing to each one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   What might have happened to Shakespeare's Romeo if that hapless
lover had declared: ``But soft! What light through yonder window
breaks? It is the west, and Juliet is the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   And how might things have gone in nursery-book land if the cow
jumped over the sun, which would have required some revising of
that rhyme so the dish might run away with the bun.
</P>
<P>
   Since my 5th-grade teacher first read us the poems of Alfred
Noyes, I have silently recited, at seeing clouds racing across the
moon: ``The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas ...''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers and Hart had to rewrite the song at least three times
before ``Blue Moon'' became a hit. It's first version was titled
``Prayer'' and was to have been sung by Jean Harlow in an MGM
musical, ``Hollywood Party,'' which really was an update of MGM's
``Hollywood Revue Of 1929.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harlow wouldn't do the film and the song was shelved until
Rodgers and Hart were asked for a song for ``Manhattan Melodrama,''
with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy. Hart reportedly just rewrote the
lyrics and called it ``The Bad In Every Man.'' A song publisher
suggested they lyrics couldn't be marketed, and Hart suggested
``something corny like `Blue Moon.''' And the lyrics were again
rewritten for what became one of the duo's largest hits. ``Blue
Moon'' sold more than 1 million sheets of music and the Marcels'
1961 recording also was a million-plus seller.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet Beethoven had the same trouble trying to market his
``Moonlight Sonata.'' And Debussy no doubt ran into similar
problems trying to sell ``Clair de lune.'' If Beethoven had called
his piece ``Blue Moon Sonata,'' it might have become a platinum
record for Liberace.
</P>
<P>
   People have been fascinated by the moon for a long, long time,
even before Sen. Strom Thurmon was born. And our moon has figured
in some wonderful hoaxes. Back in 1835, a New York Sun reporter
fabricated a story about a British astronomer having discovered
winged men and wild animals on the moon with the aid of a powerful
new telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's circulation increased almost ten-fold, and the
hoax story inspired a women's organization to raise money for
sending missionaries to the moon. Since then, we've spent billions
to send emissaries there and they've not managed to return with so
much as a slice of green cheese.
</P>
<P>
   That saying, coincidentally, meant uncured cheese the same way
we talk about green fruit. No one actually believed the moon was
colored green, any more than Andy Williams believed the moon was in
the river.
</P>
<P>
   There are pale yellow moons and ghastly white moons and yes,
even bluish moons. That bluish cast is said to be caused by
atmospheric dust particles filtering out certain parts of the
moon's reflective light.
</P>
<P>
   Blue is considered off-color by many, which is why some flicks
are called blue movies. Etymological resources hold that the name
derives from the old Chinese practice of painting the outside of
brothels a bright blue.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Monday, that being the one traditionally spent on sinful or
fattening indulgences, comes just before Lent. Blue gowns in Old
England was a term for prostitutes, derived from the blue dresses
worn as uniforms when prostitutes were imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   All this we can ponder once in a blue moon.

REEL FINE: THE CELTIC BAND LOST TRIBE IS IN FINE FORM ON ITS DEBUT
CD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Lost Tribe first formed in Dallas-Fort Worth out of the
ashes of Rakish Paddy in 1987, the band's name was a reference to
the variety of music John Burleson and John Delaney wanted to play,
which verged from Ireland to Scotland to the Celtic Brittany area
of France to America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says Burleson, ``it's a joke about how spread out we are.''
</P>
<P>
   And spread out they are: Burleson and Delaney live down around
Austin, Betsy Cummings Ener makes her home in the country near
McKinney, Texas, and Mike Hryekewicz, after moving to Portland,
Ore., for several years, has settled in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Such movement has meant death (or at least personnel changes) to
many a band, but Lost Tribe has not only held ranks but prospered,
continuing to play club shows, festivals (including the North Texas
Irish Festival), weddings and the like at the rate of one to two
shows per month. They also found time to record an excellent debut
CD, ``The Bonny Wooden Witch,'' this past spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really needed something to sell at shows,'' Burleson says,
``and what took so long was just not getting organized enough to do
it. I'm glad we did it when we did, though, because there are some
tunes that were written recently, such as ``Betsy's Wedding,'' that
we put on the CD. We just laid off shows last May, June and July
and met up and did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Full of robust playing, ``Witch'' is an uncommonly good CD of
Celtic music; both Ener and Delaney sing very well, Hryekewicz's
fiddle-playing is laudable throughout, and Burleson excels on
guitar, banjo and bodhran.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Witch'' really stand out, though, is how smartly
sets of reels or jigs are arranged. The band's ability to stitch
different songs together and make them flow invites comparisons to
fairly recent debuts by both Dervish and Nomos, as well as classic
recordings by De Danann.
</P>
<P>
   This ability is even more notable considering that between them
the members play nine instruments _ again and again, they choose
just the right combination for a given set, or song within a set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrangements are as important as finding a tune, or
more,'' says Burleson. ``When we're apart we work on the tunes,
getting the licks down, but when we're together we work on the
transitions between tunes and what will make it the most effective.
A lot of tunes evoke a certain instrument. Each one has a different
feel, and often you can hear a tune and know it was composed for
pipes or flute.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Hryekewicz moved to Oregon, the band never considered
breaking up, Burleson says. Gigs are booked only on weekends, and
the members often mail songs back and forth before settling on
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of, `Buy this record and learn this song and
we'll put it between these tunes' and like that,'' he says. ``It's
the folk process _ passing songs around. And we do get together for
rehearsals.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement works so well, he says, that ``we've never had
to turn down a gig because of where we lived. And having Mike in
Tulsa now makes it easier. Now he can just drive to shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Burleson says they recorded enough material for an entire second
CD. Lost Tribe will continue, he says, with the only immediate goal
being to keep playing and, hopefully, make a second CD fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to play bigger, quieter places,'' he says. ``We'd
really like to get locked into that vicious cycle of selling a
bunch of CDs and making another one and another one.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ When he was 14 and growing up in 1950s Poland,
Bohdan Paczynski started observing the flashing and flaring of the
double stars called binaries through a 10-inch telescope outside
his hometown of Warsaw. Now, with the constellation Orion gently
shimmering over his shoulder like an alighting falcon, Paczynski
stands on a bridge above Lake Carnegie on a chilly evening here and
explains his proposal to record panoramic images of the entire sky
_ all of it _ several times each and every night, ``endlessly,'' as
he puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, and anyone else who wanted to view the images over
the Internet, would use them as a sort of cosmic surveillance
camera to find thousands of relatively bright but undiscovered
exploding stars, binaries, pulsating stars, quasars and comets, not
to mention the dozens of house-sized asteroids that whip through
Earth's immediate neighborhood every day.
</P>
<P>
   These fluctuating features of the sky are so unexplored, and the
necessary equipment is so unimposing, that an astronomer who shares
Paczynski's enthusiasm plans to set up an observing station amid
the bright lights of New York City _ on the grounds of the American
Museum of Natural History on Central Park West _ and hopes to make
modest astronomical discoveries there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can discover some asteroids from Manhattan,'' Paczynski
said with deadpan understatement, his hands jammed into his coat
pockets, ``this would bring excitement to the field.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a knack for generating excitement, and for sniffing out
scientific openings where others see impossibility, that has made
Paczynski's mind one of the world's leading engines of astronomical
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   That role is all the more notable considering that Paczynski, a
professor at Princeton University, has for decades been a
theoretical astrophysicist. It is a calling that often leads far
from real sky-watching, but Bohdan Paczynski (pronounced BOG-don
pah-CHIN-ski) has made it his business to spur the observers into
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always looked five or 10 years ahead,'' said Dr.
Michael Shara, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore, where he heads the office that allocates
observing time for the Hubble Space Telescope. ``While he does
sometimes have wild, far-out ideas, he grounds them firmly in
physics. He makes these terrific predictions that jog the observers
to go out and either support him or shoot him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Paczynski's scientific bombshells was a recognition in the
1980s that the cataclysms in space called gamma-ray bursts, which
had accidentally been discovered by satellites launched to monitor
nuclear tests, probably originated billions of light-years away
rather than in this galaxy. To be visible from such vast distances,
gamma-ray bursts would have to be the brightest objects in the
universe for the few moments during which they shine. That view was
at first scorned by virtually all other astronomers but has been
spectacularly confirmed by telescopic measurements in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   His vision has also led to an entirely new field of astronomy,
based on a 1986 calculation in which Paczynski showed how
electronic cameras and fast computers could help astronomers
capture a phenomenon first predicted by Albert Einstein, in which
the gravity of one star or planet can briefly act like a lens and
``magnify'' the light of a more distant star. Many astronomers
doubted that the effect, called gravitational microlensing, would
ever be seen, but it is now routinely observed in searches for
everything from planetary systems and dim, distant stars to a
mysterious constituent of the cosmos called dark matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think it revolutionizes astronomy,'' said Dr.
Rosanne Di Stefano of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics of gravitational microlensing, which she called ``a
whole different way of looking at the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Paczynski effectively took up permanent residence in the United
States on Dec. 13, 1981. On that day, the Polish leader Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski declared a military crackdown while Paczynski,
his wife and two children were on a sabbatical in this country.
``At that time things looked really bad,'' Paczynski said in an
interview. ``The reports from our friends, whatever we read in the
media here, gave an impression that things were actually worse than
under Stalin.''
</P>
<P>
   Much later he concluded that panic had amplified the reports,
but he had already accepted a position at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Paczynski seems neither pleased nor especially bitter about his
decades of coping with Communist rule, viewing it as an
inconvenient fact of his life that Westerners have difficulty
understanding. The post-World War II Warsaw to which his parents
moved from Lithuania was far from prosperous and still half in
ruins. But both his parents had jobs, and he said that every family
he knew, including his own, covered income shortfalls with heavy
borrowing from friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practice, it was a bit like a credit card here,'' Paczynski
said. ``So the same concept functioned in Communist Poland.''
</P>
<P>
   But if everyone was borrowing, where did the money come from?
``I never figured that out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Professionally, his big break came thanks to his mother. When he
was 14 she contacted a professor at the Warsaw University
Observatory whom she knew from her university days in the city now
called Vilnius, Lithuania, and said she had a son who was very
interested in astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   That was how Paczynski got the chance to observe so-called
``eclipsing binaries'' through a small telescope outside Warsaw
each summer. Such stars are born in pairs and whirl around each
other in such a way that one occasionally passes in front of the
other, eclipsing it as seen from Earth. If the eclipsed star is
much brighter than the other, the combined brightness _ all that
can be seen through a small telescope _ can dip by a factor of 30
or 40 for a few hours, then return to normal. ``This is pretty
spectacular, at least for a young kid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He followed the mostly older students at the observatory to
college in Poland, and then to a research assistantship at Lick
Observatory in California, where he had the good fortune to work
for Dr. George Preston, the noted astronomer who is soon to retire
from the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about 48 hours to figure out that he was smarter
than I was,'' said Preston in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his emigration, Paczynski is viewed as a major figure in
the recent revival of astronomy in Poland, forming numerous
partnerships with researchers, including the Optical Gravitational
Lensing Experiment, whimsically called OGLE, a highly successful
microlensing search led by Dr. Andrzej Udalski at the Warsaw
University Observatory. Paczynski has also created a conduit for
students to study in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is basically a legend in Warsaw,'' said Krzysztof Stanek,
an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
who originally came to the United States from Poland to study with
Paczynski.
</P>
<P>
   One of those research partnerships involves Dr. Grzegorz
Pojmanski, an astronomer at Warsaw University Observatory who is
running a pilot project for Paczynski's latest passion _ what he
calls the All Sky Automated Survey. Paczynski's pale blue eyes
blazed with his customary enthusiasm as he gave a rapid-fire
explanation of how the survey has the potential to rake in tens of
thousands of unknown binary stars of every description. Most modern
telescopes peer in great detail at tiny specks of the heavens,
missing the overall picture, he said. Large-scale surveys produce
invaluable snapshots of the sky, but cannot keep track of what
varies, pulsates or flares up and disappears forever.
</P>
<P>
   There are asteroids, too, to spot. On any given day, about 10
asteroids 100 feet or so across and 100 asteroids 30 feet across
tear past Earth at a distance closer than the Moon. Many can be
briefly seen with small telescopes. More elaborate equipment could
pick up the stellar explosions in distant galaxies called
supernovae or the faint optical ``afterglow'' of gamma-ray bursts.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the celestial phenomena that are already
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that we just do not know what unexpected things
may be there,'' Paczynski said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the project published the results of its first look
at a small section of the sky. Paczynski has secured just under
$100,000 in private financing to observe a section 10 times larger
over the next three years; at the end of that time, he and other
astronomers plan to make a proposal to the National Science
Foundation for financing of a major expansion of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Turner, the University of Chicago astrophysicist who
is spokesman for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which has just begun
producing a giant snapshot of a quarter of the northern sky, among
other studies, agreed with Paczynski's assessment. ``We know very
little about things that go flash in the night,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Those views are backed up by the first observations by
Pojmanski, who rigged an electronic camera and a simple telephoto
lens with a 3-inch aperture to scan a small patch of sky over and
over. In two months of observations, taken from the grounds of the
Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, Pojmanski turned up 130 fairly
bright variable sources, three-fourths of which were previously
unknown pulsating stars and eclipsing binaries.
</P>
<P>
   A system to monitor the entire sky would involve sites around
the world, with a clearinghouse to store data received over the
Internet. Paczynski said he would favor a loose confederation of
observers, some of whom could be amateurs. (Indeed, Tom Droege, a
retired engineer from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and
an amateur astronomer, has also proposed surveying the sky on a
regular basis.)
</P>
<P>
   Paczynski already has a dedicated convert to the confederation
philosophy in Shara, the Hubble astronomer, who is set to join the
new astrophysics department at the American Museum of Natural
History and become curator in astronomy there. Not only does he
think the all-sky survey could surpass all previous searches for
novae and ``dwarf'' novae _ his own areas of specialty _ but he
also has bigger game in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enthusiastic about trying to set up one of the sites for
this thing in New York City,'' he said. ``Which might sound like a
crazy thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan, he acknowledges, is a less efficient place than a
Chilean mountaintop for discoveries, but with the right
photographic filters and electronic cameras, he said, enough of
Manhattan's light can be blocked to make the project workable. The
station would serve as a demonstration of the pilot project in
Chile, as an educational project and as a possible source of
discoveries on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from gaining the experience of running a small telescope,
New Yorkers might ``even get to discover an asteroid or two,'' said
Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium. ``And if
you do,'' Tyson said, ``you get to have it named after you.''
</P>
<P>
   Paczynski said that scientists might even learn something if
students could tinker with the new data. ``Usually young kids are
fantastic at computer problems,'' he said, in what sounded like an
updated appeal to the same lure of the telescope that had started
him on the starry path.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Plans for Carnegie Hall's third concert space, a
flexible, technologically up-to-date chamber music hall that is
scheduled to open during the 2001-2002 season, were formally
unveiled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by the violinist Isaac Stern,
president of Carnegie Hall, and Sanford I. Weill, its chairman, at
the Rose Museum next to the main hall. An exhibition about the
space and its history _ since 1891, it has been a recital hall, an
Off Broadway theater and, most recently, the Carnegie Hall Cinema _
opened Monday at the Rose Museum and runs through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The hall is expected to cost about $50 million, and in
recognition of a $10 million grant toward its construction, it is
to be named the Arthur and Judy Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall. The
performance space itself, however, is to be called the Judith Arron
Auditorium. Ms. Arron was the executive director of Carnegie Hall
from 1986 until her death in December, and the new hall was one of
her initiatives. The auditorium was named for Ms. Arron after Weill
and his wife, Joan, donated $5 million to the project.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall's programming for the 1999-2000 season, which
opens with a performance of the Mahler Fifth Symphony by Lorin
Maazel and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra on Sept. 29, was also
announced, as was the appointment of Pierre Boulez as the second
holder of the Carnegie Hall Composer's Chair. Boulez succeeds Ellen
Taaffe Zwilich.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Carnegie Hall's programming is the start of a
multiseason ``Perspectives'' series in which Boulez, Daniel
Barenboim and Maurizio Pollini will each perform in programs
emphasizing the 20th century. As part of this series and in other
concerts, 28 works will have their world, United States or New York
premieres at the hall next season.
</P>
<P>
   The new hall, with a capacity of up to 640 people, depending on
which of three stage and seating configurations is used, will be
significantly larger than Weill Recital Hall, which seats 268, but
dwarfed by the 2,804-seat main hall.
</P>
<P>
   The new hall, which is being designed by Polshek Partnership
Architects, will have three levels. The first is a street-level
entrance on Seventh Avenue, where the lobby of the Carnegie Hall
Cinema was. It will have a new marquee, and its exterior will mesh
with the rest of the landmark building. The second level,
underground, is a mezzanine that can seat 140 and also has a lobby,
coat check, bar and restrooms. Another level down will be the
parterre, which can seat 500 and has its own lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility is largely in the parterre floor, with a system
of sectional lifts that allow for either an end stage (with or
without an orchestra pit), a center stage or a flat floor with no
stage. When a stage is used, the lifts make it possible for the
audience area to be flat or raked. The seats will be on a series of
chair wagons that can be quickly moved between the hall and an
adjacent storage garage.
</P>
<P>
   Wiring to accommodate audiovisual, recording and communications
systems will be installed as well, giving Carnegie what Ms. Arron
described in an address to its board last fall as ``the capability
to take our work from the corner of 57th Street and Seventh Avenue
to all corners of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall has raised about $40 million for the project,
including nearly $13 million from the City of New York and $2
million from New York State. Construction is scheduled to begin in
the summer. No specific programming was announced _ the hall won't
open for another three seasons _ but the new space is expected to
be used for chamber music, contemporary music, musical theater,
chamber opera, dance, children's events and professional training
workshops.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 season at the main hall and Weill Recital Hall,
meanwhile, includes 130 concerts. Of particular interest are those
in the Perspectives series, in which the featured musicians will
work in performing and teaching collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   Barenboim begins his contribution as a pianist in a recital with
the tenor Placido Domingo (Jan. 30, 2000). Domingo's appearances on
the opera stage and with orchestral accompaniment have been
plentiful, but his recital with Barenboim will be his first New
York recital with piano accompaniment. Barenboim will also conduct
the Chicago Symphony in three programs (March 4 to 6, 2000), with
repertory that includes Bruckner and Mahler symphonies, Boulez's
``Notations I-IV'' and the New York premiere of his ``Notations
VII,'' as well as the New York premiere of Elliott Carter's first
opera, ``What Next,'' which has a libretto by Paul Griffiths, a
contributing music critic for The New York Times. Just after the
Chicago Symphony programs, Barenboim is to coach pianists and
conductors in Mozart in a two-day workshop with the Civic Orchestra
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Barenboim is to be the soloist in the Schoenberg Piano Concerto
under the baton of another Perspectives artist, Boulez, during a
series in which Boulez conducts the London Symphony Orchestra
(March 10 to 13, 2000). Boulez's repertory will also include his
``Originel''; the Ligeti Violin Concerto, with Christian Tetzlaff,
and works by Gyorgy Kurtag, Salvatore Sciarrino (a piano concerto,
with Pollini as the soloist), Olga Neuwirth, George Benjamin,
Stravinsky and Mahler. Boulez will direct a workshop on
20th-century chamber music (Nov. 17 to 19), followed by
performances with his Ensemble Intercontemporain (Nov. 19 to 21).
</P>
<P>
   Pollini's contribution to Perspectives includes two piano
recitals, with works by Beethoven, Schoenberg and Stockhausen (Oct.
10) and Boulez and Debussy (March 20, 2000), as well as a
collaboration with the Juilliard String Quartet in a program that
includes Beethoven, Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, Stravinsky and Chopin
(Oct. 20), and appearances with the Arnold Schoenberg Choir, both
at Carnegie Hall and, under its sponsorship, at the 92nd Street Y
(March 28 to April 6, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Some of Pollini's contribution is curatorial: besides his
performances, his series includes the Philadelphia Orchestra's
performance of the Shostakovich Symphony No. 14, conducted by
Wolfgang Sawallisch (Oct. 19); the performance by James Levine and
the Met Orchestra of John Cage's ``Atlas Eclipticalis'' (Nov. 7),
and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam's performances
of Varese and Ligeti works, conducted by Riccardo Chailly (Feb. 10,
2000).
</P>
<P>
   Barenboim, Boulez and Pollini will also present ``Perspectives''
concerts in the 2000-2001 season. Another project at Carnegie Hall
is the American Composers Orchestra's ``20th Century Snapshots''
series, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. Four of the 10 thematic
installments in the series are due next season. Included is the
premiere of a work by Laurie Anderson commissioned for the series
as well as world premieres of works by Muhal Richard Abrams and
Daniel Roumain, the New York premiere of a scene from Philip Glass'
``White Raven'' and the New York premiere of Alvin Singleton's ``56
Blows.''
</P>
<P>
   Other works commissioned by Carnegie Hall for performance next
season are a vocal work by John Corigliano, to be performed by
Sylvia McNair; a chamber work by Brian Ferneyhough, and a vocal
chamber work by John Musto. Boulez, Carter, Ms. Zwilich, Louis
Andriessen, Milton Babbitt, Tan Dun, Chen Yi, Hannibal Lokumbe,
Wolfgang Rihm and Frederick Rzewski have been commissioned to write
short works for ``The Carnegie Hall Millennium Piano Book,'' which
the pianist Ursula Oppens will perform.
</P>
<P>
   Works by Krzystof Penderecki and Joan Tower will have world
premieres, and works by Boulez, Maazel, John Adams, Richard
Danielpour, Einojuhani Rautavaara and Poul Ruders will have New
York premieres.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestras visiting Carnegie Hall next season include the Berlin
Philharmonic (with Claudio Abbado), the New York Philharmonic (with
Kurt Masur), the Cleveland Orchestra (with Christoph von Dohnanyi),
the Boston Symphony Orchestra (with Seiji Ozawa), the Oslo
Philharmonic and the Pittsburgh Symphony (with the director they
share, Mariss Jansons), the National Symphony (with Leonard
Slatkin), the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (with Charles Dutoit) and
the San Francisco Symphony (with Michael Tilson Thomas). The Met
Orchestra will present its sixth season at the hall, and the
Philadelphia Orchestra will offer five concerts in celebration of
its centenary.

   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, sensing the emergence
of a new political issue that could ultimately benefit Vice
President Gore's presidential bid next year, has designed a
multibillion-dollar plan to stop the march of new homes, malls and
business parks, and make urban areas more livable.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected Tuesday to announce plans for the
federal government to spend nearly $1 billion a year to buy
undeveloped land in urban areas for parks and preservation as a
hedge against future development.
</P>
<P>
   It would mark a major shift in land acquisition policy. Over the
last decade, with budget deficits running high, the federal
government has purchased hardly any open land.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's anticipated announcement follows an initiative
announced Monday by Gore to create a ``Better America'' bond
program that would generate $10 billion to help local communities
preserve green space, reduce traffic congestion, protect water
quality and clean up abandoned industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new livability initiative represents meaningful federal
support for our 'smart growth' effort already underway in central
Texas,'' said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), who was on hand for
Gore's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Known around the White House as Gore's ``livable communities
agenda,'' the initiatives are part of the 2000 budget Clinton will
submit to Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
   They come on the heels of a national election last November in
which voters approved nearly 200 state and local ballot initiatives
on curbing urban sprawl, signaling the maturing of a political
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, for example, voters approved a $75.9 million bond
issue for the park and recreation system that included about $40
million for parks and bike trails around Austin.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most dramatic example of anti-sprawl sentiment in
last fall's election was Ventura County in southern California. A
huge majority stripped their elected supervisors of the power to
approve new subdivisions and put it in the hands of the voters
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his announcement Monday, alluded to last year's
election. ``We are taking citizens' concerns to the very top of our
national agenda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like this issue has finally trickled up to Washington
from the grass roots,'' Holly Minch, a spokeswoman for the Sierra
Club, said Monday. ``The environment is a winning political
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is preparing to run for the Democratic Party's 2000
presidential nomination, has long been identified with the
environmental movement. As a U.S. senator, he wrote a best-seller,
Earth in the Balance, which warned that the engines of civilization
had brought humankind to the brink of ecological catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, Gore has softened his approach,
concentrating on the politically palatable notion of improving
living conditions, particularly in the voter-rich suburbs of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) , which in the
fall complained of being ``demonized'' by environmentalists in
``smart growth'' initiatives, issued a politically cautious
statement in response to Gore's announcement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ruma, the NAHB's incoming president, said he welcomed
the vice president's involvement in the issue but questioned such
an imposing role for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preservation of open space beyond the backyard can best be
accomplished through local comprehensive plans that bring builders,
citizens and government officials together to provide needed
housing while protecting the environment,'' his statement said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sierra Club President Carl Pope said the administration's
initiatives are ``a good first step'' toward addressing urban
sprawl, which he labeled ``the fastest growing threat to our
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1970, more than 19 million acres of rural land has been
developed, according to the Sierra Club. The current rate of
development uses 400,000 acres a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ``Better America'' bond program unveiled by Gore, some
$9.5 billion would be generated over the next 15 years for
investments by state and local governments to preserve green space,
create or restore urban parks, protect water quality and clean up
abandoned industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the taxpayer would be about $700 million over the
first five years, but the administration had no cost estimates for
the final 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Also as part of Gore's ``livable communities'' agenda, the
administration will propose spending $6.1 billion on public transit
next year, nearly 5 percent more than the current level of
spending, to ease traffic congestion . The administration also
wants to spend another $2.2 billion to help local communities come
up with better transportation.

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; You may not know the name, but you know the face.
</P>
<P>
   It's a face we've watched grow up on TV's ``The Fresh Prince of
Bel Air,'' where singer and college freshman Tatyana Ali played
younger sister Ashley alongside Will Smith for six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who was 11 when ``Fresh Prince'' started and 17 when it
ended, began her first semester at Harvard a few months ago even as
her debut single, ``Daydreamin','' was peaking at No. 6 on the
national singles chart.
</P>
<P>
   The good-natured Ali, appearing in the forthcoming feature film
``Jawbreaker,'' said working with actor-rapper Smith taught her
about comedy _ and to expect the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the camera went on, he'd do whatever he wanted,'' said
Ali, who turns 20 on Jan. 24. ``I certainly learned improvisation
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also guided Ali through the wilds of the music business.
After encouraging her to sing, Smith signed Ali to his production
company, Will Smith Enterprises, and landed a deal with Sony's MJJ
Music label. Her hip-hop-laced debut album, ``Kiss the Sky,''
co-produced by such pop-r&AMP;b hitmakers as Rodney Jenkins, Shawn
Stockman (Boyz II Men), Vincent Herbert and Narada Michael Walden,
was released in August.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he signed Ali, Smith joked: ``Because she is almost as
talented as I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who applied to 10 top colleges and was invited to attend
all of them, deferred her Harvard enrollment while working on the
album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm such a pessimist because I thought the one school that
accepts me, I'll go to,'' Ali said. ``But I got accepted to all of
them. So, I did a road trip. I knew I wanted to go to an East Coast
school. I had this whole Princeton ideal of cobblestone streets and
beautiful lawns and students sitting under the trees doing their
homework. I visited everywhere, but I really liked Boston a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Ali planned to study biological anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a class just so I would know right away,'' she
explained. ``And I know that I'm not going to major in that anymore
because I hate that class. It's a genetics class and I just can't
stand it. One of the classes I really like is African-American
studies and I'm doing really well in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali, whose parents and two teen-age sisters live in Encino,
stays in a dorm suite with five other students. At first, the
freshman class was a bit cowed having a TV star in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew I was coming,'' Ali said. ``It took about a
month for everyone to chill out. It was like little interview
sessions on every corner. The only thing that freaked me out was
during freshman social activities, kids would ask to take a picture
with me. And I didn't know how to deal with it because this was my
home. I remember I told this one girl, `I'm going to graduate with
you. We're going to take classes together and be in study groups
together and party together. It's really not that much of a big
deal.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They got over it, especially the people I live with who see me
in my robe walking down the hall with my toothbrush. They see me as
just another person. And everyone's gotten really protective of me.
A lot of people in my building who I don't necessarily know tell me
if someone's asking for me or hanging around the dorm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali has a part in Columbia-Tristar's ``Jawbreaker,'' a dark
comedy about three teen-age girls who accidentally kill their best
friend. The film, which also stars Rose McGowan and Pam Grier,
opens Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tiny role,'' Ali said. ``I play a really snobby
cheerleader who wants desperately to be prom queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali's audience expanded over the winter when she was featured on
an oft-repeated Disney Channel special also starring teen
heartthrobs 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times when I've had club dates where it seemed
the people were too old,'' Ali said. ``And I get up on stage and
I'm completely welcomed. I've done huge arena shows with thousands
of people my age, which is probably the most difficult thing to do
because you're performing in front of your peers. And then I've
done Nickelodeon shows for little kids and that's been fine. So, I
just don't know who my biggest fans are. I've been surprised a few
times.''
</P>
<P>
   One staunch admirer is Jeanann Saigbah, 13, of Lowell, Mass.,
who calls Ali ``an inspiration. She's the best. I like her as a
singer and actress and person. I think she's the nicest person I've
ever heard about. I'm her No. 1 fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali recently released the dance-oriented ``Boy You Knock Me
Out,'' the second single from ``Kiss the Sky,'' which recently hit
No. 5 on Billboard's Heatseekers album chart for new artists. When
the disc came out, she was unsure how it would be received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought no one's gonna like it, no radio station's gonna
play it, nothing will happen with it,'' Ali said. ``If people know
you as an actor, they're not always as willing to accept you as a
singer. I didn't really have a plan because this wasn't supposed to
happen. All through my career I never really had a goal so I never
had a map to show me how to get there. The only real constant in my
life is school.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali has been proving her ability on stage with weekend shows
while plans are being worked out for a tour this summer with a
backing band.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard my song (`Daydream') played live, it was
the most incredible rush I've ever experienced in my life,'' she
said. ``I was so giddy on that stage, it was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali, who attended the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks while
working on NBC's ``Fresh Prince,'' plans to move back to Los
Angeles after college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encino is my home,'' the singer said. ``Once I learned how to
drive, I was driving over the hill a lot and doing all sorts of
things all over the city. The Valley has always been good to me.'' &QL;

   &UR; CANDY MAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An eight-year-old boy is walking down the road one day when a
car pulls over next to him.
</P>
<P>
   `If you get in the car,` the driver says, `I'll give you $10 and
a piece of candy.`
</P>
<P>
   The boy refuses and keeps on walking.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, not to take no for an answer, the man
driving the car pulls over again. `How about $20 and two pieces of
candy?`
</P>
<P>
   The boy tells the man to leave him alone and keeps on walking.
</P>
<P>
   Still further down the road the man pulls over to the side road.
`OK,` he says, `this is my final offer. I'll give you $50 and all
the candy you can eat.`
</P>
<P>
   The little boy stops, goes to the car and leans in. `Look,` he
says to the driver. `You bought the Ford, Dad. You'll have to live
with it!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAKE THAT TBIRD AWAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the side of the highway waiting to catch speeding
drivers, a State Police Officer sees a car puttering along at 22
MPH. He thinks to himself, `This driver is just as dangerous as a
speeder!` So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies
-two in the front seat and three in the back - wide eyed and white
as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, says to him, `Officer, I
don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems
to be the problem?`
</P>
<P>
   `Ma'am,` the officer replies, `You weren't speeding, but you
should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a
danger to other drivers.`
</P>
<P>
   `Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed
limit exactly... Twenty-Two miles an hour!` the old woman says a
bit proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains
to her that `22` was the route number, not the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for
pointing out her error. `But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to
ask... Is everyone in this car ok? These women seem awfully shaken
and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time.` the
officer asks.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, they'll be alright in a minute officer. We just got off
Route 119.`

<P>
   &UR; Clinton critics off track (and field) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One thing Ill never forgive Bill Clinton for is lowering the bar
for the use of cliches by commentators.
</P>
<P>
   Not just commentators, actually. Anyone dragged into a
television studio to comment about the Clinton mess somehow manages
to complain about the lowering or raising of the bar. They should
be beat with it.
</P>
<P>
   The argument usually goes like this: Subjecting the president to
impeachment for lying about consensual sex lowers the bar for all
future presidents. That means, I guess, that it sets the standard
lower than it should be for removing a president. Some think the
standard should be high treason.
</P>
<P>
   But thats problematic also, since most of us dont know the
different variations of treason. What is low treason? Giving the
Russians secret recipes from the Pentagon cafeteria? The term high
treason seems to call for an act of Hollywood daring-do, like
fighting your way, Three Musketteers-style, out of the White House
with a dueling sword in one hand hand and a copy of nuclear missile
silo launch codes in the other.
</P>
<P>
   (Medium treason, I suppose, would be allowing the Chinese
ambassador access to your America Online account, like hed know
what to do with it.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there has been much raising and lowering of bars since
the Clinton scandal broke and it must stop.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it is not a good cliche because its meaning is
unclear. Most congressional reprehensibles, er, representatives,
dont know if impeaching a president for lying about sex is raising
or lowering the bar. In a sense, when you impeach someone for just
being a big dummy and not for say, fair-to-middlin treason, you are
raising the bar, not lowering it, because you are expecting more
from this guy than was expected of other presidents. You could say,
but shouldnt, that the moral behavior bar has been raised for
Clinton because that frisky sex puppy John Kennedy was never given
a chance to lie about his libidinous liberties.
</P>
<P>
   And this confusion over raising or lowering the bar occurs even
if we assume that the phrases foundation, the cliche substratum,
relates to track and field events such as the high jump or pole
vault. In these events, participants are expected to launch their
bodies OVER a bar. Causing someone to attempt to fling himself over
a bar that has been raised willy-nilly, haphazardly or arbitrarily
is unfair and dangerous, but, ultimately, fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But what if we are talking about doing the limbo? If you say
that impeaching the president for falling for a big-haired bimbo is
lowering the bar in the limbo sense, then you are saying, well, Im
not sure what you are saying, but you get the idea. Its confusing.
Especially if you start off by saying that the presidents future is
in bimbo limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The only good thing about commentators raising the bar is that
it keeps them from leveling the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians and commentators apparently all shop at
Beltway Sports Cliche Warehouse. They are forever raising bars,
leveling playing fields, calling time outs and blowing whistles.
Who wants a level playing field? I want the playing field to be set
at a 45-degree angle and I want to be running downhill with a wind
at my back, by god.
</P>
<P>
   So why is going downhill considered a bad thing? You would think
that if your career were racing downhill, that would be great. You
never hear the compliment, Hey, I hear your career is going uphill!
Fabulous!
</P>
<P>
   I think Clinton needs to get off the playing field, level or
otherwise, climb out of the high jump pit or limbo line and hit the
showers. And while hes at it, he could come clean.

IN `TITANIC,' IT'S WATER AND A WHOLE LOT MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In ``1776,'' Peter Stone, who wrote the story and
the book for the musical, uses the famous line attributed to
Benjamin Franklin, ``We must indeed hang together, or most
assuredly we shall all hang separately.'' In ``Titanic,'' which
just arrived for an eight-week run at the Ahmanson Theatre, Stone's
message is similar, though unspoken: We most assuredly are all in
the same boat.
</P>
<P>
   It is a point brought most vividly home toward the end of
``Titanic,'' which won five Tony Awards (including best musical),
when 12 doomed men _ from the super rich to lowly emigrants _ stare
out through portholes on the listing ship watching the last of the
lifeboats depart, contemplating why they deserve such a fate. Each
is separate, framed like a portrait in a locket.
</P>
<P>
   The Titanic's sinking after hitting an iceberg on April 14,
1912, may have taken the greatest toll on the third-class
passengers, but the tragedy did not spare those in the first and
second classes. And perhaps that is what is at the bottom of the
continual interest in the tale of the ill-fated ocean liner. It was
a cold ocean that overwhelmed the divisions in classes.
</P>
<P>
   And the differences of the classes is very much at the heart of
``Titanic's'' splendid opening sequence, which builds grandly both
musically and dramatically when the passengers and crew are
introduced as they ready for boarding. Despite their differences,
they have one thing in common _ all are in awe of the technological
wonder before them, a ``floating city'' as its architect, Thomas
Andrews (Kevin Gray), describes it in the prologue.
</P>
<P>
   For those in third class, the ship is a promise of a better life
in America, ``ship of dreams.'' For those in second class _
merchants, professionals and the socially ambitious _ it was the
``a chance of a lifetime,'' an opportunity to be near the rich. For
those in first class _ including John Jacob Astor (Rob Donohue),
Benjamin Guggenheim (Ken Krugman) and Isidor Strauss (S. Marc
Jordan), the owner of Macy's department store _ it was their
God-given right to be on the greatest luxury liner in the world.
All three classes board separately, each assigned or consigned to
its appropriate station.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions are also brought home within the crew of the ship.
After the order is given to increase speed (thus hastening the
ship's doom), from seven decks down in the boiler room, the stoker
Barrett (Brian d'Arcy James from the original Broadway cast)
passionately sings ``the orders they propose above we execute down
here.'' Then he reflects how little his life has changed from what
it was in the coal mines, for despite being on a ``wonder ship,''
he is still ``below.''
</P>
<P>
   It is like a number of other moments in ``Titanic,'' poignant
but curiously not very moving. There is much about the musical that
is impressive, though. The staging is inventive yet functional
within the story, even dazzling at times. The singing is
exceptional, with too many fine voices to mention here. And besides
Gray and James, there is one fine performance after another,
including those of William Parry as the captain; David Pittu as the
first officer Murdoch; Adam Heller as Ismay, the owner; Melissa
Bell as third-class passenger Kate McGowen, who longs to be a
lady's maid in America; Dale Sandish as the radioman; and Liz
McConahay as Alice, the second-class passenger who longs to rub
elbows with the rich.
</P>
<P>
   It bears mentioning that so well did Heller play his part as
Ismay _ who bore much responsibility for the sinking yet who
escaped on a lifeboat _ that the audience didn't know whether to
cheer or boo during the curtain call. But the audience is already
familiar with his role from history. Most of the other characters,
however, are merely representative, rarely filling in the whole
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite its many attributes and wonderful touches,
``Titanic'' never quite coalesces _ the divisions are too great,
and the individual stories too often seem to hang there rather than
being woven into the fabric of the musical. We only get snapshots
of the passengers and the crew, making it difficult for the
audience to become emotionally involved with the characters.
</P>
<P>
   During the prologue, Andrews stands in front of a giant
blueprint of the ship. It is imposing, but it also is symbolic of
the production. Stone and Maury Yeston, who wrote the music, have
set themselves up with a daunting, nearly impossible task. The tale
is well-known, especially after the hoopla from the movie, although
the musical premiered on Broadway first. The miscalculations,
arrogance, hubris and stupidity that contributed to the tragedy are
well-documented, but it would have been remiss not to include it
all in the story.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to dismiss ``Titanic.'' It is fairly
entertaining if not always engaging. As a ``popera'' (there is very
little dialogue), the music is often more functional than
memorable, with few hummable tunes. But, again, there are some
noteworthy numbers besides those in the stirring opening segment,
particularly the haunting ``No Moon'' and lyrical ``Autumn'' just
before the collision with the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to that tableau of the 12 men (one, the bellboy,
played by a woman, Rebecca Lowman), the strengths and weaknesses of
the musical can be seen. It is a powerful image yet makes the
characters interchangeable. Perhaps that is the point, but in
theater, equality has a tendency to flatten things out.
</P>
<P>
   And the last thing we'd expect is smooth sailing from the
Titanic. &QL;

   ``I haven't bought a car in six years,'' Mr. Clinton says. He
may want to bone up. If things don't work out in the Senate he may
be selling them.
</P>
<P>
   _ (Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   My companion and I had been waiting for a legal two-day parking
spot to become available on the Upper East Side. We sat in our car,
hoping someone would leave. After an hour, we suddenly spotted
brake lights and knew a car was moving. It was a half-block from
our position.
</P>
<P>
   I jumped from our car to run and hold the spot. As soon as I
stood in the middle of the empty space and my companion began to
back our car down the street, another car wheeled around the
corner. The driver saw me standing there and quickly nosed his car
toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!'' I shouted. He shouted back, ``This is New York, and
you can't save spots!'' I didn't leave my spot, but I began to
plead with him, telling him we had been waiting more than a hour
and wouldn't he please move on. My companion saw us shouting and
jumped out of our car and began shouting also.
</P>
<P>
   We were getting nowhere. The driver threatened to run me down.
My companion shouted to the driver, ``If you take that spot, I'm
going to hem you in.'' The other driver stopped shouting. He rolled
down his window as my companion rushed back to our car. He said in
a plaintive voice: ``Hem? What does he mean, he'll hem me in?
What's hem? What's hem?''
</P>
<P>
   I know a good thing when I hear it. I quietly answered, ``If you
know what's good for you, you'll let us have this spot before he
starts hemming.'' Before he drove off, the driver shouted out to my
companion, ``I'll leave, but for her sake, not yours.'' So we were
able to sleep late next morning without moving our car _ all
because of a word I thought everyone knew.

   Zelda Randell was rushing to Pennsylvania Station when she
spotted the panhandler at Broadway and 45th Street. ``Free the
whales, free the whales,'' he called out. He continued: ``Free
Willie, free Willie, free Willie. My name is Willie!'' When the
smiles and laughter subsided, Willie's financial situation improved
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Heywood Hale Broun was on a Columbus Avenue bus when he observed
an elderly couple boarding. They settled in opposite him, and the
man addressed a couple of remarks to his partner without getting a
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' he said. ``You don't like talking to
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind talking to you,'' she replied. ``I just don't
like listening to you.''
</P>
<P>
   They both laughed and relapsed into silence.
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of fresh red roses, the stems tightly wrapped in silver
foil, rested on the taxi's divider between driver and passenger.
``Beautiful roses,'' said Carol Shedlin, the somewhat surprised
passenger. ``Yours,'' the driver replied. ``I always buy a dozen
roses for passengers to enjoy and give them to my last fare of the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who gets around town on a bicycle, I don't expect
cabdrivers to give me any kind of break. I know they'll cut me off,
honk their horns at me, yell something offensive as they pass, stop
suddenly in front of me to pick up or drop off passengers _ all the
stuff that brings on road rage. It's only recently that this
behavior stopped bothering me. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   First there were the words shouted by a passing cabby which, as
usual, I ignored until I realized the last word I heard was
``gloves,'' as in ``You dropped your gloves.'' Sure enough, the
pocket where my gloves had been was empty. As I pedaled back, a
second driver delivered the same message, and so did a third.
</P>
<P>
   My gloves were lying on the pavement a block north. As I
remounted and got back onto taxi-ridden lower Fifth Avenue, I
realized something had changed. Those yellow cabs with their
hard-charging drivers were no longer the enemy. I now saw them as a
bunch of people chasing a buck as best they could while still
caring whether an aged bike rider retrieved his gloves.
</P>

<P>
   It was a Saturday afternoon, the train was relatively empty and
I had settled down in my corner subway seat on the Broadway line,
opened the paper and prepared for a half-hour of reading.
</P>
<P>
   I scarcely noticed the arrival of three tall post-teen-age males
until I became aware that a match had been struck and there was a
flame. For a moment, the anti-subway anxieties of my suburban
middle-aged peers passed through my mind. Maybe I should start to
drive into the city or use Metro North trains. What were those guys
up to? I put down my paper to take a good look.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them had finished lighting the pink candles on top of a
pack of Twinkies. They presented it to the third, singing ``Happy

   Her first answer was laudable _ she wrote that yes, she would

   &UR; CANDY MAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An eight-year-old boy is walking down the road one day when a
car pulls over next to him.
</P>
<P>
   `If you get in the car,` the driver says, `I'll give you $10 and
a piece of candy.`
</P>
<P>
   The boy refuses and keeps on walking.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, not to take no for an answer, the man
driving the car pulls over again. `How about $20 and two pieces of
candy?`
</P>
<P>
   The boy tells the man to leave him alone and keeps on walking.
</P>
<P>
   Still further down the road the man pulls over to the side road.
`OK,` he says, `this is my final offer. I'll give you $50 and all
the candy you can eat.`
</P>
<P>
   The little boy stops, goes to the car and leans in. `Look,` he
says to the driver. `You bought the Ford, Dad. You'll have to live
with it!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAKE THAT TBIRD AWAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the side of the highway waiting to catch speeding
drivers, a State Police Officer sees a car puttering along at 22
MPH. He thinks to himself, `This driver is just as dangerous as a
speeder!` So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies
-two in the front seat and three in the back - wide eyed and white
as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, says to him, `Officer, I
don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems
to be the problem?`
</P>
<P>
   `Ma'am,` the officer replies, `You weren't speeding, but you
should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a
danger to other drivers.`
</P>
<P>
   `Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed
limit exactly... Twenty-Two miles an hour!` the old woman says a
bit proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains
to her that `22` was the route number, not the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for
pointing out her error. `But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to
ask... Is everyone in this car ok? These women seem awfully shaken
and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time.` the
officer asks.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, they'll be alright in a minute officer. We just got off
Route 119.`

   &UR; Clinton critics off track (and field) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One thing Ill never forgive Bill Clinton for is lowering the bar
for the use of cliches by commentators.
</P>
<P>
   Not just commentators, actually. Anyone dragged into a
television studio to comment about the Clinton mess somehow manages
to complain about the lowering or raising of the bar. They should
be beat with it.
</P>
<P>
   The argument usually goes like this: Subjecting the president to
impeachment for lying about consensual sex lowers the bar for all
future presidents. That means, I guess, that it sets the standard
lower than it should be for removing a president. Some think the
standard should be high treason.
</P>
<P>
   But thats problematic also, since most of us dont know the
different variations of treason. What is low treason? Giving the
Russians secret recipes from the Pentagon cafeteria? The term high
treason seems to call for an act of Hollywood daring-do, like
fighting your way, Three Musketteers-style, out of the White House
with a dueling sword in one hand hand and a copy of nuclear missile
silo launch codes in the other.
</P>
<P>
   (Medium treason, I suppose, would be allowing the Chinese
ambassador access to your America Online account, like hed know
what to do with it.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there has been much raising and lowering of bars since
the Clinton scandal broke and it must stop.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it is not a good cliche because its meaning is
unclear. Most congressional reprehensibles, er, representatives,
dont know if impeaching a president for lying about sex is raising
or lowering the bar. In a sense, when you impeach someone for just
being a big dummy and not for say, fair-to-middlin treason, you are
raising the bar, not lowering it, because you are expecting more
from this guy than was expected of other presidents. You could say,
but shouldnt, that the moral behavior bar has been raised for
Clinton because that frisky sex puppy John Kennedy was never given
a chance to lie about his libidinous liberties.
</P>
<P>
   And this confusion over raising or lowering the bar occurs even
if we assume that the phrases foundation, the cliche substratum,
relates to track and field events such as the high jump or pole
vault. In these events, participants are expected to launch their
bodies OVER a bar. Causing someone to attempt to fling himself over
a bar that has been raised willy-nilly, haphazardly or arbitrarily
is unfair and dangerous, but, ultimately, fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But what if we are talking about doing the limbo? If you say
that impeaching the president for falling for a big-haired bimbo is
lowering the bar in the limbo sense, then you are saying, well, Im
not sure what you are saying, but you get the idea. Its confusing.
Especially if you start off by saying that the presidents future is
in bimbo limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The only good thing about commentators raising the bar is that
it keeps them from leveling the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians and commentators apparently all shop at
Beltway Sports Cliche Warehouse. They are forever raising bars,
leveling playing fields, calling time outs and blowing whistles.
Who wants a level playing field? I want the playing field to be set
at a 45-degree angle and I want to be running downhill with a wind
at my back, by god.
</P>
<P>
   So why is going downhill considered a bad thing? You would think
that if your career were racing downhill, that would be great. You
never hear the compliment, Hey, I hear your career is going uphill!
Fabulous!
</P>
<P>
   I think Clinton needs to get off the playing field, level or
otherwise, climb out of the high jump pit or limbo line and hit the
showers. And while hes at it, he could come clean.

 &HT;    SENATORS TO SEEK TO OPEN IMPEACHMENT DELIBERATIONS
 &HT;    440&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two senators launched a campaign Monday to warn the
public that after round-the-clock news coverage at the start of
President Clinton's impeachment trial, they may be closed out of
the final stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many American people know that our debates are
going to be secret,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said as he announced
an effort to overturn a longstanding rule that requires the
senators to shut the doors at the trial's end and decide the fate
of the president in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned through the years that sunshine is best
political disinfectant,'' Harkin said as he attempted to enlist the
public to protest the secrecy rule.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Rule 24,'' the procedure would allow open coverage
for arguments and other trial proceedings, including any witness
testimony, but not for debates on motions or deliberations on the
final verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who is co-sponsoring the
Harkin resolution: ``It would be a profound mistake for us to start
off for the first two weeks, and then all of a sudden, when we go
into our deliberations and have our debate on these important
questions, we essentially shut the public out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said it would be necessary for ``closure'' and
``healing'' to have all of the Senate debates open for TV coverage.
Turning off the cameras and closing out the press would ``invite
distrust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both senators have been staunch defenders of the president.
Harkin dismissed the case against Clinton on Fox-News TV as a
``sham'' and ``a pile of dung.'' Wellstone has offered similar,
although less colorful, sentiments. But the two Democrats insisted
that partisanship played no part in the secrecy issue.
</P>
<P>
   They said they have found sympathy from colleagues in both
parties for opening the deliberations, although none has have
publicly joined them.
</P>
<P>
   It may require strong public pressure for the Harkin-Wellstone
proposal to prevail. A two-thirds majority is needed to overturn
the impeachment procedure, which was first drawn up for the
Senate's impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   The Harkin-Wellstone proposal ``obviously has an uphill
battle,'' said Ed Amorosi, spokesman for Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., a
member of the Senate leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gregg is open'' to the idea, his aide said. But like most
members, the senator is awaiting the advice of senior members such
as the Senate's unofficial historian, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., or
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Ala. Neither of those senators had an immediate
response to the measure to open all proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One factor that could could work against the measure is the
experience last Friday, when deeply divided senators met in closed
session and emerged with a unanimous accord on ground rules for the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Senators have lavishly extolled that private session, and some
have suggested that it should be a model.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is noteworthy that we achieved our bipartisan agreement in
a closed session,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told CNN. ``We are
...much better able to relate to each other and deal with each
other and reach compromises when we are not under the glare of the
cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said that if the cameras are allowed, the Senate would
be more likely to become ``a sort of feuding bunch of people with
partisan agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., agreed in part, saying that he
would object to the Harkin-Wellstone resolution if it required that
all procedures be open. ``I think our motivation ought to be to
have whatever can be public be public,'' Dodd said, adding that he
wanted to keep the option of closing proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that view, Harkin said that some closed-door
meetings of the Senate ``do have a certain benefit,'' but he said
that official proceedings of the full Senate must be conducted in
public.

   ``I haven't bought a car in six years,'' Mr. Clinton says. He

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   My companion and I had been waiting for a legal two-day parking
spot to become available on the Upper East Side. We sat in our car,
hoping someone would leave. After an hour, we suddenly spotted
brake lights and knew a car was moving. It was a half-block from
our position.
</P>
<P>
   I jumped from our car to run and hold the spot. As soon as I
stood in the middle of the empty space and my companion began to
back our car down the street, another car wheeled around the
corner. The driver saw me standing there and quickly nosed his car
toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!'' I shouted. He shouted back, ``This is New York, and
you can't save spots!'' I didn't leave my spot, but I began to
plead with him, telling him we had been waiting more than a hour
and wouldn't he please move on. My companion saw us shouting and
jumped out of our car and began shouting also.
</P>
<P>
   We were getting nowhere. The driver threatened to run me down.
My companion shouted to the driver, ``If you take that spot, I'm
going to hem you in.'' The other driver stopped shouting. He rolled
down his window as my companion rushed back to our car. He said in
a plaintive voice: ``Hem? What does he mean, he'll hem me in?
What's hem? What's hem?''
</P>
<P>
   I know a good thing when I hear it. I quietly answered, ``If you
know what's good for you, you'll let us have this spot before he
starts hemming.'' Before he drove off, the driver shouted out to my
companion, ``I'll leave, but for her sake, not yours.'' So we were
able to sleep late next morning without moving our car _ all
because of a word I thought everyone knew.

   Zelda Randell was rushing to Pennsylvania Station when she
spotted the panhandler at Broadway and 45th Street. ``Free the
whales, free the whales,'' he called out. He continued: ``Free
Willie, free Willie, free Willie. My name is Willie!'' When the

   Heywood Hale Broun was on a Columbus Avenue bus when he observed
an elderly couple boarding. They settled in opposite him, and the
man addressed a couple of remarks to his partner without getting a
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' he said. ``You don't like talking to
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind talking to you,'' she replied. ``I just don't
like listening to you.''
</P>
<P>
   They both laughed and relapsed into silence.

   A bunch of fresh red roses, the stems tightly wrapped in silver
foil, rested on the taxi's divider between driver and passenger.
``Beautiful roses,'' said Carol Shedlin, the somewhat surprised
passenger. ``Yours,'' the driver replied. ``I always buy a dozen
roses for passengers to enjoy and give them to my last fare of the
day.''

   As someone who gets around town on a bicycle, I don't expect
cabdrivers to give me any kind of break. I know they'll cut me off,
honk their horns at me, yell something offensive as they pass, stop
suddenly in front of me to pick up or drop off passengers _ all the
stuff that brings on road rage. It's only recently that this
behavior stopped bothering me. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   First there were the words shouted by a passing cabby which, as
usual, I ignored until I realized the last word I heard was
``gloves,'' as in ``You dropped your gloves.'' Sure enough, the
pocket where my gloves had been was empty. As I pedaled back, a
second driver delivered the same message, and so did a third.
</P>
<P>
   My gloves were lying on the pavement a block north. As I
remounted and got back onto taxi-ridden lower Fifth Avenue, I
realized something had changed. Those yellow cabs with their
hard-charging drivers were no longer the enemy. I now saw them as a
bunch of people chasing a buck as best they could while still
caring whether an aged bike rider retrieved his gloves.

   It was a Saturday afternoon, the train was relatively empty and
I had settled down in my corner subway seat on the Broadway line,
opened the paper and prepared for a half-hour of reading.
</P>
<P>
   I scarcely noticed the arrival of three tall post-teen-age males
until I became aware that a match had been struck and there was a
flame. For a moment, the anti-subway anxieties of my suburban
middle-aged peers passed through my mind. Maybe I should start to
drive into the city or use Metro North trains. What were those guys
up to? I put down my paper to take a good look.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them had finished lighting the pink candles on top of a
pack of Twinkies. They presented it to the third, singing ``Happy
Birthday'' at the top of their lungs. The trio got off at the next
stop, munching the Twinkies.

   It was a Broadway local subway train, and Mark Shapiro was
reading over the shoulder of a high school student doing homework.
The assignment was a series of questions apparently meant to induce
the student to think gravely about her life, its choices and
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Her first answer was laudable _ she wrote that yes, she would
remain engaged to a man who fell seriously ill subsequent to the
engagement. Her next answer was more succinct. Asked, `What would
you do if you learned there would be a nuclear world war in one
week?' she offered this reply: ``Move.''

   &UR; CANDY MAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An eight-year-old boy is walking down the road one day when a
car pulls over next to him.
</P>
<P>
   `If you get in the car,` the driver says, `I'll give you $10 and
a piece of candy.`
</P>
<P>
   The boy refuses and keeps on walking.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, not to take no for an answer, the man
driving the car pulls over again. `How about $20 and two pieces of
candy?`
</P>
<P>
   The boy tells the man to leave him alone and keeps on walking.
</P>
<P>
   Still further down the road the man pulls over to the side road.
`OK,` he says, `this is my final offer. I'll give you $50 and all
the candy you can eat.`
</P>
<P>
   The little boy stops, goes to the car and leans in. `Look,` he
says to the driver. `You bought the Ford, Dad. You'll have to live
with it!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAKE THAT TBIRD AWAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the side of the highway waiting to catch speeding
drivers, a State Police Officer sees a car puttering along at 22
MPH. He thinks to himself, `This driver is just as dangerous as a
speeder!` So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies
-two in the front seat and three in the back - wide eyed and white
as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, says to him, `Officer, I
don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems
to be the problem?`
</P>
<P>
   `Ma'am,` the officer replies, `You weren't speeding, but you
should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a
danger to other drivers.`
</P>
<P>
   `Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed
limit exactly... Twenty-Two miles an hour!` the old woman says a
bit proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains
to her that `22` was the route number, not the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for
pointing out her error. `But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to
ask... Is everyone in this car ok? These women seem awfully shaken
and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time.` the
officer asks.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, they'll be alright in a minute officer. We just got off
Route 119.`

   &UR; Clinton critics off track (and field) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One thing Ill never forgive Bill Clinton for is lowering the bar
for the use of cliches by commentators.
</P>
<P>
   Not just commentators, actually. Anyone dragged into a
television studio to comment about the Clinton mess somehow manages
to complain about the lowering or raising of the bar. They should
be beat with it.
</P>
<P>
   The argument usually goes like this: Subjecting the president to
impeachment for lying about consensual sex lowers the bar for all
future presidents. That means, I guess, that it sets the standard
lower than it should be for removing a president. Some think the
standard should be high treason.
</P>
<P>
   But thats problematic also, since most of us dont know the
different variations of treason. What is low treason? Giving the
Russians secret recipes from the Pentagon cafeteria? The term high
treason seems to call for an act of Hollywood daring-do, like
fighting your way, Three Musketteers-style, out of the White House
with a dueling sword in one hand hand and a copy of nuclear missile
silo launch codes in the other.
</P>
<P>
   (Medium treason, I suppose, would be allowing the Chinese
ambassador access to your America Online account, like hed know
what to do with it.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there has been much raising and lowering of bars since
the Clinton scandal broke and it must stop.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it is not a good cliche because its meaning is
unclear. Most congressional reprehensibles, er, representatives,
dont know if impeaching a president for lying about sex is raising
or lowering the bar. In a sense, when you impeach someone for just
being a big dummy and not for say, fair-to-middlin treason, you are
raising the bar, not lowering it, because you are expecting more
from this guy than was expected of other presidents. You could say,
but shouldnt, that the moral behavior bar has been raised for
Clinton because that frisky sex puppy John Kennedy was never given
a chance to lie about his libidinous liberties.
</P>
<P>
   And this confusion over raising or lowering the bar occurs even
if we assume that the phrases foundation, the cliche substratum,
relates to track and field events such as the high jump or pole
vault. In these events, participants are expected to launch their
bodies OVER a bar. Causing someone to attempt to fling himself over
a bar that has been raised willy-nilly, haphazardly or arbitrarily
is unfair and dangerous, but, ultimately, fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But what if we are talking about doing the limbo? If you say
that impeaching the president for falling for a big-haired bimbo is
lowering the bar in the limbo sense, then you are saying, well, Im
not sure what you are saying, but you get the idea. Its confusing.
Especially if you start off by saying that the presidents future is
in bimbo limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The only good thing about commentators raising the bar is that
it keeps them from leveling the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians and commentators apparently all shop at
Beltway Sports Cliche Warehouse. They are forever raising bars,
leveling playing fields, calling time outs and blowing whistles.
Who wants a level playing field? I want the playing field to be set
at a 45-degree angle and I want to be running downhill with a wind
at my back, by god.
</P>
<P>
   So why is going downhill considered a bad thing? You would think
that if your career were racing downhill, that would be great. You
never hear the compliment, Hey, I hear your career is going uphill!
Fabulous!
</P>
<P>
   I think Clinton needs to get off the playing field, level or
otherwise, climb out of the high jump pit or limbo line and hit the
showers. And while hes at it, he could come clean.

   ``I haven't bought a car in six years,'' Mr. Clinton says. He

<P>
   My companion and I had been waiting for a legal two-day parking
spot to become available on the Upper East Side. We sat in our car,
hoping someone would leave. After an hour, we suddenly spotted
brake lights and knew a car was moving. It was a half-block from
our position.
</P>
<P>
   I jumped from our car to run and hold the spot. As soon as I
stood in the middle of the empty space and my companion began to
back our car down the street, another car wheeled around the
corner. The driver saw me standing there and quickly nosed his car
toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!'' I shouted. He shouted back, ``This is New York, and
you can't save spots!'' I didn't leave my spot, but I began to
plead with him, telling him we had been waiting more than a hour
and wouldn't he please move on. My companion saw us shouting and
jumped out of our car and began shouting also.
</P>
<P>
   We were getting nowhere. The driver threatened to run me down.
My companion shouted to the driver, ``If you take that spot, I'm
going to hem you in.'' The other driver stopped shouting. He rolled
down his window as my companion rushed back to our car. He said in
a plaintive voice: ``Hem? What does he mean, he'll hem me in?
What's hem? What's hem?''
</P>
<P>
   I know a good thing when I hear it. I quietly answered, ``If you
know what's good for you, you'll let us have this spot before he
starts hemming.'' Before he drove off, the driver shouted out to my
companion, ``I'll leave, but for her sake, not yours.'' So we were
able to sleep late next morning without moving our car _ all
because of a word I thought everyone knew.

passenger. ``Yours,'' the driver replied. ``I always buy a dozen
roses for passengers to enjoy and give them to my last fare of the
day.''

   As someone who gets around town on a bicycle, I don't expect
cabdrivers to give me any kind of break. I know they'll cut me off,
honk their horns at me, yell something offensive as they pass, stop
suddenly in front of me to pick up or drop off passengers _ all the
stuff that brings on road rage. It's only recently that this
behavior stopped bothering me. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   First there were the words shouted by a passing cabby which, as
usual, I ignored until I realized the last word I heard was
``gloves,'' as in ``You dropped your gloves.'' Sure enough, the
pocket where my gloves had been was empty. As I pedaled back, a
second driver delivered the same message, and so did a third.
</P>
<P>
   My gloves were lying on the pavement a block north. As I
remounted and got back onto taxi-ridden lower Fifth Avenue, I
realized something had changed. Those yellow cabs with their
hard-charging drivers were no longer the enemy. I now saw them as a
bunch of people chasing a buck as best they could while still
caring whether an aged bike rider retrieved his gloves.

   _ GENE EPSTEIN

<P>
   It was a Saturday afternoon, the train was relatively empty and
I had settled down in my corner subway seat on the Broadway line,
opened the paper and prepared for a half-hour of reading.
</P>
<P>
   I scarcely noticed the arrival of three tall post-teen-age males
until I became aware that a match had been struck and there was a
flame. For a moment, the anti-subway anxieties of my suburban
middle-aged peers passed through my mind. Maybe I should start to
drive into the city or use Metro North trains. What were those guys
up to? I put down my paper to take a good look.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them had finished lighting the pink candles on top of a
pack of Twinkies. They presented it to the third, singing ``Happy
Birthday'' at the top of their lungs. The trio got off at the next
stop, munching the Twinkies.
</P>
<P>
   Go by car and miss a scene like that _ never!
</P>
<P>
   _ BERENICE COHEN
</P>
<P>
   It was a Broadway local subway train, and Mark Shapiro was
reading over the shoulder of a high school student doing homework.
The assignment was a series of questions apparently meant to induce
the student to think gravely about her life, its choices and
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Her first answer was laudable _ she wrote that yes, she would
remain engaged to a man who fell seriously ill subsequent to the
engagement. Her next answer was more succinct. Asked, `What would
you do if you learned there would be a nuclear world war in one
week?' she offered this reply: ``Move.''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Ackerman was visiting her grandchildren when she saw her
4-year-old grandson standing on a step stool at the kitchen sink.
He was holding a sports watch under running water.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ackerman: ``Connor, what are you doing to that watch?''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``I'm testing it to see if it's waterproof.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ackerman: ``If it's not waterproof, you will ruin it.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor: ``That's OK, it belongs to my sister.''

   What would the New Year be without what could be, but then again
might not be, the final Titanic anecdote? This one is the message
Kal Noselson saw on a T-shirt: ``It Sank. Get Over It!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday in Minnesota, former professional wrestler Jesse
'The Body' Ventura was sworn in as the state's new governor. In a
surprise move, he announced he's quitting politics because it's too
fake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new poll, Mark McGwire has a higher
favorability rating than the Pope. Apparently, the Pope took the
news pretty hard because he immediately started taking steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recent interview, Cher denies the popular rumor that she
had a rib removed to make her waist smaller. She said she had a rib
removed so scientists could make Calista Flockhart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As part of the settlement of the recent tobacco lawsuit, all
cigarette ads had to be removed from Times Square. Don't worry,
folks, it's still okay to smoke crack there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The lockout is over. The NBA and players union decided to play
a shortened season that's going to last three months. In other
words, about five times as long as a Dennis Rodman's marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to City Hall, Mayor Giuliani has performed over 120
weddings since he became mayor. Not only that, he attended the
bachelor parties and arrested over 120 strippers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the FDA approved a new drug that helps dogs deal
with depression. Of course, the leading cause of depression among
dogs is that they've had their gonads cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recent interview, Pamela Anderson said that if she were
Hillary, she would leave President Clinton. In response, the
President said, 'If Pamela Anderson were Hillary, none of this
would have happened in the first place.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the opening of the impeachment trial, all 100 senators
swore under oath that they would be impartial. Immediately after
taking the oath, Republican Senator Trent Lott said, 'Now, let's
get back to throwing Bubba out on his ass.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 50 out of 700 seats in the Senate gallery were made
available to the American public. The other 650 seats are taken up
by women who may be called to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Burt Reynolds recently filmed a commercial for an eyeglasses
store in London, and in this commercial he didn't wear his toupee.
Mainly because when Reynolds arrived in London, customs officials
demanded the toupee be quarantined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a new poll in Details Magazine, Pamela Anderson
is the celebrity that people think has the most sex. I was in the
article, too, chosen as the celebrity who spends the most time
thinking about Pamela Anderson having sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the White House press secretary, President
Clinton didn't watch any of the impeachment proceedings yesterday.
So, today, in an effort to get him to watch, a lot of senators wore
halter tops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of watching the impeachment trial yesterday, President
Clinton spent the afternoon having lunch with Al Gore. After lunch
with Gore, President Clinton said, 'It turns out there is something
more boring than the impeachment trial.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Rodman announced this morning that he's going to sit
out the NBA season. Apparently, now that Rodman is married, he
wants to take some time off and try to get himself pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday in Los Angeles, a woman was arrested for breaking
into Brad Pitt's house. Reportedly, police were notified by several
women who were also trying to break into Brad Pitt's house.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM 'WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has Larry Flynt behind him, exposing Republicans in
Hustler Magazine. The Republicans have Star Magazine talking about
Clinton's illegitimate kid. This is a very highbrow war they're
fighting. Right now, there are politicians all over the country
telling their campaign managers, 'Get me on the cover of Big
Jugs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Flynt, of Hustler Magazine, says that he will announce
next week the name of another Republican who had an extra-marital
affair. In a related story, the House this week has repealed the
Americans with Disabilities Act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to testimony made public this week, Linda Tripp says
she may have seen billing records from Hillary Clinton's law firm
in a safe in Vince Foster's office. It might have been billing
records, or it might have been Tripp's monthly statement from
Krispy Kreme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are allegations this week that President Clinton has a
13-year-old love child from an encounter with an Arkansas
prostitute. When the teen was questioned by reporters, he
apologized and then beat up an Iraqi kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chief Justice William Rehnquist swore in the Senate, he
wore a robe with gold stripes that he designed himself after seeing
a Gilbert and Sullivan show. Judge Rehnquist, is there something
you want to tell us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be just 50 seats available to the general public
for the President's impeachment trial, on a first-come, first-serve
basis. However, Senate officials want to issue a warning: people in
the first row could get sprayed by evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a Playboy interview, Pamela Anderson, who left her husband
after he beat her, says she cannot understand why Hillary Clinton
is sticking with her husband after all he's done. Because he is the
most powerful man in the world, not a drummer for an 80s hair
band.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Ventura, the new governor of Minnesota, has suggested
that his wife be paid a salary of $25 thousand a year to be the
state's First Lady. Her official duties will include wearing a
bikini and holding up cardboard signs during state functions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA lockout is finally over and although most parties are
happy, Patrick Ewing still feels the players are treated unfairly.
Ewing was quoted as saying, 'The owners want us to go back to horse
and buggies.' Yeah, horse and buggies. Even the sixth man on the
Amish basketball team drives a Navigator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen years after being fired as the manager of the New
York Yankees, Hall-of-Famer Yogi Berra made up with George
Steinbrenner. When asked about the peace making, Yogi didn't
disappoint, coming up with another one of his trademark
'Yogi-isms:' 'Steinbrenner's a douche bag.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod Stewart and his wife, Rachel Hunter, are divorcing after
eight years of marriage. Many blame it on the wide age difference
between Rachel and the new teenager Rod wants to nail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, the FDA approved a Prozac-type drug for dogs who
are depressed. Which is good, because it's hard for dogs to get
therapy since they're never allowed on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Stewart, the former head of Marvel Comics, has been
appointed the director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in hopes
that he can save the financially slumping shrine in Cleveland. My
spider sense is tingling and it tells me the problem is location,
location, location.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The children's television show 'Zoom' is returning to PBS
after 20 years. Just when you got that song out of your head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On this week in history in 1992 at a state function in Tokyo,
George Bush vomited into the lap of the Japanese prime minister.
Later, little-known White House secretary Linda Tripp advised the
prime minister to hold onto the pants and not wash them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pennsylvania Legislature is considering a bill that would
prevent drivers from starting their cars until a built-in
breathalyzer checks for alcohol. If a trace of alcohol is found, it
will cause the car's horn to beep, but if a lot of alcohol is
detected, the car will start and drive you to an old girlfriend's
house.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``People stay out all night drinking on New Year's Eve, they get
sick, they eat cake, cookies, smoke cigarettes, people look like
hell, then you ask them what their New Year's resolution is, they
say, 'I'm gonna take better care of myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 -- quite a year. Do you realize before this year the term
'Have a Cigar' wasn't even considered a pick-up line?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And a year of contrasts. 1998 brought us Linda Tripp and
Viagra. So, sexually, we come out even, 'cause one cancels the
other out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, some good news today about this whole stupid
impeachment thing. The Democrats and the Republicans have agreed to
a short trial. When President Clinton was told about it, he said,
'Great, I love a quickie!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the New York Post, Lynda Tripp is house hunting.
She wants a bigger house. Wouldn't it be easier just to go on a
diet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Glad the NBA lockout is over? This is gonna be tough for the
Clippers. Because they gotta squeeze 82 games worth of losing into
52 games now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood the lockout. Like Shaquille O'Neal. Why
lock him out of a basketball court? Sure, lock him out of a
recording studio, maybe a movie set, but not a basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a man in Kenya has found a way to make paper out of
elephant dung. Paper out of dung. Don't we have that already? It's
called the National Enquirer.''

murder rate on Earth. In 1993 a poll of villagers revealed that 50
percent of their immediate male ancestors had died from shotgun
blasts. (The traditional Achuar greeting is ``Pujamik'' _ ``Are you

place to understand the violence within us all. Mary Roach, a

   The Vedas, texts dating from some 3,500 years ago, made no

The people of the Indus Valley _ a stupendously successful

created one of the world's first written languages, and thrived in
an area twice the size of Egypt and Mesopotamia for 700 years. What

   Miguel never recalled when they actually began _ the feeble,
quivering heartbeats he experienced. The first attacks were brief.
But when a cold he caught from his daughter kept him in bed, he
knew something was wrong. His feet and ankles began to swell, and
he couldn't get air. He spent an entire night bolt upright (since
he could no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing. Doctors
determined that Miguel was suffering from Chagas' disease, named
after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist to expose the secret life
of Trypanosoma cruzi, a single-celled protozoan that can burrow
into heart muscle. Claire Panosian, a professor of medicine in the
division of infectious diseases and director of travel and tropical
medicine at UCLA Medical Center, reports on treating Miguel.

   The Vedas, texts dating from some 3,500 years ago, made no
mention of it. Nor did the Bible. No pyramids or burial mounds
marked the area as the site of an ancient power. Yet 4,600 years
ago, great cities arose along the floodplains of the ancient Indus
and Saraswati rivers in what is now Pakistan and northwest India.
The people of the Indus Valley _ a stupendously successful
civilization _ built some of the world's first planned cities,
created one of the world's first written languages, and thrived in
an area twice the size of Egypt and Mesopotamia for 700 years. What
happened to them? Shanti Menon, a researcher/reporter for Discover
magazine, reports on this ancient, prosperous culture.

   Miguel never recalled when they actually began _ the feeble,
quivering heartbeats he experienced. The first attacks were brief.
But when a cold he caught from his daughter kept him in bed, he
knew something was wrong. His feet and ankles began to swell, and
he couldn't get air. He spent an entire night bolt upright (since
he could no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing. Doctors
determined that Miguel was suffering from Chagas' disease, named
after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist to expose the secret life
of Trypanosoma cruzi, a single-celled protozoan that can burrow
into heart muscle. Claire Panosian, a professor of medicine in the
division of infectious diseases and director of travel and tropical
medicine at UCLA Medical Center, reports on treating Miguel.

   &UR; CANDY MAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An eight-year-old boy is walking down the road one day when a
car pulls over next to him.
</P>
<P>
   `If you get in the car,` the driver says, `I'll give you $10 and
a piece of candy.`
</P>
<P>
   The boy refuses and keeps on walking.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, not to take no for an answer, the man
driving the car pulls over again. `How about $20 and two pieces of
candy?`
</P>
<P>
   The boy tells the man to leave him alone and keeps on walking.
</P>
<P>
   Still further down the road the man pulls over to the side road.
`OK,` he says, `this is my final offer. I'll give you $50 and all
the candy you can eat.`
</P>
<P>
   The little boy stops, goes to the car and leans in. `Look,` he
says to the driver. `You bought the Ford, Dad. You'll have to live
with it!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAKE THAT TBIRD AWAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the side of the highway waiting to catch speeding
drivers, a State Police Officer sees a car puttering along at 22
MPH. He thinks to himself, `This driver is just as dangerous as a
speeder!` So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the car, he notices that there are five old ladies
-two in the front seat and three in the back - wide eyed and white
as ghosts. The driver, obviously confused, says to him, `Officer, I
don't understand, I was doing exactly the speed limit! What seems
to be the problem?`
</P>
<P>
   `Ma'am,` the officer replies, `You weren't speeding, but you
should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a
danger to other drivers.`
</P>
<P>
   `Slower than the speed limit? No sir, I was doing the speed
limit exactly... Twenty-Two miles an hour!` the old woman says a
bit proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains
to her that `22` was the route number, not the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for
pointing out her error. `But before I let you go, Ma'am, I have to
ask... Is everyone in this car ok? These women seem awfully shaken
and they haven't muttered a single peep this whole time.` the
officer asks.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, they'll be alright in a minute officer. We just got off
Route 119.`

   &UR; Clinton critics off track (and field) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One thing Ill never forgive Bill Clinton for is lowering the bar
for the use of cliches by commentators.
</P>
<P>
   Not just commentators, actually. Anyone dragged into a
television studio to comment about the Clinton mess somehow manages
to complain about the lowering or raising of the bar. They should
be beat with it.
</P>
<P>
   The argument usually goes like this: Subjecting the president to
impeachment for lying about consensual sex lowers the bar for all
future presidents. That means, I guess, that it sets the standard
lower than it should be for removing a president. Some think the
standard should be high treason.
</P>
<P>
   But thats problematic also, since most of us dont know the
different variations of treason. What is low treason? Giving the
Russians secret recipes from the Pentagon cafeteria? The term high
treason seems to call for an act of Hollywood daring-do, like
fighting your way, Three Musketteers-style, out of the White House
with a dueling sword in one hand hand and a copy of nuclear missile
silo launch codes in the other.
</P>
<P>
   (Medium treason, I suppose, would be allowing the Chinese
ambassador access to your America Online account, like hed know
what to do with it.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there has been much raising and lowering of bars since
the Clinton scandal broke and it must stop.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it is not a good cliche because its meaning is
unclear. Most congressional reprehensibles, er, representatives,
dont know if impeaching a president for lying about sex is raising
or lowering the bar. In a sense, when you impeach someone for just
being a big dummy and not for say, fair-to-middlin treason, you are
raising the bar, not lowering it, because you are expecting more
from this guy than was expected of other presidents. You could say,
but shouldnt, that the moral behavior bar has been raised for
Clinton because that frisky sex puppy John Kennedy was never given
a chance to lie about his libidinous liberties.
</P>
<P>
   And this confusion over raising or lowering the bar occurs even
if we assume that the phrases foundation, the cliche substratum,
relates to track and field events such as the high jump or pole
vault. In these events, participants are expected to launch their
bodies OVER a bar. Causing someone to attempt to fling himself over
a bar that has been raised willy-nilly, haphazardly or arbitrarily
is unfair and dangerous, but, ultimately, fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But what if we are talking about doing the limbo? If you say
that impeaching the president for falling for a big-haired bimbo is
lowering the bar in the limbo sense, then you are saying, well, Im
not sure what you are saying, but you get the idea. Its confusing.
Especially if you start off by saying that the presidents future is
in bimbo limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The only good thing about commentators raising the bar is that
it keeps them from leveling the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Washington politicians and commentators apparently all shop at
Beltway Sports Cliche Warehouse. They are forever raising bars,
leveling playing fields, calling time outs and blowing whistles.
Who wants a level playing field? I want the playing field to be set
at a 45-degree angle and I want to be running downhill with a wind
at my back, by god.
</P>
<P>
   So why is going downhill considered a bad thing? You would think
that if your career were racing downhill, that would be great. You
never hear the compliment, Hey, I hear your career is going uphill!
Fabulous!
</P>
<P>
   I think Clinton needs to get off the playing field, level or
otherwise, climb out of the high jump pit or limbo line and hit the
showers. And while hes at it, he could come clean.

   The Achuar Indians of Ecuador have, by one count, the highest
murder rate on Earth. In 1993 a poll of villagers revealed that 50
percent of their immediate male ancestors had died from shotgun
blasts. (The traditional Achuar greeting is ``Pujamik'' _ ``Are you
living?'') To anthropologists, that makes their society a good
place to understand the violence within us all. Mary Roach, a

   ``I haven't bought a car in six years,'' Mr. Clinton says. He

   My companion and I had been waiting for a legal two-day parking
spot to become available on the Upper East Side. We sat in our car,
hoping someone would leave. After an hour, we suddenly spotted
brake lights and knew a car was moving. It was a half-block from
our position.
</P>
<P>
   I jumped from our car to run and hold the spot. As soon as I
stood in the middle of the empty space and my companion began to
back our car down the street, another car wheeled around the
corner. The driver saw me standing there and quickly nosed his car
toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!'' I shouted. He shouted back, ``This is New York, and
you can't save spots!'' I didn't leave my spot, but I began to
plead with him, telling him we had been waiting more than a hour
and wouldn't he please move on. My companion saw us shouting and
jumped out of our car and began shouting also.
</P>
<P>
   We were getting nowhere. The driver threatened to run me down.
My companion shouted to the driver, ``If you take that spot, I'm
going to hem you in.'' The other driver stopped shouting. He rolled
down his window as my companion rushed back to our car. He said in
a plaintive voice: ``Hem? What does he mean, he'll hem me in?
What's hem? What's hem?''
</P>
<P>
   I know a good thing when I hear it. I quietly answered, ``If you
know what's good for you, you'll let us have this spot before he
starts hemming.'' Before he drove off, the driver shouted out to my
companion, ``I'll leave, but for her sake, not yours.'' So we were
able to sleep late next morning without moving our car _ all
because of a word I thought everyone knew.

spotted the panhandler at Broadway and 45th Street. ``Free the

smiles and laughter subsided, Willie's financial situation improved

   Heywood Hale Broun was on a Columbus Avenue bus when he observed
an elderly couple boarding. They settled in opposite him, and the
man addressed a couple of remarks to his partner without getting a
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' he said. ``You don't like talking to
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind talking to you,'' she replied. ``I just don't
like listening to you.''
</P>
<P>
   They both laughed and relapsed into silence.

   A bunch of fresh red roses, the stems tightly wrapped in silver
foil, rested on the taxi's divider between driver and passenger.

roses for passengers to enjoy and give them to my last fare of the

   As someone who gets around town on a bicycle, I don't expect
cabdrivers to give me any kind of break. I know they'll cut me off,
honk their horns at me, yell something offensive as they pass, stop
suddenly in front of me to pick up or drop off passengers _ all the
stuff that brings on road rage. It's only recently that this
behavior stopped bothering me. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   First there were the words shouted by a passing cabby which, as
usual, I ignored until I realized the last word I heard was
``gloves,'' as in ``You dropped your gloves.'' Sure enough, the
pocket where my gloves had been was empty. As I pedaled back, a
second driver delivered the same message, and so did a third.
</P>
<P>
   My gloves were lying on the pavement a block north. As I
remounted and got back onto taxi-ridden lower Fifth Avenue, I
realized something had changed. Those yellow cabs with their
hard-charging drivers were no longer the enemy. I now saw them as a
bunch of people chasing a buck as best they could while still
caring whether an aged bike rider retrieved his gloves.

   It was a Saturday afternoon, the train was relatively empty and
I had settled down in my corner subway seat on the Broadway line,
opened the paper and prepared for a half-hour of reading.

<P>
   I scarcely noticed the arrival of three tall post-teen-age males
until I became aware that a match had been struck and there was a
flame. For a moment, the anti-subway anxieties of my suburban
middle-aged peers passed through my mind. Maybe I should start to
drive into the city or use Metro North trains. What were those guys
up to? I put down my paper to take a good look.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them had finished lighting the pink candles on top of a
pack of Twinkies. They presented it to the third, singing ``Happy
Birthday'' at the top of their lungs. The trio got off at the next
stop, munching the Twinkies.

<P>
   The railway linking Lahore to Multan in Pakistan is 4,600 years
old. In truth, the rails were laid down in the middle of the 19th
century, but to build the railway bed, British engineers smashed
bricks from crumbling buildings and rubble heaps in a town called
Harappa, halfway between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1856, Alexander Cunningham, director of the newly formed
Archaeological Survey of India, thought the brick ruins were all
related to nearby seventh-century Buddhist temples. Local legend
told a different story: The brick mounds were the remnants of an
ancient city, destroyed when its king committed incest with his
niece.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cunningham nor the locals were entirely correct. In
small, desultory excavations a few years later, Cunningham found no
temples or traces of kings, incestuous or otherwise. Instead he
reported the recovery of some pottery, carved shells and a badly
damaged seal depicting a one-horned animal, bearing an inscription
in an unfamiliar writing. That seal was a mark of one of the
world's great ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vedas, the oldest texts of the subcontinent, dating from
some 3,500 years ago, made no mention of it, nor did the Bible. No
pyramids or burial mounds marked the area as the site of an ancient
power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 4,600 years ago, great cities arose along the floodplains of
the ancient Indus and Saraswati rivers in what is now Pakistan and
northwest India.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the Indus Valley were a highly organized and
stupendously successful civilization. They built some of the
world's first planned cities, created one of the world's first
written languages, and thrived in an area twice the size of Egypt
and Mesopotamia for 700 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding at Harappa for the first time is how the
first cities started,'' says Mark Kenoyer, an archaeologist at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison. Kenoyer, who was born in India
to missionary parents, has been excavating at Harappa for the past
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kenoyer's archaeological evidence suggests that the city got its
start as a farming village around 3300 B.C. Situated near the Ravi
River, Harappa lay on a fertile floodplain. But the key to
urbanization was its location at the crossroads of several major
trading routes. Traders from the highlands of Baluchistan and
northern Afghanistan to the west brought in copper, tin and lapis
lazuli; clam and conch shells were brought in from the southern
seacoast, timber from the Himalayas, semiprecious stones from
Gujarat, silver and gold from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of goods allowed Harappans to become traders and
artisans as well as farmers. And specialists from across the land
arrived to set up shop in the new metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   By 2200 B.C., Harappa covered about 370 acres and may have held
80,000 people, making it roughly as populous as the ancient city of
Ur in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the haphazard arrangement of Mesopotamian cities, Indus
Valley settlements all followed the same basic plan. Streets and
houses were laid out on a north-south, east-west grid, and houses
and walls were built of standard-size bricks.
</P>
<P>
   They were also devoted to sanitation. Nearly every Harappan home
had a bathing platform and a latrine, says Kenoyer, and some Indus
Valley cities reached heights of 40 feet. Each neighborhood had its
own well, and elaborate covered drainage systems carried dirty
water outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   The towering brick cities, surrounded by sturdy walls with
imposing gateways, reminded early researchers of the medieval forts
in Delhi and Lahore. But Kenoyer thinks the walls were created to
control the flow of goods in and out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get into the city, you had to pay a tax,'' Kenoyer
explains. ``If you produced things, you had to pay a tax to take
goods out of the city. This is how a city gets revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the tax collectors and those they served remains
a mystery. Indus Valley rulers did not immortalize themselves with
mummies or monuments. They did, however, leave behind elaborately
carved stone seals, used to impress tokens or clay tabs on goods
bound for market. The seals bore images of animals, the most common
being the unicorn, a symbol that originated in the Indus Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Frustratingly, though, those seals carry inscriptions that no
one has been able to decipher. Early Mesopotamian cuneiform was
thought to be the world's first written language, says Kenoyer, but
the Indus Valley script emerged independently around the same time
_ at least by around 3300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the language remains a mystery, so too will the
identities of the Indus Valley elites. Kenoyer thinks each of the
large cities may have functioned as an independent city-state,
controlled by a small group of merchants, landowners and religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They controlled taxation, access to the city and communication
with the gods,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While the balance of power may have shifted between these
groups, they seem to have ruled without a standing army.
Sculptures, paintings and texts from Egypt and Mesopotamia clearly
illustrate battles between cities. But in the Indus Valley, not a
single depiction of a military act, of taking prisoners, of a human
killing another human has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Excavators have turned up some hints of the wealth an individual
could accumulate. Two decades ago, in the rural settlement of
Allahdino, near modern Karachi in Pakistan, archaeologists stumbled
upon a buried pot filled with jewelry, the secret hoard of a rich
landowner. Among the goods was a belt or necklace made of 36
elongated carnelian beads interspersed with bronze beads. It was
most likely made by a group of artisans over a period of two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Such intensive devotion to craftsmanship and trade, Kenoyer
argues, is what allowed Indus Valley culture to spread over a
region twice the size of Mesopotamia without a trace of military
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, between 1900 and 1700 B.C., the extensive trading
networks and productive farms supporting this cultural integration
collapsed, Kenoyer says, and distinct local cultures emerged.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that the Indus River shifted, flooding many
settlements and disrupting agriculture. It is likely that when
these smaller settlements were abandoned, trade routes were
affected.
</P>
<P>
   But the legacy of the ancient Indus cities and their
craftspeople remains. In the crowded marketplaces of Delhi and
Lahore, as gold and jewels are weighed in bronze balances, it's
hard to imagine that a 4,000-year-old Harappan bazaar could have
been terribly different.

<P>
   There are many reasons to be nervous in the village of Conambo
in the Ecuadoran Amazon. The Achuar people of Conambo are nervous
about the Achuar. The Achuar hold the dubious distinction of having
had, in recent generations, one of the highest murder rates on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 a poll of villagers revealed that 50 percent of their
immediate male ancestors had died from shotgun blasts. (The
traditional Achuar greeting is ``Pujamik'' _ ``Are you living?'')
</P>
<P>
   John Q. Patton, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
and the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, studies the roots of war and killing.
He takes a biological approach to human behavior, which is to say
he expects Darwinian theory to explain it. And from that
evolutionary perspective, war is something of a problem, because it
appears to be an altruistic act: You are risking your life for the
good of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altruism is the conundrum of Darwinian theory,'' Patton is
saying. ``When people use the term altruism, what they usually mean
is behaviors that appear to be altruistic but are really some form
of enlightened self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has theorized that warriors fight and kill in exchange
for a boost in status _ and that boost in status sets them up for
certain evolutionary perks.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's method is straightforward: He asks each Achuar man to
rank his fellow men, first by status in the community, then by
warriorship. Patton's only tools are a stack of Polaroids, a pencil
and a waterproof field notebook.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Ushpa lives on the riverbank. From his backpack,
Patton extracts his deck of Polaroids. Patton explains that he
wants Ushpa to arrange the Polaroids according to who is the most
``juunt'' _ an Achuar word that translates loosely as ``big.'' He
arrived at the term by talking to villagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say to them, 'Some people, when they talk, people don't
pay attention. But others, when they talk, people always listen. Is
there a name for someone like that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Ushpa has the Polaroids laid out on the floor, a
photographic hopscotch of intense, unsmiling faces. After noting
the order of the photographs, Patton gathers them up for round two:
warriorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``?Quien es mas achima?'' ``Achima'' is the Achuar word for
``warrior.'' ``If a war was to break out and there was a battle,
who would prove himself to be the best?''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has been asking the Achuar this question since 1992, and
his results are striking. When he lines up the rankings Achuar men
give for both qualities, warriorship accounts for as much as 78
percent of the variation in men's status. The better a warrior you
are, the more status you apparently earn.
</P>
<P>
   To Patton, this is the first step toward understanding how war
persists in human societies _ tracing the effect of being a good
warrior on your success in society, and ultimately in passing on
your genes.
</P>
<P>
   The Achuar concept of warriorship encompasses not only strategy
and skill but also valor, willingness and lack of hesitation.
Wisdom also plays a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to people about this, one of the things that kept
coming up was that a good warrior was `mas pensativo-' _ he's more
thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   A Polaroid of an older man invariably places higher on the
warriorship ranking than those of the town's youngest men,
regardless of the size of their biceps or the fierceness of their
gaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a society where in the past half the men got killed, you
assume that a man who reaches old age must be doing something
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in our society, where status is tied to income and address,
wartime exploits will carry a man a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this slide that I use in lectures that was the cover of
the National Enquirer,'' Patton comments. ``It says `Stormin'
Norman Schwarzkopf, Sexiest Man in America.' We still have this
tribal psychology about our warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ushpa is finishing up the warriorship task, but Patton has a new
line of questions for him: ``If a conflict arose here in Conambo,
who would side with whom?''
</P>
<P>
   Patton is aware that the town's social alliances can skew the
men's rankings of one another. In addition, the men of Conambo have
a keen sense of whom they can and can't trust in the event of
conflict. Patton would argue that this is an evolved trait.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong selective pressure to be able to make good
who-to-trust decisions: You're wrong, you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, according to Patton, are the forces that were behind the
origin of human social structures. You want to be part of a group
that's big enough to beat the other guys, or at least be a threat
to them, yet not so big that you can't keep everyone fed.
Friendships are forged according to who can offer whom what, as a
sort of insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the natural state,'' Patton says.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Patton sees a strong parallel between Amazonian
tribes and inner-city gangs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a gang, just as here, there's no question that you choose
your friends in terms of who you think is going to back you up and
who might be an important person to have on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phrase,'' Patton says. ```An armed society is a
polite society.' When you don't have institutions like police and
any conflict can escalate to something serious, you have to be very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he adds, he's not making the case that the Achuar are
violent by nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about a gene for violence here. We're
talking about the evolution of the strategic use of violence:
knowing when to push it and when not to. The biggest mistake people
make about the kind of anthropology I do is that they assume that
what we're talking about is these simple, knee-jerk instincts. When
in fact these instincts are complex, evolved strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives violence is: When do the costs and benefits favor
it, and when do they favor peace? I have no problem saying warfare
is a product of our biology. I also say that doesn't mean it's a
biological inevitability.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   There are many reasons to be nervous in the village of Conambo
in the Ecuadoran Amazon. The Achuar people of Conambo are nervous
about the Achuar. The Achuar hold the dubious distinction of having
had, in recent generations, one of the highest murder rates on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 a poll of villagers revealed that 50 percent of their
immediate male ancestors had died from shotgun blasts. (The
traditional Achuar greeting is ``Pujamik'' _ ``Are you living?'')
</P>
<P>
   John Q. Patton, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
and the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, studies the roots of war and killing.
He takes a biological approach to human behavior, which is to say
he expects Darwinian theory to explain it. And from that
evolutionary perspective, war is something of a problem, because it
appears to be an altruistic act: You are risking your life for the
good of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altruism is the conundrum of Darwinian theory,'' Patton is
saying. ``When people use the term altruism, what they usually mean
is behaviors that appear to be altruistic but are really some form
of enlightened self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has theorized that warriors fight and kill in exchange
for a boost in status _ and that boost in status sets them up for
certain evolutionary perks.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's method is straightforward: He asks each Achuar man to
rank his fellow men, first by status in the community, then by
warriorship. Patton's only tools are a stack of Polaroids, a pencil
and a waterproof field notebook.
</P>

<P>
   Miguel never recalled when they actually began _ those feeble,
quivering heartbeats he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   The first attacks were brief. Then, over time, they lasted
longer, until one day a friend at work saw the sweat on his face
and the fear in his eyes. He thought Miguel was having some kind of
dizzy spell and made him lie down.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Miguel's wife took him to the emergency room at L.A.
County Hospital. That's when they did an electrocardiogram _ his
first ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extra heartbeats,'' the nurse said, ``but no sign of
heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The intern on duty added, ``You're 38 years old, your blood
pressure's great, you don't even smoke. You've got a lot of miles
left on that heart.''
</P>
<P>
   So Miguel decided it was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The following winter Miguel caught a cold from his daughter. The
sore throat and aching muscles kept him in bed. Soon his feet and
ankles began to swell, and he couldn't get air.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he spent an entire night bolt upright (since he could
no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing.
</P>
<P>
   And he worried ... something was terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As an infectious-diseases specialist in Los Angeles, I first met
Miguel while doing rounds in our hospital's Coronary Observation
Unit. I guess Miguel was only a slow-motion disaster. Over a period
of months, he had gone from clinic to clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Miguel received a heart catheterization. Dye was
squirted through a tube placed in the heart to reveal its structure
and function. The results showed no coronary blockage.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Miguel carried the diagnosis of congestive
cardiormyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, idiopathic.
Basically, that meant he had a flabby balloon of a heart beating
dangerously out of control, and no one knew why.
</P>
<P>
   His heart and circulatory system were functioning so poorly that
fluids were building up. He had come to us for a possible heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Before I visited him, I scanned Miguel's chart. Since his first
attack of waterlogged lungs, he had taken digitalis and diuretics.
The digitalis helped his heart pump more efficiently, and the
diuretics helped flush out the fluid that was building up from the
failing pump.
</P>
<P>
   On his current chest X-ray, his heart was a large baggy mass in
the middle of his chest. But at least his lungs were clear. Thanks
to more potent diuretics, in the last few days they were free of
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   I am a parasite sleuth. Today my quarry was Trypanosoma cruzi, a
single-celled protozoan that can burrow into heart muscle and lead
to Chagas' disease, named after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist
to expose the secret life of T. cruzi.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient, sickle-shaped organism indigenous to Central and
South America, T. cruzi remains in the 1990s one of the leading
causes of cardiac death in young and middle-aged people south of
the border. Right now, the invader inhabits 16 to 18 million humans
in Latin America and more than 300,000 U.S. immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But most victims are unaware of their infection as are their
doctors. Hence, even in southern California T. cruzi infections are
missed more often than they are diagnosed. I didn't want to miss
the diagnosis in Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has a small farm with goats and pigs and chickens in
Jalisco,'' Miguel said. ``Our house? Oh, adobe _ very poor. And
yes, there are bugs in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the clues were adding up: farm, animals, insects. The
natural reservoir of T. cruzi is warmblooded animals.
House-dwelling insects, specifically known as conenose, or
``kissing,'' bugs (entomologists call them reduviids) transfer T.
cruzi from animals to man.
</P>
<P>
   The final clue was poverty. That's because reduviids often nest
in the nooks and crannies of the poorest rural dwellings. The bugs
emerge at night to binge on humans and purge: They first suck
blood, then dump parasite-laden feces next to the skin punctures
they've just created.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was ready to examine Miguel. I bent over his chest with
my stethoscope and heard the soft syncopation of a failing heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then I turned to Miguel's abdomen. First I felt for his liver.
It was slightly enlarged, confirming a blood buildup from an ailing
heart. As my fingertips continued to search, they also sensed
fullness of the colon. Did he have constipation? No, he said, not
usually.
</P>
<P>
   I was relieved. In my mental cinema, I had imagined
single-celled squatters, this time ensconced in the nerve clusters
that lace around the digestive tract. Parasite nests and
inflammation located here produce ``mega syndrome.'' in 6 to 10
percent of those infected, the gut enlarges because the nerves that
control the rhythmic squeezing of peristalsis die. Such nerve
damage can afflict other hollow organs too. Miguel had been spared
the indignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senora, if you are right, could I give this infection to my
family?''
</P>
<P>
   No, I said. Except for occasional cases of maternal-fetal
transmission, intrafamilial spread of T. cruzi does not occur,
except by the feces of reduviids.
</P>
<P>
   But did he, in fact, have Chagas' disease? Our best bet: the
antibody test for T. cruzi performed at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One week after drawing his blood, I heard from a technician in
Atlanta. Miguel's serum was unequivocally positive.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the real question facing Miguel was heart
transplantation. If Miguel had a transplant, he would need to take
drugs to rein in his immune response and prevent rejection of his
new heart.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell him that patients with endstage Chagas' disease had
gotten new hearts. But early results of transplantation had been
dismal. Most patients died within a year from new colonies of T.
cruzi sprouting not only in their new heart but in their skin,
brain and other organs. The drugs used to prevent organ rejection
created an open playing field for parasite growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Miguel made his own decision. He declined to be
placed on the transplant list, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, I heard he had died. He was one of more than
40,000 who lost their lives that year to a hidden intruder in the
heart.

   On his current chest X-ray, his heart was a large baggy mass in
the middle of his chest. But at least his lungs were clear. Thanks
to more potent diuretics, in the last few days they were free of
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   I am a parasite sleuth. Today my quarry was Trypanosoma cruzi, a
single-celled protozoan that can burrow into heart muscle and lead
to Chagas' disease, named after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist
to expose the secret life of T. cruzi.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient, sickle-shaped organism indigenous to Central and
South America, T. cruzi remains in the 1990s one of the leading
causes of cardiac death in young and middle-aged people south of
the border. Right now, the invader inhabits 16 to 18 million humans
in Latin America and more than 300,000 U.S. immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But most victims are unaware of their infection as are their
doctors. Hence, even in southern California T. cruzi infections are
missed more often than they are diagnosed. I didn't want to miss
the diagnosis in Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has a small farm with goats and pigs and chickens in
Jalisco,'' Miguel said. ``Our house? Oh, adobe _ very poor. And
yes, there are bugs in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the clues were adding up: farm, animals, insects. The
natural reservoir of T. cruzi is warmblooded animals.
House-dwelling insects, specifically known as conenose, or
``kissing,'' bugs (entomologists call them reduviids) transfer T.
cruzi from animals to man.
</P>
<P>
   The final clue was poverty. That's because reduviids often nest
in the nooks and crannies of the poorest rural dwellings. The bugs
emerge at night to binge on humans and purge: They first suck
blood, then dump parasite-laden feces next to the skin punctures
they've just created.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was ready to examine Miguel. I bent over his chest with
my stethoscope and heard the soft syncopation of a failing heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then I turned to Miguel's abdomen. First I felt for his liver.
It was slightly enlarged, confirming a blood buildup from an ailing
heart. As my fingertips continued to search, they also sensed
fullness of the colon. Did he have constipation? No, he said, not
usually.
</P>
<P>
   I was relieved. In my mental cinema, I had imagined
single-celled squatters, this time ensconced in the nerve clusters
that lace around the digestive tract. Parasite nests and
inflammation located here produce ``mega syndrome.'' in 6 to 10
percent of those infected, the gut enlarges because the nerves that
control the rhythmic squeezing of peristalsis die. Such nerve
damage can afflict other hollow organs too. Miguel had been spared
the indignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senora, if you are right, could I give this infection to my
family?''
</P>
<P>
   No, I said. Except for occasional cases of maternal-fetal
transmission, intrafamilial spread of T. cruzi does not occur,
except by the feces of reduviids.
</P>
<P>
   But did he, in fact, have Chagas' disease? Our best bet: the
antibody test for T. cruzi performed at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One week after drawing his blood, I heard from a technician in
Atlanta. Miguel's serum was unequivocally positive.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the real question facing Miguel was heart
transplantation. If Miguel had a transplant, he would need to take
drugs to rein in his immune response and prevent rejection of his
new heart.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell him that patients with endstage Chagas' disease had
gotten new hearts. But early results of transplantation had been
dismal. Most patients died within a year from new colonies of T.
cruzi sprouting not only in their new heart but in their skin,
brain and other organs. The drugs used to prevent organ rejection
created an open playing field for parasite growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Miguel made his own decision. He declined to be
placed on the transplant list, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, I heard he had died. He was one of more than
40,000 who lost their lives that year to a hidden intruder in the
heart.

`THE EROTICA PROJECT': A `PREOCCUPATION' IS PUTTING IT LIGHTLY

   NEW YORK _ One midnight in Paris some years ago, three friends
and I took a bad recommendation and ended up in the sort of club
where the minimum order is a $100 bottle of champagne. We sighed,
ordered and sat back for a little late-night conversation, or so we
thought. Suddenly a movie screen appeared and a series of truly
vulgar sexual cartoons began to play.
</P>
<P>
   That terrible feeling of being trapped at a pornography display
returned last Friday night at Joe's Pub, the Public Theater's new
cabaret and lounge. Some will say that the show's title, ``The
Erotica Project: Cunning Stunts,'' should have been a hint.
</P>
<P>
   The mercifully brief, intermissionless production consists of
eight women _ mostly young, mostly gorgeous, mostly in the skimpy
little black dresses of the fashion moment _ standing at
microphones and talking dirty in breathy phone-sex voices.
Propriety prevents my quoting much of the dialogue, but one of the
less risque lines is ``because your warm tongue is the fountain of
the universe'' and the word ``wet'' is used a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   There are, in the middle of this, two excellent sequences. One
is ``Threesome,'' performed with quiet power by Rebecca Nelson, the
story of a young woman's menage a trois with her boyfriend and his
best friend, the excitement and the irrevocable regrets.
(Afterward, the narrator observes, she and her boyfriend ``smell
like Clay's skin.'') The other is ``Mary Magdalene,'' performed
with style and conviction by Caroline Burwell, in which the
audience meets the biblical prostitute as an impressionable
teen-age girl who falls for a sexy radical while he's preaching the
Sermon on the Mount. (``I hear He's dangerous and know that I am
already in love with Him.'') Still, the sequence is sure to offend
many since it includes vivid descriptions of oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of the production, written by Lillian Ann
Slugocki and Erin Cressida Wilson and directed by John Gould Rubin,
is just titillation and anger. Perhaps the low point is
``Soapbox,'' performed by Christen Clifford, which declares that
feminism is a plot to keep her from having a happy, healthy, active
sex life. When Ms. Clifford announces, ``My vagina is not your
soapbox,'' only one thing comes to mind: just how fabulous Eve
Ensler's Off Broadway show ``The Vagina Monologues'' was.

<P>
   The railway linking Lahore to Multan in Pakistan is 4,600 years
old. In truth, the rails were laid down in the middle of the 19th
century, but to build the railway bed, British engineers smashed
bricks from crumbling buildings and rubble heaps in a town called
Harappa, halfway between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1856, Alexander Cunningham, director of the newly formed
Archaeological Survey of India, thought the brick ruins were all
related to nearby seventh-century Buddhist temples. Local legend
told a different story: The brick mounds were the remnants of an
ancient city, destroyed when its king committed incest with his
niece.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Cunningham nor the locals were entirely correct. In
small, desultory excavations a few years later, Cunningham found no
temples or traces of kings, incestuous or otherwise. Instead he
reported the recovery of some pottery, carved shells and a badly
damaged seal depicting a one-horned animal, bearing an inscription
in an unfamiliar writing. That seal was a mark of one of the
world's great ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vedas, the oldest texts of the subcontinent, dating from
some 3,500 years ago, made no mention of it, nor did the Bible. No
pyramids or burial mounds marked the area as the site of an ancient
power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 4,600 years ago, great cities arose along the floodplains of
the ancient Indus and Saraswati rivers in what is now Pakistan and
northwest India.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the Indus Valley were a highly organized and
stupendously successful civilization. They built some of the
world's first planned cities, created one of the world's first
written languages, and thrived in an area twice the size of Egypt
and Mesopotamia for 700 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're finding at Harappa for the first time is how the
first cities started,'' says Mark Kenoyer, an archaeologist at the
University of Wisconsin in Madison. Kenoyer, who was born in India
to missionary parents, has been excavating at Harappa for the past
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kenoyer's archaeological evidence suggests that the city got its
start as a farming village around 3300 B.C. Situated near the Ravi
River, Harappa lay on a fertile floodplain. But the key to
urbanization was its location at the crossroads of several major
trading routes. Traders from the highlands of Baluchistan and
northern Afghanistan to the west brought in copper, tin and lapis
lazuli; clam and conch shells were brought in from the southern
seacoast, timber from the Himalayas, semiprecious stones from
Gujarat, silver and gold from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of goods allowed Harappans to become traders and
artisans as well as farmers. And specialists from across the land
arrived to set up shop in the new metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   By 2200 B.C., Harappa covered about 370 acres and may have held
80,000 people, making it roughly as populous as the ancient city of
Ur in Mesopotamia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the haphazard arrangement of Mesopotamian cities, Indus
Valley settlements all followed the same basic plan. Streets and
houses were laid out on a north-south, east-west grid, and houses
and walls were built of standard-size bricks.
</P>
<P>
   They were also devoted to sanitation. Nearly every Harappan home
had a bathing platform and a latrine, says Kenoyer, and some Indus
Valley cities reached heights of 40 feet. Each neighborhood had its
own well, and elaborate covered drainage systems carried dirty
water outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   The towering brick cities, surrounded by sturdy walls with
imposing gateways, reminded early researchers of the medieval forts
in Delhi and Lahore. But Kenoyer thinks the walls were created to
control the flow of goods in and out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get into the city, you had to pay a tax,'' Kenoyer
explains. ``If you produced things, you had to pay a tax to take
goods out of the city. This is how a city gets revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the tax collectors and those they served remains
a mystery. Indus Valley rulers did not immortalize themselves with
mummies or monuments. They did, however, leave behind elaborately
carved stone seals, used to impress tokens or clay tabs on goods
bound for market. The seals bore images of animals, the most common
being the unicorn, a symbol that originated in the Indus Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Frustratingly, though, those seals carry inscriptions that no
one has been able to decipher. Early Mesopotamian cuneiform was
thought to be the world's first written language, says Kenoyer, but
the Indus Valley script emerged independently around the same time
_ at least by around 3300 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the language remains a mystery, so too will the
identities of the Indus Valley elites. Kenoyer thinks each of the
large cities may have functioned as an independent city-state,
controlled by a small group of merchants, landowners and religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They controlled taxation, access to the city and communication
with the gods,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While the balance of power may have shifted between these
groups, they seem to have ruled without a standing army.
Sculptures, paintings and texts from Egypt and Mesopotamia clearly
illustrate battles between cities. But in the Indus Valley, not a
single depiction of a military act, of taking prisoners, of a human
killing another human has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Excavators have turned up some hints of the wealth an individual
could accumulate. Two decades ago, in the rural settlement of
Allahdino, near modern Karachi in Pakistan, archaeologists stumbled
upon a buried pot filled with jewelry, the secret hoard of a rich
landowner. Among the goods was a belt or necklace made of 36
elongated carnelian beads interspersed with bronze beads. It was
most likely made by a group of artisans over a period of two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Such intensive devotion to craftsmanship and trade, Kenoyer
argues, is what allowed Indus Valley culture to spread over a
region twice the size of Mesopotamia without a trace of military
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, between 1900 and 1700 B.C., the extensive trading
networks and productive farms supporting this cultural integration
collapsed, Kenoyer says, and distinct local cultures emerged.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that the Indus River shifted, flooding many
settlements and disrupting agriculture. It is likely that when
these smaller settlements were abandoned, trade routes were
affected.
</P>
<P>
   But the legacy of the ancient Indus cities and their
craftspeople remains. In the crowded marketplaces of Delhi and
Lahore, as gold and jewels are weighed in bronze balances, it's
hard to imagine that a 4,000-year-old Harappan bazaar could have
been terribly different.

   There are many reasons to be nervous in the village of Conambo
in the Ecuadoran Amazon. The Achuar people of Conambo are nervous
about the Achuar. The Achuar hold the dubious distinction of having
had, in recent generations, one of the highest murder rates on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 a poll of villagers revealed that 50 percent of their
immediate male ancestors had died from shotgun blasts. (The
traditional Achuar greeting is ``Pujamik'' _ ``Are you living?'')
</P>
<P>
   John Q. Patton, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
and the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, studies the roots of war and killing.
He takes a biological approach to human behavior, which is to say
he expects Darwinian theory to explain it. And from that
evolutionary perspective, war is something of a problem, because it
appears to be an altruistic act: You are risking your life for the
good of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Altruism is the conundrum of Darwinian theory,'' Patton is
saying. ``When people use the term altruism, what they usually mean
is behaviors that appear to be altruistic but are really some form
of enlightened self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has theorized that warriors fight and kill in exchange
for a boost in status _ and that boost in status sets them up for
certain evolutionary perks.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's method is straightforward: He asks each Achuar man to
rank his fellow men, first by status in the community, then by
warriorship. Patton's only tools are a stack of Polaroids, a pencil
and a waterproof field notebook.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Ushpa lives on the riverbank. From his backpack,
Patton extracts his deck of Polaroids. Patton explains that he
wants Ushpa to arrange the Polaroids according to who is the most
``juunt'' _ an Achuar word that translates loosely as ``big.'' He
arrived at the term by talking to villagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say to them, 'Some people, when they talk, people don't
pay attention. But others, when they talk, people always listen. Is
there a name for someone like that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Ushpa has the Polaroids laid out on the floor, a
photographic hopscotch of intense, unsmiling faces. After noting
the order of the photographs, Patton gathers them up for round two:
warriorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``?Quien es mas achima?'' ``Achima'' is the Achuar word for
``warrior.'' ``If a war was to break out and there was a battle,
who would prove himself to be the best?''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has been asking the Achuar this question since 1992, and
his results are striking. When he lines up the rankings Achuar men
give for both qualities, warriorship accounts for as much as 78
percent of the variation in men's status. The better a warrior you
are, the more status you apparently earn.
</P>
<P>
   To Patton, this is the first step toward understanding how war
persists in human societies _ tracing the effect of being a good
warrior on your success in society, and ultimately in passing on
your genes.
</P>
<P>
   The Achuar concept of warriorship encompasses not only strategy
and skill but also valor, willingness and lack of hesitation.
Wisdom also plays a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to people about this, one of the things that kept
coming up was that a good warrior was `mas pensativo-' _ he's more
thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   A Polaroid of an older man invariably places higher on the
warriorship ranking than those of the town's youngest men,
regardless of the size of their biceps or the fierceness of their
gaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a society where in the past half the men got killed, you
assume that a man who reaches old age must be doing something
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in our society, where status is tied to income and address,
wartime exploits will carry a man a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this slide that I use in lectures that was the cover of
the National Enquirer,'' Patton comments. ``It says `Stormin'
Norman Schwarzkopf, Sexiest Man in America.' We still have this
tribal psychology about our warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Ushpa is finishing up the warriorship task, but Patton has a new
line of questions for him: ``If a conflict arose here in Conambo,
who would side with whom?''
</P>
<P>
   Patton is aware that the town's social alliances can skew the
men's rankings of one another. In addition, the men of Conambo have
a keen sense of whom they can and can't trust in the event of
conflict. Patton would argue that this is an evolved trait.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong selective pressure to be able to make good
who-to-trust decisions: You're wrong, you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, according to Patton, are the forces that were behind the
origin of human social structures. You want to be part of a group
that's big enough to beat the other guys, or at least be a threat
to them, yet not so big that you can't keep everyone fed.
Friendships are forged according to who can offer whom what, as a
sort of insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the natural state,'' Patton says.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Patton sees a strong parallel between Amazonian
tribes and inner-city gangs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a gang, just as here, there's no question that you choose
your friends in terms of who you think is going to back you up and
who might be an important person to have on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phrase,'' Patton says. ```An armed society is a
polite society.' When you don't have institutions like police and
any conflict can escalate to something serious, you have to be very
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he adds, he's not making the case that the Achuar are
violent by nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about a gene for violence here. We're
talking about the evolution of the strategic use of violence:
knowing when to push it and when not to. The biggest mistake people
make about the kind of anthropology I do is that they assume that
what we're talking about is these simple, knee-jerk instincts. When
in fact these instincts are complex, evolved strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drives violence is: When do the costs and benefits favor
it, and when do they favor peace? I have no problem saying warfare
is a product of our biology. I also say that doesn't mean it's a
biological inevitability.''

<P>
   Miguel never recalled when they actually began _ those feeble,
quivering heartbeats he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   The first attacks were brief. Then, over time, they lasted
longer, until one day a friend at work saw the sweat on his face
and the fear in his eyes. He thought Miguel was having some kind of
dizzy spell and made him lie down.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Miguel's wife took him to the emergency room at L.A.
County Hospital. That's when they did an electrocardiogram _ his
first ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are extra heartbeats,'' the nurse said, ``but no sign of
heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The intern on duty added, ``You're 38 years old, your blood
pressure's great, you don't even smoke. You've got a lot of miles
left on that heart.''
</P>
<P>
   So Miguel decided it was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The following winter Miguel caught a cold from his daughter. The
sore throat and aching muscles kept him in bed. Soon his feet and
ankles began to swell, and he couldn't get air.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he spent an entire night bolt upright (since he could
no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing.
</P>
<P>
   And he worried ... something was terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As an infectious-diseases specialist in Los Angeles, I first met
Miguel while doing rounds in our hospital's Coronary Observation
Unit. I guess Miguel was only a slow-motion disaster. Over a period
of months, he had gone from clinic to clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Miguel received a heart catheterization. Dye was
squirted through a tube placed in the heart to reveal its structure
and function. The results showed no coronary blockage.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Miguel carried the diagnosis of congestive
cardiormyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, idiopathic.
Basically, that meant he had a flabby balloon of a heart beating
dangerously out of control, and no one knew why.
</P>
<P>
   His heart and circulatory system were functioning so poorly that
fluids were building up. He had come to us for a possible heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Before I visited him, I scanned Miguel's chart. Since his first
attack of waterlogged lungs, he had taken digitalis and diuretics.
The digitalis helped his heart pump more efficiently, and the
diuretics helped flush out the fluid that was building up from the
failing pump.
</P>
<P>
   On his current chest X-ray, his heart was a large baggy mass in
the middle of his chest. But at least his lungs were clear. Thanks
to more potent diuretics, in the last few days they were free of
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   I am a parasite sleuth. Today my quarry was Trypanosoma cruzi, a
single-celled protozoan that can burrow into heart muscle and lead
to Chagas' disease, named after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist
to expose the secret life of T. cruzi.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient, sickle-shaped organism indigenous to Central and
South America, T. cruzi remains in the 1990s one of the leading
causes of cardiac death in young and middle-aged people south of
the border. Right now, the invader inhabits 16 to 18 million humans
in Latin America and more than 300,000 U.S. immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But most victims are unaware of their infection as are their
doctors. Hence, even in southern California T. cruzi infections are
missed more often than they are diagnosed. I didn't want to miss
the diagnosis in Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has a small farm with goats and pigs and chickens in
Jalisco,'' Miguel said. ``Our house? Oh, adobe _ very poor. And
yes, there are bugs in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the clues were adding up: farm, animals, insects. The
natural reservoir of T. cruzi is warmblooded animals.
House-dwelling insects, specifically known as conenose, or
``kissing,'' bugs (entomologists call them reduviids) transfer T.
cruzi from animals to man.
</P>
<P>
   The final clue was poverty. That's because reduviids often nest
in the nooks and crannies of the poorest rural dwellings. The bugs
emerge at night to binge on humans and purge: They first suck
blood, then dump parasite-laden feces next to the skin punctures
they've just created.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was ready to examine Miguel. I bent over his chest with
my stethoscope and heard the soft syncopation of a failing heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then I turned to Miguel's abdomen. First I felt for his liver.
It was slightly enlarged, confirming a blood buildup from an ailing
heart. As my fingertips continued to search, they also sensed
fullness of the colon. Did he have constipation? No, he said, not
usually.
</P>
<P>
   I was relieved. In my mental cinema, I had imagined
single-celled squatters, this time ensconced in the nerve clusters
that lace around the digestive tract. Parasite nests and
inflammation located here produce ``mega syndrome.'' in 6 to 10
percent of those infected, the gut enlarges because the nerves that
control the rhythmic squeezing of peristalsis die. Such nerve
damage can afflict other hollow organs too. Miguel had been spared
the indignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senora, if you are right, could I give this infection to my
family?''
</P>
<P>
   No, I said. Except for occasional cases of maternal-fetal
transmission, intrafamilial spread of T. cruzi does not occur,
except by the feces of reduviids.
</P>
<P>
   But did he, in fact, have Chagas' disease? Our best bet: the
antibody test for T. cruzi performed at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One week after drawing his blood, I heard from a technician in
Atlanta. Miguel's serum was unequivocally positive.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the real question facing Miguel was heart
transplantation. If Miguel had a transplant, he would need to take
drugs to rein in his immune response and prevent rejection of his
new heart.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell him that patients with endstage Chagas' disease had
gotten new hearts. But early results of transplantation had been
dismal. Most patients died within a year from new colonies of T.
cruzi sprouting not only in their new heart but in their skin,
brain and other organs. The drugs used to prevent organ rejection
created an open playing field for parasite growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Miguel made his own decision. He declined to be
placed on the transplant list, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, I heard he had died. He was one of more than
40,000 who lost their lives that year to a hidden intruder in the
heart.

   ``There are extra heartbeats,'' the nurse said, ``but no sign of
heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The intern on duty added, ``You're 38 years old, your blood
pressure's great, you don't even smoke. You've got a lot of miles
left on that heart.''
</P>
<P>
   So Miguel decided it was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The following winter Miguel caught a cold from his daughter. The
sore throat and aching muscles kept him in bed. Soon his feet and
ankles began to swell, and he couldn't get air.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he spent an entire night bolt upright (since he could
no longer catch his breath lying down) coughing.
</P>
<P>
   And he worried ... something was terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As an infectious-diseases specialist in Los Angeles, I first met
Miguel while doing rounds in our hospital's Coronary Observation
Unit. I guess Miguel was only a slow-motion disaster. Over a period
of months, he had gone from clinic to clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Miguel received a heart catheterization. Dye was
squirted through a tube placed in the heart to reveal its structure
and function. The results showed no coronary blockage.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Miguel carried the diagnosis of congestive
cardiormyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, idiopathic.
Basically, that meant he had a flabby balloon of a heart beating
dangerously out of control, and no one knew why.
</P>
<P>
   His heart and circulatory system were functioning so poorly that
fluids were building up. He had come to us for a possible heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Before I visited him, I scanned Miguel's chart. Since his first
attack of waterlogged lungs, he had taken digitalis and diuretics.
The digitalis helped his heart pump more efficiently, and the
diuretics helped flush out the fluid that was building up from the
failing pump.
</P>
<P>
   On his current chest X-ray, his heart was a large baggy mass in
the middle of his chest. But at least his lungs were clear. Thanks
to more potent diuretics, in the last few days they were free of
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   I am a parasite sleuth. Today my quarry was Trypanosoma cruzi, a
single-celled protozoan that can burrow into heart muscle and lead
to Chagas' disease, named after Carlos Chagas, the first scientist
to expose the secret life of T. cruzi.
</P>
<P>
   An ancient, sickle-shaped organism indigenous to Central and
South America, T. cruzi remains in the 1990s one of the leading
causes of cardiac death in young and middle-aged people south of
the border. Right now, the invader inhabits 16 to 18 million humans
in Latin America and more than 300,000 U.S. immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But most victims are unaware of their infection as are their
doctors. Hence, even in southern California T. cruzi infections are
missed more often than they are diagnosed. I didn't want to miss
the diagnosis in Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has a small farm with goats and pigs and chickens in
Jalisco,'' Miguel said. ``Our house? Oh, adobe _ very poor. And
yes, there are bugs in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the clues were adding up: farm, animals, insects. The
natural reservoir of T. cruzi is warmblooded animals.
House-dwelling insects, specifically known as conenose, or
``kissing,'' bugs (entomologists call them reduviids) transfer T.
cruzi from animals to man.
</P>
<P>
   The final clue was poverty. That's because reduviids often nest
in the nooks and crannies of the poorest rural dwellings. The bugs
emerge at night to binge on humans and purge: They first suck
blood, then dump parasite-laden feces next to the skin punctures
they've just created.
</P>
<P>
   By now I was ready to examine Miguel. I bent over his chest with
my stethoscope and heard the soft syncopation of a failing heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then I turned to Miguel's abdomen. First I felt for his liver.
It was slightly enlarged, confirming a blood buildup from an ailing
heart. As my fingertips continued to search, they also sensed
fullness of the colon. Did he have constipation? No, he said, not
usually.
</P>
<P>
   I was relieved. In my mental cinema, I had imagined
single-celled squatters, this time ensconced in the nerve clusters
that lace around the digestive tract. Parasite nests and
inflammation located here produce ``mega syndrome.'' in 6 to 10
percent of those infected, the gut enlarges because the nerves that
control the rhythmic squeezing of peristalsis die. Such nerve
damage can afflict other hollow organs too. Miguel had been spared
the indignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senora, if you are right, could I give this infection to my
family?''
</P>
<P>
   No, I said. Except for occasional cases of maternal-fetal
transmission, intrafamilial spread of T. cruzi does not occur,
except by the feces of reduviids.
</P>
<P>
   But did he, in fact, have Chagas' disease? Our best bet: the
antibody test for T. cruzi performed at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   One week after drawing his blood, I heard from a technician in
Atlanta. Miguel's serum was unequivocally positive.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, the real question facing Miguel was heart
transplantation. If Miguel had a transplant, he would need to take
drugs to rein in his immune response and prevent rejection of his
new heart.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell him that patients with endstage Chagas' disease had
gotten new hearts. But early results of transplantation had been
dismal. Most patients died within a year from new colonies of T.
cruzi sprouting not only in their new heart but in their skin,
brain and other organs. The drugs used to prevent organ rejection
created an open playing field for parasite growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Miguel made his own decision. He declined to be
placed on the transplant list, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, I heard he had died. He was one of more than
40,000 who lost their lives that year to a hidden intruder in the
heart.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The boundary between polar air and a moderating air mass over
the South will become established from Kansas to western New
England. A series of weak disturbances in the jet stream, which
will be flowing parallel to this newly formed front, should induce
patches of wintry precipitation as pockets of mild air are drawn
north and colder air pushes south.
</P>
<P>
   Light to moderate snow will fall from western New York to Maine
with more than six inches possible on the higher terrain of western
New England. Scattered snow showers will become mixed with rain and
sleet along the Northeast coast. A little light snow or drizzle
will dampen the central Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Much warmer air will occupy the Southeast as high pressure moves
offshore. The return flow of milder, moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico into the lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys will
produce a few patches of light rain. The southern Plains will stay
quite mild, but chilly air will arrive from the north Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frigid conditions will cover the northern Plains and upper
Middle West as Arctic air circulates southward. Low pressure
developing over Kansas will trigger light snow farther north.
Patches of light snow are expected in the northern Rockies along a
stalled front.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest will be dull with showers along the coast. Fog in
the Central Valley will persist. The interior West and deserts of
the Southwest will stay sunny and rather mild. Offshore winds will
keep readings above seasonal levels in coastal areas of southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Downslope Windstorms
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusts were clocked at 96 mph at Estes Park near Denver,
Colo., early Monday morning. Fierce winds also gusted to 80 mph at
Boulder, Colo., a town infamous for its ``downslope windstorms.''
Such windstorms develop over the eastern foothills of the Rockies
in winter when speedy westerly winds near the summits careen down
the lee side of the mountains, sometimes attaining speeds over 100
mph. The fiercest winds typically occur as low pressure passes
north of the affected region, a path that favors both strong winds
aloft and sinking air over the region.

`SNITCH': A DRAGNET THAT GIVES SHARKS A LEASE ON LIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes are at end of review.) 
(Time, channel are for the New York metropolitan area. Check local
listings.) (ms)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Snitch,'' the outdated slang insult for an informer, is back
in fashion, and along with it a new career for drug dealers and
users, which Tuesday night's ``Frontline'' charges is corrupting
the nation's criminal justice operations. Relying mainly on horror
stories of low-level drug suspects who are serving long prison
terms on evidence supplied by more culpable pals and collaborators,
the producer, Ofra Bikel, makes a case that the famous war on drugs
is being perverted by incentives that reward the guiltiest and
punish the less guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute report returns to the late 1980s, when the crack
cocaine epidemic drove Congress to enact hasty tough minimum
sentences for drug trafficking. Offenses that might once have
brought probation now carried 20 years to life in prison. Moreover,
Congress tagged on a conspiracy amendment that called for heavy
sentences for even minor participants in a drug sale and made their
convictions much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these laws, which one of their devisers now
blames on an ``incredible conjunction between politics and
hysteria,'' created an incentive for convicted dealers to make
deals with prosecutors, trading accusations against former friends,
neighbors and family members in exchange for a reduction in their
own long sentences. The prosecutors proved eager to credit the
self-serving accounts of felons, whose reputation for reliability
is not high. ``Do I feel that snitches lie?'' asks a defense
lawyer. ``Only when their mouth is moving.''
</P>
<P>
   One repentant snitch, who says he won a reduced sentence by
lying about seeing a friend selling drugs, asks: ``What are you
going to do? You going to take that life sentence?''
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday night you can meet a man with a clean record who was
peripherally involved in a drug sale and was turned in by four
buddies, all of whom faced life sentences. The charges against him
consisted exclusively of their testimony. These ``cooperating
individuals,'' as the prosecution politely calls them, won reduced
terms, and he wound up with life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   The cases of apparent injustice are affecting and not
implausible, but like any account that draws largely on defendants
and their lawyers, you may be left less than certain that you are
getting a straight story. At the least ``Snitch'' adds another
count to critics' indictment of a costly policy that has jammed
prisons with nonviolent and, as life on the street goes, relatively
inoffensive offenders.

   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ President Clinton presents his first
formal defense against removal from office by the Senate, arguing
that he committed no crimes and that the charges against him are so
vague and muddled that they are unconstitutional. By James Bennet.

</P>
<P>
   CONGO-CONFLICT (Kinshasa, Congo) _ From its earliest imagination
in the minds of outsiders hungry for its riches _ gold for traders
and souls for missionaries _ Congo has rarely belonged to itself
alone. Now this huge and unsteady state has become a battlefield of
soldiers from no fewer than six foreign nations. It is a war that
has as much to do with problems outside of Congo as inside it. A
fundamental reworking of the old rules of Africa may be unfolding
in the five-month-old Congo war. By Norimitsu Onishi and Ian
Fisher. With photo and map. 2,000 words.

<P>
   U.N.-COUNCIL-IRAQ (United Nations) _ Whatever happened to the
Security Council? It seems paralyzed over what to do next on Iraq.
By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TOILET-TRAINING (Undated) _ Toilet training is not rocket
science, says John Rosemond, a syndicated columnist and
best-selling author of parenting books. He considers it ``a slap to
the intelligence of a human being that one would allow him to
continue soiling and wetting himself past age 2.'' The process, he
says, should be as simple and straightforward as housebreaking a
four-month-old puppy. Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the noted
pediatrician, says there is more to it than that. Parents who force
toilet training, he says, can cause lasting problems. ``Don't rush
your toddler into toilet training or let anyone else tell you it's
time. It's got to be his choice,'' Brazelton advises in a
television commercial for Pampers ``Size 6'' diapers. What does he
think about Rosemond's arguments? ``They sound very logical _ for
puppies.'' Welcome to the newest round in the toilet training wars.
1800 words. By Erica Goode.

<P>
   OLY-UTAH-IMAGE (Salt Lake City) _ The Olympic scandal, with
reports of bribes, a land deal and possibly prostitutes, used to
steer the 2002 Winter Olympics to this clean cut Western city has
tarnished this city's effort to project a new high tech,
cosmopolitan image to the world. On Monday the evolving scandal
apparently claimed its latest victim as Salt Lake's mayor, Deedee
Corradini, announced that she would not run for a third term,
crushing her dream of presiding over the Olympics here. By James
Brooke.

   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ On Monday came the clearest sign
yet of just how much Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
estranged the Israeli political establishment, left and right.
Netanyahu's political godfather, Moshe Arens, 73, a former defense
and foreign minister, announced that he would challenge his
one-time protege for the leadership of the Likud Party in party
primaries. The primaries will select the Likud candidates for the
national elections on May 17. By Deborah Sontag.

   MICROSOFT-TRIAL (Washington) _ Microsoft Corp. begins its trial
defense with an economist from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology bearing a massive tome of written testimony with a
simple message _ Microsoft's business practices are good for
consumers and any government meddling with the software industry
would likely do more harm than good. By Steve Lohr.

<P>
   Scientists, intent on categorizing everything around them,
sometimes divide themselves into the lumpers and the splitters. The
lumpers, many of whom flock to the unifying field of theoretical
physics, search for hidden laws uniting the most seemingly diverse
phenomena: Blur your vision a little and lightning bolts and static
cling are really the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The splitters, often drawn to the biological sciences, are more
taken with diversity, reveling in the 34,000 variations on the
theme spider, or the 550 species of conifer trees.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions to the rule. When two biologists and a
physicist, all three of the lumper persuasion, recently joined
forces at the Santa Fe Institute, an interdisciplinary research
center in northern New Mexico, the result was an advance in a
problem that has bothered scientists for decades: the origin of
biological scaling. How is one to explain the subtle ways in which
various characteristics of living creatures _ their life spans,
their pulse rates, how fast they burn energy _ change according to
their body size?
</P>
<P>
   As animals get bigger, from tiny shrew to huge blue whale, pulse
rates slow down and life spans stretch out longer, conspiring so
that the number of heartbeats during an average stay on Earth tends
to be roughly the same, around a billion. A mouse just uses them up
more quickly than an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Mysteriously, these and a large variety of other phenomena
change with body size according to a precise mathematical principle
called quarter-power scaling. A cat, 100 times more massive than a
mouse, lives about 100 to the one-quarter power, or about three
times, longer. (To calculate this number take the square root of
100, which is 10 and then take the square root of 10, which is
3.2.) Heartbeat scales to mass to the  &UR; minus &LR;  one-quarter power.
The cat's heart thus beats a third as fast as a mouse's.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe Institute collaborators _ Geoffrey West, a
physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and two biologists at
the University of New Mexico, Jim Brown and Brian Enquist _ have
drawn on their different kinds of expertise to propose a model for
what causes certain kinds of quarter-power scaling, which they have
extended to the plant kingdom as well.
</P>
<P>
   In their theory, scaling emerges from the geometrical and
statistical properties of the internal networks animals and plants
use to distribute nutrients. But almost as interesting as the
details of this model, is the collaboration itself. It is rare
enough for scientists of such different persuasions to come
together, rarer still that the result is hailed as an important
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scaling is interesting because, aside from natural selection,
it is one of the few laws we really have in biology,'' said John
Gittleman, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Virginia.
``What is so elegant is that the work makes very clear predictions
about causal mechanisms. That's what had been missing in the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said: ``None of us could have done it by himself. It is
one of the most exciting things I've been involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that because a cat is a hundred times more massive
than a mouse, its metabolic rate, the intensity with which it burns
energy, would be a hundred times greater _ what mathematicians call
a linear relationship. After all, the cat has a hundred times more
cells to feed.
</P>
<P>
   But if this were so, the animal would quickly be consumed by a
fit of spontaneous feline combustion, or at least a very bad fever.
The reason: the surface area a creature uses to dissipate the heat
of the metabolic fires does not grow as fast as its body mass. To
see this, consider (like a good lumper) a mouse as an approximation
of a small sphere. As the sphere grows larger, to cat size, the
surface area increases along two dimensions but the volume
increases along three dimensions. The size of the biological
radiator cannot possibly keep up with the size of the metabolic
engine.
</P>
<P>
   If this was the only factor involved, metabolic rate would scale
to body mass to the two-thirds power, more slowly than in a simple
one-to-one relationship. The cat's metabolic rate would be not 100
times greater than the mouse's but 100 to the power of two-thirds,
or about 21.5 times greater.
</P>
<P>
   But biologists, beginning with Max Kleiber in the early 1930s,
found that the situation was much more complex. For an amazing
range of creatures, spanning in size from bacteria to blue whales,
metabolic rate scales with body mass not to the two-thirds power
but slightly faster _ to the three-quarter power.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution seems to have found a way to overcome in part the
limitations imposed by pure geometric scaling, the fact that
surface area grows more slowly than size. For decades no one could
plausibly say why.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiber's law means that a cat's metabolic rate is not a hundred
or 21.5 times greater than a mouse's, but about 31.6 _ 100 to the
three-quarter power. This relationship seems to hold across the
animal kingdom, from shrew to blue whale, and it has since been
extended all the way down to single-celled organisms, and possibly
within the cells themselves to the internal structures called
mitochondria that turn nutrients into energy.
</P>
<P>
   Long before meeting Brown and Enquist, West was interested in
how scaling manifests itself in the world of subatomic particles.
The strong nuclear force, which binds quarks into neutrons, protons
and other particles, is weaker, paradoxically, when the quarks are
closer together, but stronger as they are pulled farther apart _
the opposite of what happens with gravity or electromagnetism.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Scaling also shows up in Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: the
more finely you measure the position of a particle, viewing it on a
smaller and smaller scale, the more uncertain its momentum becomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything around us is scale dependent,'' West said. ``It's
woven into the fabric of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson he took away from this was that you cannot just
naively scale things up. He liked to illustrate the idea with
Superman. In two panels labeled ``A Scientific Explanation of Clark
Kent's Amazing Strength,'' from Superman's first comic book
appearance in 1938, the artists invoked a scaling law: ``The lowly
ant can support weights hundreds of times its own. The grasshopper
leaps what to man would be the space of several city blocks.'' The
implication was that on the planet Krypton, Superman's home,
strength scaled to body mass in a simple linear manner: If an ant
could carry a twig, a Superman or Superwoman could carry a giant
ponderosa pine.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rest of the universe, the scaling is actually much
slower. Body mass increases along three dimensions, but the
strength of legs and arms, which is proportional to their
cross-sectional area, increases along just two dimensions. If a man
is a million times more massive than an ant, he will be only
1,000,000 to the two-thirds power stronger: about 10,000 times,
allowing him to lift objects wighing up to a hundred pounds, not
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Things behave differently at different scales, but there are
orderly ways _ scaling laws _ that connect one realm to another.
``I found this enormously exciting,'' West said. ``That's what got
me thinking about scaling in biology.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point he ran across Kleiber's law. ``It is truly amazing
because life is easily the most complex of complex systems,'' West
said. ``But in spite of this, it has this absurdly simple scaling
law. Something universal is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Enquist became hooked on scaling as a student at Colorado
College in Colorado Springs in 1988. When he was looking for a
graduate school to study ecology, he chose the University of New
Mexico in Albuquerque partly because a professor there, Brown,
specialized in how scaling occurred in ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   There are obviously very few large species, like elephants and
whales, and a countless number of small species. But who would have
expected, as Enquist learned in one of Brown's classes, that if one
drew a graph with the size of animals on one axis and the number of
species on the other axis, the slope of the resulting line would
reveal another quarter-power scaling law? Population density, the
average number of offspring, the time until reproduction _ all are
dependent on body size scaled to quarter-powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an ecologist you are used to dealing with complexity _
you're essentially embedded in it,'' Enquist said. ``But all these
quarter-power scaling laws hinted that something very general and
simple was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The examples Brown had given all involved mammals. ``Has anyone
found similar laws with plants?'' Enquist asked. Brown said, ``I
have no idea. Why don't you find out?''
</P>
<P>
   After sifting through piles of data compiled over the years in
agricultural and forestry reports, Enquist found that the same
kinds of quarter-power scaling happened in the plant world. He even
uncovered an equivalent to Kleiber's law.
</P>
<P>
   It was surprising enough that these laws held among all kinds of
animals. That they seemed to apply to plants as well was
astonishing. What was the common mechanism involved? ``I asked Jim
whether or not we could figure it out,'' Enquist recalled. ``He
kind of rubbed his head and said, `Do you know how long this is
going to take?'''
</P>
<P>
   They assumed that Kleiber's law, and maybe the other scaling
relationships, arose because of the mathematical nature of the
networks both animals and trees used to transport nutrients to all
their cells and carry away the wastes. A silhouette of the human
circulatory system and of the roots and branches of a tree look
remarkably similar.
</P>
<P>
   But they knew that precisely modeling the systems would require
some very difficult mathematics and physics. And they wanted to
talk to someone who was used to trafficking in the idea of general
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicists tend to look for universals and invariants whereas
biologists often get preoccupied with all the variations in
nature,'' Brown said. He knew that the Santa Fe Institute had been
established to encourage broad-ranging collaborations. He asked
Mike Simmons, then an institute administrator, whether he knew of a
physicist interested in tackling biological scaling laws.
</P>
<P>
   West liked to joke that if Galileo had been a biologist, he
would have written volumes cataloging how objects of different
shapes fall from the leaning tower of Pisa at slightly different
velocities. He would not have seen through the distracting details
to the underlying truth: if you ignore air resistance, all objects
fall at the same rate regardless of their weight.
</P>
<P>
   But at their first meeting in Santa Fe, he was impressed that
Brown and Enquist were interested in big, all-embracing theories.
And they were impressed that West seemed like a biologist at heart.
He wanted to know how life worked.
</P>
<P>
   It took them a while to learn each other's languages, but before
long they were meeting every week at the Santa Fe Institute. West
would show the biologists how to translate the qualitative ideas of
biology into precise equations. And Brown and Enquist would make
sure West was true to the biology. Sometimes he would show up with
a neat model, a physicist's dream. No, Brown and Enquist would tell
him, real organisms do not work that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When collaborating across that wide a gulf of disciplines,
you're never going to learn everything the collaborator knows,''
Brown said. ``You have to develop an implicit trust in the quality
of their science. On the other hand, you learn enough to be sure
there are not miscommunications.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   They started by assuming that the nutrient supply networks in
both animals and plants worked according to three basic principles:
the networks branched to reach every part of the organism and the
ends of the branches (the capillaries and their botanical
equivalent) were all about the same size. After all, whatever the
species, the sizes of cells being fed were all roughly equivalent.
Finally they assumed that evolution would have tuned the systems to
work in the most efficient possible manner.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged closely approximated a so-called fractal network,
in which each tiny part is a replica of the whole. Magnify the
network of blood vessels in a hand and the image resembles one of
an entire circulatory system. And to be as efficient as possible,
the network also had to be ``area-preserving.''
</P>
<P>
   If a branch split into three daughter branches, their
cross-sectional areas had to add up to that of the parent branch.
This would insure that blood or sap would continue to move at the
same speed throughout the organism.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists were delighted to see that the model gave rise to
three-quarter-power scaling between metabolic rate and body mass.
But the system worked only for plants. ``We worked through the
model and made clear predictions about mammals,'' Brown said,
``every single one of which was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In making the model as simple as possible, the scientists had
hoped they could ignore the fact that blood is pumped by the heart
in pulses and treat mammals as though they were trees. After
studying hydrodynamics, the nature of liquid flow, they realized
they needed a way to slow the pulsing blood as the vessels got
tinier and tinier.
</P>
<P>
   These finer parts of the network would not be area-preserving
but area-increasing: the cross sections of the daughter branches
would add up to a sum greater than the parent branch, spreading the
blood over a larger area.
</P>
<P>
   After adding these and other complications, they found that the
model also predicted three-quarter-power scaling in mammals. Other
quarter-power scaling laws also emerged naturally from the
equations. Evolution, it seemed, has overcome the natural
limitations of simple geometric scaling by developing these very
efficient fractal-like webs.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it all seemed too good to be true. One Friday night,
West was at home playing with the equations when he realized to his
chagrin that the model predicted that all mammals must have about
the same blood pressure. That could not be right, he thought. After
a restless weekend, he called Brown, who told him that indeed this
was so.
</P>
<P>
   The model was revealed, about two years after the collaboration
began, on April 4, 1997, in an article in Science. A follow-up last
fall in Nature extended the ideas further into the plant world.
</P>
<P>
   More recently the three collaborators have been puzzling over
the fact that a version of Kleiber's law also seems to apply to
single cells and even to the energy-burning mitochondria inside
cells. They assume this is because the mitochondria inside the
cytoplasm and even the respiratory components inside the
mitochondria are arranged in fractal-like networks.
</P>
<P>
   For all the excitement the model has caused, there are still
skeptics. A paper published last year in American Naturalist by two
scientists in Poland, Dr. Jan Kozlowski and Dr. January Weiner,
suggests the possibility that quarter-power scaling across species
could be nothing more than a statistical illusion. And biologists
persist in confronting the collaborators with single species in
which quarter-power scaling laws do not seem to hold.
</P>
<P>
   West is not too bothered by these seeming exceptions. The
history of physics is replete with cases where an elegant model
came up against some recalcitrant data, and the model eventually
won. He is now working with other collaborators to see whether
river systems, which look remarkably like circulatory systems, and
even the hierarchical structure of corporations obey the same kind
of scaling laws.
</P>
<P>
   The overarching lesson, West says, is that as organisms grow in
size they become more efficient. ``That is why nature has evolved
large animals,'' he said. ``It's a much better way of utilizing
energy. This might also explain the drive for corporations to
merge. Small may be beautiful but it is more efficient to be big.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I was just promoted, and there is no doubt I am
in way over my head. There is so much to do, and just about
everywhere I turn, I find responsibilities that I do not know how
to handle. I was happy and successful in my prior position, and I
am thinking of asking for it back. Do you have any suggestions?
T.M.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not uncommon for newly promoted employees to feel
overwhelmed, overworked and over their heads. However, the fact is
that these are initial feelings, and before you take any action,
you need to give yourself some time.
</P>
<P>
   You should take immediate steps to identify the key job
priorities and the extent to which you have the expertise to handle
them. If there are some glaring gaps, you should put together a
personal plan to develop the necessary skills.
</P>
<P>
   In putting together this plan, you can include a combination of
readings, classes, and discussions with your manager and
significant others at work. Research continues to find that one of
the key sources of employee growth and development is through
interaction with associates on the job.
</P>
<P>
   If you return to your former position now, without exhausting
every possible strategy in order to succeed in your new position,
you will be left with lingering doubts for the rest of your career.
To be fair to yourself, you should do all that you can to work this
job, rather than let the job work you.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I interviewed for a job over a month ago and was told that it
came down to two people, but the company felt the other person was
better qualified and hired him. A couple of days ago I got a phone
call from one of the owners and he said that things did not work
out with the other person, and he offered the job to me. I'm not
sure I want to work for a company where I was the second choice.
What do you think? G.F.
</P>
<P>
   A. Just because you were the company's second choice does not
mean that the company views you as being second rate. In reality,
the company narrowed its job search down to two first-choice
candidates, one of whom seemed stronger.
</P>
<P>
   You can stand on ceremony and conclude that if the company did
not want you, then you do not want it. Or, you can step back and
recognize that the opportunity that originally attracted you to the
company more than likely still exists. You should go back and meet
with the owner and with some of the people with whom you would be
working. Spending more time at the company can definitely help you
make the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   You are not going to be permanently labeled as the second-choice
employee, unless you affix this label to yourself. If the owner
thought you were anything less than outstanding, he would not be
offering you the job now. The company may well have made a hiring
mistake a month ago, but if you walk away from this job offer, you
may be making one now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have a fairly new employee in our office who frequently
talks about her old company. She claims that they had better
policies and procedures, and she keeps trying to change the way
work is done here. Is there a way to get her to focus more on what
we are doing and less on what she did? A.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. New employees who focus on the workings of their old jobs can
be a source of new ideas or a source of new aggravation. The best
way to deal with them is through open two-way communication.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all of the employees, not just the vocal new ones,
should have frequent opportunities to express their ideas regarding
better ways in which their department or even the company can
operate. This can be through a combination of meetings, informal
discussions, designated committees and suggestion systems.
</P>
<P>
   The employees' recommendations that appear to have merit can be
implemented or at least tested, while those that are not feasible
can be referred back to the employees for further analysis and
revision. It is important for the employees to receive feedback on
their suggestions, regardless of merit.
</P>
<P>
   This approach may help your new employee channel her ideas more
effectively and perhaps bring more balance into her approach to
this job. However, if she is so focused on her prior job that she
is interfering with the productivity of her associates, then it is
time to give her some feedback regarding the importance of
concentrating more on where she is going and less on where she has
been.

   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I was just promoted, and there is no doubt I am
in way over my head. There is so much to do, and just about
everywhere I turn, I find responsibilities that I do not know how
to handle. I was happy and successful in my prior position, and I
am thinking of asking for it back. Do you have any suggestions?
T.M.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not uncommon for newly promoted employees to feel
overwhelmed, overworked and over their heads. However, the fact is
that these are initial feelings, and before you take any action,
you need to give yourself some time.
</P>
<P>
   You should take immediate steps to identify the key job
priorities and the extent to which you have the expertise to handle
them. If there are some glaring gaps, you should put together a
personal plan to develop the necessary skills.
</P>
<P>
   In putting together this plan, you can include a combination of
readings, classes, and discussions with your manager and
significant others at work. Research continues to find that one of
the key sources of employee growth and development is through
interaction with associates on the job.
</P>
<P>
   If you return to your former position now, without exhausting
every possible strategy in order to succeed in your new position,
you will be left with lingering doubts for the rest of your career.
To be fair to yourself, you should do all that you can to work this
job, rather than let the job work you.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I interviewed for a job over a month ago and was told that it
came down to two people, but the company felt the other person was
better qualified and hired him. A couple of days ago I got a phone
call from one of the owners and he said that things did not work
out with the other person, and he offered the job to me. I'm not
sure I want to work for a company where I was the second choice.
What do you think? G.F.
</P>
<P>
   A. Just because you were the company's second choice does not
mean that the company views you as being second rate. In reality,
the company narrowed its job search down to two first-choice
candidates, one of whom seemed stronger.
</P>
<P>
   You can stand on ceremony and conclude that if the company did
not want you, then you do not want it. Or, you can step back and
recognize that the opportunity that originally attracted you to the
company more than likely still exists. You should go back and meet
with the owner and with some of the people with whom you would be
working. Spending more time at the company can definitely help you
make the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   You are not going to be permanently labeled as the second-choice
employee, unless you affix this label to yourself. If the owner
thought you were anything less than outstanding, he would not be
offering you the job now. The company may well have made a hiring
mistake a month ago, but if you walk away from this job offer, you
may be making one now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have a fairly new employee in our office who frequently
talks about her old company. She claims that they had better
policies and procedures, and she keeps trying to change the way
work is done here. Is there a way to get her to focus more on what
we are doing and less on what she did? A.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. New employees who focus on the workings of their old jobs can
be a source of new ideas or a source of new aggravation. The best
way to deal with them is through open two-way communication.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all of the employees, not just the vocal new ones,
should have frequent opportunities to express their ideas regarding
better ways in which their department or even the company can
operate. This can be through a combination of meetings, informal
discussions, designated committees and suggestion systems.
</P>
<P>
   The employees' recommendations that appear to have merit can be
implemented or at least tested, while those that are not feasible
can be referred back to the employees for further analysis and
revision. It is important for the employees to receive feedback on
their suggestions, regardless of merit.
</P>
<P>
   This approach may help your new employee channel her ideas more
effectively and perhaps bring more balance into her approach to
this job. However, if she is so focused on her prior job that she
is interfering with the productivity of her associates, then it is
time to give her some feedback regarding the importance of
concentrating more on where she is going and less on where she has
been.

WOLVES (Phoenix) - Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said wolves are
here to stay in Arizona, and he meant it. Despite a quartet of
unsolved wolf killings, disappearances and recaptures, a new round
of wolf releases will soon bring more wolves than ever to the wilds
of eastern Arizona as biologists begin the second year of a highly
controversial wolf reintroduction experiment. Some wolves may even
arrive by helicopter as researchers attempt to keep the
captive-bread wolves as wild as possible by minimizing their
contact with people. Meanwhile, ranchers continue their opposition
in the federal courts, while environmentalists continue to post a
$50,000 reward for the arrest of those responsible for last year's
wolf killings. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL;

ENGLISH-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - The U.S. Supreme Court finally has

KEATING (Undated) - U.S. District Court Judge in Los Angeles has

BEGAY-NAVAJO (Undated) - In 1975, Kelsey Begay was drowning in
``dark waters,'' what Navajos refer to as alcoholism. Fresh from
the jungles of the Vietnam War, he lived on the streets of Los
Angelos, far away from his homeland on the Navajo Reservation. But
Kaibeto, a tiny Navajo community an hour from Page, beckoned. Begay
returned home and today is sworn in as president of America's
largest Indian tribe. By BETTY REID and BILL DONOVAN. Story will

JUSTICES REJECT APPEAL ON ARIZONA'S ENGLISH-ONLY LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday refused to review a
former provision of the Arizona constitution that made English the
state's official language but was struck down as restricting free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The justices without comment let stand an Arizona Supreme Court
decision that the English-only rule illegally required state
business to be conducted in English. The state court said the
provision violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech
by depriving non-English-speaking residents access to information
about the government and preventing them from having ``meaningful
communication'' with state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans for Official English, an ad hoc group that initiated
the controversial law, argued in vain to the U.S. Supreme Court
that the First Amendment does not apply to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Constitution prohibits the government from
restricting the free speech of citizens. However, the Arizona
provision limits only the government's speech, requiring that the
state conduct its business in English, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods, pressing the state's
opposition to the English-only rule, told the justices that the
advocacy group has not been harmed by the provision's removal and,
therefore, has no legal standing to fight for its reinstatement.
Several Arizona elected officials and state employees, in a
separate brief, said the state supreme court was correct in finding
a First Amendment violation and urged the justices to reject
Arizonans for Official English's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' action Monday marked the second time the case has
been before the high court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the provision's
opponents, saying the former state worker who opposed the
English-only law had left government service and had no standing to
continue her challenge.
</P>
<P>
   However, after the Supreme Court's decision, the Arizona elected
officials and state employees renewed the First Amendment fight,
losing at the trial level but winning in their appeal to the
Arizona Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans for Official English and its spokesman, Robert D.
Park, launched a ballot initiative that resulted in the 1988
adoption of the English-only rule. The provision, which was Article
28 of the state constitution, required Arizona to ``take all
reasonable steps to preserve, protect and enhance the role of the
English language as the official language of the state of
Arizona,''
</P>
<P>
   Under the provision, no government document was valid unless it
was written in English. Exceptions to the English-only rule allowed
the use of other languages in state documents referring to the
teaching of foreign tongues in public schools. State agencies were
also allowed to use other languages to protect public health or
safety and to ensure that the rights of criminal defendants and
crime victims were protected. &QL;

 &HT;    Cousins acquires N.C. firm
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cousins Properties Inc. has acquired the Atkins Group,
a Charlotte, N.C., real estate firm. The acquired firm's principals
will pursue development opportunities in the Carolinas for Cousins
and oversee marketing and leasing there.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based real estate investment trust named W. Henry
Atkins senior vice president in its office division. The other
principal of the firm, C. David Atkins, was named vice president in
the office division.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is the latest of several affiliations Cousins
Properties _ whose portfolio is dominated by metro Atlanta holdings
_ has established with local firms in Southeastern markets and
California since it embarked on a strategy of geographic
diversification.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins, which owns and develops large office complexes and
retail centers, already has two projects underway in Charlotte. The
largest is Gateway Village, a multi-use urban project that includes
the one-million-square-foot Bank of America Technology Center, a
joint venture with the bank. The other is a 500,000-square-foot
downtown office tower acquired in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Though 1998 brought economic challenges, Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Co. is chugging right along, Chief Executive M. Douglas
Ivester said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our '98 volume growth is coming in a bit below our long-term
target of 7 to 8 percent worldwide, but not much below. Earnings
will likely be down from 1997,'' Ivester told a packed house at the
Rotary Club of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The final numbers will come out when Coca-Cola releases
fourth-quarter earnings, expected before month's end. But the
showing should be no surprise, given the company's warnings in the
second half of last year that results would be dragged down by
comparisons to one-time gains recorded in 1997. The company also
cited global economic uncertainty and weak currencies in several
major markets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. were estimating that
Coca-Cola would hit a fourth-quarter earnings target of 30 cents
per share before Ivester's December announcement that
lower-than-expected volume would drop earnings to 24 or 25 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
   The expected earnings reduction has somewhat clipped Coca-Cola's
wings on Wall Street, bringing the company's stock down 26 percent
since July. It closed Monday at $66.12 1/2, down $1.87 1/2.
Overall, though, 14 of 24 analysts who follow the company currently
have buy or hold ratings on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who seldom speaks before a crowd as he did Monday, told
of the ``tremendous opportunity'' he sees for the world's No. 1
soft drink company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to chuckle sometimes when I read that some analyst is
fretting about our 'global exposure.' I hate to tell them, but
that's the idea,'' he said. ``We are cognizant of the events of
1998 _ but they don't alter our long-term view.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Coca-Cola sold nearly 16 billion cases of its soft
drinks in 197 countries last year, including 11 billion cases
outside North America. That's about a billion more cases than the
company sold in 1997 _ and there's no end in sight, Ivester said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worldwide, people will drink 48 billion servings of
refreshment today, but only a little more than 1 billion of those
servings are ours. In 10 years, with population growth, the world
will drink 55 billion servings a day,'' he said. ``Now we don't
have to get all of that. But if we get just 2 billion of that we
will double our company's size.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he said, the company plans to continue building its
brands and acquiring new ones. Last month, Coca-Cola said it would
spend $1.85 billion to acquire Cadbury Schweppes' soft drink
operations in all of the 120 countries where the London-based
company does business except the United States, France and South
Africa. It's still in negotiations to acquire Orangina, owned by
French-based Pernod Ricard SA.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you can look for more significant developments from us
later this year,'' Ivester said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a question-and-answer session, Ivester confirmed
reports that the company is ``cautiously'' investigating entering
the domestic bottled water business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottled water is a tricky subject. There's an awful lot of
water sold, but there's not an awful lot of money made selling
water,'' he said. ``We never said we're in this business for
growth. We're in this business for profitable growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is well prepared for the introduction of the Euro,
which does not appear to pose any ``detrimental'' concerns, as well
as Year 2000 computer conversions, which should be completed by
June 30, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester didn't have much to say regarding rival Pepsico's plans
to spin off its company-owned bottling operations in an initial
public offering this spring that's expected to raise $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Pepsico's plans, Coca-Cola will keep its gaze set
on the tried and true market-by-market approach to selling soft
drinks, Ivester said. Pepsico's stock closed Monday at $40.87 1/2,
down 50 cents.

 &HT;    The Falcons want the NFL's king of kings to know poetic justice
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In its face, the script for this NFC Championship
might have been written 182 years ago by the smash-mouth poet Percy
Bysshe Shelley: ``My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:/Look on my
Works, ye Mighty, and despair!''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, mighty enough themselves, are given little chance
against Minnesota, a team already primping for coronation. Vegas
set the opening line at 10 points. The Vikings beat Arizona by
three touchdowns and warned they hadn't played all that well. The
headline writer at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper
captured the prevailing thought: ``Yikes, it'll be the Vikes.''
</P>
<P>
   To look on Minnesota's works is indeed to feel unease. The
Vikings have lost only once, have scored more points over the
course of a regular season than any team ever. But this is to say
that any rush toward despair should be halted forthwith. Teams like
the Vikings have been beaten before. By, not coincidentally, teams
like the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   We remember the Buffalo Bills as forlorn Super Bowl foils, but
we forget how omnipotent they seemed when first they reached the
land of Roman numerals. Plying the cutting-edge no-huddle offense,
the 1990 Bills scored 44 points in the first playoff game and beat
the Raiders 51-3 for the AFC title. Alongside this sleek
assemblage, the New York Giants seemed plodding. The plodders won
by a point.
</P>
<P>
   Ottis Anderson trundled for 102 yards. The journeyman Jeff
Hostetler kept drives moving interminably. The Giants held the ball
for 40 minutes and 33 seconds. Sometimes the best defense is an
offense that won't yield the ball. What team leads the NFL in time
of possession? Why, the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It's instructive that the team that held the record for points
before Minnesota didn't win a championship. The 1983 Washington
Redskins _ Joe Theismann and John Riggins, Hogs and Smurfs _ were
favored in Super Bowl XVIII but lost 38-9. The best-ever offense
smacked into an even better defense.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders cornerbacks Lester Hayes and Mike Haynes muzzled the
Smurfs. Nose tackle Reggie Kinlaw overpowered center Jeff Bostic,
squelching Riggins. Derrick Jensen blocked a Redskins punt for the
game's first touchdown. (Quoth Dan Reeves: ``The quickest way to
lose a game is to have a punt blocked.'') Jack Squirek intercepted
a screen pass to break it open before halftime. Marcus Allen rushed
for 191 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson led the NFC in rushing. The Falcons' defense led
the conference in rushing defense. How far can you go by doing
those two things? Only all the way. The 1974 Pittsburgh Steelers
were decided underdogs in the AFC title game, the thinking being
that the Raiders had essentially won the Super Bowl by eliminating
Miami on Clarence Davis' catch the week before. But Franco Harris
and Rocky Bleier rushed for 209 yards and the great Steelers front
four limited Oakland's rushers to 29. Pittsburgh won 24-13 on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   And Ozymandias, self-described ``king of kings''? Well, he lost,
too. In Shelley's poem, the haughty inscription quoted above was
found on a shattered statue in the desert _ ``that colossal wreck .
. . '' Sounds like a game plan to me.

 &HT;    Running back Anderson bestows gifts upon blockers
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons' season-long feel-good party
continued Monday, when running back Jamal Anderson rewarded his
offensive linemen and three other blockers with 36-inch flat-screen
televisions.
</P>
<P>
   The blockers helped Anderson rush for a franchise-record 1,846
yards on an NFL record 410 carries in the regular season and
another 113 yards and two touchdowns on 29 carries in Saturday's
20-18 playoff victory against the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, giant TV boxes were scattered in the locker
room for left tackle Bob Whitfield, left guard Calvin Collins,
center Robbie Tobeck, right guard Gene Williams, right tackle
Ephraim Salaam, tight end O.J. Santiago, fullback Bob Christian,
and tight end/fullback Brian Kozlowski.
</P>
<P>
   The units retail at one Atlanta video store for $1,044 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're state of the art,'' Santiago said. `` 'Jam' is that
kind of guy. There are a lot of great running backs, but to have
guys that lay it on the line is important, too, and he knows
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson surpassed the 1,000-yard mark in the 10th game
with a 31-carry, 100-yard, two-touchdown effort in a 31-19 victory
against San Francisco on Nov. 15, Whitfield put in the order for
TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to get us 20-inch TVs,'' Whitfield said.
``When he'd have a big game, we'd be going, 'The gift is getting
bigger.' When I saw that big box, I said, 'He's the greatest
running back ever.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a fifth-year pro who finished as the NFL's
second-leading rusher behind Denver's Terrell Davis, who had 2,008
yards, also scored a franchise-record 14 rushing touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He has one more year left on his contract, calling for a salary
of $1.6 million. He has earned $850,000 in bonuses for rushing
yardage, which will be added to next season's salary. Anderson also
has earned bonuses of $30,000 for being named first-team All-Pro,
and $25,000 for being voted to start in the Pro Bowl.

 &HT;    Vikings warn Falcons: Don't expect to hear
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER PARK, Minn. _ From one dome team to another, the Vikings
say this to the Falcons: Too bad you have to come to our house.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that Atlanta has to face the explosive Minnesota
attack, but the Metrodome crowd rates among the loudest in the NFL,
and Viking players are feeling no pity that their dome-dwelling
adversary in Sunday's NFC Championship game have to endure what
promises to be the loudest crowd of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've earned that advantage,'' running back Leroy Hoard said.
``Everybody had the same opportunity we had to gain it. We won 15
games _ that's got to count for something. I was standing next to
Robert (Griffith), yelling at him and he couldn't hear me. That's
how loud it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the noise was fan-generated, but the Metrodome also
employs a sound system that blares everything from sound effects to
rock music. To that, Hoard said, ``So, am I supposed to feel sorry
for (the Falcons)? I don't think so. It's an advantage we earned.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle John Randle said, ``We couldn't hear (Sunday
against Arizona), so how could the other team?''
</P>
<P>
   Fancy formations
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings used 15 different formations in their first 16 plays
on Sunday against Arizona, and the young defense seemed confused by
the constant movement, shifting and, at times, odd lineups. Hoard
said it was much to-do about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was like smoke screens,'' he said. ``A lot of
movement and stuff to run the same play we always run. So it comes
down to: Are you trying to stop a formation or a play? Plus, we
still have to execute, no matter if they're confused or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The most confusing formation appeared to be when the Vikings
lined up with running back David Palmer as the shotgun quarterback,
with regular quarterback Randall Cunningham at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick added: ``We did
nothing we haven't done all year, except that we only used Palmer
(at QB) on third down. We've got great talent, and the thing is to
involve everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoard said he can throw the ball, but he hasn't been given the
opportunity _ for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can throw the ball far, but I have no touch,'' he said. ``I
can throw it 70 yards. So if I'm called on to throw it, it's going
70 yards, whether someone's out there or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are hoping Randall McDaniel's knee and Jake Reed's
and Orlando Thomas' hamstrings will be healed by Sunday. McDaniel
was listed Monday as probable, with Reed and Thomas questionable.
``That's where depth comes in,'' Green said. ``We hope they can go,
but if not, we'll put somebody else in there and go. Everybody's
injured this time of year. It's part of the game.''

 &HT;    Anderson marks the spot for Vikings defense
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER PARK, Minn. _ Right between the 3 and the 2 on Jamal
Anderson's jersey, the Minnesota Vikings have placed an imaginary
target ``X.'' Anderson, a Pro Bowl running back, is definitely a
marked man, the perceived single most important facet of the
Falcons' assault. Minnesota's thinking: Cut off the head, and the
legs will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their defensive preparation this week will evolve around
limiting Anderson. The Falcons lead the NFL in time of possession,
a key element against the record-setting Vikings' offense. Simply,
they can't score if they're not on the field.
</P>
<P>
   That's where stopping Anderson comes in for Minnesota's defense.
It's a unit that has size, but that physical condition is not what
coach Dennis Green believes will be enough to handle Anderson, who
had 1,570 yards in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a running team, and the No. 1 element against them has
to be quickness,'' Green said. ``Then you have to have toughness.
Then explosiveness and then attitude. I didn't mention size. We
like big guys. But that's not the key. We know they're going to
come at us, but we have to negate (Anderson) with quickness,
toughness, explosiveness and attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings know that Anderson seldom is tackled by the first
defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you end up being a single tackler (against Anderson), you'd
better be good, because we've seen him run through guys,'' said
nose tackle Jerry Ball, who anchors the Minnesota interior line.
``He's got the power of Natrone Means, but the quickness of Barry
Sanders. He has great lateral movement. Someone like Garrison
Hearst only runs straight ahead. But people like Emmitt Smith,
Barry Sanders, Jamal Anderson, they hit holes that aren't holes _
they're creases. They make creases holes and get through them.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Anderson's quick feet and vision allow him to cut back
for yardage, Ball said, so it's vital for the Vikings to have
backside pursuit. ``Yeah, he shifts gears and goes the other
direction. He can sense a different hole is there,'' Ball said.
``So we have to watch the backside, because he's like Barry
Sanders, cutting against the grain.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Green is not expecting the Vikings to run over
Atlanta, as they have so many others this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point of the season, stopping the run and controlling
the ball is something you have to do,'' Green said. ``They have a
fine running game. But they were 14-2. They have a complete team. I
know it's not going to be like the Jacksonville game or Baltimore
or even Arizona, where we scored a lot of points and ran away. It's
going to be a close, hard-fought game that'll go 60 minutes.''

 &HT;    Inside pro tennis: Korda receives cold reception from players
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Petr Korda, whose positive test for steroids was made known last
month, has arrived in Melbourne a week before the Australian Open
to find what amounts to a lynch mob of players wanting him to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas Bjorkman suggested that the International Tennis
Federation ban Korda from defending his title. Jason Stoltenberg
said he wants Korda to withdraw on his own. Richard Krajicek
demanded that the ITF explain why Korda was spared the mandatory
one-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The ill will toward Korda started Dec. 22, when the ITF
announced that Korda had tested positive for the steroid Nandrolone
at Wimbledon and was being stripped of points and $94,529 in prize
money won there.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Korda did not knowingly take any prohibited
substance, an independent appeals committee eliminated the ITF's
one-year suspension. Under pressure from players, the ITF last week
appealed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Korda has declined to speak about the case this week, but he
said at the time, ``I have never cheated, and I have never taken
any steroid to increase my performance on the court. When I first
heard the news, I thought it was a bad joke. . . . Now, I suppose I
will always have a black mark on my back for the rest of my life
and never be able to clean it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Korda's response apparently hasn't moved many of the players.
Bjorkman, who lost to Korda in a five-set quarterfinal last year at
the Australian, told The Age newspaper in Melbourne that the ITF
was ``scared'' to crack down on a top player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cheat, you should be suspended for two, three, four,
five years,'' Bjorkman said. ``I think it is the worst decision the
ITF (ever) made.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoltenberg, ranked 27th, said there is widespread anger and
even talk of a boycott in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think they're saying that to show how strongly they
feel about him not playing,'' Stoltenberg said. ``And I support
them in what they're saying. It's silly that he hasn't been
punished for a level-one steroid.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, who called Korda ``gutsy'' for playing through the
controversy, pressed the ITF for a fuller explanation, which could
come Saturday at a mandatory ATP Tour players meeting in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek's questions: If Korda is guilty, why no suspension? If
he is innocent, why any penalty at all, and why aren't the tests
more reliable?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ITF really did make some kind of mistake with the test,
it's very bad for Petr,'' Krajicek said, ``because now he's got the
name, and it's going to be very tough to shake it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players asked that no one pass judgment until the ITF
explains its position further. ``I really prefer not to see such an
outcry for a lynching,'' Todd Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Aussie great Pat Cash, expressed what apparently is the
prevailing opinion among players: ``How . . . can you take steroids
accidentally?''
</P>
<P>
   In Korda's native land of the Czech Republic, the tabloid Blesk
was equally unsympathetic with a headline last week that screamed:
``Petr, the truth or get out!''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly. . .
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T Challenge is making a pitch for Boris Becker and
defending champion Pete Sampras to play in the April 26-May 2
tournament at Atlanta Athletic Club. . . . Steffi Graf could face
Serena Williams in the second round of the Adidas International
this week in Sydney. The winner probably would get Venus Williams
in the third. . . . The draw for the Australian Open will be
announced Friday. . . . Best new face of 1999 thus far has been
Australian 15-year-old Jelena Dokic, the U.S. Open junior girls
champion who beat No. 15 Sandrine Testud and No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario last week in the Hopman Cup.

PEDIATRICIANS RENEW BATTLE OVER TOILET TRAINING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J.)  (nk) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toilet training is not rocket science, says John Rosemond, a
syndicated columnist and best-selling author of parenting books. He
considers it ``a slap to the intelligence of a human being that one
would allow him to continue soiling and wetting himself past age
2.'' The process, he says, should be as simple and straightforward
as housebreaking a four-month-old puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the noted pediatrician, says there is
more to it than that. Parents who force toilet training, he says,
can cause lasting problems. ``Don't rush your toddler into toilet
training or let anyone else tell you it's time. It's got to be his
choice,'' Brazelton advises in a television commercial for Pampers
``Size 6'' diapers, suitable for children 35 pounds and over. What
does he think about Rosemond's arguments? ``They sound very logical
_ for a puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the newest round in the toilet training wars.
</P>
<P>
   The previous round was won by parenting experts like Brazelton
and Dr. Benjamin Spock, who schooled a generation of 1960s parents
in a more flexible toilet training approach.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few decades, the age at which toddlers become
diaper free has been creeping upward. In 1957, 92 percent of
children were toilet trained by the age of 18 months, studies
found. Today, that figure has plunged to less than 25 percent,
according to a large-scale Philadelphia study. Only 60 percent of
children have achieved mastery of the toilet by 36 months, the
study found, and 2 percent remain untrained at the age of 4.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, though there are no hard statistics, pediatricians say
they are seeing more children with toilet training problems,
including withholding of urine and stool, chronic constipation and
wetting and soiling by older children. Dr. Bruce Filmer, an
associate professor of pediatric urology at Thomas Jefferson
University in Medical School in Philadelphia, for example, says
that he and other pediatric urologists have noticed an increase in
referrals of young patients experiencing problems with both daytime
and nighttime urinary control.
</P>
<P>
   And these developments combined have nourished a multibillion
dollar diaper industry, which last year racked up $545 million in
training-pant sales, and spurred the introduction of the
giant-sized diaper, designed for toddlers well past the terrible
twos.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of diaper-clad 3- and 4-year-olds, however, does not
amuse Rosemond, a family psychologist who advocates a return to
traditional child rearing practices, and he has decided to do
public battle on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of columns, published in more than 100 newspapers
last month, he blamed delayed training on wishy-washy parenting
inspired by ``Freudian mumbo-jumbo.'' In particular, he pointed at
Brazelton, professor emeritus of pediatrics at Harvard Medical
School, who in the 1960s pioneered the ``child-centered'' parenting
approach, recommending that parents let their children decide when
to become diaper-free.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing tendency for parents to leave the timing of
toiling training up to the child, Rosemond asserted, is largely
responsible for the rise in toilet training difficulties. Delayed
training, he said in a telephone interview, can also lead to
discipline problems because mothers spend too much time being
servants for their children and do not make the transition soon
enough to ``authority figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rosemond concedes that Brazelton has been giving the
same advice for decades, he also criticized the pediatrician for
serving as a consultant to Pampers, a division of Procter &AMP; Gamble,
and for appearing in the Pampers commercials. ``I think it's a
fairly blatant conflict of interest,'' Rosemond said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brazelton said he believed that the rise in toilet
training problems is the result of too much pressure on kids _ not
too little. The increase can be traced to the escalating demands of
modern life, he said. centers often require that children be toilet
trained in order to enroll, and working parents end up leaning on
their kids to comply. Nannies and baby sitters share the
responsibility for training. ``Parents are feeling very guilty and
people like Rosemond are making them feel more guilty, not less,''
Brazelton said. ``And the child's only recourse is to withhold
urine or stool in protest.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his relationship with Pampers, which also provides
funding for his research, Brazelton said he is proud of his
association with the company. ``It took me a long time to decide to
do it, but I'm absolutely convinced that it was a wonderful thing
to do,'' he said. ``I'm certainly not doing it to keep kids in
diapers. It's just the opposite: Pampers is willing to go along
with me to make it easier for mothers to let kids be open to toilet
training when they are ready.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Going along,'' of course, is not all that difficult for
Procter &AMP; Gamble which, like its competitor Kimberly-Clark, maker
of Huggies, recognizes a bonanza when it sees it. Wendy Strong,
director of corporate communications for Kimberly-Clark, said the
company's own marketing research confirms that toddlers are toilet
training later than in the past: At 18 months, only 12 percent of
children were trained; 85 percent were trained by 30 months, the
company found. Huggies, too, just began offering customers a Size 6
diaper, but the company also makes ``training pants'' for toddlers
of 38 pounds or more, a product category, Strong said, that
Kimberly-Clark ``expects to grow to more than a billion dollars by
2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever expert's school of parenting parents decide to follow,
they run no risk of confusing the philosophies, or the methods
themselves. Rosemond offers a toilet training technique he calls
``Naked and $75,'' which he recommends that parents embark upon
with their two-year olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stay home from work with your child for a few days, you
let the child walk around the house naked all day long,'' he said.
The parent puts the potty where the child spends most of his time,
and moves it when necessary to keep it nearby. Every so often, the
parent reminds the child to use the potty when needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children at this age do not like urine and feces running down
their legs,'' Rosemond said. ``When they have an accident they stop
and start to howl, and the mother comes along and says `Well, you
forgot to use the toilet.' She puts him on the toilet, wipes him
off, speaks reassuringly to him. And within three days, or five
days, he's doing it on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The 75 dollars, he added, is for the carpet cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Brazelton, also the author of best-selling
parenting manuals, discourages parents from expecting their child
to potty train in a few days. The pediatrician recommends that
parents buy a potty chair and ``show children what is expected of
them at 2, what we are all doing and why it is important.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rate at which training occurs should be left up to the
child. ``If your child is afraid of the potty chair, don't put
pressure on him to use it. Put toilet training aside for a month or
two and give your child time to get used to the idea of the potty
and to be comfortable with it,'' Brazelton advises in a
step-by-step guide available on the Pampers Parenting Institute web
site (www.pampers.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Be patient and positive,'' the pediatrician suggests. ``As
with any new skill, your child will master toilet training in
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In his experience, Brazelton said, 85 percent to 90 percent of
children will embrace toilet training soon after they first show an
interest. ``But the others are saying that there are other issues
they're trying to deal with, like day care, like parents who are
extremely busy. The child gets confused and maybe even angry and
withholds. And at this point I think you have to be able to say,
`This has got to be up to you.'''
</P>
<P>
   For parents, the bottom line seems to be: Whatever works.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Saren, for example, a Manhattan attorney, said that she
tried introducing her son Matthew to the potty when he was 3. ``But
I think looking back on it that I started when I was ready, not
when he was ready,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, nothing seemed to work, not bribes, not the books
``Once Upon a Potty'' or ``Everyone Poops,'' not ``big boy''
underwear. Finally, she said, Matthew decided the time was right _
when he enrolled in day care at 3 and a half. ``Seeing the other
boys poop in the potty'' seemed to do the trick, she said. ``I
would fall into the category of thinking that you just leave them
alone and they'll come to it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other mothers _ Rosemond said his daughter-in-law is one example
_ find the ``stay-at-home-and-do-it-in-three-days'' approach works
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Many pediatricians, on the other hand, say their experience has
landed them much closer to the Brazelton than the Rosemond camp.
</P>
<P>
   Filmer, for example, said that he has seen many parents become
embroiled in battles with their children if they try to force
toilet training within a defined period of time. ``Goodness me, you
talk to these parents and they will tell you that their children
formed almost a fear of toilet training,'' Filmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Taubman, a pediatrician in the department of
gastroenterology and nutrition at Childrens Hospital in
Philadelphia who has a private practice Cherry Hill, N.J., agrees
that early toilet training was a phenomenon of an earlier, less
mobile time, when most mothers stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a child trained by 2 can be done, but it is probably
done at a cost. It takes a tremendous effort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Taubman says he has a hunch, though he does not yet have
data to support it, that there is a window of opportunity, perhaps
near the age of 2 or 2 and a half, ``when kids really want their
parents to get excited if the kids poop.'' If this opportunity is
missed, toilet training may take much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Taubman is one of the few people who have collected systematic
data on toilet training: In 1997, he published the first large
scale study of children's reactions to toilet training since the
1960s, a report on 482 children in suburban Philadelphia. The study
appeared in the journal Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to assessing the ages at which most children now
train, Taubman found that on average, boys trained later than girls
and that the average age at which parents introduced toilet
training was at 23 months.
</P>
<P>
   There was no relationship, Taubman found, between when a child
was trained and the mother's work status, the presence of siblings,
the child's scores on measure of behavior, or whether or not the
child was in day care.
</P>
<P>
   About 13 percent of the children in the study had trouble with
toilet training, withholding stool and/or refusing to use the
toilet. But the vast majority of these children, Taubman said,
``resolved the problem without intervention.''

   KISANGANI, Congo _ The new chairman of Congo's state-owned
mining company is not from Congo. He is a 39-year-old transport
entrepreneur and former race car driver from Zimbabwe, Billy
Rautenbach. Congo's president calls him ``Mr. Billy.''
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Kisangani, in the nation's east, Ugandan soldiers
patrol streets almost empty of cars. The cars, locals say, were
stolen long ago by Rwandan soldiers, who are disliked here. These
days, the Rwandans stay mostly out of sight in camps south of the
muddy Congo River.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, in the minds of outsiders hungry for its riches _
gold for traders and souls for missionaries _ Congo has rarely
belonged to itself alone. Now this huge and unsteady state has
become a battlefield for soldiers from no fewer than six foreign
nations who are fighting a war that has as much to do with problems
outside of Congo as inside it.
</P>
<P>
   A fundamental reworking of the old rules of Africa may be
unfolding in the five-month-old Congo war. By explicit agreement,
African nations are not supposed to invade one another. But critics
of Uganda and Rwanda, Congo's neighbors to the east, say those two
countries did exactly that by sending troops in August to help the
rebels seeking to overthrow President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The borders of African nations, set up arbitrarily by the
Europeans who colonized the continent a century ago, are supposed
to be inviolable. Yet Congo is now split in two, perhaps for good:
Kabila and his allies _ Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad _
control its western two-thirds. The rebels and their allies _
Uganda and Rwanda _ control a growing third in the east.
</P>
<P>
   With so many combatants, a major question is where the conflict
is leading not only Congo but Africa itself. Diplomats around the
world worry that a full-blown regional war may not be far off, for
already no African war has ever drawn in so many outside nations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the longer run, many experts say that the Congo war may
become a point of departure from which African nations begin to
re-imagine themselves in ways not possible under the old rules of
engagement. Wars among nations, largely absent since Africans
became independent starting in the 1960's, may become more common.
As troubling, many experts say, the national boundary lines that
have defined African countries for a century, and lent some
stability, may slowly come apart.
</P>
<P>
   It is a danger that worries many people in Congo _ fighters,
politicians and ordinary Congolese. ``If we make the mistake of
partitioning the Congo, all of Africa will follow because all our
borders are artificial creations,'' said Dr. Kabamba Mbwebwe, the
chief of the emergency room at Kinshasa General Hospital, who is
involved in opposition politics here. ``It's a really dangerous
precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders are concerned too. A senior European diplomat here
calls the Congo war ``the first big test of borders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we left behind _ the British, the French, the
Germans, the Belgians,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``Nobody is happy with the borders they
have, but nobody wants to open the Pandora's box.''
</P>
<P>
   Congo is particularly divisible, experts say, because these
foreign troops tread on land rich in gold, diamonds, copper,
cobalt, oil and timber. Each outside nation has interests in Congo
_ security, financial or both. So some Africa watchers say that a
second and more subdued scramble for Congo, this time involving not
Europeans colonists but its own neighbors, is also helping to pull
the nation apart.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is not lost here in Kisangani. ``Because of our
weakness,'' said Omari Leasisi, a former Governor of the eastern
province Kivu, whom Kabila just released from prison, ``We have
become a neo-colony of other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why Congolese think their destiny has slipped
from their fingers _ 20 months after Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator
since 1965, was overthrown and the nation of Zaire became, once
again, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   News of major developments in the war come as often from
Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, as from Kinshasa, the capital of Congo.
A few weeks ago, the head of the badly divided rebels, Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba, had to fly to Uganda to learn from officials there the
details of a peace meeting in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It is a loss of control that angers people in Congo. The
country's major cities crawl with foreign troops, often staying
free in the best hotels. At the Inter-Continental Hotel here,
Zimbabwean soldiers get on the elevators on one floor, Namibians on
another and Angolans on yet another, all wearing different
uniforms, but armed with pounds of guns and explosives. In
Kisangani in the rebel-held area and Lubumbashi in the Government
zone, there are reports of food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   People around the nation are adamant that Congo must remain
intact. ``Being Congolese is like being in your bath,'' said Louis
Kembo, a businessman in Kisangani. ``It's your place. It's yours.
It can never be divided.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Congo is Africa's second largest country after Sudan, a third as
big as the United States. By sheer size, location and potential for
wealth, it is one of Africa's most important countries. But it
barely ever existed as a state, either under Belgium's loose
colonialism or under Mobutu's years of corruption and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 ethnic groups live in Congo. Roads are impassable.
Kinshasa, in the west, is a capital in name only, its monuments
crumbling and its hold over the east theoretical even before the
war. These days, the Government grasps for ways, from songs to
clothing, to unify the country and its people. It produced a video
featuring many of Kinshasa's most famous singers just to get people
to use the new Congolese franc.
</P>
<P>
   But few people have televisions. Along the eastern border, 1,000
miles away, people have bank accounts and use telephones next door
in Rwanda. In the southeast, they gravitate philosophically to
South Africa and mundanely, for services like mail, across the
border to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congo should never have been one state,'' said Basil
Davidson, an eminent Africa scholar. ``It simply suited Belgian
convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Congo's beginnings were fractured _ and experts say a straight
line runs from its birth to its problems today. In 1884, the
explorer Henry Morton Stanley arrived in Belgium with the raw
materials for incoherence: 450 treaties from men claiming to be
chiefs and willing to cede sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Congo was a central question of a conference in
Berlin, which ended in 1885 with the first draft of how Europe
would carve up Africa. The borders established had little to do
with geography or the lines that separated ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in 1963, the newly free nations gathered to form the
Organization of African Unity and enshrined the Berlin borders in
its charter. A second understanding was equally important: no
African nation had the right to invade another African nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 35 years since, there have been few exceptions to either
rule. Now the conflict in Congo threatens both.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Rwanda and Uganda, worried about rebels attacking their
own borders from inside Congo, sponsored a group of anti-Mobutu
rebels headed by a slightly disreputable longtime exile, Laurent
Desire Kabila. Mobutu, near death physically and politically, was
toppled in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But relations between Kabila and his sponsors, Uganda and
Rwanda, quickly soured (as they did with the United States, itself
a cold war patron of Mobutu) as Kabila turned independent and
autocratic. Last summer, he purged his leadership of advisers from
the Tutsi ethnic group who had helped him to power. He also failed
to control the fighters who continued attacks on Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   So in August, those two nations sent troops to back a second
rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, again dominated by
Tutsis, but this time to unseat Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad all sent in troops
to back him, angrily citing the noninvasion principle. The stage
was set for a war unlike any other in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Only last week Salim Ahmed Salim, the secretary general of the
Organization of African Unity, reaffirmed the group's strong
opposition to outside intervention, condemning Uganda and Rwanda by
drawing a comparison with another Congo neighbor that has steered
clear of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Tanzania has its interests in D.R.C. as a neighbor, since
the war in Congo means a continued influx of refugees, but did not
send troops,'' Salim said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Shatzberg, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, who has written three books on Zaire, said: ``Those old
rules had their drawbacks, but they were effective in keeping the
genie of interstate conflict in the bottle. All bets are off at the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many experts argue that the war in Congo is essentially a
stalemate, with each side unable to dislodge the other. Some fear
that Congo's neighbors simply want to carve up the nation and annex
territory outright. Rwanda, for example, could then have an enclave
of land populated by Tutsis as a way to prevent a genocide like the
one in 1994. Other experts believe that Rwanda and Uganda could
establish a military protectorate, just as Israeli troops and their
militia allies have occupied part of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Others see an economic motivation _ the ability to plunder
Congo's rich natural resources. Many of the nations who are taking
sides in this war have financial stakes, according to Johan
Peleman, director of the International Peace Information Service in
Belgium, which studies financial incentives behind conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Pelemen said Ugandans _ notably President Yoweri Museveni's
brother _ have gold mining and other business interests in the
east. Angola has signed a joint venture with Congo's state oil
company. The rebels claim that Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe,
has personal mining investments in the south and that the
appointment of Rautenbach, the Zimbabwean transport executive, to
head the state-owned mining company, Gecamines, is payback for
Zimbabwe. Rautenbach denies any political connections.
</P>
<P>
   Private mining companies, Peleman speculated, could also sign
contracts giving any of the players an incentive to keep the
territory they hold _ or at least let the war drag on.
</P>
<P>
   ``For economic players, border sovereignty and all that stuff is
not so important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all Mobutu's failings, Congolese and outside experts say, he
gave life to a national identity even as the state itself expired.
Since the rebellion, many Congolese express that identity sharply
in terms of who they are not _ that is, any of the six outside
nations.
</P>
<P>
   This sense of both nationalism and hostility seems strong, on
either side of Congo's cleft. In Kisangani, Ebony Badengo, 50, a
bank manager with a soft voice, exploded when asked whether his
nation could be cut up. ``This big country is good for us,'' he
said. ``The idea of partition is coming from other countries who
want to get it. We would never accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has almost never been up to the Congolese to accept or
refuse decisions about the shape of their country. As more
countries join this war _ the Central African Republic opened its
territory to Kabila's forces two weeks ago _ the assertions in
Kinshasa that it is not worried about a break-up sound less
convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the government has erected new billboards in the
capital, next to old ones showing the bald head of Kabila with the
message: ``With this man, hope is reborn!''
</P>
<P>
   The new roadside propaganda is less boastful, but more pleading,
clearer in its call for unity. One billboard urges people to unite
and support Kabila. And next to it, an ambitious call for something
that eluded the Belgians and Mobutu, and seems ever more elusive
now: ``Only one goal: Integral development.''

FOR HORSEPLAYERS, IT'S GULFSTREAM FANTASY TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)   (For release Sunday, Jan. 17.)  
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For New York horseplayers, January is the cruelest month. The
excitement of the late-fall Breeders' Cup, horse racing's
equivalent of the Super Bowl, has long since faded away, and the
local action, such as it is, has moved to the dreary confines of
Aqueduct. There, hard by John F. Kennedy Airport, shivering
jockeys, stung by the icy wind off Jamaica Bay, thrash their
blue-collar mounts across the frozen dirt, witnessed by sparse
crowds made up of the desolate and the desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of these die-hard fans nourishes a fantasy, and it's
right on the overhead simulcast monitors that transmit the signal
from Gulfstream Park outside Miami. Just a three-hour flight away,
happy horseplayers in sunglasses and loud shirts are watching
first-class racing against a backdrop of swaying palms and tropical
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sight to make the heart ache, and many a bettor, driven
mad by the vibrant purple Gulfstream sign above the starting gates,
has cracked under the pressure and booked passage south. Wandering
the grandstand and the clubhouse at Gulfstream, you can see them,
the most downtrodden of the New York railbirds, mysteriously
transplanted to racing's winter paradise. They wear the dazed look
of prisoners who have won a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing has its times and seasons. In spring, the talent,
and the attention of racing fans, moves to the Kentucky circuit, as
the most gifted 3-year-olds gear up for the Kentucky Derby. At the
height of summer, Saratoga opens for business in the East, and Del
Mar revs up on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But in the dead of winter, from early January to mid-March,
Gulfstream is the place, as top jockeys and trainers from the
Midwest and the East migrate south, lured by bigger purses and a
steady diet of important stakes races like the Donn Handicap, the
Hutcheson Stakes, the Fountain of Youth Stakes, the Pan American
Handicap and the Gulfstream Park Handicap. The highlight of the
meet is the $750,000 Florida Derby, often a launching pad for
horses en route to Kentucky and the Run for the Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Six days a week, Gulfstream offers good, competitive racing in
an idyllic setting. The blindingly white race-track building, a
three-level affair, is enormous and well equipped, without the long
lines that torment New York horseplayers. Service is efficient and,
with rare exceptions, polite, another sharp contrast.
</P>
<P>
   The self-service betting machines all work, although there could
be more of them, and there are well-organized race-replay stations
where bettors can call up past races for profitable study. The
betting infrastructure is sound, in other words. Gulfstream also
offers simulcast betting on at least 10 other tracks, including
Aqueduct, which means that vacationing New Yorkers can look at what
they left behind and gloat. This year, as a kind of bonus,
Gulfstream will reopen for three days, Nov. 5 to 7, to play host to
the Breeders' Cup, which takes place on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream is easy for newcomers to master. Agents stationed at
the information counters just inside the grandstand and clubhouse
entrances field any and all questions, from the location of
restaurants to the ins and outs of placing a bet, and on Saturdays
and Sundays the track offers lecture-demonstrations on betting at
12:30 and 3:30 in the Inside Track Room. The wisest first step,
however, is to ask for a ``Welcome to Gulfstream'' brochure. It
folds out into a color map of the race track with instructions on
how to place a bet and what the different bets mean. It also
includes short descriptions of the track's cafes and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   So much for orientation. With brochure in hand, walk over to a
nearby booth and pick up a Daily Racing Form ($3 plus tax, or
$3.25) and, if you must, one of the myriad tipsters' sheets that
claim to offer special insights into the day's races. Then proceed
to the paddock area, at the rear of the building, where before each
race the horses are led around the English-style wood-chip walking
ring fringed with violets and lavender. Watch with a keen eye. Does
your horse have fire in his eye and a bounce in his step? Does he
exude a winner's confidence? This is the time to look up close.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the race _ you can cash that winning ticket
later _ take up a position on the clubhouse terrace right next to
the path that leads from the walking ring to the track. This is
where the jockeys emerge, faces covered in dirt, to report back to
the trainer and, in most cases, to answer the $64,000 question:
What happened? You can overhear some fascinating conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Tour the grandstand side of the walking ring, making sure to
stroll through the Garden of Champions, a formal walk lined with
obelisks whose plaques honor equine greats that have run at the
track, like A.P. Indy, Spectacular Bid and Holy Bull. The area is
decorated with beds of impatiens, geraniums and Dusty Miller,
forming a patriotic red, white and blue pattern. Cigar, the
wonderhorse who reeled off 16 straight victories before retiring in
1996, gets a special tribute in the form of a life-size bronze
statue and flower beds in the stable's colors.
</P>
<P>
   Now to the races. For a good view, buy a reserved seat, which
costs $3 in the clubhouse and $2 in the grandstand. The extra money
is worth it. With no heads in the way, and a good second-floor
vantage, you can get a perfect view of the action without having to
stand up. Besides, it's a pleasure to relax before each race and
survey the track and infield, a beautifully landscaped greensward
punctuated by banks of salmon, red and silver flowers (49 beds in
all, with 52,000 annuals), royal palms, and the box-shaped hedges
arranged along the turf course at precise intervals. On the
infield's enormous lake, a miniature red-and-white paddlewheeler
called the Suwanee River putts back and forth aimlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Take a deep breath. The sun is shining, the palms are swaying,
and a tropical breeze wafts the buzz and murmur of the crowd. You
hold what is undoubtedly a winning ticket. Life doesn't get any
sweeter. To ice the cake, Gulfstream has imported Tom Durkin, the
familiar voice of New York racing, to make the calls.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If hunger strikes, Gulfstream abounds in fast-food concessions
and snack stands, some with Mexican and Cuban dishes, and fancier
fare is offered at a handful of restaurants. The Royal Palm Dining
Room and its covered outdoor annex, the Terrace Dining Room, occupy
prime real estate, on the ground floor at the clubhouse turn. This
year Gulfstream has brought in Levy Restaurants, the company that
owns Spaggia and Bistro 110 in Chicago, to run the track's food and
beverage services.
</P>
<P>
   For the Royal Palm, Levy has laid out a glorified brunch buffet,
called the chef's table, where for $18.95 diners can construct a
meal from appetizers to dessert. The a la carte menu is priced from
$6.95 to $14.95. There is a $1 seating charge at the Royal Palm and
Terrace. For reservations, call (954) 457-6254.
</P>
<P>
   The Rooftop Bar and Grill, on the second-floor clubhouse level,
is more casual, with fancy sandwiches (hickory-smoked ham and
Gruyere cheese on a pretzel loaf, for example) and fanciful drinks,
like the splendor in the grass martini. Menu prices run from $5.95
to $12.95. The high rollers head for the Turf Club, a more formal
dining room on the third floor of the clubhouse, where the
offerings, priced from $4.95 to $13.95, include crab cakes with
lemon aioli, red snapper with saffron couscous and pan-roasted
garlic chicken. Men must wear jackets, and nonmembers must pay $10
to enter. For reservations, call (954) 457-6255.
</P>
<P>
   Warning. All race-track dining rooms steer favorite customers to
the best tables _ the ones along the windows _ and condemn
unfamiliar faces to Siberia. At the Royal Palm, I was seated at a
table behind a pillar and a view-blocking overhang. At the Turf
Club, although I had made reservations the day before, the hostess
installed me at the one table that lacked a television monitor, so
I could not tune in Aqueduct. A modest amount of pleading and
complaining brought some relief, although not a coveted trackside
table.
</P>
<P>
   There's something perverse, in any case, about sitting indoors
to watch an outdoor sport, especially one that takes place under
limpid blue skies, with the thermometer poised at a perfect 78
degrees. Savor the moment. With a cold beer in one hand and a
promising trifecta ticket in the other, saunter over to the rail
and, for one race at least, watch the herd thunder down the
homestretch, preferably in the right order.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, there's a payoff. Win or lose, when the race is
over, drop by the simulcast monitors and take a look at Aqueduct.
Admit it, doesn't that feel good?

 &HT;    Barnes gives 'a speech to govern' By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Orman and John Stanfill knew Roy Barnes when he was a
boy working at his family's general store in Mableton.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, they stood beneath a perfect blue sky and watched Barnes
take office as governor of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always real outgoing,'' said John Stanfill, 65. ``I
knew he was going to be a preacher or a politician, one.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes sounded a little like both in his 15-minute inaugural
address Monday. After an election last fall that was one of the
most divisive in state history, he appealed for people of both
parties and all races to join together.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 4,000 offered only polite applause, but Barnes'
well-wishers, such as the Stanfill brothers, gave him high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no zinger lines, but there was a whole tone of
working together,'' said Sen. David Scott (D-Atlanta). ``It was
conciliatory.''
</P>
<P>
   While the speech might not have been the most exciting of
Barnes' political career, ``I was excited about the content,'' said
state Rep. Terry Coleman (D-Eastman).
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a speech to govern,'' Coleman added, ``not a campaign
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans could find little to criticize in Barnes' first
speech as governor. ``He put out his hand to us,'' said Rep. Steve
Stancil (R-Canton). ``I hope he lives up to that.''
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, the Barnes administration got off to an
auspicious start. While the last few governors had chosen to take
the oath of office indoors, Barnes bucked that trend in favor of
the steps on the west side of the Capitol, the traditional site for
inaugurations in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He was rewarded with clear skies and tolerable, if brisk,
temperatures. In fact, the sun shone so brightly that Barnes had to
forego using a Teleprompter because of the glare.
</P>
<P>
   While those who attended the inauguration in person enjoyed
perfect weather, some who watched on TV or the Internet experienced
technical problems. A live feed on the state's Web site was briefly
interrupted, and some MediaOne cable system customers in Atlanta
lost signals from local stations that were carrying the speech.
</P>
<P>
   History suggests that Barnes' inauguration speech, and the
attending ceremonies, will barely be remembered compared to his
accomplishments as governor. Nevertheless, for those who were
there, Monday was an historic day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important to our state,'' said Earl Daniels, a Georgia
State University student who walked over after class to witness the
event. ``It's important to our government and to our way of life.''
</P>

TRAVELING THE WEB  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By L.R. SHANNON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are three independent sites on the World Wide Web, each of
which intends to be your main or only stop for arranging travel.
They all succeed, at least to some extent; they also all fail, to
some extent. They are all worth a look. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON-LINE PLANNING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.travelscape.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Architected to fully automate and individualize personal
travel planning,'' as it promotes itself, Travelscape is crammed
with just about every-thing needed to arrange, or ``architect,'' a
journey. There are sections devoted to cities, hotels, booking,
``hot deals,'' vacations, free trips and, happily, help. If the
on-screen help is not good enough, there is a toll-free telephone
number ``for further assurance of travel integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opening page, a few packages are spotlighted. If you know
where you want to go, you can fill out a form for the service to
check rates and schedules for flights and hotels, either together
or separately. I said I wanted to leave Newark on Feb. 13, fly to
New Orleans, and return Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the time it took to pour a fresh cup of coffee, a new screen
had appeared with three flight options, two of them from La Guardia
Airport rather than Newark, and five hotels in New Orleans. The
free trip, a kind of sweep-stakes, was from Los Angeles to Kauai,
Hawaii, but to enter the contest you must provide such personal
information as name and address and are encouraged, but not
required, to contribute additional information. (``How many
vacations do you take per year?'' None of your business.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``hot deals'' were for rooms at five ``luxury-level hotels''
in New Orleans, ostensibly at 15 percent to 50 percent below the
usual rates. Even though I was booking more than a month before my
trip, none of the hotels had any hot-deal rooms available.
Travelscape is still worth a look, and maybe even a stay. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LINKS GALORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.tripspot.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tripspot, a self-styled ``travel sweetspot,'' has little
original content. It offers links to scores of other Web sites,
some relevant but many not. It is certainly easier to find an
airline, hotel or cruise here than to ride out on the wild wild Web
without a scout. And, as with more and more sites, you can shop
here, too; the so-called unclaimed baggage center sells books,
music, videos, electronic gear, clothing and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The ``library'' is heaped with travel books and other
publications. It is too easy to get distracted in Tripspot. I ended
up in a site full of dumb quotations, which was fun but had nothing
to do with arranging a trip. A sample: Duffy Daugherty, the late
college football coach and sports analyst, about a player: ``Not
only is he ambidextrous, but he can throw with either hand.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHEAT SHEETS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.previewtravel.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preview Travel says it gives you free access to the same
information travel agents use. There is a destination guide (from
Fodor), hotel, air and car reservations, and vacation and cruise
packages. Separate sections are farefinder and carfinder,
emphasizing low prices, and a business-travel subsection with maps,
weather forecasts and a currency converter, where you can create a
cheat sheet to carry on a foreign trip.
</P>
<P>
   There are two long lists of currencies, alphabetically from the
American dollar to the Venezuelan bolivar, and the program converts
from the currency selected in the left-hand list to the currency
selected in the right-hand list.

DODGE CITY, WHERE WYATT EARP STOOD TALL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Okla., Colo., N.M., Neb., Taxas)  (For release Sunday, January 17)  
(jw) 
 By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hadn't gone to Dodge City to be a tourist and see the sights
and artifacts of the mythical Old West town, but I was struck from
the time I arrived by the way the past _ both real and imagined _
was all around and slipped into the most routine of conversations.
One man said that when he told friends in another part of the
country that he was moving to Dodge City, they seemed surprised to
learn there really was such a place. Folks at the Chamber of
Commerce wondered if I knew that the handsome brick building in
which we talked was atop the original Boot Hill, where at least 26
people were ``planted'' after meeting their final fate in less than
pleasant circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, I can confirm that there really is a Dodge City, a
place on the high plains of southwestern Kansas that proudly uses a
longhorn steer as its town symbol and whose main drag, in its
historic section, is still called Front Street. There was never a
Marshal Dillon, but there was a Sheriff Bat Masterson and a Deputy
Marshal Wyatt Earp. There was never a Miss Kitty, but the real life
of the beautiful and talented Miss Dora Hand was better than
fiction, right up until she was fatally shot in the mayor's bed.
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop for their lives is recreated in a museum village
that occupies the remainder of the old Boot Hill site _ a row of
wooden buildings modeled on the businesses that existed on Front
Street before they burned down in a series of fires in 1885, almost
coinciding with the end of the cattle drive days. The actual Front
Street was, and remains, about three blocks to the east, where
today's downtown stores continue to do business. In summer, the
museum village is filled with tourists watching actors re-enact
gunfights and dancers do the can-can at the Long Branch Saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Between Memorial Day and Labor Day you can also ride the Dodge
City Trolley to other historic sites. That includes a swing east of
town to old Fort Dodge, established in 1865 to protect a long
section of the Santa Fe Trail, but shut down in 1882. Several of
the early buildings of the fort remain, and some are open to
visitors, among them Sutler's Store, where soldiers once bought
their whisky and played cards. About a mile east of the fort, on
Highway 400, there's a 38-foot cross commemorating the site where
Coronado is believed to have crossed the Arkansas River in his
quest for Quivira in 1541. But on this frigid, blustery day last
January I was probably the only potential sightseer in town, and I
shivered in the car and dreamed of being enveloped in one of the
buffalo robes that used to be a staple of Dodge City life.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I was delighted to find the chief reality check on
Dodge City inside the warm rooms of the Kansas Heritage Center,
dedicated to the history of the Old West in Kansas and nearby
states. Noel Ary, the center director and a former biology teacher,
spends his days sorting out fact from fancy in a history ``retold
so many times that you often don't know what's real and what
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are familiar with Dodge City through `Gunsmoke,'
though it wasn't quite like that,'' he told me. ``Enough names were
dropped and places mentioned in the television series to give it
credibility. We know Doc Holliday was here, at least once. He was a
dentist, and we found an ad in The Dodge City Times in 1878 saying
he was seeing patients in his room at the Dodge House.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Heritage Center was founded with a federal education
grant during the Johnson administration. The grant was used to buy
many of the center's 7,000 books on Western history. The center
also has the military correspondence from Fort Dodge and some maps
and other documents gathered from Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico
and Nebraska. More important, however, the center is the
repository, on microfilm, of nearly all issues of the 20-odd
newspapers published in Dodge City since 1876. The newspapers are
the most reliable source of information on local history, because
the creators of ``Gunsmoke,'' it seems, were not the first to
exaggerate a bit. Ary says many of the books in the center's
collection are also more fiction than fact.
</P>
<P>
   Among the travelers who find their way to the center, part of
the local school administration building, are history buffs
painstakingly looking for the hardened ruts of wagon trains along
the Santa Fe Trail. They can find a few, Ary will tell them,
particularly at a site nine miles west of town on the north side of
Highway 50, but the fact is that the Santa Fe Railroad laid many of
its rails directly into the old trail bed, and the railroad still
runs right through town, along Wyatt Earp Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, telephone calls come from Europe, especially
Germany and Britain, and also from Japan. Writers and researchers
in those countries display considerable interest in America's Old
West. Some of the callers want Ary to send one of the ``cowboy
kits'' that the center lends to Kansas schools. The kits, which the
center does not send outside the state, contain items meant to give
students the feel of the Old West, including 10-gallon hats, chaps,
lariats and bandannas. Ary remembered an e-mail request from a
woman doing her doctoral dissertation on the influence of women in
the Old West. And a high school senior wanted information on Dodge
City's attitude toward prostitution in the old days. Sometimes,
genealogists will stop at the center while trying to run down
ancestral black sheep who took off for the West to escape debts, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Dora Hand may have been one of those who came to Dodge City to
escape the past. She arrived in the summer of 1878, and her singing
so captivated the town that she was, according to The Dodge City
Times and The Ford County Globe, ``engaged as a vocalist in the
Varieties and Comique shows.'' People guessed that she was a
European-trained opera singer who had fled great sadness somewhere
back East. The newspaper described her as ``a prepossessing woman''
whose ``artful winning ways brought many admirers within her smiles
and blandishments.'' But, alas, she fell ill that very October, and
Mayor James (Dog) Kelley invited her and another ailing lady to
recuperate in his home, while he occupied himself elsewhere. As
Dora lay abed, someone out to get the mayor fired two shots into
the house and killed her _ as the newspaper said _ ``in full bloom
of gayety and womanhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the West's legendary lawmen _ Bat Masterson, Wyatt Earp,
Bill Tilghman and Charles Bassett _ formed a posse and rode out
after the man said to be her killer, the son of a founder of the
famed King Ranch in Kingsville, Texas. They captured their man and
brought him back to Dodge City, where he was tried but because of
insufficient evidence was found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a story that Ary truly delights in telling about the
reckless abandon of old Dodge City, however, it is that of another
female in Kelley's life: Paddy the bear. Someone brought her to the
mayor while she was a cub, and no one knows why he named her Paddy.
Most of the time she was kept chained behind the mayor's
restaurant, where children often visited. As she grew older, the
mayor's drinking buddies played a lot of pranks on Paddy, which
eventually made her mean. So she was shot, and a butcher shop put
her remains on sale as steak and other cuts at 25 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   In its obituary of Paddy on Dec. 29, 1883, The Dodge City
Democrat said many families enjoyed her for Christmas dinner, and,
the writer also recalled, she could drink more whisky than he
could. I suppose you could say that at least she didn't end up in
Boot Hill.

CLINTON LAWYERS ATTACK IMPEACHMENT CASE AS BASED ON `MYTH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for President Clinton on Monday declared
the president innocent of charges contained in the articles of
impeachment and said the perjury case against Clinton was based on
``myth.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House arguments came in its formal response to the
Senate summons officially notifying Clinton that the Senate would
start his impeachment trial Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, House prosecutors in the Senate trial, led by
Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., filed a trial
memorandum backing up their contention that Clinton's actions
warrant removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Both documents were opening salvos in the second Senate
impeachment trial in the nation's history. House prosecutors start
the proceedings Thursday with up to 24 hours of argument, followed
by an equal amount of time for the White House legal team. After
that, senators will submit written questions and likely decide
whether to dismiss the case or call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-page White House response reiterated many of the basic
points that Clinton's lawyers made during House impeachment
hearings: Clinton neither lied to the grand jury nor obstructed
justice in hiding his affair with Lewinsky. And in any case, the
impeachment articles are too vague and do not ``meet the
constitutional standard for conviction and removal,'' the response
said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the 50-page House document recited most of the points
gone over at the same hearings: Clinton lied about his sexual
relationship with Lewinsky and obstructed justice by covering it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the memorandum charged Clinton with lying in his
Aug. 17, 1998, grand jury testimony when he said he had not had
``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky under the definition provided to
him by lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment
lawsuit. It also charged the president with participating in an
``on-going scheme'' to obstruct the Jones case and the grand jury,
and to ``tamper'' with witnesses to get them to testify falsely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is not about sex or private conduct,'' the House
prosecutors argued. ``It is about multiple obstructions of justice,
perjury, false and misleading statements and witness tampering _
all committed or orchestrated by the president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers did not file a motion to dismiss the
charges, a move that likely would come after both House prosecutors
and the White House legal team complete their opening arguments
before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by White House Counsel Charles Ruff and Clinton's private
lawyer David Kendall, the response said the perjury charge
contained in the first article is based on a ``myth'' that the
president failed to admit a relationship with the former White
House intern. The article approved by the House last month said
Clinton in his grand jury testimony lied about ``the nature and
details of his relationship'' with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton acknowledged ``an improper
intimate relationship'' with Lewinsky, and that he had been alone
with her on certain occasions, the White House team said. That was
in marked contrast to his Jan. 17, 1998, deposition in the Paula
Jones lawsuit, in which he denied having had ``sexual relations''
with Lewinsky and could not recall whether they had ever been
alone.
</P>
<P>
   But White House lawyers argued that Clinton is not on trial for
statements under oath in the Jones deposition because the House
specifically rejected an impeachment article based on that
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House managers should not be allowed to prosecute before
the Senate an article of impeachment which the full House has
rejected,'' the response said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also characterized the perjury article as
``vague,'' explaining it ``fails to identify any specific statement
by the president'' that is an alleged lie. But the response then
goes on to say the impeachment article lumps ``multiple instances''
of alleged perjury together.
</P>
<P>
   This could set up a situation in which senators who believed
Clinton lied in one instance but not in the others would have to
vote for the entire first article, making it possible for House
managers to garner the 67 votes necessary for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Were the alleged mistruths packaged in individual articles,
senators would have to vote on each one, making conviction less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking people to vote on multiple charges without
giving them the ability to look at each charge, weigh the evidence
and make a reasoned judgment,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the second article, alleging obstruction of justice, White
House lawyers said Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to file a ``limited
but truthful affidavit'' after she received a subpoena in the Jones
case on Dec. 19, 1997. In that affidavit, Lewinsky denied a sexual
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The response also says Clinton was unconcerned about gifts he
had given Lewinsky being subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers, and that
he did nothing out of the ordinary to help Lewinsky land a job in
New York. The document cites several instances in which Lewinsky
said that no one ever directed her to lie or promised her a job in
exchange for silence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, two Democratic senators, Tom Harkin
of Iowa and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, said they planned to move
to open up the full range of Senate impeachment deliberations to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Senate impeachment rules provide for an open trial but would
require deliberations on procedural questions, motions or on a
verdict to be done behind closed doors.

 &HT;    WINDOWS PRICING DOMINATES MICROSOFT TRIAL
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The secretive world of Windows pricing practices
took center stage Monday at the Microsoft antitrust trial even as
the company released testimony arguing that the software giant sets
its fees too low and enhances its products too often to be branded
as a monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   In winding up its case, the government contended that Microsoft
manipulates the prices it charges computer makers to load Windows
on their machines so as to reward its allies and punish its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The data gathered from Microsoft and the computer firms under
Justice Department subpoenas was presented by economist Franklin
Fisher after U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will
issue a verdict, sealed the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson acted after Lee Levine, a lawyer for some news
organizations that are covering the landmark trial, argued that
Jackson should open all but the most ``confidential sensitive
information'' to public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys for Dell Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.,
two of the largest computer makers and both ardent supporters of
Microsoft, urged the judge to keep the pricing information hidden.
While both lawyers were allowed to attend the closed session, they
reportedly promised Jackson that they would not reveal what they
heard to their respective clients.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's pricing charts were coded by name and his data was
redacted to show only the deviation from the mean that Microsoft
charged each manufacturer. Nevertheless, Microsoft lawyers
successfully held that the government's encoding system could be
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, who made the case for keeping the trial open, said he
knew of ``no precedents'' in high-profile antitrust trials where
the testimony of a witness _ as opposed to sensitive documents _
was taken in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, in newly released testimony, Microsoft's first
witness, economist Richard Schmalensee, disclosed that the company
had sold 125 million copies of Windows 95 for more than $7 billion
_ an average price of $56.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive sections of Schmalensee's testimony also were
excised from public scrutiny _ such as the actual prices that
Microsoft charges its various customers for Windows. The economist
wrote, however, that a monopolist would set its charge ``at least
16 times'' higher than what is currently levied to load Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee estimated that if Microsoft could raise the price of
Windows by 5 percent, it could raise its pre-tax revenues by an
extra $173 million. A 10 percent increase, he wrote, would earn the
company an additional $345 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a profit-driven firm not known for leaving money on
the table pass up such easy money?'' Schmalensee asked. ``No one,''
he suggested, ``could possibly conclude that Microsoft enjoys the
quiet life of a monopolist.''
</P>
<P>
   A document filed earlier in the case by another economist, David
Sibley, places the price Microsoft charged most companies for
Windows 95 at $65 _ with up to an another $16 off in promotional
discounts for its best customers. The current version of the
operating system, Windows 98, retails for $89, although ``street''
prices are often sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
   In open court, Fisher testified that Microsoft can set its
prices as it chooses, in part because computer makers effectively
have no choice except to buy Windows, which is being shipped on
more than 95 percent of newly minted personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, David Boise, the government's lead
lawyer in the case, said he ``could not answer'' whether Microsoft
had changed its pricing practices in response to the allegations
``because he might have to touch on matters that were under seal.''

RESTAURANT GROUP DISPUTES SMOKING BAN STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Banning smoking in some Massachusetts restaurants did
not hurt their business, according to the largest study to date of
the economic impact of municipal smoking bans in eateries.
</P>
<P>
   However, the researchers acknowledged problems with their
approach _ measuring meals-tax receipts in communities with smoking
bans _ and the Massachusetts Restaurant Association strongly
disputed the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which covered 1992 through 1995, compared meals-tax
receipts in 32 towns that adopted smoking bans to 203 towns that
did not. The study did not include Boston, which adopted a
restaurant smoking ban last autumn.
</P>
<P>
   On average, revenue in the smoke-free-dining communities rose 4
percent, compared to 2 percent in those without smoking bans. After
accounting for seasonal trends and local demographics, ``Our models
failed to find a statistically significant effect of local,
smoke-free policies on restaurant business,'' said study co-author
William J. Bartosch of the Center for Health Economic Research in
Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of complicating issues in the study, however.
Thirteen of the 32 communities adopting bans did so during 1995, so
only a few months of revenue data were available from after their
bans took effect. Another 17 of the 32 adopted bans during 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Many chain restaurants also report sales from several outlets in
one filing to the Department of Revenue that is not broken down by
town, a problem the researchers could only partially correct for.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, for example, a town that adopted a restaurant smoking
ban in 1995, was dropped from the comparison because it is the
corporate headquarters of the Bertucci's pizzeria chain, and the
database lists all Bertucci's tax receipts for that town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meals-tax database can potentially over- or underestimate
the meals-tax receipts of any single community, and it is
impossible to perfectly match meals receipts with communities,''
Bartosch and Gregory C. Pope wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Potter, a senior official with the Westborough-based
restaurant association, said his group has tried to conduct its own
analyses, but has been warned by the Revenue Department that ``you
really can't use these meals-tax figures'' to calculate trends
because of problems with how the data are collected.
</P>
<P>
   Potter said his members' experience is that ``you definitely can
see them hurt business if it's a highly restrictive ban,'' but that
ordinances that reserve up to 30 percent of seats for smokers do
not hurt revenues.
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Cod, for example, anecdotal reports indicate that recent
restaurant smoking bans in Chatham and Orleans have helped push
business to neighboring Brewster, Eastham, and Harwich, Potter
said. None of those towns was in the study.
</P>
<P>
   In Dorchester, Nanina's Italian restaurant reported that
receipts dropped by $1,500 a week after a smoking ban took effect
in October, prompting the restaurant's owners briefly to flout the
ban before getting slapped with a $300 fine and agreeing to back
off and install a bar where diners could smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hartzfeld, chief executive officer of the 35-unit Back Bay
Restaurant Group operation, which includes Paparazzi, Charlie's and
Hillary's restaurants, said he has seen ``no impact'' on sales in
communities such as Boston where local authorities consulted with
restaurant owners first and allowed special smoking areas insulated
from non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But they lost 10 to 11 percent of business at a Chestnut Hill
Paparazzi restaurant where the city of Newton totally banned
smoking without consulting restaurant managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it is done with foresight and participation from business
owners, it has not had a negative impact,'' Hartzfeld said.
``There's something to be said for a well-thought-out,
well-planned-for ban'' that allows for smoking in bars or creates
segregated smoking areas.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's
Substance Abuse Policy Research Program and published in this
month's Journal of Public Health Management and Research.

 &HT;    CLINTON CALLS FOR DISMISSAL OF IMPEACHMENT CHARGES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton entered a formal ``not guilty''
plea Monday to impeachment charges, arguing that none of the
accusations, even if proved, would warrant his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   In its formal 13-page response to four perjury charges and seven
obstruction of justice charges pending before the Senate, Clinton's
lawyers launched a multi-pronged legal and constitutional assault
on the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   The legal brief maps out the lines of defense the White House
intends to use in the trial. It doesn't take a lawyer, however, to
grasp the two central points of the White House defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The charges in the articles do not constitute high crimes and
misdemeanors,'' states the first heading in the lawyers' preamble.
''The president did not commit perjury or obstruct justice,''
states the second.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, prepared under Clinton's guidance, his 11-person
legal team makes the case that all the charges against him in the
two articles of impeachment should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers stopped short of making a formal motion for
dismissal, however, opting instead to comply with the unanimous
will of the Senate to hear opening arguments first.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to go forward on the schedule set out by the
Senate. ...Then there'll be a time for motions,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're at the final stage of this process, and we can do it two
ways: we can do it fairly and expeditiously, or we can do it fairly
in a process that's open-ended and takes months and months,'' said
Lockhart. ''We prefer the former rather than the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan adopted in a 100-0 vote Friday, the Senate will
hear, beginning Thursday, up to 24 hours of presentations from
Clinton's accusers. Over a period of about three days, the 13 House
``managers'' will present evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Clinton's defense team will have 24 hours starting Jan. 19
to make its case. After that, the Senate will question both sides
and then vote on a motion to dismiss the case, with a simple
majority required to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   If that motion fails, the trial moves forward into a second
phase more complicated _ both legally and politically _ than the
first. The divisive, and as yet undecided, issue of whether to call
witnesses will move quickly to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds majority of the Senate would be needed to convict
Clinton, a finding that would require him to leave office
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers said Friday, however, they expect the Senate
to dismiss the charges after phase one of the trial. On Monday,
they laid out their strategy for that phase, attacking the charges
against him on multiple fronts.
</P>
<P>
   As a first line of defense, Clinton's lawyers argue simply that
none of the charges meets the constitutional test of an impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The charges in the articles do not rise to the level of 'high
Crimes and Misdemeanors' as contemplated by the Founding Fathers,''
the White House brief argues, ''and they do not satisfy the
rigorous constitutional standard applied throughout our Nation's
history. Accordingly, the Articles of Impeachment should be
dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House brief confronts each separate charge with
head-on denials.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the perjury charges, Clinton's lawyers assert, for
instance, that it is ''a myth'' that the president lied about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky during
grand jury testimony last Aug. 17, during which he read a statement
acknowledging that his encounters with her ''did involve
inappropriate intimate contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers go on to argue that the perjury charges
against Clinton are ''fatally flawed'' because they bundle all four
allegations into a single article. Under that structure, Clinton's
attorneys argue, he could be found guilty if two-thirds of the
Senate agreed that he committed perjury on any combination of the
charges, even though they might not agree in those numbers on any
one specific charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This creates the very real possibility that conviction could
occur even though Senators were in wide disagreement as to the
alleged wrong committed,'' Clinton's lawyers stated. ''The
president could be convicted even though he would have been
acquitted if separate votes were taken on each allegedly perjurious
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also specifically deny that he urged Lewinsky
to lie under oath when she testified in December 1997 in the sexual
harassment case of former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''The President denies that he encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie if
and when called to testify personally in the Jones case,'' the
White House brief states.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from Lewinsky's own testimony, the White House lawyers
argue that she made exculpatory statements _ testimony that would
exonerate Clinton _ that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr ignored
in his report. For example, the brief states that Lewinsky
testified, ''No one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a
job for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment article does not accuse Clinton of telling
Lewinsky to lie. It charges him with urging her to make a statement
under oath that he knew to be ''perjurious, false and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   That charge comports with the accusation levied by Starr in his
report last September to the House Judiciary Committee summarizing
his inquiry into the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the president did not expressly instruct her to lie,
according to Ms. Lewinsky, he did suggest misleading cover stories.
And, when she assured him that she planned to lie about the
relationship, he responded approvingly,'' the Starr report states.
</P>
<P>
   In a handwritten statement to Starr's office, for example,
Lewinsky wrote that ''The President told Ms. L to deny a
relationship, if ever asked about it. He also said something to the
effect of if the two people who are involved say it didn't happen _
it didn't happen,'' according to the Starr report.

CARRYONS CREATE SOME EXTRA BAGGAGE FOR SQUABBLING AIRLINES
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 17.) 
(ms) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The major airlines are fighting one another over how many bags,
and what size bags, passengers may carry on board. But instead of
being pawns in the latest airline wars _ in which Continental is
suing Delta, and the biggest flight attendant union is asking the
government to impose a uniform carry-on rule _ passengers can take
some steps to improve their chances of getting their bags on board
if they understand what's behind the battles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problems stem from the confluence of two trends: the growing
popularity of large bags with wheels and record numbers of occupied
seats. In the past five years the number of empty seats has dropped
by a third, Transportation Department records show, heightening
competition for the storage space in overhead bins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has flown recently knows that departures can be
delayed and cross words exchanged between passengers and flight
attendants when the last few passengers arrive huffing and puffing
only to discover that there is no room for their bags, which must
then be checked at the gate.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines and US Airways, which are heavily dependent
on short flights, are the staunchest opponents of strictly limiting
carry-on bags. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to accommodate our customers so they can bring aboard
the baggage that they have,'' said Julie Gardner, a Continental
spokeswoman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continental is spending $14 million, or about $80,000 a plane,
to install deeper overhead bins on all but its oldest planes. The
bins are 2.7 inches deeper, and provide enough extra room that most
bags with rollers can slide in bottom first, instead of having to
be turned sideways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a move that drew wide attention to its policy of
accommodating passengers with roller bags, Continental sued Delta
Airlines on Nov. 24 for strictly enforcing tough carry-on baggage
rules at Lindbergh International Airport in San Diego, where Delta
controls Continental's security checkpoint. Delta, which said the
suit lacks merit, uses a Plexiglas template to restrict the size of
bags that pass through its X-ray machines.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United, which has jumbo bins on its 777 long-haul jumbo jets, is
considering larger bins on its short-haul 737's, said Joe Hopkins,
a spokesman. That is a sharp change from a year ago, when United
experimented with a rule limiting passengers on discount tickets to
one carry-on, which drew so many complaints that it was quickly
ended. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But United has not given up on trying to persuade more
passengers to check their bags. ``We are trying to improve on-time
departure performance,'' Hopkins said, ``and we think we can do
that by not having to check so many items at the last minute.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 42,000
members at 10 airlines, has petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration to adopt a uniform rule on carry-on baggage so that
its members do not get caught in disputes between airlines and
passengers. The union fears that members could be disciplined
unfairly, said Chris Witkowski, a union spokesman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendant union wants carry-on bags limited to 45
linear inches, which is the sum of the height, width and depth of a
bag. A bag 14 inches high, 22 inches wide and 9 inches deep _ a
total of 45 inches _ would qualify. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The union is also concerned with safety issues. In a survivable
crash the overhead bins may fly open, with heavy bags becoming
potentially lethal missiles. And in numerous emergency evacuations,
as when a Tower Air 747 ran off a runway at Kennedy International
Airport in New York in December 1995, people had to climb over
baggage strewn in the aisles and were slowed by passengers who
insisted on collecting their belongings before fleeing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government is being drawn into the debate because the
airlines, through the Air Transport Association, a trade
organization for 22 major passenger and cargo airlines, have been
unable to agree on a one-rule-fits-all solution. Under Federal
rules each airline sets its own policy, which must be approved by
the Federal Aviation Administration.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The use of templates at X-ray machines ignores a reality of
soft-sided carry-ons: Most of them will compress to fit under a
seat or in an overhead bin if air is squeezed out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, the United spokesman, suggests carrying a plastic bag
inside your soft-sided carry-on. If the carry-on won't fit through
the template, take some items out and put them in the plastic bag,
then put them back after leaving the security point.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The early boarding that airlines offer their most frequent
fliers is also a valuable perk, especially on full flights, because
it assures space in overhead bins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport
Association, people who carry bags on because they fear they will
be lost forever have little to worry about. Airlines now tag bags
with bar codes, and the latest Department of Transportation figures
show that while one passenger in 226 has a complaint about baggage,
99 percent of those complaints are resolved within 24 hours. He
said that only one bag in 22,000 is permanently lost. But Fuscus
acknowledges that the principal concern of passengers, and the
reason many are determined to board with luggage, is to avoid
waiting around carousels until their bags finally appear.  &QL;

`FACE-TIME': MODERN POLITICAL NOVEL AS MIRROR OF THE BIZARRE
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(ms) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To get a sense of just how drastically the Washington political
scene _ along with the Washington political novel _ has changed
over the last few decades, compare Allen Drury's ``Advise and
Consent,'' published exactly 40 years ago, with the hot political
novel of the moment, Erik Tarloff's ``Face-Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Drury's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel concerned a Senate
confirmation battle over a nominee for secretary of state; the
slight but entertaining ``Face-Time'' concerns an extramarital
affair between the president of the United States and the
girlfriend of his chief speechwriter. Tarloff's novel has already
created a buzz within the Washington dinner party set that the
author and his wife, Laura Tyson, the former chairwoman of
President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, used to frequent
during their years in the capital, and comes adorned with glowing
blurbs from Jim Lehrer, Judy Woodruff and Elizabeth Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Given today's political reality (the Starr report's salacious
allegations, months of crude jokes about a stained dress and thong
underwear, and the possibility of Monica Lewinsky's testifying
before the Senate), it's no surprise that Drury's brand of fiction
_ which, for all its melodrama, invested government dealings with a
certain air of gravitas _ should have given way to a considerably
cruder, more satiric type of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it any surprise that novels that only a few years ago
were dismissed as ludicrous fantasies now seem more in touch with
our tabloid Zeitgeist. ``The Campaign'' (1996), by Marilyn Quayle
and her sister, Nancy Northcott, postulated a philandering
Democratic president and a vast left-wing conspiracy involving
bimbos, computer hackers and Asian agents. ``1945'' (1995), by Newt
Gingrich and William R. Forstchen, showcased a ``pouting sex
kitten'' and spy who liked to sit ``athwart'' the chest of the
White House chief of staff. And Larry Beinhart's ``American Hero''
(1993) _ which inspired the movie ``Wag the Dog'' and talk of a
``wag the dog'' syndrome after United States air strikes against
Iraq, Afghanistan and the Sudan _ featured a phony war cooked up by
a political consultant to bolster a president's falling poll
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Drury's solemn fascination with ``fallible people
in difficult situations who were called on to solve great
problems'' that feels out of date. Ward Just's Washington novels,
with their Jamesian moral distinctions and subtle delineation of
conflicting loyalties and ideals, now tend to feel old-fashioned as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, recent Washington fiction has increasingly tried to
cope with the growing bizarreness of real-life politics by
indulging in black comedy, tabloid voyeurism and out-and-out farce.
Charles McCarry's ``Lucky Bastard'' (1998) portrayed a sexually
rapacious president (possibly the illegitimate son of John F.
Kennedy), who marries a leftist ideologue and becomes a pawn of the
KGB. ``The People's Choice'' (1995) by Jeff Greenfield depicted a
crisis resulting from the accidental death of the president-elect,
who is thrown from an amphetamine-drugged horse during a photo op,
and the presumptive ascension of his dimwitted running mate. And
``Primary Colors'' (1996), by Anonymous (Joe Klein), featured the
suicide of a campaign worker and an attempt by the candidate's wife
to seduce an idealistic aide.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Lucky Bastard'' and ``Primary Colors,'' Erik Tarloff's
new novel, ``Face-Time,'' gains much of its heat from its portrait
of a president (or would-be president) who bears more than a
passing resemblance to Bill Clinton. Tarloff's president, one
Charles (Chuck) W. Sheffield by name, may be less touchy-feely than
Clinton and decidedly balder, but he, too, is a politician blessed
with ``plain dumb luck'' and high approval ratings. He is known for
his gregarious charm, his ability to compartmentalize different
aspects of his life, and his tendency to leave emotional and
political casualties in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   As one character observes of Sheffield: ``He never is scathed,
is he? Other people get scathed in his stead. The designated
scathees, you might say. He leaves great trains of mutiles de
guerre in his wake as he blithely follows his bliss. Perhaps it's
because others are unaccountably willing to do his dirty work for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Tarloff's narrator, Ben Krause, we also learn that
President Sheffield is an inveterate womanizer, a Don Juan who
covets other men's women. Much to Ben's dismay, one of the
president's current paramours turns out to be Gretchen Burns, Ben's
own sexy and sexually pragmatic girlfriend, who in a typical
Washington moment manages to turn men on by slipping into a
turtleneck and a nice pair of pleated herringbone tweed pants.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Ben is another variation on that other stock character
in recent political fiction, the smart, young George Stephanopoulos
clone who has surfaced in everything from ``Primary Colors'' to a
host of movies, from ``The American President'' to ``Broken Arrow''
to ``City Hall.'' In the case of ``Face-Time,'' he's the
president's chief speechwriter, an ambitious yuppie who cherishes
his access or ``face time'' (or, as acronym-fond Washingtonians
might put it, SPFT, Serious Personal Face Time) with the president.
</P>
<P>
   While Tarloff clearly knows his way around Washington, he does
not regale the reader with the sort of insider dish that Joe Klein
and Sally Quinn lavished on their novels. The story he tells of the
sex triangle among Ben, Gretchen and the president is not
predicated upon sharply observed little vignettes, comic cameos or
even a political agenda. Rather, it has two very simple points to
make: that the sex-and-power equation reigns supreme in Washington,
trumping both love-and-death and eros-and-lucre; and that powerful
men like the president are apt to exercise ``noblesse merite'' _
that is, ``the opposite of noblesse oblige,'' the assumption that
they are entitled in ways that other mortals are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face-Time'' gets off to a creaky start: the reader can feel
Tarloff, a playwright and screenwriter who has worked on such
movies as ``Aladdin'' and ``Car 54, Where Are You?,'' trying to get
the gist of writing a novel. It also suffers from occasional lapses
of plausibility (perhaps not a major flaw in this day of
increasingly implausible news). Its supporting cast members,
including Gretchen and President Sheffield, have the emotional life
of cartoons, and their utterances often devolve into B-movie
cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the story gradually picks up steam, immersing the reader
in Ben's tortured (and often comical) efforts to cope with
Gretchen's infidelity and the knowledge that he is being cuckolded
by the most powerful man in the world, the most alpha of all alpha
males.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Tarloff dispenses the sort of observations that
might as easily be found in an op-ed piece these days as in a
novel. His hero, Ben, observes that President Sheffield wasn't
Caligula _ he was simply a fellow with sexual appetites, a guy
``who found himself in a position where he had the wherewithal,
along with the vanity and indiscipline, to indulge them when he
shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ben declines to shrug off the president's affair with
Gretchen as ``a mistake.'' ``A mistake?'' he says. ``I don't think
so. A mistake is when you goof once. An affair spread over several
months, with God knows how many trysts, an affair that persists
even after it's been discovered, that goes way beyond mistake.
Mistake doesn't begin to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, that in today's Washington, it depends on how
you define ``mistake''; it depends on how you define the word
``it.''

COMMENTARY: THE KNOCK ON THE DOOR  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his speech to the House urging impeachment of
the president, Henry Hyde said that our safety depends on respect
for the law. ``The rule of law,'' he said, ``protects you and it
protects me from ... the 3 a.m. knock on our door. It challenges
abuse of authority. It's a shame `Darkness at Noon' is forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   But the knock on the door is here. Abuse of legal authority is
occurring in the very process that Hyde and his colleagues are so
zealously pressing.
</P>
<P>
   On the day that the Senate began its trial of President Clinton,
Kenneth Starr had a grand jury indict Julie Hiatt Steele. She is a
remote, peripheral figure in the Starr campaign against the
president, and a single mother without resources. Yet the
independent counsel, unaccountable and obsessed, has set out to
grind her to dust.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Julie Steele was more telling than all the
solemn repetitions of ``William Jefferson Clinton'' in the Senate.
It was a frightening symbol, a metaphor for a process run riot.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele is a target of Kenneth Starr for one reason: She will
not support the story of Kathleen Willey, a woman who said Clinton
made a pass at her in the White House in 1993. Ms. Willey said she
immediately went to the home of Ms. Steele, then a friend, and told
her about the episode. In 1997 Ms. Steele told Newsweek that she
had had that visit from Kathleen Willey. But later that year, long
before the Monica Lewinsky story broke, she told Newsweek that the
tale was untrue _ that Ms. Willey had asked her to lie. She has
held to that position ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to break Miss Steele, Starr has called her before
two grand juries _ and called her brother, daughter and former
lawyer. His agents have gone around Ms. Steele's neighborhood in
Richmond, Va., questioning neighbors about the adoption of her son,
Adam, in Romania eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was asked by members of the House Judiciary Committee
whether his office had raised the adoption to pressure Ms. Steele
to change her testimony. He said that was ``absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   But not only did agents ask neighbors about the adoption. At the
grand jury Ms. Steele's brother and daughter were asked about it.
Where did she get the money for it? Whom did she talk to? The
questions assumed that there was something wrong about the
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Not many of us could stand up to pressure like that. Ms.
Steele's reward is an indictment that repackages her refusal to
support the Willey story into four counts of obstructing justice
and making false statements. The indictment's 20 wandering,
unprofessional pages include a charge that she spoke falsely on
``Larry King Live.'' Characteristically, the Starr office leaked
word of the indictment before it was handed down.
</P>
<P>
   I did not believe that even Kenneth Starr would actually indict
Julie Hiatt Steele. It seemed so gratuitous, so indecent. But I was
naive. For him, everything must yield to the aim of destroying Bill
Clinton. And if he could steamroll Ms. Steele into supporting the
Willey story, it would be something else for Hyde &AMP; Co. to use
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   It is not irrelevant that Julie Steele is a lonely woman,
financially vulnerable. Starr and his brutal deputies have a thing
about women. They kept Susan McDougal in prison for 18 months
because she would not testify as they wanted. They ruined the life
of another Arkansas woman, Sarah Hawkins, by menaces and threats of
indictment. And there was the bullying of Monica Lewinsky and her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   We all tend to ignore abuses directed at others. Conservatives
overlook the abuses of Kenneth Starr now as liberals overlooked the
dangers of the Independent Counsel Act when the Supreme Court in
1988 upheld its use against Theodore Olson, a Reagan administration
official. Only Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting, saw what is
evident today to all but the willfully blind: An unaccountable
prosecutor menaces the Constitution and, for all of us, freedom
under law.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find words for Kenneth Starr's behavior as a
prosecutor. The ones that seem to me to fit are the adjectives
Hamlet had for his murderous uncle: ``remorseless, treacherous,
lecherous, kindless.''

   Panama Canal Tours
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there cruises through the Panama Canal other than long
ones, perhaps tours that would include a passage through the canal?
_ Ellen Hanley, Muskegon, Mich. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Panama is starting to be discovered by visitors other than
those on the decks of cruise ships, and a good one-stop-shopping
place for touring the country is Panama Discovery Tours. This
booking agency for Panama Jones, a Panama City tour operator,
offers several standard tours encompassing various regions, and can
customize them, according to Linda Rice, a travel consultant at the
Panama Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   One tour spends six days mainly in the Panama City area. It
includes guided excursions in the city and the Canal Zone, and a
full-day transit of the canal, which includes food and drinks.
There is also a visit to the Summit Tropical Gardens and Zoological
Park to see the macaws, toucans and other wildlife, and a cruise to
Taboga Island. This tour costs from $599 to $1,375 a person, double
occupancy, depending on the level of accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Discovery Tour is two days longer, adding trips to
the Anton Valley, about two and a half hours west of Panama City; a
pontoon boat expedition to Gatun Lake islands to see the culture of
the Embera Indians, and a tour to the Conquistador-era ruins at
Portobello. This tour costs from $922 to $1,924 each, double
occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Panama Discovery uses Argo Tours for marine transportation. This
company offers half-day canal tours to the Pedro Miguel Locks from
Pier 18 in Balboa on Saturday mornings, with full-day trips through
the canal one Saturday a month. These cost $75 and $125. The
company uses two ships, the 96-foot Islamorada, a 1912 wooden
vessel, and the 1977 steel-hulled Fantasia del Mar, 117 feet with
three decks.

   Bay Area Cooking Schools
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in San Francisco in May. Are there cooking schools
there with one-to-three-day sessions? _ E.A. Fentress, Jackson,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   A. ``The 1999 Guide to Cooking Schools,'' published by Shaw
Guides ($22.95) and available on the Web at www.shawguides.com,
lists dozens of recreational cooking schools in Northern
California, so it depends on how far afield you want to travel. The
wine country of Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino Counties is a center of
such schools.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco itself, the California Culinary Academy offers
six-hour sessions on Saturdays in the Civic Center area. The
classes are broken into groups of 10 to 20 and are hands on, led by
a chef. Afterward, the classes dig in to a buffet of their work in
various ethnic cuisines, vegetarian cooking or baking. Sessions
cost $130. Contact the Weekend Program Manager, 625 Polk Street,
San Francisco, Calif. 94102; (800) 229-2433; www.baychef.com.
</P>
<P>
   Tante Marie's Cooking School was started 20 years ago and is
still run by Mary Risley, who studied at Le Cordon Bleu and La
Varenne. The school's professional classes teach classic French
cooking, but recreational classes cover a wide variety of cuisines,
according to Peggy Lynch, administrator of the school, which is on
Telegraph Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor can choose from weeklong vacation cooking schools
($550), two-day weekend sessions ($250), and individual classes
($40 to $75). The school uses its own faculty and guest
instructors, who are chefs or cookbook authors. The May schedule
will be out in March, Ms. Lynch said. Contact her at 271 Francisco
Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94133; (415) 788-6699, fax (415)
788-8924; www.tantemarie.com.

<P>
   Europe, by Barge
</P>
<P>
   Q. Four of us would like to charter a barge in Europe to see a
few countries from canals or rivers. Can you provide any resources?
_ Pamela J. Caldwell, Seattle
</P>
<P>
   A. Barging is particularly popular in France, perhaps less so in
other European countries. Barges or river boats can be charted with
or without crews. This mode of leisurely touring is probably best
supplemented by taking along bicycles, or renting them at the
various stops.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies charter boats in France, but few offer
itineraries that cross borders. Le Boat, an American company, deals
with several charter outfits offering dozens of cruises in France,
the Netherlands, Germany, Britain and Ireland, but only one route _
along the northern branch of the Canal de l'Est in Alsace-Lorraine
_ allows a brief crossover from France into Belgium, according to
Debbie Petermann, president of Le Boat. Other routes include the
Canal du Midi in southern France, the Canal de Bourgogne and a
network of canals in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Prices, like the itineraries, cover a wide area, but for a
smaller vessel, expect to pay $900 to $2,000 a week. These rates
include the boat, galley gear _ but not food _ bedding and some
taxes. Fuel, maps, bikes and parking are extra. Contact Le Boat at
10 South Franklin Turnpike, Ramsey, N.J. 07446; (800) 992-0291, fax
(201) 236-1214.
</P>
<P>
   Offering similar charters in France is American Media Tours, 16
West 32d Street, New York, N.Y. 10001; (800) 969-6344, fax (212)
465-1636. This company, which deals with France only, offers
cruises in the Loire Valley, Burgundy, Alsace and on the River
Charente.
</P>
<P>
   Among German companies renting boats is Kuhnle Tours, 4
Nagelstrasse, D-70182, Stuttgart; (49-711) 164-820, fax (49-711)
164-8260. Eva Irina Muehleck, a company spokeswoman, said that
while none of its itineraries crossed national borders, rentals
could be arranged on the lakes of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in
Germany, and many rivers and canals in France, the Netherlands and
Ireland. Rates for a boat for four start at $535 to $900 in low
season to about double those at peak times, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, the province of Friesland has numerous lakes
and canals to explore _ and just as many charter boat operators.
Many of them offer seven-night motor yacht rentals that include a
day of supervision by an instructor and guide before you continue
on your own. Prices run from about $190 to $600 a person, based on
five to a boat.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about these companies, contact Friesland
Holland Tourist Information, 38 Hoofdstraat West, NL-8471 HV
Wolvega; (31-561) 615-364, fax (31-561) 617-818.

US PROPOSES CUT IN LOBSTER FISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fearful that New England's most valuable fishery is in
danger, the National Marine Fisheries Service has proposed new
limits on lobster fishing in federal waters in an effort to stop a
lobster trap ``arms race'' that is decimating the sexually mature
population.
</P>
<P>
   The federal trap limits and other requirements apply only to
about 20 percent of the industry, the 3,400 lobstermen licensed to
set traps more than 3 miles off shore. Federal regulators will need
help from sometimes-reluctant state governments to stop
over-fishing for lobsters in the 80 percent of lobstering that
occurs closer to shore.
</P>
<P>
   But National Marine Fisheries Service officials said their
regulations, aimed at rebuilding the lobster industry over the next
decade, will allow the agency and states from Maine to North
Carolina to work together to reverse the ominous trend of fishermen
setting more and more lobster traps each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real reduction in the amount of gear that's out
there. It's the first step toward reducing the arms race,'' said
Andrew Rosenberg, deputy director of the National Marine Fisheries
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the American lobster business appears to be
booming: the catch rose by 20 percent from 1995 to 1997, when
lobsters accounted for 27 percent of the Northeast's fishing income
and provided 50,000 jobs. Maine and Massachusetts alone account for
three quarters of the total catch.
</P>
<P>
   But federal biologists say the boom masks an impending disaster
if nothing is done as lobstermen catch increasing numbers of young
females before they can spawn the next generation of lobsters.
Almost half the legal-sized female lobsters were removed from the
Gulf of Maine each year from 1982 to 1993, they said, a dangerous
trend that has continued.
</P>
<P>
   Lobster states, working through the Atlantic States Marine
Fisheries Commission in Washington, have agreed that the lobster
population should recover over the next decade, and groups of
fishermen now are devising rules to meet that goal. However, some
state legislatures are resisting a crackdown on lobstering; for
instance, Rhode Island recently allowed more lobstermen into the
industry, increasing the fishing pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service rules would allow the
Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to lead on lobster
conservation, automatically adopting their rules in federal waters
for consistency. However, if the states don't do enough, the
service promises to crack down independently.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the federal limits on lobster traps would grow
tighter over the next two years, while requiring lobstermen to
choose between fishing less than 30 miles offshore or fishing
exclusively in the more-distant offshore waters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rosenberg said the federal plan may not be enough. ``I'm
an optimist, but I'm just nervous that this fishery is going to
take a downturn,'' he said. ``My frustration has been . . . that we
are going to be behind the curve.''

MEDICARE SPENDING GREW IN 1998 AT SLOWEST ANNUAL RATE EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic on medicare growth is being sent to NYT graphic
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(pr) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The growth of Medicare slowed last year to a
virtual halt as spending in the giant health insurance program for
the elderly rose by just 1.5 percent, the smallest increase since
the beginning of the program in 1965, new government data show.
</P>
<P>
   The slower rate of growth will probably add a few years to the
life of the Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the
elderly. And it may temporarily relax the pressure on Congress to
redesign the program. But officials said that it does not
fundamentally alter the long-term outlook for Medicare, which will
incur immense new costs as baby boomers become eligible after 2010.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Medicare spending last year grew more slowly
than the federal budget as a whole, which increased by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown shows the effects of congressional curbs on
payments to hospitals and home health care agencies and the results
of a federal crusade against Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Medicare spending rose by an average of
$12.8 billion, or 10 percent, a year. But in 1998, it grew just
$3.1 billion, to a total of $213.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are all rightly concerned about the growth of future
costs, Medicare right now is amazingly well behaved,'' said Robert
Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
``Nobody is really sure why Medicare spending has slowed down quite
as much as it has. The only thing we can be sure of is that it
won't last.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Medicare beneficiaries grew last year by slightly
more than 1 percent, to 39 million. So the average increase in
Medicare spending for each beneficiary was close to zero, budget
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The experts offer several explanations. Congress intentionally
curbed payments to hospitals, home health agencies and other health
care providers in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and the savings
so far have exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and hospitals have historically absorbed such cutbacks
without reducing services to patients, but there is evidence that
some beneficiaries are having difficulty gaining or keeping access
to home health care services.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay within their Medicare budgets, home health agencies
are avoiding higher-cost patients, chronically ill patients and
those who need the most care,'' said William Dombi, vice president
of the National Association for Home Care.
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations, saying their costs are rising
faster than the payments they receive, have dropped more than
400,000 Medicare patients from their rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Federal efforts to curb fraud and abuse also appear to have
slowed the growth of Medicare. Health care executives said the
federal investigation of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. had sent a
chill through the hospital industry and encouraged greater
compliance by health care providers of all types, including
doctors, who fear prosecution for submitting false claims.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has pumped money into such investigations for several
years, and June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of
Health and Human Services, has led a crackdown on Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Scully, president of the Federation of American Health
Systems, which represents 1,400 for-profit hospitals, said:
``People in hospitals _ the billing clerks and their supervisors _
are generally scared to death of being investigated for billing
errors, accidental or intentional. Revenues are dropping because
hospitals are being ultraconservative in their billing practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's growth last year was significantly slower than that
of private health insurance plans. In a recent survey of 207 large
employers, Towers Perrin, a management consulting concern, found
that the cost of employee health benefits increased 4 percent on
the average last year, with an increase of 7 percent forecast for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that
Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays hospital bills
for the elderly, would run out of money in 2010. But health policy
experts now say the trust fund will probably not be depleted until
some time after 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund had been expected to lose $4 billion in 1998, but
instead it posted a surplus of nearly $1 billion. The trust fund's
revenues, mainly from payroll taxes, were $2 billion higher than
expected, thanks to a strong economy, and spending was $3 billion
less than projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Spending from the hospital trust fund declined last year by
one-half of 1 percent, to $136.7 billion. Spending for doctors'
services and other items covered by a separate trust fund rose by
5.1 percent, to $76.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Moon, a public trustee of the Medicare trust funds,
said, ``The 1997 Balanced Budget Act will do more than people
thought to hold down Medicare costs.'' For example, she said,
``spending on home health care declined from 1997 to 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays in the payment of claims also seem to have slowed the
growth of Medicare spending last year. Federal officials and
government contractors are taking more time to scrutinize claims
for errors and fraud, and these delays may have been worsened by
changes in Medicare computer systems, needed to get ready for the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, health officials said, government data show a greater lag
between the time when patients are treated and the time when
Medicare pays hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies for
those services.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays a fixed amount for each beneficiary admitted to a
hospital, and the government measures the average complexity, or
cost, of all the Medicare cases at each hospital. This ``case mix
index,'' which had been been rising for many years, declined last
year, officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Federal spending on Medicaid, the health program for poor
people, which also pays for large amounts of nursing home care,
rose last year by 5.9 percent, to $101 billion. This was larger
than the increases in 1995 and 1996, when Medicaid spending grew an
average of 3.6 percent a year. But, aside from those years, it was
the smallest increase since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The steep decline in welfare rolls has contributed to a
reduction in the number of Medicaid recipients, and this in turn
has held down Medicaid costs. Welfare officials acknowledge that
some people who leave welfare are entitled to Medicaid but do not
receive it, because they do not understand their rights or are
discouraged by the difficulties of obtaining coverage.

   DIAMOND-CARTEL (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ A diamond cartel
is forever. Oppenheimers, nearly so. The cartel is De Beers, and De
Beers is the Oppenheimers _ for three generations, the most

Oppenheimer, 53, who became chairman of De Beers a year ago, this

sold fewer diamonds than it had for 12 years, a mere $3.4 billion
worth. But not to panic. This has happened before. By Donald G.

   DIAMOND-CARTEL (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ A diamond cartel
is forever. Oppenheimers, nearly so. The cartel is De Beers, and De
Beers is the Oppenheimers _ for three generations, the most
important business figures in this country. But for Nicholas Frank
Oppenheimer, 53, who became chairman of De Beers a year ago, this
is not an easy time: Last month, the company announced that it had
sold fewer diamonds than it had for 12 years, a mere $3.4 billion
worth. But not to panic. This has happened before. By Donald G.

COMMENTARY: A DANGEROUS PEACE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some statesmen are remembered for having crossed the Rubicon.
Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will be remembered for
swimming laps in the Rubicon. Bibi is the Mark Spitz of Israeli
politics _ no Israeli leader has ever crisscrossed the Rubicon
faster or more often.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you think he has made a strategic decision to
fundamentally cross the river and pursue partnership with the
Palestinians, and you want to extend a hand to him on the other
shore, Bibi swims back the other way. His supporters say this a
strategy. I think not. I think it reflects a total absence of a
strategy, and it is resulting in Israel making the most dangerous
peace of all.
</P>
<P>
   How so? Well, it would be one thing if Bibi were true to his
heart, his writings and his core supporters and said: ``I don't
believe any partnership is ever possible with the Arabs or
Palestinians. Therefore, I will not give up one inch.'' And it
would be another thing if Bibi adopted the Yitzhak Rabin view that
the way to make peace is to gradually trade land with the
Palestinian Authority in return for a real, long-term economic,
political and security partnership.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu has opted for a ``third way,'' which is not a
coherent synthesis of these two but rather a constant wavering
between them. He delays as long as he can, then under maximum
international pressure strikes agreements with the Palestinians
over Hebron and the West Bank, then withdraws from territory, and
then when this produces a hostile reaction from his far-right
supporters, he lurches backward to placate them, undermining any
long-term partnership with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most dangerous sort of peacemaking of all, because
at the end of the day Bibi gives up 5 percent less land than Labor
would have, and gets 100 percent less partnership. I can only
assume that he has no strategy, because it is impossible to see how
this approach _ which has left Israel's relations with the Arabs in
tatters and produced the most intimate relationship between America
and the Palestinians in the history of this conflict _ could be a
deliberate strategy. If Bibi continues on this track, he will give
up 50 percent of the West Bank, as opposed to Labor giving up 60
percent, and he will end up with no partnership with the
Palestinians and a crisis of confidence with the U.S. This is a
strategy?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe there is any hope of partnership with the
other side, then don't give up any land. But if you think that a
real partnership is possible and Israel's security depends on it,
than this must be the focus of your diplomacy and politics _ not
trying to salve the hurt of Israel's far right.
</P>
<P>
   Divining any strategy with Bibi, though, is hard because to this
day he has never given a speech laying out the logic of what he is
doing and where exactly he is heading. The only clear-cut speeches
Bibi has ever given are to denounce the agreements he has just made
_ Hebron and Wye _ and to denounce his partner in those agreements,
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Had he come home from the Wye negotiations and declared:
``Friends, the game is up. This is the direction I am going, and I
am going to make sure that I have a government that represents the
75 percent of Israel that wants to go there'' _ that would have
been a strategy. But Netanyahu came home from Wye, got a bad
reaction from the rightists, and instead of having the courage of
someone with convictions, started trying to placate them. When that
didn't work, he made a desperate 12th-hour attempt at forming a
national unity government that no one took seriously. And when that
led to new elections being called, he froze the Wye agreement _ to
reclaim his right-wing base _ while claiming that the Palestinians
were not keeping their side of the bargain (which the State
Department on Friday said was simply untrue).
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to build an ideological and political
synthesis between the center-right and center-left, Bibi has spent
the last two years trying to fool different parts of the Israeli
electorate at different times. Anyone who thinks this doesn't have
costs is fooling himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi has crossed the line between being pragmatic and being
unprincipled,'' observed the Middle East expert Stephen Cohen. ``He
has refused to make either a choice between the two sides in the
Israeli debate or to make a synthesis between them. The result is
that he produces neither a genuine peace nor a sense that he has
any principles.''

A POST-APARTHEID TRIBUTE: ART LEADING THE PEOPLE

 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ South Africa, a nation top-heavy
with ponderous memorials to British and Boer victories, is
struggling to come up with a few catchy post-apartheid monuments.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy. The ever modest Nelson Mandela has not posed for
a colossus yet. The bronze statue in East London of Steve Biko, the
anti-apartheid activist who was beaten to death by the police in
1977, is widely acknowledged to be a nice idea, dreadfully molded.
</P>
<P>
   The statue of the new mayor of the little dorp of Wepener, put
up to counterbalance the old one of the brutal 19th-century
Kommandant Louw Wepener, lost some of its luster when the mayor was
accused of car theft and check kiting.
</P>
<P>
   The Zulus who were killed at the Battle of Blood River finally
have their own memorial near the great circle of bronze wagons that
the Afrikaner victors put up, but Blood River is several miles back
of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, take heart. Right now, in the very center of
Johannesburg, Reshada Crouse is finishing her mural. It's grand,
it's romantic, it's a knockoff of Delacroix's ``Liberty Leading the
People.'' But there's something oddly familiar about the faces.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Mandela or Tutu or Biko among them. After a bit,
though, it becomes clear: You've seen them on the afternoon soaps.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crouse is not making fun of the genre. Nor of liberation.
Her mural _ she can't make up her mind whether it is called
``Revolution'' or ``Passive Resistance'' _ is a testament to the
role that theater people played in the anti-apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Her commission, which comes from a government-financed arts
foundation, is to adorn a big public space: the Civic Theater,
Johannesburg's equivalent of Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was an art student,'' she said, ``there was always a
lot of pressure on us to do `political art,' which I thought was
just a phony, because no visual artist was going to change
anything. But theater was different. Because of the shows put on
overseas, Athol Fugard's plays for example, there was a lot of
outside pressure on the Nats'' _ the ruling National Party in the
apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't the French Revolution,'' she said. ``It didn't get
that violent here. In the end it was intellectual pressure that
brought the Nats to their knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crouse is a serious artist, but she has done the official
portraits of army commanders and reserve bank governors without
losing her sense of whimsy. Her official version of Gen. Constand
Viljoen, army commander during apartheid, is a double portrait,
which slyly reminds viewers that he had a twin brother in the
anti-apartheid movement. It also features his favorite cows and
favorite assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The mural, on which she has labored in the Civic's lobby for a
year, is a minefield of allusions. It may be realistic, she said,
``but it's surreal. It's not linear.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first draft, when she entered the contest, was ``very
politically incorrect'' _ a Zulu street battalion led to freedom by
her 19-year-old ``Aryan beauty'' of a daughter in combat boots. Her
written description, which bested 54 other entries, promised a
final version equally black and white, male and female.
</P>
<P>
   The battalion mutated into ``a gypsy caravan of traveling
players'': playwrights like Athol Fugard and Paul Slabolepszy,
producers like Mannie Manim and Barney Simon, founder of the
defiantly integrated Market Theater.
</P>
<P>
   John Kani, now the managing trustee of the Market, marches in
his ``Othello'' robes; Nomsa Nene, now a loudmouth game show host,
wears her humble maid's uniform from ``Poppie Nongena'' and pushes
a mop.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape is full of African aloes, twisted spikes that
contain healing juices. Over it all waves what Ms. Crouse, with her
quirky eye, calls ``the toothpaste flag.'' As soon as she says it,
the noble pennant of the new South Africa is ruined for you. You
realize that it does look as if it had been squeezed out of a tube
of Aquafresh.
</P>
<P>
   At lower right are three guerrillas with guns and machetes. One
is obvious: the television heartthrob Sello Maake ka-Ncube. The
others, less well known, look wrong somehow. Nick Boraine, who
fiercely resembles David Bowie, wears a bustier and opera gloves
with his M-16. Jamie Bartlett has a red clown nose.
</P>
<P>
   These are not mistakes. In Fugard's early play ``Woza Albert,''
black men playing whites don red noses, so Ms. Crouse is signaling
that Bartlett is black.
</P>
<P>
   In Boraine's case, she is echoing something she learned from
startled war correspondents: in the cruelest civil wars in Africa,
from Zaire to Sierra Leone, a few fighters charge into battle stark
naked, while others wear blond wigs and bras.
</P>
<P>
   ``When societies go completely anarchic, people cross-dress,''
she said. ``And I wanted to show the sexual arousal men find in
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The central figure of Liberty has caused her the most grief.
Kani said he would not appear in a tribute to black liberation with
a white Miss Liberty. Ms. Crouse agreed, and persuaded Sibongile
Mngoma, a singer and actress, to pose. But Ms. Mngoma later decided
not to be captured for posterity half-nude. She is now in the
background, in what looks like a bikini.
</P>
<P>
   Camilla Waldman, a white actress, agreed to let her own full,
slightly pregnant, figure be used. ``We put dark makeup on for the
photo shoot, but I've still got to disguise her, make her at least
Creole,'' Ms. Crouse said. Ms. Mngoma's aunt, the diva Sibongile
Khumalo, understood her niece's reluctance and said Ms. Waldman
would do, with adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Make her nipples pitch black and give her
dreadlocks, and she'll be fine,''' Ms. Crouse said.
</P>
<P>
   When the political corrections to the mural are finally done,
Ms. Crouse knows exactly where she wants to hang it. Bisecting the
upper lobby is a sort of peninsula of mirrors that was built in a
more elitist era. It is the VIP box, and the mirrors are two-way
glass. They let the mighty join the lobby crowd at intermission,
but without the proletariat being able to gawk back at them. Ms.
Crouse sized her canvas to fit precisely over the biggest mirror.
</P>
<P>
   And what does she hope that viewers will feel on seeing her
greatest work?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a kid, you'll say, `Oh, look, there's so-and-so from
TV!' If you know Delacroix, you'll have a whole post-modern
explanation for it. And if you're from America and you know
absolutely nothing, you'll have to read the plaque.''

GORE UNVEILS OPEN SPACE INITIATIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Touting proposals to preserve open spaces and tame
urban sprawl, Vice President Al Gore launched Monday what is
expected to be a week's worth of initiatives that could provide a
foundation for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the American Institute of Architects, Gore unveiled a
program to provide federal support for communities that seek to
purchase land for parks, old industrial sites, or land to preserve
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The open space initiative would be accomplished by floating $9.5
billion in bonds that state and local governments could use as a
financing mechanism to purchase land.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore proposal, to be included in the administration's
upcoming budget, would provide for $700 million in federal tax
credits, which would make it cheaper to finance the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the urban sprawl initiative are a 16 percent
increase in funds for public transit, and $50 million in grants to
local groups to design strategies to control growth.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the purpose of the proposals was to create ``livable
communities, comfortable suburbs, vibrant cities and green spaces
all around and in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement was the first of what aides say will be a
week of initiatives from the vice president. On Tuesday he is
expected to propose tax incentives for education and job training
and on Wednesday will propose empowerment grants. At the end of the
week the vice president is expected to speak on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   The series of policy announcements come as the vice president
positions himself for a bid for the White House in 2000. Analysts
say that by focusing on these initiatives, he may be trying to
distance himself from the impeachment trial in the Senate and to
show that he is serious about governing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of being vice president in a second presidential
term is that gradually you are given more opportunities for
stepping out and taking the lead with new initiatives, allowing you
to act presidential before you're president,'' said Thomas Mann,
political analyst at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   But Mann noted that the urban sprawl issue Gore is promoting is
not one that has been important to the most traditional Democratic
voters, such as organized labor and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake to see this as distributing goodies to
the base. This is different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said using government as means to push planning could
alienate those who believe that individuals should have the right
to live or develop land wherever they chose.
</P>
<P>
   However, the issue could resonate with suburbanites _ key swing
voters _ particularly in the crowded northeast corridor, who
believe that their neighborhoods have become over developed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican,
championed a $1 billion program to save open space and farmland
that was approved by voters in the Garden State.
</P>
<P>
   John Casbarian, the associate dean of the School of Architecture
at Rice University in Houston, called the Gore open space plan, ``a
smart idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Casbarian said that Houston parents could have used the bond
concept recently when they tried to save undeveloped land next to
the Rice School.
</P>
<P>
   Casbarian said the heavily wooded land has served as a buffer
between the school and busy intersection. But then the owner razed
the land for a high density development and the parents were unable
to raise enough money to buy the property.

lifting an embargo on Iraqi oil sales or significantly relaxing
sanctions in other ways to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi
people. But contrary to what the Iraqis may hope, there is also
solid agreement that long-term international supervision is needed

   SCI-TOILET-TRAINING (Undated) _ Toilet training is not rocket

continue soiling and wetting himself past age 2.'' The process, he
says, should be as simple and straightforward as housebreaking a
four-month-old puppy. Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the noted
pediatrician, says there is more to it than that. Parents who force
toilet training, he says, can cause lasting problems. ``Don't rush
your toddler into toilet training or let anyone else tell you it's
time. It's got to be his choice,'' Brazelton advises in a
television commercial for Pampers ``Size 6'' diapers. What does he
think about Rosemond's arguments? ``They sound very logical _ for
puppies.'' Welcome to the newest round in the toilet training wars.

 &HT;    Barnes becomes a man in full
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a cloudless Monday _ a ``righteous day,'' was how
Dr. Johnetta Cole described it _ Roy Barnes put his hand on the
Bible and became his own conception of a man in full.
</P>
<P>
   There was no ceremonial traffic-copter flyby to mark the
ascension of the state's first truly suburban governor. Barnes'
inaugural message rang with a rhetoric of racial harmony that is
becoming traditional for this occasion, but did not speak of road
rage or overdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is worth noting that this former legislator, with his
good-ol'-boy drawl and lawyerly stoop, represents a demographic
point of departure from the row of former governors who watched him
take the oath of office Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is Georgian down to his middle name (Eugene), a
politician and businessman with ties to many parts of the state.
He's also the first Georgian elected governor whose career has been
shaped by the tidal wave of development that has shaped
Metropolitan Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The area around his family's hardware store on Bankhead Highway
would be a great subject for one of those ``then-and-now'' photos
in the Monday Horizon section. His politics has been learned in a
shifting suburban world affected by white flight, northern
immigration and in recent years, increasing ethnic and racial
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when he was tagged as a suburban conservative and
finished third in the Democratic primary behind Zell Miller and
Andrew Young, it would have seemed farfetched that he would one day
be hailed by Cole, the past president of Spelman College, as
``Brother Governor Barnes'' and his wife Marie as ``First Sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the politician and politics in general have adjusted over
the decade, a then-and-now work in progress. Just as the characters
in Tom Wolfe's novel must cross racial lines to make money, the
black and white Democrats who took statewide office Monday have
succeeded by discovering their mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything about the man himself, Barnes is the first
suburban governor because of what the suburbs expect of him. Any
governor would have to confront the complex environmental and
transportation problems which threatened to choke Metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But this governor was elected in part because of the expectation
that his background equipped him to tackle those problems, and
those expectations have been raised by the promise of an ambitious
transportation plan.
</P>
<P>
   It was the culmination of a career's effort when Barnes rose to
take the oath from his University of Georgia classmate, Chief
Justice Robert Benham, but the moment also marked a dangerous
political turn.
</P>
<P>
   As he has efficiently gone about the business of organizing his
administration, hiring experienced hands to help him manage things
and confidently plotting his legislative strategy, Barnes's
performance has mostly drawn comparison with what might have been
if Guy Millner were at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday onward, the comparison will be with the record of
the Miller administration, which raises the hurdle considerably.
But this son of Metro Atlanta has reached the place he wanted to
be, and on Monday he could bask in the glory of it.

 &HT;    1996 Olympics lawsuit settled
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A $6 million trial over Olympic kiosks could have
stretched over a month and revealed details of one of the most
troubled companies involved in Games vending.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the lawsuit was settled Monday, a week after jury
selection began in Fulton County Superior Court and before openings
statements were made. Details of the deal, including a dollar
amount, are confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties are satisfied; they're very happy with the
settlement,'' said attorney Vanessa Vargas of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas represented 11 individuals and corporations who claimed
they were bilked after spending at least $10,000 for each of dozens
of souvenir booths. They said the defendants provided no goods or
services that were contracted.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants included Creative Travel Service, which garnered
nationwide publicity during the 1996 Games after it brought 3,000
teenagers from across the country to work at the souvenir booths.
The youths returned home after finding they had nowhere to stay and
nothing to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garland, an Atlanta attorney representing the defendants, did
not return a phone call Monday. Defendants also included companies
the kiosk buyers say were set up to carry out the sales and their
backers New Orleans retailer Raed Halum was among those who sued.
He and four family members and friends bought 27 kiosks for
$270,000, hoping to make more than $1.35 million in profit.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement did ``not really'' get all their investment back,
Halum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm OK with it,'' he said. ``It would have been better, it
could have been worse. We figured, you take your losses and run and
it's been two and half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels the way I do. Nobody's thrilled, but we feel
it's the best we can do so let's take it and end it.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier Fulton County lawsuit involving Olympic vendors was
dismissed before reaching trial.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, vendors sued B.G. Swing Games Management Inc. and
its president, Munson Steed. B.G. Swing, the city's former
marketing representative, leased city streets and sidewalks during
the Olympics and Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors claimed they were mislead and fraudulently induced to
sign contracts with B.G. Swing. The suit sought $25 million in
punitive damages, but did not specify compensatory damages. Other
defendants included the city and the Atlanta Economic Development
Corp., now called the Atlanta Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the suit was dismissed by a judge in May 1997, who later
threw out remaining claims against Steed.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors in October voluntarily dismissed what was left of
their case, although they may refile. Their attorney, Louis
Levenson said that should happen within a week. And in April,
Atlanta businessman Andrew Adler was convicted in South Carolina of
defrauding a T-shirt supplier out of more than $400,000.

ARENS TO CHALLENGE NETANYAHU IN LIKUD PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS) 
(rk) 
 By   DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The clearest sign yet of just how much Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has estranged the Israeli political
establishment _ both left and right _ came Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's political godfather, Moshe Arens, 73, a former
defense and foreign minister, announced that he would challenge his
one-time protege for the leadership of the Likud Party in party
primaries. The primaries will select the Likud candidates for the
May 17 national elections .
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true my relations with Benjamin Netanyahu, because of
the age gap, were in many ways like father to son,'' Arens said
Monday. ``But that doesn't change the situation the Likud is in
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing defections of ``first-rank people'' from Likud and
pronouncing the party to be in crisis, Arens, a hawkish and
straightforward old-timer, became the second challenger for the
Likud title and the eighth candidate for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It is a field so crowded _ particularly with army generals _
that Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon interrupted a recent
ribbon-cutting ceremony to congratulate one participant, a former
army chief of staff, for not throwing his hat in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to run, Arens relied on a poll of Likud voters. The
poll favored Netanyahu, with 57 percent of the voters' support. But
it showed Arens, who retired from politics five years ago, at 22
percent, ahead of the other challenger, Uzi Landau, who had 7.5.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts consider it highly unlikely that Arens could
unseat Netanyahu but do not rule it out. The primaries will be on
Jan. 25 to select candidates for Parliament and prime minister.
Some 160,000 party members are eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu voiced no concern. ``I can assure you that I have no
doubt that I will receive the overwhelming support of the Likud
voters in the Likud primaries and, indeed, of the citizens of
Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An aircraft engineer trained in the United States, Arens is
fluent in English and was ambassador to the United States during
the early 80s. It was then when he hand-selected Netanyahu, who was
the marketing manager for a furniture company, for a future in
politics. Arens hired the man whom he knew as the son of Benzion
Netanyahu, an Israeli historian, to be the diplomatic liaison aide
for the embassy. From that time Arens helped guide Netanyahu's
career.
</P>
<P>
   But Arens, who was defense and foreign minister under Yitzhak
Shamir, a previous Likud prime minister, grew disenchanted with
Netanyahu the prime minister. He wrote frequent newspaper columns
that criticized Netanyahu's political and diplomatic moves,
particularly in the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   After the prime minister signed the latest peace agreement in
October, his party fell into shambles, because Netanyahu's approval
of the accord signaled the end of an ideological era for the Likud,
which was born to oppose territorial concessions. Netanyahu lost
many supporters who felt betrayed or that they could not trust him.
</P>
<P>
   Arens reportedly came forward when younger members of the Likud
chose not to oppose Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Likud young guard got weak knees, the elders of the
tribe had to take up the reins, and they have put Moshe Arens in
the forefront,'' Nehama Duek, a political analyst, wrote in a
newspaper, Yediot Ahronot.
</P>
<P>
   Two younger Likud members defected rather than go up against
Netanyahu, who despite his inability to hold his government
together is an aggressive and charismatic campaigner. Dan Meridor,
one of the party's aristocrats or ``princes,'' left to run for
prime minister as a centrist, and Benny Begin, son of the late
Prime Minister Menachem Begin, resigned to campaign at the head of
a new right-wing party.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prime minister revealed no embarrassment, political
commentators said Netanyahu received the ultimate rebuke when his
mentor officially abandoned him Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in another newspaper, Maariv, Menachem Rahat described
the move as an effort ``to beat his pupil and inherit his place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The creator,'' the writer said, ``defied his creation.''

OLDER TRAVELERS TURN TO INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 17.) 
(ms) 
 By BETSY WADE     
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elderhostel and Interhostel, which offer travel for vigorous
older people, have entered cyberspace, putting their catalogs on
Web sites. And in November, Elderhostel began taking registrations
electronically through its site.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the elderly have discovered that e-mail is the ideal way
for the sleepless to communicate with the world, they have also
apparently found that the Internet is an efficient way to shop.
Since Elderhostel began Internet registration in November, a
spokeswoman said, 1,000 clients, or 5 percent of those signing up
in the period, took the electronic option, plus 50 who used it to
change earlier registrations. This is out of Elderhostel's estimate
of a total of 325,000 ``older learners'' who signed on in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic registration is expected to grow, but the process
will never be as zip-zip-zip as ordering socks through the Web: One
trip does not fit all. People who have traveled with these
organizations know what to expect: dormitory rooms or cabins,
bathrooms shared with a battalion, meals at cafeteria tables, lots
of walking and carrying of one's own bags.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet may pose problems for the uninitiated.
Spokeswomen for both organizations said that phone discussions with
applicants were frequently necessary to be sure that they realized
that air fare is or is not included, or that they have not
neglected to read notices that special menus are not available,
cobblestones are hard to navigate and applications by frail people
are discouraged. There are plenty of warning flags in the paper
catalogs, but using Web sites, it is easy to sign up before
reckoning with the realities.
</P>
<P>
   Those without computers should know that they have not been
betrayed in the race for spots in popular Elderhostel courses: the
thousands of listings in each fat newsprint catalog _ or on the Web
_ all have a single date for a lottery for registration spots.
Until then, all applications _ mail, fax, phone and electronic _ go
into the hopper.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery for places in Elderhostel's first spring-summer
international listing was held in November, and for domestic
courses, Jan. 5. Programs in these listings that still have space
are open to registration, first come, first served. In this
situation, once you have an Elderhostel identification number,
registration through the Web on a business day between 9 a.m. and 9
p.m., Eastern time, is supposed to bring immediate confirmation if
there is space.
</P>
<P>
   The principal registrant for Elderhostel programs must be at
least 55; there is no age limit for an adult companion. This
organization's ``intergenerational'' programs usually involve a
child or grandchild under 25, and the program descriptions usually
indicate what age is appropriate. These adult-child programs can be
picked out on the Web site through the use of a search engine
there, and they are separately indexed in the paper catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Since Elderhostel stopped using Social Security numbers for
identification, catalogs normally arrive with randomly assigned
identification numbers. If there is no number, one may be obtained
through the Web during business hours. People getting their initial
information off the Web can also get a number electronically.
</P>
<P>
   An Elderhostel spokeswoman, Heather Baynes, said employees could
help applicants on the toll-free number, (877) 426-8056. All
applications by Internet, fax and phone require the use of a Visa,
Mastercard or American Express card.
</P>
<P>
   Interhostel, which usually offers only foreign travel, has
distributed its early summer catalog with 26 programs. Later
listings, for July into fall, will be mailed by the end of this
month; the information will also be on the Web site. These programs
are open to people over 50 and to their companions of at least 40.
</P>
<P>
   This organization breaks out its adult-child offerings into a
separate Familyhostel catalog for summer, which has been mailed.
The intended age for children here is 8 to 15; adults may be
parents or grandparents, but there must be at least one child and
one adult in each registration. There are 10 programs in this
catalog, plus the organization's first domestic trip, a New England
Sampler, with a base at the organization's home, the University of
New Hampshire, in Durham. This one is offered from July 11 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   Interhostel has no lottery for places, but accepts registrations
as it goes along. The Web site has a place to enter registration
information, including the number of the applicant's Visa,
Mastercard, Discover or American Express card. But people
submitting this material electronically should not assume that they
are registered until they get a phone call back from the
Interhostel office. According to Carol Bense, a spokeswoman, the
organization does not assume that applicants have read all the
rules and caveats until there is direct discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of trips listed in the catalogs. Space was
still available in the first week in January.
</P>
<P>
   _From April 25 to 30, Elderhostel at the Coastal Retreat Center
on the Isle of Palms near Charleston, S.C., is offering courses on
family history, Martin Luther and ``Diaries From Dixie'' from the
Civil War period, which covers the journals of Mary Boykin Chesnut
and two others. The cost is $420.
</P>
<P>
   _In New York, the American Institute of Banking and the South
Street Seaport are offering an Elderhostel course called
``Navigating Wall Street: Institutions at the Epicenter of World
Finance.'' This is offered May 6 to 11 and June 3 to 8. The
students stay in a hotel at the financial center; the fee is $575.
</P>
<P>
   _In Montana from June 6 to 26, an Elderhostel program is offered
at the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Great Falls: ``Lewis
and Clark: Explorers at the Portage'' and ``Agriculture on the High
Plains.'' ``Strenuous program,'' the note on the explorers'
sessions says, ``the equivalent of two courses.'' The fee is $425.
</P>
<P>
   _Interhostel is offering a new program, the Villas of Rome and
Florence, from May 14 to 28, through the auspices of the Lorenzo de
Medici Institute. Five nights are spent in Florence, four in
Viterbo and four in Tivoli, with a one-day trip to Rome. With air
fare from Newark, meals and double-occupancy hotel rooms, this
costs $3,285.
</P>
<P>
   _A new Familyhostel trip is ``Spain and France: Basque Country
and Paris,'' offered June 29 to July 9 under the auspices of the
American University of Paris. The hotel in the Basque area is on
the beach at St.-Jean-de-Luz, and there are excursions into Bilbao
and San Sebastian. With air fare from Newark, the price for one of
two in a room ranges from $2,595 for a child 8 to 11 to $2,895 for
an adult.

   The 400th anniversary of the birth of Oliver Cromwell, one of
the most significant figures in British history, will be both
celebrated and investigated in 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Cromwell headed the only republic that Britain ever had,
from 1653 to his death in 1658. Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire,
in 1599, Cromwell, a landowner and local politician, rose to become
lord general of all the parliamentary forces in Britain's civil
wars of the 1640s.
</P>
<P>
   After the defeat of King Charles I, he became Lord Protector of
England, the head of state. Historians cannot agree whether
Cromwell was an ambitious tyrant in pursuit of power or a tolerant,
enlightened figure who sought to create a stronger and fairer
country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 museums and institutions plan to explore Cromwell's
legacy through exhibitions and events, and some of his major
battles will be re-enacted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the year's events are ``Cromwell: Warts
and All,'' an exhibition at the Museum of London through Feb. 28,
telephone (44-171) 600-3699; ``Cromwell Collections: Past, Present
and Future,'' at the Cromwell Museum in Huntingdon, near Cambridge,
April 1 to June 27, (44-1480) 375-830; and ``That Great Impostor,''
an exhibition examining Cromwell's image in literature and
politics, from April 26 to Sept. 30 at Sidney Sussex College,
Sidney Street, Cambridge, where Cromwell was a student, (44-1223)
338-800.
</P>
<P>
   On April 25, Cromwell's birthday, there will be a re-creation of
a 17th-century street market with traders, entertainment and
displays in Huntingdon, (44-1480) 388-057. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Historical re-enactments will include a St. George's Day
Festival at Wrest Park Bedfordshire, 50 miles north of London, with
military displays on April 24 and 25. And one of the largest
historical events in Europe, including major re-creations of Civil
War battles, will take place at Kirby Hall, Northamptonshire, 80
miles north of London, on Aug. 14 and 15. Both will be staged by
English Heritage, (44-171) 973-3457. The Civil War Society will
present re-enactments and other activities at the Tower of London
from Oct. 24 to 31, (44-171) 709-0765. &QL;

   Stanford University's renovated and expanded museum _ home to
the largest Rodin collection outside the Musee Rodin in Paris _
will reopen next Sunday after having been closed for nearly 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has been renamed the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center
for Visual Arts, in honor of the philanthropists who made major
donations to the $36.8 million project. The Cantors have also
contributed more than 180 Rodin works to Stanford. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When its original sandstone-colored neo-classical complex opened
in 1894, the Leland Stanford Junior Museum _ as it was then known _
rivaled in size the two great American museums of the time, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts
in Boston. But the 1906 San Francisco earthquake leveled all but
the central pavilion of the museum and set into motion years of
decline. After the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, the remaining
structure was closed as unsafe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The old building has now been restored and a wing has been
added. With 21 indoor and outdoor galleries, the center can play
host to midsize traveling exhibitions, the first of which will
feature 120 Picasso prints from the Norton Simon Museum in

   First there was the movie ``Free Willy.'' Now, you can see
Willy, on an Oceanic Society Expeditions tour. Keiko, a killer
whale whose confinement in a small tank in Mexico City inspired an
international rescue effort (and the movie), was returned this
summer to his original home _ the waters off Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, from May 30 to June 9, will include a visit to Keiko
in his natural sea pen (a netted-off enclosure that allows the
whale to interact with other marine life) off the Westmann
Islands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Willy may be free, but the trip isn't: it's $2,940 a person,
double occupancy, including air fare from New York, tours,
accommodations and meals (except for some dinners). Contact Oceanic

   The renovated Arabic Coffe Baum in Leipzig, Germany, reopened in
November after having been closed for seven years. Famous for the
artists and intellectuals who frequented it, including the
composers Richard Wagner and Robert Schumann, the Coffe Baum is,
along with the Procope in Paris, the birthplace of the European
coffee tradition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Coffe Baum, or coffee tree, opened in 1720. It is named for
the Baroque relief above the portal: a sandstone carving showing a
Turk sitting under a coffee tree, passing a cup of coffee to a
cherub. It is said that August II (the Strong), Duke of Saxony,
drank coffee here. Schumann had a regular table, and Gotthold
Ephraim Lessing, the German playwright and critic, was another
influential guest. Others included Liszt, Goethe and the
turn-of-the-century artist Max Klinger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first time visitors may explore the entire four-story
building, where many rooms are themed. In the Schumann Room, for
instance, there is a portrait of Schumann from 1828, when he
visited the Coffe Baum for the first time. This sober, ground-floor
room is paneled in dark wood guests are served on bare acorn
tables.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional red velvet booths and mirrors decorate the Viennese
Cafe, and the walls of the Lehmann Room (named for the original
owners, who ran it first as a guesthouse in the late 1600s) are
hung with portraits of the most famous guests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Coffee Museum covers the history of coffee culture in Saxony
from the 18th to the 20th century, and displays Arabian coffee
vessels, a collection of coffee cups, the steps in roasting coffee
and typical coffeehouse games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A choice of coffees is offered on the second floor. Regular
espresso costs $2, a melange $2.25, and the specialty coffee called
August the Strong is $6. Pastries and full meals are served on the
third floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum and cafe, at 4 Kleine Fleischergasse in Leipzig,
(49-341) 961-0060, are open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission is free.
For tours, call the city museum, (49-341) 965-1321 or (49-341)
965-1323.

IN TALK TO PALESTINIAN COUNCIL, PERES BACKS NEW STATE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (Eds: See also ISRAEL-POLITICS) 
(jw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Far from the nasty bickering of the
Israeli election campaign, Shimon Peres, the former Israeli prime
minister, swept into Ramallah Monday with a covey of fellow Nobel
Peace Prize winners to promote his vision of peace, delivering the
first address by an Israeli to the Palestinian legislative council.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene evocative of the good will that accompanied peace
efforts when Peres was prime minister, he was given a warm ovation
by council members after he expressed support for an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our deep hope that the Palestinian people will gain
independence,'' Peres, an architect of the 1993 Oslo accords on
interim Palestinian self-rule, told the council. ``It is our common
interest to see a Palestinian state taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Palestinian state as a result of an agreement,'' Peres
added, alluding to statements by Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, that he reserves the right to declare statehood on May 4,
when talks on a permanent peace are supposed to end under the Oslo
accords. ``An agreement will take place about a Palestinian
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience included several foreign statesmen who had arrived
with Peres. Their presence was a reminder of the broad
international support Israel maintained under Peres' leadership,
when he pressed ahead with peace efforts that have in effect been
suspended by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The guests included former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former President F.W. de Klerk of South
Africa, as well as former Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil,
who helped negotiate the Camp David peace accords in 1978. All are
members of the international board of governors of the Peres Center
for Peace, which promotes cooperative projects involving Arabs and
Israelis. The board traveled here Monday as part of its second
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Peres, the gray-haired former leaders seemed like a
group of peace pensioners _ no longer in power, but still wielding
moral authority. ``They take on the aura and role of a collective
conscience, and they do make a difference,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, a
Palestinian legislator.
</P>
<P>
   After the council meeting, the visitors met with Arafat, the
only Nobel Prize winner present who is still governing. Peres
greeted him warmly, kissing him on both cheeks, and compared him to
Israel's first prime minister and state-builder, David Ben-Gurion.
``As an Israeli, I pray and wish for your success,'' Peres said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat responded with a policy speech, his first detailed
response to the freezing of the latest Israeli-Palestinian accord
by Netanyahu ahead of national elections set for May 17. Netanyahu
contends the Palestinians have failed to meet their commitments
under the accord, which was signed in Washington on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot understand how in political, legal or constitutional
terms one can freeze international agreements approved legally by
an elected parliament once one engages in domestic elections,''
Arafat said. ``Are they going to stop the peace process with Egypt?
Are they going to stop the peace process with Jordan?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Nobody can freeze life and its essential requirements for six
months,'' Arafat added. ``Further erosion of peace under the
pretext of elections should never be permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   As for a possible declaration of statehood on May 4, Arafat told
a reporter that it was ``still under discussion,'' and he was vague
about it in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are important dates that cannot be ignored, bypassed or
let slide without proper accounting and a proper decision,'' Arafat
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coming of May 4 is one of these important dates,'' he
added. ``We cannot bypass that date simply because one of the
parties wants to keep it hostage to its narrow domestic
calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat asserts that he is free to declare statehood on May 4,
because that is when talks on a permanent peace are supposed to end
under the Oslo accords. Netanyahu has called such a declaration a
breach of the accords, which require negotiations to reach a final
settlement. He has warned that Israel will annex parts of the West
Bank if Arafat proclaims a state.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., who joined Peres and spoke to the
legislative council, warned Palestinians against a unilateral
declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli elections will take place on May 17,'' he said.
``Don't do anything on the fourth of May, because all hell will
break loose, and all of your advantages and gains will go down the
drain.''

CHINA'S INACTION ON GITIC STIRS ANGER AND CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  HONG KONG _ China's relations with the international banking
world may go into a deep freeze after its decision over the weekend
not to bail out foreign creditors of a debt-ridden investment-trust
company.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 foreign creditors of the Guangdong International
Trust and Investment Corp., known as Gitic, were told Sunday that
the company would file for bankruptcy. The move will put the
foreign banks at the end of a long line of creditors clamoring for
repayment of Gitic's $4.3 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of anger,'' said one executive at a financial
company that has loans outstanding to Gitic. ``The general tone of
the meeting is that they were disorganized and unresponsive to the
needs of the creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
creditors were particularly shocked that the Chinese government was
unwilling to repay loans that were registered with the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange. Historically, Beijing has
guaranteed these loans with state money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the ill will, some analysts said they doubted
that foreign creditors would cease lending to Chinese companies.
Chinese officials have gone to pains to say that Gitic's bankruptcy
is an isolated case rather than a harbinger of financial distress
throughout China's state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also said Beijing might be sending a message that
it would not bail out foreigners who lend indiscriminately to
provincial companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a decision taken lightly,'' said T.L. Tsim, a
strategist who follows China for his consulting firm in Hong Kong.
``It is obviously a setback for the banks. But the government
probably took the view that the banks needed to know there was risk
to supporting these companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts warn that other investment-trust companies may
follow Gitic into insolvency, China still seems a safer bet than
other Asian economies. While Japan, Indonesia and other Asian
countries are mired in recession, Beijing predicts that its economy
will grow 7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a display of its economic muscle, the Chinese government
raised $1 billion in a global bond offering last month _ doubling
the size of the offering after investors flocked to buy the
dollar-denominated bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers will go where the money is,'' Tsim said. ``Creditors
may want extra guarantees, but how can you ignore the opportunities
of the China market?''
</P>
<P>
   To creditors of Gitic, however, China looks like a decidedly
inhospitable place. After lending on the assumption that the
provincial or central government would guarantee their loans, the
creditors were stunned to discover that they would be treated like
any other lender.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, under Chinese law, Gitic's 25,000 individual creditors
will be repaid from Guangdong provincial money, while the foreign
banks will have to seek repayment through protracted bankruptcy
proceedings. Given that Gitic's liabilities outweigh its assets by
$1.7 billion, the odds of these creditors recovering their
investment through such a process are slim.
</P>
<P>
   What frustrates creditors is that after three months of
scrutinizing Gitic's finances, a liquidation committee appointed by
the People's Bank of China is still unclear about many details.
Although the committee made fresh estimates of Gitic's assets and
liabilities, it drew no distinction between senior and subordinate
debt and gave few clues about how the bankruptcy would be handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of disclosure has been very poor,'' said the
executive from the Gitic creditor. ``The whole thing was handled
very unprofessionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Gitic could serve as a case study of the dangers of
throwing money at Chinese ventures. The company, based in the
provincial capital of Guangzhou, was established in 1980 as the
main fund-raising arm of the Guangdong government. Riding the wave
of China's most economically fertile region, Gitic expanded into
everything from securities trading to silk textiles.
</P>
<P>
   By last fall, however, it was sinking under billions of dollars
in debt to creditors like HSBC Holdings and Bank of East Asia. In
its first surprise move, Beijing shut down Gitic on Oct. 6. Then,
in late October, the company missed an interest payment on a $200
million international bond.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most alarming part of the Gitic saga is its
mushrooming debt. At first, analysts estimated that the company
owed about $2 billion. The news that it owes more than twice that
shocked creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Gitic is not the only government-owned company in Guangdong to
run into financial trouble. The province recently hired Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co &UR; . &LR;  to advise on a reorganization of Guangdong
Enterprises Holdings, a conglomerate based in Hong Kong that the
government also owns.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs served as the lead manager of the central
government's $1 billion bond offering. Now the firm has a chance to
return the favor to Beijing: Under the terms of its agreement with
Guangdong, Goldman's partners promised to buy a $20 million stake
in Guangdong Enterprises.

 &HT;    An Atlanta firm offers words, likeness of Martin Luther King
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) general news and (l) lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream, but who
knew the late civil rights leader would one day have his own music
CDs, an MTV special and a star-studded animated feature?
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years after his assassination, an Atlanta-based
company called Intellectual Properties Management is merchandising
the martyr with a line of products hailed by some as a savvy
business venture, but criticized by some King stalwarts for
commercializing his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In a multimedia strategy timed to coincide with the King
holiday, IPM and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment today are
unveiling ``Our Friend, Martin,'' a direct-to-video cartoon movie
featuring the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Angela Bassett, James Earl
Jones, John Travolta and Susan Sarandon.
</P>
<P>
   IPM also teamed up with R&AMP;B music label Motown to release a
soundtrack with performances by such diverse acts as Sheryl Crow,
Salt-N-Pepa, Montell Jordan and Brian McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, MTV will chronicle King in its rock 'n' roll
documentary series ``BIOrhythm,'' which also has profiled slain
rapper Tupac Shakur and Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is the best way to re-introduce King to young
people who speak a totally different language than just a
generation ago,'' said Phillip Jones, the chief executive officer
of IPM, which has an exclusive agreement with the King family to
manage the marketing of King's words and likeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language of young people in a contemporary paradigm is
MTV, the Internet and interactive learning. The information
revolution has changed the way they think, and we have to change
the way we convey his message.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the video and CD comes two years after Jones
forged a multimillion-dollar publishing deal with Warner Books, a
subsidiary of Time-Warner. The partnership has resulted in five
books, including a new ``autobiography,'' actually written by
Clayborne Carson, editor of the King Papers Project at Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   There's more coming, including King-related Web sites; an
autobiography by King's widow, Coretta Scott King; and a memoir by
King's youngest son, Dexter, president of the Martin Luther King
Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change and a Morehouse College
chum of Jones'.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jones nor his corporate partners would discuss financial
details of their various projects or how profits and royalties are
being distributed between IPM and the King estate. Jones said
revenues will be plowed back into the King Center to continue its
work. Dexter King and Coretta King could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Matlock, president and CEO of Matlock &AMP; Associates, the
public relations firm that advises the King family, lauds Jones for
reviving King's message while providing a potential windfall for
the cash-strapped King Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``King's message is just as important today and just as relevant
as it was 30 years ago,'' Matlock said. ``Phillip has been smart
and creative enough to figure out how to keep King's message and
his dream alive without exploiting it. He's extremely focused and
dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the marketing plans approved by the family and implemented
by IPM are part of a larger controversy over whether King's legacy
is property owned by his family or whether he is such a national
icon that his work belongs to history.
</P>
<P>
   IPM and the estate remain fiercely protective of rights to
King's work. In two high-profile cases, the estate has challenged
news organizations over their use of King's words. The estate sued
USA Today for printing the ``I Have a Dream'' speech without
permission, dropping the suit in 1993 after the paper agreed to pay
a fee. In July, the King estate lost a copyright infringement
lawsuit it filed against CBS News, which aired a documentary about
the 1963 March on Washington. That case is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones maintains that King purposely copyrighted his work while
he was alive, a clear indication he intended his heirs to reap any
financial benefits it might generate after his death.
</P>
<P>
   But other King confidantes are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have unquestionable love and respect for the King family,
but the thing that gets me is the kids trying to make money from
his memory,'' said the Rev. Hosea Williams, one of King's closest
aides. ``They were so young when he was murdered and do not know
the same Martin Luther King Jr. that I knew. He never let us put a
price tag on anything he did. He would have approved of
distributing his message, but he would never have accepted a dime
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Orange, a trusted King lieutenant, has not seen
the merchandise that IPM has released, but says he's concerned that
it may detract attention from King's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``His spirit wasn't about money, his spirit was about helping
the least of these and all of God's children,'' Orange says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of King's work is copyrighted, which means it is generally
protected from being used by others without his consent. There are
limited exceptions, such as a news organization that disseminates
copyrighted information as part of its coverage, says Michael
Landau, an associate professor at Georgia State University who
specializes in intellectual property issues.
</P>
<P>
   The King estate's efforts to define King's image has extended
into other areas. In 1995, the King family and the National Park
Service butted heads over competing plans to build a new King
exhibit, a dispute that resulted in the family temporarily banning
the park service from giving tours of King's birth home. The family
drew criticism that it was trying to turn the historic site into a
gimmicky theme park, a charge Jones and the Kings have denied. Both
sides eventually worked out their differences _ the Park Service
opened an $11 million visitors center in 1996, and the family's
plans for an interactive exhibit of its own are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says many of his critics don't understand that IPM's
marketing efforts represent the next chapter in the civil rights
movement: the battle for economic independence.
</P>
<P>
   An entrepreneur with ``a hip-hop sensibility,'' Jones speaks
passionately about the Kings' ``moral courage.'' In the next breath
he's comparing himself to DreamWorks SKG movie mogul Jeffrey
Katzenberg and rhapsodizing about corporate synergies that enable
media conglomerates such as Time-Warner and Disney to retain
control over products they create.
</P>
<P>
   Rakishly handsome, Jones dresses in the latest BCBG fashion
eyewear, drives a black Mercedes-Benz convertible and is fond of
clothing by FUBU, a ubiquitous African-American designer whose logo
is an acronym for ``For Us, By Us.'' He won't reveal his age, but
associates say he's in his early 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also is part owner of the now defunct Atlanta Live dance
club in Buckhead, once a favorite hangout for celebrities and
wannabes. The club is being relocated to Bankhead Highway, and the
new site is undergoing a $1 million renovation in hopes of opening
in late February. In addition to projects developed with the King
estate, Jones also is trying to sell several television series,
including a Saturday morning cartoon and a black prime-time soap
opera.
</P>
<P>
   Jones sees no contradiction in melding '60s social activism with
brashly aggressive marketing techniques of the '90s as a way of
reaching a generation of people who may consider King's life a
stale history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're following the plan that Dr. King left for us,'' says
Jones, in his office at the King Center. ``If Dr. King were alive,
he'd be on the Internet, and he'd approve of computers. I feel I'm
a man of my time, and I'm using my special talents to create new
products, images and works of art that can inspire and educate.''

is property owned by his family or whether he is such a national
icon that his work belongs to history.
</P>
<P>
   IPM and the estate remain fiercely protective of rights to
King's work. In two high-profile cases, the estate has challenged
news organizations over their use of King's words. The estate sued
USA Today for printing the ``I Have a Dream'' speech without
permission, dropping the suit in 1993 after the paper agreed to pay
a fee. In July, the King estate lost a copyright infringement
lawsuit it filed against CBS News, which aired a documentary about
the 1963 March on Washington. That case is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jones maintains that King purposely copyrighted his work while
he was alive, a clear indication he intended his heirs to reap any
financial benefits it might generate after his death.
</P>
<P>
   But other King confidantes are not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have unquestionable love and respect for the King family,
but the thing that gets me is the kids trying to make money from
his memory,'' said the Rev. Hosea Williams, one of King's closest
aides. ``They were so young when he was murdered and do not know
the same Martin Luther King Jr. that I knew. He never let us put a
price tag on anything he did. He would have approved of
distributing his message, but he would never have accepted a dime
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Orange, a trusted King lieutenant, has not seen
the merchandise that IPM has released, but says he's concerned that
it may detract attention from King's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``His spirit wasn't about money, his spirit was about helping
the least of these and all of God's children,'' Orange says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of King's work is copyrighted, which means it is generally
protected from being used by others without his consent. There are
limited exceptions, such as a news organization that disseminates
copyrighted information as part of its coverage, says Michael
Landau, an associate professor at Georgia State University who
specializes in intellectual property issues.
</P>
<P>
   The King estate's efforts to define King's image has extended
into other areas. In 1995, the King family and the National Park
Service butted heads over competing plans to build a new King
exhibit, a dispute that resulted in the family temporarily banning
the park service from giving tours of King's birth home. The family
drew criticism that it was trying to turn the historic site into a
gimmicky theme park, a charge Jones and the Kings have denied. Both
sides eventually worked out their differences _ the Park Service
opened an $11 million visitors center in 1996, and the family's
plans for an interactive exhibit of its own are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says many of his critics don't understand that IPM's
marketing efforts represent the next chapter in the civil rights
movement: the battle for economic independence.
</P>
<P>
   An entrepreneur with ``a hip-hop sensibility,'' Jones speaks
passionately about the Kings' ``moral courage.'' In the next breath
he's comparing himself to DreamWorks SKG movie mogul Jeffrey
Katzenberg and rhapsodizing about corporate synergies that enable
media conglomerates such as Time-Warner and Disney to retain
control over products they create.
</P>
<P>
   Rakishly handsome, Jones dresses in the latest BCBG fashion
eyewear, drives a black Mercedes-Benz convertible and is fond of
clothing by FUBU, a ubiquitous African-American designer whose logo
is an acronym for ``For Us, By Us.'' He won't reveal his age, but
associates say he's in his early 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also is part owner of the now defunct Atlanta Live dance
club in Buckhead, once a favorite hangout for celebrities and
wannabes. The club is being relocated to Bankhead Highway, and the
new site is undergoing a $1 million renovation in hopes of opening
in late February. In addition to projects developed with the King
estate, Jones also is trying to sell several television series,
including a Saturday morning cartoon and a black prime-time soap
opera.
</P>
<P>
   Jones sees no contradiction in melding '60s social activism with
brashly aggressive marketing techniques of the '90s as a way of
reaching a generation of people who may consider King's life a
stale history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're following the plan that Dr. King left for us,'' says
Jones, in his office at the King Center. ``If Dr. King were alive,
he'd be on the Internet, and he'd approve of computers. I feel I'm
a man of my time, and I'm using my special talents to create new
products, images and works of art that can inspire and educate.''

   ATLANTA _ Few flesh-and-blood actors have re-created the
commanding presence of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
on-screen, and few TV writers have bothered coming up with story
lines about the slain civil rights leader that appeal to adults and
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Friend, Martin,'' a direct-to-video movie debuting today
in retail outlets, clears both hurdles (mostly) with a 'toon
version of King. It's got a little of something for everybody,
including the voices of a multiracial A-list Hollywood cast, a plot
reminiscent of ``Back to the Future'' and ``Forrest Gump''-style
special effects.
</P>
<P>
   The movie centers on a black Atlanta sixth-grader named Miles;
his white best friend, Randy; their overachieving Latina
schoolmate, Maria; and an overweight white bully, Kyle. During a
class trip to King's birth home on Auburn Avenue, they are
magically transported back in time to key moments in King's life,
from his baseball-loving boyhood to the civil rights marches he led
across the Jim Crow South.
</P>
<P>
   What's most striking about ``Martin'' is the use of still
photography and sepia-toned stock footage blended seamlessly with
the animated characters. At one point, Miles and Randy are seen
cheering among the crowd of actual participants in the 1963 March
on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The racial hatred of the '60s is wisely toned down for younger
viewers, although it includes scenes of cops directingfirehoses and
sicking dogs on young marchers. The N-word is never used, but
derogatory references to African-American characters as
``coloreds'' and ``you people'' hint at the raw prejudices of the
era.
</P>
<P>
   LeVar Burton gives voice to the young King, then passes the
microphone to King's real-life son Dexter, who on occasion can
summon the same chest-rattling cadence that became his father's
oratorical trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Adults already familiar with the story may catch themselves
playing who's who with the cartoon cast. Whoopi Goldberg's soulful
rasp is easily recognizable as the voice of Mrs. Peck, the kindly
tour guide. And James Earl Jones as Daddy King is a no-brainer. But
it gets trickier trying to figure out which characters are voiced
by Ed Asner, Danny Glover, Angela Bassett, Oprah Winfrey, Samuel L.
Jackson and John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   While it's heavy-handed in spots, ``Our Friend, Martin'' is a
kid-friendly video for younger viewers who may be hearing King's
enduring message of racial tolerance for the first time, and a
reminder for older viewers who may have forgotten it.

VETERAN POLITICIAN FORMS GOVERNMENT IN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkey's six-week-old political crisis
appeared to end Monday when a strongly secular politician, Bulent
Ecevit, announced that he had assembled a minority government. It
is expected to win parliamentary approval by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The country has been without a functioning government since Nov.
25, when Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who was implicated in a
corruption scandal, lost a confidence vote in Parliament. He has
remained in office as a caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain how long Ecevit will remain in power. An
election is scheduled for April, but President Suleyman Demirel and
powerful military commanders want to postpone it. They fear a quick
election will produce new gains for the Islamic political movement.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit's government will be the sixth since the last election,
in December 1995. That election produced a government headed by the
Islamic leader Necemttin Erbakan. His policies angered the
country's military commanders, who are committed to secularism, and
they orchestrated a campaign that led to his resignation after one
year in office.
</P>
<P>
   In the political bickering that has split the country since
then, Ecevit has solidified his position as one of the country's
most steadfast secularists. He is also a strong nationalist, and is
still remembered as the prime minister who ordered troops to Cyprus
in 1974 in what he described as a ``peace operation'' to protect
the Turkish minority there. These convictions make him acceptable
to the military even though he is a lifelong leftist.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet that Ecevit presented Monday is made up almost
entirely of members of his own Democratic Left party. Although the
party is a minority in Parliament, other power brokers have
signaled they will support it.
</P>
<P>
   Key figures from the departing government will keep their jobs,
among them Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, who is considered
pro-Western; Finance Minister Zekeriya Temizel, whose immediate
task will be to help negotiate a new loan agreement with the
International Monetary Fund, and Education Minister Hikmet Ulugbay,
who has angered some Muslims with his campaign against religious
influence in schools and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit, 73, has been a political figure in Turkey for more than
40 years, beginning with his first election to Parliament in 1957.
In the 1970s he served three terms as prime minister, holding
office for a total of 33 months.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most fateful of Ecevit's policies was his work in the
1970s to prevent Turkey from joining the European Union, then
called the European Community. He said it represented capitalist
forces seeking to dominate Turkey and pull it away from its allies
in the Middle East. Turkey is now committed to joining the Union,
but no longer finds the climate as welcoming as it was then.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit is the godfather of Turkey's political left. He has
maintained his convictions even in the face of trials,
assassination attempts and prison terms. Critics say he remains
stuck in outdated views, clinging to his old beliefs in
anti-imperialism, protectionist economics and heavy state
involvement in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   A policy statement distributed by his party, however, says the
party now favors ``a market economy that should operate within a
democratic leftist framework in which workers' participation and
joint people's enterprises will play a dominant role.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually alone among senior politicians here, Ecevit lives
modestly and has avoided the taint of scandal. His insistence on
driving to work in an aging Turkish sedan rather than using the
chauffeur-driven Mercedes to which he is entitled has given him a
reputation as something of an eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit's education also sets him apart from many of his
colleagues. He studied English literature at Ankara University, and
later Sanskrit and Bengali at London University. In 1957 he spent
eight months at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering politics, Ecevit worked as a journalist,
including a stint as a columnist for The Winston-Salem Journal in
North Carolina. He is an accomplished translator and has produced
Turkish versions of works ranging from ``The Cocktail Party'' by
T.S. Eliot to the Indian classic ``Bhagavat Gita.''

BANK PRESIDENT VOWS TO REACH OUT TO WEST COAST CUSTOMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ One of the favorite paintings of Bank of
America chief executive Hugh McColl is a commissioned work titled
``Take The Money And Run.'' It shows the bad guys making their
getaway from a bank called ``Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, McColl's former NationsBank Corp. merged with
Republic Bank of Texas in 1988, setting off a wave of acquisitions
that culminated with the marriage to San Francisco's BankAmerica
Corp. in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   McColl smiles as he gazes upon the painting, but his Old South
conviviality and hospitality are bundled with a deadly serious
competitive business sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlotte has always been about business and nothing else,''
said McColl, 63, smoothly shifting gears from discussing art to the
business at hand: making the San Francisco merger work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do everything in our power to make this a
successful merger,'' McColl said recently in a wide-ranging
interview in the gleaming 60-story bank headquarters in Charlotte.
``I want it to be the best place to work, best place to do business
and the company that matters the most to its communities, and that
is exactly what I am about, and I'm going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   McColl is the chairman and chief executive of BankAmerica Corp.,
the parent corporation of Bank of America, which now serves 22
states.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to California this week, he will try to alleviate
post-merger fears and the perception that the new Charlotte-based
institution is insensitive to its California customers.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank seeks to grow rapidly, McColl said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of NationsBank and BankAmerica, announced last spring
and finalized in the fall, was quickly followed by sharp criticism
as San Francisco grappled with losing one of its oldest corporate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected resignation of former BankAmerica chairman and
chief executive David Coulter, McColl's heir-apparent, created only
further distrust. This was compounded by the post-merger departure
of several top women executives, which was perceived to be the
result of a less-than-supportive atmosphere for diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in San Francisco and California quickly demanded that
the new bank disclose whether it would maintain its commitments to
diversity and lending to minority communities and threatened a
review of government accounts managed by BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   McColl's trip to the West Coast is an effort to turn around what
has become a public relations fiasco for the merged bank.
</P>
<P>
   McColl is considered a progressive here, and his Charlotte
supporters say McColl has a long-held commitment to diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, McColl supported a black candidate for mayor. And
last year, he helped defeat four of the five members of the
Mecklenburg County Commission who voted to cut $5 million for
Charlotte's arts programs to demonstrate disapproval of the
Charlotte Repertory Theatre's production of a play with gay themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my career I've judged people on results ... and I
certainly don't care what their lifestyle choices are,'' McColl
said. ``Within the law we did everything possible (contributing
money to defeat the group of five), and those of us individually
contributed tons of money. I was inflamed. It was bad for the city
and narrow-minded.'' Four of the five were defeated in re-election
bids.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, McColl has applied the same unabashed approach
to building a banking empire. His pride in that growth, he and his
Charlotte friends insist, is rooted in a belief that diversity is
his bank's salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The news reports in San Francisco that the merger revealed a
cultural divide that caused women executives to leave and the
perception that a Charlotte-based parent company cannot appreciate
California's social and business values have stung McColl
personally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot written about eight or 10 people who have
left the company and very little written about the 170,000 people
who work here,'' he said. ``One would have thought that logic would
say to people that NationsBank could not have become what was the
second largest bank in the U.S. through a series of mergers _ which
is more than 600 different banking companies _ if they did not have
an environment in which talented people could succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond perception, the political repercussions of the criticism
could cost the new bank business.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors have
questioned whether the city, Bank of America's major customer in
Northern California, should continue doing business with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Other political figures also have questioned the new bank's
commitment to community reinvestment.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the barbed reaction to the aftermath of the merger
there is a sense of seller's remorse in California _ lament that
the old Bank of America, which gave Walt Disney his first $100 loan
and sold the bonds to build the Golden Gate Bridge, has slipped
away.
</P>
<P>
   McColl said he wants to build a united but diverse bank that
will serve California well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be responsive to California and to
California's needs. In fact, we will take more risk than the old
Bank of America did,'' he said..
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now one company, and all the new teammates who come to
our company I view the same way that I view the people who came
from Texas, Missouri, Florida or wherever. This may be a foreign
concept to some people, but it's just the way we are.''
</P>
<P>
   McColl derided the perception that a macho climate permeates the
Bank of America, that some women are unwelcome or uncomfortable in
a company where the chief executive, a Marine veteran, rewards high
performers with toy hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this company is is demanding,'' McColl said. ``It is
results-oriented. It measures people on results only. And facts. It
does not deal with fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The glint that so often shimmers in his blue eyes momentarily
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people find that environment very threatening,'' he went
on. ``Others find it extremely rewarding, and we pay well for
people who produce results. Am I aggressive? Am I ambitious, all
those things? Absolutely. But that does not include destroying the
franchise.''

<P>
   McColl's lack of specifics on the allocation of philanthropic
contributions and community reinvestment money _ federal law
requires banks to serve all segments of their service areas without
excluding low or moderate income or minority areas _ is still the
No. 1 issue for merger critics in California.

<P>
   With ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Tom Stoppard completes an arc that
began in 1967 with ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' his
first produced stage play. Taken in the context of the playwright's
other work, the two are primary instances of Stoppard in love _
with Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   As he has said, ``Rosencrantz'' is a play about ``Hamlet'' as
seen by two people, both outsiders to the court, ``driving past
Elsinore'' and wondering what is happening in the state of Denmark.
Serving as an involuntary act of criticism, the play also deals
with what Shakespeare left out of ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a film with a screenplay by Stoppard
and Marc Norman, is about how Shakespeare wrote ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' or, rather, how he should have written ``Romeo and
Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing a monumental writer's block and unable to finish a work
titled ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter,'' the movie's
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is also lovelorn until he meets Viola
de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow), a wealthy lady who desperately wants
poetry in her life and joins Shakespeare's company disguised as a
man.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of having a writer, especially a real one, as the
protagonist of a movie or a play is fraught with pitfalls. Van Gogh
can paint; Mozart can compose (and we can hear the music), but how
does one dramatize the act of writing? Think of the movie ``Dr.
Zhivago,'' when Omar Sharif stared out a window and thought of Lara
and then magically, and unconvincingly, began to write.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the success of ``Shakespeare in Love'' is the intensity
of Fiennes' performance, for example, in the scene in which he
practices writing his signature. The quill pen dives into the ink
pot and then crackles on parchment. Or the swiftness with which the
director, John Madden, moves from the writing to the rehearsal of
the play, underlining the immediacy and the spontaneity of
Shakespeare's art.
</P>
<P>
   Should the screenwriter use the author's words? That question is
answered here with an emphatic affirmative. Quotations from
Shakespeare are artfully inserted so that they seem like common
speech, as in a minister's overheard threat, ``A plague on both
your houses.'' This Shakespeare is always listening, as Trigorin
does in ``The Seagull,'' storing lines away for future use.
</P>
<P>
   In passing he profits from a seemingly casual barroom tip from
his rival, Christopher Marlowe, who suggests that he consider using
the plot device of two warring families. Wisely, Shakespeare
removes all piratical references and changes the title to ``Romeo
and Juliet.'' The ``real life'' story seen on screen is filled with
parallels to the play, starting with the fact that both pairs of
lovers are star-crossed.
</P>
<P>
   One striking difference between ``Shakespeare in Love'' and
``Rosencrantz'' _and most of Stoppard's other work _ is that the
movie is unabashedly a love story. In the past it has often been
said that his plays were intellectually dazzling but that he
averted his eyes (and his pen) in matters of romance.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally lust entered his realm, as in ``Dirty Linen,'' his
mischievous mockery of Parliamentary sexual shenanigans in Britain,
as timely today as it was in 1976. With ``The Real Thing'' in 1981
he began shedding more of his inhibitions. In that play the leading
character, himself a playwright presumably speaking for the author,
said that whenever he tried to write a play about love, it came out
``embarrassing, childish and rude.'' But at least the character
could talk about his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of ``Indian Ink'' in 1995, Stoppard approached the
subject more forthrightly, conjuring a wistful romance between an
English poet and an Indian artist in the 1930s. That play, which is
scheduled to have its United States premiere in February at the
American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, has a nude scene,
the first in a Stoppard work since ``Jumpers.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new movie, he fully embraces love's comedy and drama. The
character of Shakespeare is overcome by his passion, putting
himself and Viola in jeopardy as they pursue their ardent
courtship. Love proves to be creatively invigorating. Soon he is
rushing from the lady's bedchamber to his desk, plunging into his
play while also dashing off sonnets to Viola _ no Dark Lady _
comparing her to a summer's day. She becomes his muse: Viola as
Juliet and Shakespeare as Romeo inspire the play.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Rosencrantz,'' the movie is both Stoppardian and
Shakespearean, which is to say it is an antic original but also
respectful of its source. In effect ``Shakespeare in Love'' treats
``Romeo and Juliet'' as ``Rosencrantz'' did ``Hamlet,'' as a
necessary subplot. In each case Stoppard plays fair with
Shakespeare, although in the movie he takes literary license with
his life. With so little information available, he could be freely
inventive.
</P>
<P>
   In the years between ``Rosencrantz'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' he has often drawn from reality, especially when dealing
with literary matters. ``Travesties'' cross-pollinated events in
the lives of James Joyce and Tristan Tzara with a performance of
Oscar Wilde's ``Importance of Being Earnest.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilde himself makes a cameo appearance in ``The Invention of
Love,'' Stoppard's latest play, an imaginative exploration of the
life and philosophy of A.E. Housman. A central theme of that work
is Housman's thwarted love for a Cambridge classmate, a passion
that generated the author's most deeply felt poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Another writer on Stoppard's landscape is Arthur Schnitzler. He
has adapted several of Schnitzler's plays, most notably
``Undiscovered Country,'' which is Shakespearean both in its title
(taken from ``Hamlet'') and its scope. In ``Arcadia,'' a crucial
offstage role is played by Lord Byron, who was once a guest in the
house that is the play's setting.
</P>
<P>
   Neither in his art nor his mien could Stoppard be described as
Byronesque. But because he is a playwright of ideas, he has been
called Shavian. As an artist he bears a debt to Samuel Beckett and
as a reader and book collector he has a particular fondness for the
work of Ernest Hemingway. More than anyone else, however,
Shakespeare remains his master.
</P>
<P>
   One should not forget his middle careering of ``Dogg's Hamlet,
``Cahoot's Macbeth,'' interrelated plays. The first was written to
be presented on a double-decker London bus, the second a living
room ``Macbeth'' as it might have been staged in Prague during the
years of Soviet repression.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the core of ``Dogg's Hamlet'' is a hilarious 15-minute
version of ``Hamlet'' that cuts Shakespeare to the quick. It is a
gauntlet tossed in the faces of those who favor the fuller length.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dogg's Hamlet,'' Shakespeare, appearing for the first time
as a character in a work by Stoppard, delivers the Prologue,
running ``Something is rotten'' right into ``To be, or not to be,
that is the question.'' Later, when Hamlet refrains, ``To be, or
not to be,'' Ophelia rudely interrupts him and he responds,
posthaste, ``Get thee to a nunnery.''
</P>
<P>
   After this condensation there is a breathless 90-second encore
in which ``To be'' is not to be, and there are exclamations rather
than questions.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Stoppard takes a more leisurely
approach, opening up his story to include the world of Elizabethan
theater: its factionalism, chicanery, self-interest and rigidity.
Periodically, Stoppard has touched on theatrical matters: the play
within the play in ``The Real Thing'' and in ``The Real Inspector
Hound.'' But in ``Shakespeare in Love'' the theater is center
stage, and all contemporary resonances are intentional, as when an
actor asks a producer his identity and the man replies, ``I'm the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth herself, as incarnated by Judi Dench, proves to
be a figure of surprising liberality, at least in the arena of
theater and romance. In addition to Marlowe, John Webster is in the
lineup as a youth with a sadistic streak, and there is more than a
hint that the lady Viola will inspire a future Shakespearean
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was Norman's idea. Other than that, the division of
labor between the two screenwriters is not specified. But the
dialogue has the linguistic limberness of Stoppard at his wittiest,
as when Shakespeare persuades the actor Ned Alleyn to play Mercutio
by telling him that his is the title role. Or when confronted with
a crisis, the woeful company manager (Geoffrey Rush) says, ``The
show must ... you know.'' Shakespeare urges him to finish his
sentence, ``go on.''
</P>
<P>
   As his authorial signature the playwright has infiltrated his
work with references to characters named Boot and Moon. In ``The
Real Inspector Hound,'' Birdboot is a first-string drama critic,
Moon one of the second string, and they are soon caught up onstage
in a spoof of an Agatha Christie thriller. There are no Boots or
Moons in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' although in what might be
considered a Stoppard note, the film begins with Rush having his
booted feet burned by an angry creditor. In the place of critics,
there is Simon Callow as the imperious Master of Revels, and the
Queen herself is withering in her criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Stoppard has also managed to insert the name Chamberlain into
almost all his plays. Like Alfred Hitchcock, Chamberlain wanders
onstage (as a member of the British Parliament in ``Dirty Linen'')
or remains just offstage (a man in a taxi in ``Hapgood''). The
mention is a tip of the writer's hat to his secretary, who was a
Chamberlain before she married. He once explained that he put the
name in to wake her up when she was typing his manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   To one's knowledge, his movies (``Despair,'' ``Empire of the
Sun'' and others) have been Chamberlain-free, until ``Shakespeare
in Love.'' The reference fits very naturally into the movie because
Richard Burbage's acting troupe was known as Chamberlain's Men. One
actor in that company, a hopeful playwright, was, of course,
William Shakespeare, brought vibrantly to life in Stoppard's new
film.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Sparky Watts first shows up at a naval base
outside Tokyo in ``Far East,'' A.R. Gurney's uneven but poignant
new play at Lincoln Center, his future is in his face. It's an open
face, transfused with that raw hopefulness often seen in young men
starting the first chapter of their adulthood. Yet there is also a
trace of anxiety, of defensiveness in his eager smile, a sense that
whatever hopes he may harbor are somehow already under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Sparky, played with winningly eloquent awkwardness by Michael
Hayden, speaks with the cocky confidence and reflexive air of
entitlement that belong to children of affluent, old-line American
families, the kind of WASP clans that Gurney has always written
about. He is also, very clearly, a prisoner of these very traits
and knows it.
</P>
<P>
   What Sparky seeks in the exotic realm of the play's title is
transformation, the abandonment of a claustrophobic social
identity. His fears that he will never achieve this are what make
him interesting, and you can sometimes read in his expressions the
anticipation of regrets of a lifetime to come.
</P>
<P>
   Regret is Gurney's specialty, and it is what has given his plays
an emotional clout beyond their status as brittle comedies of
upper-middle-class manners. From early works like ``Children'' to
``Later Life,'' his 1993 variation on Henry James' short
masterpiece on lost opportunities, ``The Beast in the Jungle,''
this dramatist has created a gallery of wistful characters for whom
class is destiny. Even his most defiant rebels, the ne'er-do-well
son of ``The Middle Ages'' or the autobiographical playwright of
``The Cocktail Hour,'' remain tethered by their roots.
</P>
<P>
   For Gurney, as well as his alter ego Sparky, ``Far East,'' which
opened Monday night at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater in an
impeccably realized production, represents a serious bid for escape
from the world that has defined him. Throughout his career, the
author has been criticized for working on too small a canvas, for
creating mere tempests in martini glasses. Here, he tries hard to
extend his thematic reach, to find in Sparky's coming of age a
mirror for the U.S. rediscovery of itself after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1954, the play centers on Sparky's love affair with a
Japanese woman, a romance inspired by events in Gurney's life and
previously alluded to in his ``Middle Ages'' and ``Love Letters.''
``Far East'' turns this admittedly familiar situation into an
opportunity to consider such hefty subjects as U.S. involvement in
both Korea and Vietnam, homosexuality in the military,
life-sacrificing espionage and Eastern vs. Western notions of
femininity.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of weight to place upon the play's slender,
gracefully sloped shoulders, and the evening is least satisfying
when it self-consciously announces its political significance. It
should also be noted that in embracing the cliches of
soldier-in-love dramas common to postwar films like ``From Here to
Eternity'' and ``Sayonara,'' Gurney doesn't always transcend them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is good in ``Far East,'' especially the scenes
portraying Sparky's ambivalent friendship with an officer's wife
(played to perfection by Lisa Emery), is as good as anything Gurney
has written and a vast improvement over his recent, clunky
``Overtime'' and ``Labor Day.'' Like its hero, ``Far East'' never
quite becomes what it wants to be. Under Daniel Sullivan's
first-rate direction, however, the production is a welcome reminder
of the appeal of its author's gliding dialogue and structural
elegance, as well as of the troubled, rueful heart that informs all
of Gurney's work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Visually, the evening is delicious. The set designer Thomas
Lynch has created a scenic poem of cultural conflict, with
backdrops that evoke the fine-lined delicacy of traditional
Japanese art, corrupted by signs of a nascent Western invasion. Pay
special attention to the witty representation of a golf course near
Tokyo. The look of the show, moreover, reflects the very form of
the play, which incorporates touches of Noh theater in telling
Sparky's story.
</P>
<P>
   A single performer (Sonnie Brown) in traditional Japanese
costume sits on an elevated platform, reading the dialogue of minor
characters and signaling changes of scene with a sweeping clack of
two blocks of wood. She also implicitly represents the girl whom
Sparky, a Milwaukee brewery heir and naval reserve officer fresh
from officer's training school in Newport, R.I., meets and falls in
love with, a character we get to know only through discussion of
her by others.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown defines a cultural element that is in effect the
proverbial China shop, suddenly invaded by a herd of shortsighted
American bulls. These invaders include Capt. James Anderson (Bill
Smitrovich), Sparky's commanding officer, who is still mourning the
loss of a son in the Korean War, and his wife, Julia (Ms. Emery), a
former Voice of America employee who remains a self-styled American
voice, reminding her husband's men of what they left behind, by
organizing weenie roasts, dance classes and tennis matches. There
is also Bob Munger (Connor Trinneer), Sparky's roommate, a nervous
young man with a droll manner and obvious ambivalence about being
in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Ambivalence is the keynote of each of these characters, who
desire to be something other than what they are and are troubled by
a concomitant sense of bad faith. Sparky is tested in different
ways and to varyingly successful dramatic effect by the claims of
each of these three other people in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Smitrovich and Trinneer both turn in fine, understated
performances, but they bear the ungainly brunt of the most
blatantly political aspects of the play. It's when Sparky faces off
with Julia, in a pas de deux of mutual attraction and irritation,
that ``Far East'' flies. Julia, it turns out, comes from a
background similar to Sparky's and knows one of his relatives. She
is the siren call of everything Sparky is running from. She is also
determined, from very mixed motives, to sabotage the young man's
relationship with the Japanese woman with whom he has set up house.
</P>
<P>
   Julia is by far the play's most fully drawn character, and Ms.
Emery is absolutely splendid in the role, giving her levels of
shading that go beyond the script. Her voice filtered through a
high-WASP lockjaw that somehow avoids caricature, her body a study
in angular composure, she is a knotty mixture of determination and
inhibition, of witty, self-aware intelligence and instinctive
prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   When she and Hayden execute a cha-cha in a dance class at the
officer's club, you know that something dangerous is happening and
not just because of the suggested erotic attraction. Each knows
what the other really is, and their similarities will be what undo
their respective attempts to get beyond what they have come from.
Far East is clearly not far enough for these refugees from the WASP
nest, and the scene hums with a subliminal resonance that says far
more about the American character than the play's shorthand
discussions of war, police actions and political betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible, of course, not to think of that other restless
officer's wife played so memorably by Deborah Kerr in ``From Here
to Eternity,'' a movie which, by the way, is alluded to in ``Far
East.'' Julia, of course, is never going to find herself lying in
an adulterous embrace in a bathing suit on a beach as the waves
wash over her.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in which Gurney tantalizingly raises the possibility
of such a thing happening, however, is priceless, a seduction
botched by good manners. It is a sterling example of what this
playwright does best: finding boundless, tragicomic wistfulness in
people of unconquerable limitations.

STOCK PRICE FALLS AS CAMPBELL SOUP ANNOUNCES DROP IN EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blaming the weather for sluggish sales of its biggest brand, the
Campbell Soup Co. warned Monday that its earnings in the current
quarter would be off by 18 to 23 cents a share, significantly lower
than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, the company said its sales
of condensed soup, those familiar red-and-white cans that make up
two-thirds of Campbell's sales and earnings, had been depressed by
unusually warm weather in November and December and would not
improve meaningfully before its second quarter ends on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Camden, N.J., also said that
shipments would be down ``significantly in the near term'' and that
the effect would be felt for the full fiscal year, which ends on
July 31. Earnings for the year are expected to be $1.90 to $1.95 a
share, down from the $2.13 consensus on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement sent the company's share price into a tailspin.
Trading was halted briefly in the morning as the price plunged more
than $7 and hit a 52-week low. The shares finished the day at
$45.375, down $6.875, or about 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dale F. Morrison, Campbell's chief executive, said that soup
sales for the fiscal year were hurt by the weather in late 1998,
which he called the warmest ``since 1200, when Empress Irene
blinded her son Constantine and vowed to marry Charlemagne.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts seemed unimpressed by the history lesson. As cause for
the problems, they cited not atmospheric conditions but unrealistic
expectations heralded by company management.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, the company came out and said the market for
condensed soup would grow 4 percent,'' said Nomi Ghez, a food
analyst for Goldman, Sachs. ``And there was nobody who believed
them. They built inventories on the assumption that consumption
would grow, because that's what they decided. It's the confusion
between reality and wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Three analysts downgraded the stock after the conference call,
and others said they wondered whether the company's board might
consider a sale to make things right with shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campbell could be attractive,'' said John M. McMillin, an
analyst for Prudential Securities, who asked Morrison in the
conference call whether he had spoken to the Dorrance family, which
has five members on the board and whose patriarch, John R.
Dorrance, started Campbell. Morrison did not answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, who has been relentless in his optimism about the
company's prospects for growth, said in the conference call that
despite increased spending on marketing, condensed soup sales would
grow by only 1 percent to 2 percent for the year. Recent marketing
campaigns included tie-ins with popular children's television shows
such as ``Blue's Clues'' and ``Rugrats'' and efforts to make
condensed soup more relevant to consumers with recipes and store
displays aimed at the time-pressed home cook.
</P>
<P>
   To try to lift sales, the company also brought out television
commercials that showed various contemporary family scenes,
including a young girl dropped off at her new foster home and a
family merrily making a casserole using a can of soup.
</P>
<P>
   All of that _ together with a spinoff of underperforming
businesses that was completed last year, a companywide campaign
that has employees wearing ``Growth'' pins on their lapels and
healthy expansion of other Campbell businesses like Pepperidge Farm
cookies and V8 Splash soft drinks _ was not enough to overcome a
decline in condensed soup that has continued for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's executives continued to say Monday that they were
making progress, but analysts were highly skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management is trying to move mountains in terms of consumer
behavior change,'' McMillin said. ``To blame all of this on the
weather is too much to take. The big problem is they spent a lot of
dollars on marketing and the needle didn't move at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ghez said her recommendation on Campbell shares would remain
at ``neutral,'' despite the drop in price. ``I don't believe this
is a buying opportunity,'' she said. ``The fact is, the total soup
category is not growing very much because people do not sit down to
dinner so often, soup is not portable and people eat out a lot and
eat on the go.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also said Monday that it had come up with a plan to
reduce inefficiencies on its manufacturing side that should save
the company $100 million a year, starting in the fiscal year 2000.
The company also hired an executive from PricewaterhouseCoopers,
the accounting and consulting giant, to examine how else it might
cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   In response, analysts seemed to think that the company should be
concentrating on bolstering its sales, not on cutting back where it
could. ``Whether or not they are doing supply-chain management is
not the issue,'' said Jaine Mehring, an analyst for Salomon Smith
Barney, who cut her rating last month on fears of an earnings drop.
She said the magnitude of the decline Monday was larger than she
had forecast.
</P>
<P>
   McMillin expressed the mood of disappointment that prevailed on
Wall Street Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their desire was to be `Best in Show,' '' he said, recalling
an oft-voiced goal of Morrison and others at Campbell. ``Now
they're really in the doghouse.''

   ATLANTA _ Video poker. Casino boats. A lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Like a band of Atlantic City conventioneers, the South Carolina
General Assembly finds a gambling smorgasbord on its list of things
to do.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly convenes today in the wake of a tumultuous
November election that featured the ouster of an incumbent governor
who opposed the video poker industry and the election of a
challenger who advocated a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Southern states that have turned to gambling for
revenue _ Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Virginia and Louisiana run
lotteries while Mississippi allows casinos _ South Carolina is
figuring out how to maximize its take on some games of chance while
prohibiting others.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama Legislature also will consider a lottery bill this
session. Tennessee, which rejected a lottery proposal last session,
may review another one this year. In Virginia Beach, Va., the City
Council soon will deal with the proposed docking of a casino boat
there.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina not only will consider a lottery, a prime
campaign plank of incoming Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges, but also
whether to tightly regulate or ban video poker and whether to
prohibit casino boats that have begun to ply territorial waters of
the Palmetto State.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the different gambling elements are coming in, and there's
no way to stop it,'' said state Rep. John Hawkins, a Republican
attorney in Spartanburg.
</P>
<P>
   In a conservative bastion where politics are shaped by the
Christian Coalition and the Legislature has declared milk the state
beverage, video poker payoffs became legal in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing Republican Gov. David Beasley called the machines a
``cancer'' that eats away at those who play them.
</P>
<P>
   That stand, said Laura Woliver, a political scientist at the
University of South Carolina, ``mobilized every single convenience
store owner who could pay his mortgage with three or four machines
in the back near the men's room.''
</P>
<P>
   The video poker lobby donated huge sums to Hodges, making an
indispensable contribution to his victory.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime opponent of poker payoffs when he was the House
minority leader, Hodges now is lobbying the Legislature to pass a
referendum that would allow voters to decide the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges wants the referendum set for 2000 when legislators will
be up for re-election and pressed on their video poker views.
Analysts say the maneuver is an attempt to keep momentum by the
Democrats, who had seemed before the November elections on the
verge of extinction. Traditionally, Democrats have favored
legalized gambling; Republicans have opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Video poker generates about $3 billion a year in South Carolina
compared with the $1.7 billion in annual sales produced by the
Georgia lottery. Poker detractors complain the industry is
underregulated and undertaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's going to separate the men from the boys is
how much we decide to tax these rascals,'' said Hawkins, the
Spartanburg representative. ``I support a very high tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest proponents of video poker _ those who
receive campaign contributions from the industry _ are trying to
shut down fledgling casino boats as they edge toward a coastline
boom. Poker people don't want the competition.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled the only way to prevent the boats from
running casinos once they reach the three mile territorial limit
offshore is for the Legislature to outlaw such wagering.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Victori Casino began sailing out of the Little
River fishing village near the North Carolina border. Now at least
two other developers say they may start sailing even in the face of
legislative opposition.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent incursions by so-called cruises to nowhere, the
Charleston City Council has passed ordinances that would keep the
boats off its coast.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Joe Brown (D-Columbia) has modified his view of
gambling over the years. Six sessions ago, he favored riverboat
gambling because of its promised job growth. Today, he's a sponsor
on a bill that would stop casino boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our harbors filled up with casino boats,'' Brown
said. ``I know it creates some jobs, but I'm not sure whether it
would cause more problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A lottery for education may be a more palatable form of gambling
for Christian conservatives who quote biblical passages in their
opposition to legal wagering. ``People do not perceive the lottery
like they perceive video poker or casino gambling,'' said Whit
Ayres, a Republican pollster who worked for Beasley. ``In the first
place, the lottery is run by the state. Second, a lot of people
don't see it as gambling. . . . One-third of religious
conservatives wanted a lottery.'' South Carolina residents account
for an estimated 5.5 percent of total sales in the Georgia Lottery
_ the highest out-of-state percentage. In the fall, the top Georgia
Lottery retailer was Dad's Restaurant No. 2 in Lavonia near the
Georgia-South Carolina border.

   MILAN, Italy _ Nothing, it seems _ not an NBA lockout nor
thwarted balloon expeditions _ can dampen designers' enthusiasm for
athletic inspirations. As it turns out, it is not outer space that
will define the start of the new millennium in fashion, but sports,
those pastimes and professions that supply iconography and
innocence at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Designers gazing into the future are inspired by the details and
functionality of clothing for snowboarding, skiing, motorbike
racing and fitness generally. What is clear from the men's wear
shows for fall 1999, which began here last Friday and continue
through Wednesday, is that in sports, designers have found a deep
well of ideas for the turn of the century. The sports element in
fashion promises to be much more than a yearlong trend; no doubt
fashion in the year 2000 will also be full of references to it.
</P>
<P>
   In Jil Sander's luxurious casual collection, the spirit of
sports was one subtly suggestive element, like a dabble of paint in
a Jackson Pollock painting. By contrast, John Bartlett's references
in his designs for Byblos were as obvious as the padded vests he
paired with side-zip pants. The sports theme was picked up with
bravado by Donatella Versace for Gianni Versace in flamboyant ski
pants with furry and feathered trim bursting from the seams.
</P>
<P>
   Was it well-placed confidence or blind fear that drove Ms.
Versace to put her clothes on the same stage as Iggy Pop? It is
enough to say that an oxygen-sucking performance by the phenomenal
Iggy Pop (the inspiration for the glam-rock character in ``Velvet
Goldmine'' played by Ewan McGregor, who was in the audience here)
did not eclipse her work. In a sense, the house of Versace has
always done glam.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Versace confidently merged touches of glamour in T-shirts in
chain mail and relaxed trousers with side zippers near the ankle.
Monster coats of leather trimmed with huge collars of fox or wolf
were thrown over slim suits. Gothic letters spelled out the house
of Versace's signature on leather pieces and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   As styled by William Mullen, a freelance stylist and
contributing editor to Interview magazine, this was casual glamour,
displaying the humor and nonchalance necessary to make such clothes
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Gianni Versace said he felt a strong urge to move
beyond music to sports. His sister, who succeeded him after he was
slain in Miami Beach, has paired the two, making the combination
appear the most natural of fusions.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said he is fascinated by snowboarding culture and the
design details of snowboarding clothes. The sport's burly
masculinity, which is Bartlett's forte, found expression in ample
sport jackets and trousers in white or herringbone cut with the
fullness of snowboarding pants. Frissons of fluorescent color
outlining zippers or flashing like beacons through a fog of gray
trousers and jackets gave the energy of 'board clothing to high
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The same energy was at full throttle in Alessandro Dell'Acqua's
collection, one of his best. Casting aside the cerebral musings
that have sometimes led him astray, Dell'Acqua made a convincing
case for blazing yellows and reds in peel-off sweaters layered one
upon another. This smart, passionate sportswear was balanced with
sober trousers in black or a bird's-eye print, cut loose and long
with zippers at the hem.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum of athleticism derives partly from designers'
desire to imbue softness and comfort _ two culturally feminine
qualities _ with a veneer of masculinity. For all the progress of
women toward athletic parity, sports are still essentially a man's
game. For designers, it is easy to talk about sensuality and luxury
in men's wear when the fundamental inspiration is sports. It lends
credibility to Vivienne Westwood's knit sets and dresses for men _
yes, for men _ that one of her models, a Briton, Chris Eubanks, is
a boxer, engaging in the most brutal of modern sports. In keeping
with her new consideration of actually selling clothes (as opposed
to merely making a stir), Ms. Westwood, who is to open her first
American store in SoHo in Manhattan in the spring, showed an
accessible collection, with suits in velveteen or wool chalk
stripes, and beaded sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sander seems to understand better than anybody the synergy
between men's designer clothes and athletics. ``It's function,''
she said. Tiny zippers, hidden at the hem of trousers paired with a
slick black hooded pullover, spoke of the rich simplicity the
designer is after. Orange pants burst from beneath a stark camel
coat, a mix of the rebel and the orthodox present on many runways
in Milan. White trousers for men were also ubiquitous, another
attempt by designers to push men forward, but not too far.
</P>
<P>
   Austere as they are, Ms. Sander's designs are often more than
the sum of their parts. This element was missing from the attempt
by the Richard Edwards design team to bring depth to bare-bones
fashion. Adding motocross quilting to jackets and trousers and
molding appealing sweatshirts from tactile wools like alpaca and
mohair were some of the nicer ideas of the team, Richard Bengstrom
and Edward Pavlick. But their own voices were lost somewhere;
instead, there was a preciousness to these street-inspired clothes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Dirk Bikkembergs' presentation in a museum of
science and technology was highly personal. Amid the ammunition
exhibits, the Bikkembergs show began with burly ribbed turtlenecks
in olive and cadet-style shirt and tie combinations, segueing
neatly into nylon ski pants with matching high-neck pullovers.
Bursting from the neckline of one of the pullovers was a furry ring
that lent a splendid glamour to such a utilitarian garment.
</P>
<P>
   A bit startlingly _ for no one is really ready to face the next
year so soon _ Bikkembergs called his collection ``2000,'' which it
is, in European fashion parlance: fall-winter 2000. As designers
weigh the coming of the new millennium and are unconsciously
swayed, it is evident that they are considering what a
new-millennium collection will look like.
</P>
<P>
   For many it includes something of the old and something
futuristic _ the classic with the ultramodern sport fabric, as
exemplified by the combination of fur skin with industrial nylon
that Tom Ford utilized for Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion is a greedy animal, and so it asked more of Ford than
the few, albeit interesting, style mixes he chose to give. An
evolution of one trendsetting Gucci look from last season, the
velvet jacket, was given the rich patina of garnets, rubies or
sapphires. Ford threw the jackets over white T-shirts, as he did
almost everything, and paired them with magnificent jeweled jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as a counterweight to the collection's whimsy were sober
militaristic jackets, coats and trousers with red piping, all a bit
too literal. (Only a policeman's plumed helmet was missing.) By his
own count, Ford showed 19 pairs of decorated jeans, and he called
the display a deliberate overstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Should Ford be excused for coasting? No, he shouldn't. Still,
having set the trends for several seasons to come, he can afford
to.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many propositions that Ford made more than a year ago
(and that have been picked up by other designers) is fur for men.
Ford now uses it in vests and in mottled calfskin and goatskin
coats.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Paul Gaultier, too, played up the sporty element of fur,
cutting sheared furs into sweatshirts and sweaters. Layering on old
hits of his, like a champagne body stocking and his signature
wide-lapel jacket, Gaultier turned a new hand to painted jeans,
silky nylon sweatshirts, knee-length trousers with motocross knee
padding and sequined sweaters. The message is clear: fur this time
cannot be taken too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana got the trend right, making
baggy flannel trousers with deep fur cuffs. But they went
dreadfully wrong with pants made entirely of fur. It looked
awkward, and it's been done.
</P>
<P>
   The theme for Dolce and Gabbana this season was fishermen and
children, and except for the fur pants, they told the story well.
They returned to the shrunken sweaters and beaded floral knitwear
they have done before, freshening them with tooled leather jackets
and vests, gently tailored Angora coats and full trousers.
</P>
<P>
   For Naoki Takizawa, designer of the men's collection at Issey
Miyake, the elements of old and new were represented in wonderful
suits and coats to which he had applied a series of creases
resembling the folds in origami. To see this kind of innovative
application is to observe a design intellect at work. That the
postscript to such originality was the most pedestrian ski jacket
proves, unfortunately, that every designer at some point gets swept
along by a trend.

 &HT;    Barnes ready to get to business after inauguration
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The pomp and circumstance of Gov. Roy Barnes' new
administration gave way to the day-to-day challenge of crafting the
``new Georgia'' he proposes to lead into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, the Democrat who became Georgia's 80th governor in front
of a crowd of about 4,000 who braved crisp 40-degree weather, is
expected to waste little time pressing his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of his transportation package that would create a
regional authority to help relieve metro Atlanta's traffic gridlock
could be introduced in the state legislature within the next two
weeks. And he'll make his case for an increase in homestead
exemption as part of a budget proposal unveiled to lawmakers on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Barnes eschewed details to outline a broader
vision of where he believes Georgia could be, propelled by
diversity and education, and of how far the state has come since
the last time a century dawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, let us celebrate a new Georgia,'' the 50-year-old
Democrat challenged from the outdoor stage set up in front of a
banner-draped Capitol. ``Together, we lift up the weak and weigh
down the wicked, we reduce illiteracy and reform health care, cut
taxes and improve services.''
</P>
<P>
   After placing his left hand on his worn, red-leather Bible and
taking the oath of office from Chief Justice Robert Benham _ a
classmate at the then-recently integrated University of Georgia _
Barnes used his 13-minute address to try to knit the state together
after an election year of racially charged campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor called on ``those who once sought to divide us
to work with us,'' and warned ``those who play with the fire of
racial hatred . . . they will surely be burned.'' Returning to his
campaign promises, Barnes pledged to make education a top priority
and not allow a scenario in which ``the ringing of gunshots drowns
out the ring of the school bell.''
</P>
<P>
   A 22-year legislative veteran and long-time student of state
government, Barnes harkened back to the changes since a governor
last took office at the turn of a century, a time when few
Georgians completed elementary school and half the state's
residents were denied the right to vote because of their skin
color.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia must again take mighty steps to tackle the new threats _
such as air pollution and problems in health care delivery _ that
are on the horizon, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating the speech, Michael Binford, a Georgia State
University political scientist, said: ``There's a lot of symbols, a
lot of hope for the future, but there's not a lot of specifics he
can be pinned down on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor, who followed Barnes in taking the oath of
office, was more specific as he paid homage to his south Georgia
roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there are counties in the state that have been left
behind economically,'' Taylor said. ``For the growing, prosperous,
most developed part of the state to be indifferent to those
counties . . . is not smart, it's not right, and it's not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, Barnes provoked comparisons to departing Gov. Zell
Miller, who shared the inaugural stage along with six other former
governors but uttered only a few scripted words as he turned over
the state seal. Missing from Barnes' address were the mountain
metaphors and crisp images political observers had come to expect
from the man who leaves office after two terms as perhaps the
state's most popular chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The open-air ceremony to transfer power, a tradition in Georgia,
also marked the start of the 40-day General Assembly session, a
period often fraught with partisan fighting and political
turbulence. But regardless of party, most legislators found little
over which to disagree with the new governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything to quibble about,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Eric Johnson (R-Savannah). ``Republicans at this
point are very comfortable with Roy Barnes.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, opening day held few surprises, with the House
installing Tom Murphy for his 13th term as speaker, which the
74-year-old Bremen Democrat has hinted may be his last. Murphy is
the nation's longest-serving state House speaker. Barnes and
Taylor, who won election in part on the strength of the black vote,
fittingly started their first day in office at an ecumenical
service in a predominantly black church in southwest Atlanta.
There, ministers from at least four faiths called Barnes ``our
dream-keeper'' and likened him to Moses, leading the Israelites out
of bondage in Egypt. But they warned of the fickleness of the
electorate and the news media at the first sign of hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only a handspan between a pat on your back and a kick
on your duff,'' the Rev. Gerald Durley, pastor of Providence
Missionary Baptist Church warned. ``Never forget the handspan,
governor.''

PARCELLS HAS MORE TRICKS IN RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. &UR;  &LR; _ It wasn't Keyshawn's receptions and it wasn't
Keyshawn's end-around plays. It wasn't even the sight of Keyshawn
sticking his loquacious head into a scrum and coming up with a
loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Keyshawn Johnson sighting that sticks the longest from
the Jets' playoff victory Sunday is his plucking the last
desperation pass by Jacksonville as a member of the Jets' defensive
backfield.
</P>
<P>
   This is when football gets really good, when the coach sends out
his best athlete, his stud, his dude, to take a walk on the wild
side.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Jets were up by an insurmountable 10 points in
the final seconds, it was still a galvanizing vision when the Jets'
wide receiver dashed toward the ball, elevated himself and came
down with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just put him in there for his height,'' said Bill Parcells,
the Jets' coach. ``It's just like in basketball, where you put your
tallest guy under the basket for the rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, football is nothing like basketball. Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar could dribble the ball, if needed, and Magic Johnson
could play point guard or center from one play to the next, and
Michael Jordan is the best defensive player of his time as well as
the best offensive player.
</P>
<P>
   Football is so compartmentalized, so specialized, that players
are either offensive or defensive. They wear green jerseys in
practice or they wear white, and on Sunday they wear the same
uniforms but huddle in separate units on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   It is great fun to see turnovers, when players undergo instant
role reversal. Vinny Testaverde, the quarterback, the one player
who is not supposed to be roughed up in midweek practices, deserves
to take a ritual training meal with the macho linebackers for the
way he pursued a Jaguar running with a recovered fumble on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The player made a dumb mistake _ overtrained football players
are not universally good at improvisation _ and coughed up the
ball, and Keyshawn recovered it. It makes you want to bring back
the old days of one-platoon football, when footballers were
footballers.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, somebody breaks the mold, usually a defensive
back like Deion Sanders or Rod Woodson at receiver, or a
quarterback like Randall Cunningham or Kordell Stewart given
license to run with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The most imaginative coaching move in the past generation was
when Mike Ditka of the Bears recognized that the gigantic defensive
tackle, William Perry, would be difficult to haul down with the
ball in his hand. Football hasn't been the same since that rogue
whale went out of style.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is more imaginative than the average coach. He insisted
that his use of Keyshawn on defense was no ad-hoc,
let's-do-the-play-right-here-in-the-garage stratagem, sending in
the tall guy because he was having an enchanted afternoon. Nor was
it a belligerent response to the sloppiness that allowed a Jaguars
touchdown on the final heave of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw, at the end of the first half, we were thinking they might
go for a field goal,'' Parcells said. ``But at the end of the game,
we wanted another defensive back. We've been working on that for at
least six weeks. You've got to run the play in practice, so
everybody will know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why they herd reporters into dismal press rooms rather
than let us watch practice. Who knows? By accident, one of us might
observe something.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty going on behind that dyspeptic stare of
Parcells. He always seems to have a running back like Dave Meggett
who can throw a pass, or a receiver like Johnson who can run with
the ball. Parcells often gambles on fourth down, and is still
remembered in New England for a failed pass off a fake punt
(against Denver, as a matter of fact).
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when the Patriots beat the Jaguars for the
conference championship on Jan. 12, 1997, one successful play had
been practiced for four years without ever being used.
</P>
<P>
   Attention to detail has helped Parcells become the first head
coach to take three different teams to conference championship
games. On Sunday, as he drove home to South Jersey, Parcells was
already working out this week's practice schedule, and where he
would deploy all his players on the extra-wide jet he had requested
for a road playoff game, many, many weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells likes to think up new variations on old themes, but he
doesn't necessarily want to use them because that probably means
the Jets are behind. Having exposed Keyshawn the runner several
times this year, he has now exposed Keyshawn the defender. Parcells
allowed Monday that, yes, there could be more surprises where those
came from.

PATTERNS: OUT FROM VERSACE'S SHADOW; GUCCI BUZZWORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ In time, Antonio D'Amico, who on Monday night
introduced his first signature collection, will be known simply as
a designer. But for now he must bear the weight of being known
primarily as Gianni Versace's companion of 14 years, even though
for 13 of them he worked at Versace SpA. Most recently he was
designer of Istante and Versus Sport.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John, who was the closest of Versace's celebrity friends,
flew to Milan to attend D'Amico's show. He came to support him,
``because he's my friend and he's been through hell in the last two
years,'' John said, adding, ``I think you should show support for
people when they are trying to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion shows can be like family weddings, with keen observation
paid to who attends and who does not. On Saturday, John missed the
Versace presentation by Donatella Versace. The singer, who attended
Ms. Versace's first solo show following the death of her brother
Gianni in August 1997, immediately tried to dispel the rumors that
there was a rift between him and the Versace family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no war,'' he said. ``I was in LA and just couldn't
deal with the Versace show on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico's partner in his new business is Massimo Lotti, a former
designer at Jean-Charles de Castalbajac, a French fashion company.
D'Amico, whose theatrical show was lavish even by European
standards, said that he did receive money upon Versace's death, but
that it was not financing his venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did get money,'' he said. ``Gianni was very generous. But
I'm not using it. I'm using my own money that I saved to start the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually ambitious move, D'Amico introduced men's wear
and women's wear simultaneously. Prices range from about $200 to
$400 for knitwear and $600 to $1,500 for suits. Spacewear, his
less-expensive line, includes jeans and T-shirts. The lines will be
made in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico, who will be 40 on Jan. 21, feels he has an angel on his
shoulder. Versace, he said, told him to open his own company.
Still, the call from beyond was not enough to lure Santo Versace,
the late designer's brother and the chairman of Versace, nor Ms.
Versace, to the debut of D'Amico.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ms. Versace said she had to leave for Paris on
Monday morning to prepare for her couture presentation there this
month.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico said that his relations with the Versaces remain good,
``but things have changed.'' He departed the house a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay,'' he added. ``But after Gianni's death I
couldn't find any solace there. It was difficult to be there.
Everything was so painful.''
</P>
<P>
   In a postscript, there was no Istante show this season. Versace
S.p.A. will close the diffusion line, Santo Versace said. Versace
officials would not give further comment. Bloomingdale's is among
the American stores that carry the line.
</P>
<P>
   GUCCI BUZZWORD: TAKEOVER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gucci is at the center of discussions once again in Milan, and
not just for what Tom Ford, its designer, has put on the runway.
Just six months ago, the fashion world in Milan was on the edge of
its seat during show week, awaiting news on a possible Gucci
takeover by Prada. That never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city is abuzz again, and this time it is Bernard
Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moeet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, who
holds the cards. Fashion insiders were surprised by the news last
week that LVMH had raised its holdings of Gucci shares to more than
5 percent. LVMH officials are expected to say more this week.
</P>
<P>
   But even as a potential corporate suitor is apparently fixed on
Gucci, Gucci itself has been doing a little shopping around. The
company is looking for some possible takeover targets in the luxury
goods sector, said one knowledgeable executive of Gucci.

<P>
   Where some see an empty closet, second bedroom, or garage
apartment, others see a home office.
</P>
<P>
   But today's home work spaces don't have to be rooms dedicated to
computers, files and fax machines.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on needs and workloads, a ``home office'' can be
anything from an elaborate L-shaped desk to a rollaway computer
cart, or even a hide-the-goods armoire.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 million of us doing at least some of our work at home,
and increasing tax incentives for setting up space exclusively
devoted to business, homeowners are seeking creative solutions to
fashioning home offices.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to start with the fundamental question: Where?
</P>
<P>
   Will the office dominate an entire room? Or will you make do
with a small wall panel in the den or family room?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you have no space at all to set up a computer desk full
time.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant and author Candace Ord Manroe, who wrote ``The Home
Office'' (Reader's Digest, 1997, $23), says once you evaluate your
needs and have a clear idea of what you want, a space can always be
found. She's designed offices that have been tucked under
stairwells, in closets, attics and former pantries.
</P>
<P>
   Components exist to fit just about every need for a home office,
which at a minimum often means a personal computer, monitor, and a
printer/fax machine. The typical workstation has a hutch, a place
for a computer monitor, a pullout printer stand, a work surface,
file drawers and little nooks for paper.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms that have an open 7-by-7-foot corner can accommodate
elaborate L-shaped centers of that size, with plenty of room for
accessories like a printer table.
</P>
<P>
   ``The L-shaped and U-shaped desks are becoming more popular due
to space. The traditional executive type set up is just not
functional for the home,'' says Christina Erridge, public relations
manager of Staples Inc., the office-supply chain based near Boston.
``And people want more of a choice in fabrics, cabinet facings,
wood finishings. Not just the typical metal filing cabinets.
Something that complements their home and doesn't stick out.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, nearly 50 percent of homes will have some form of home
office, Erridge says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tremendous growth. A lot of homes are now being built
with an office in mind,'' she says. ``Home offices are growing four
times as fast as any other kind of business, which is great for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary 30-by-60-inch computer desks and workstations can
fit into rooms where just one wall is available. For a standard
desk you would need a 6-foot wall space.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for L-shape centers can range from $199 to $800, while
desks and one-wall workstations are from $99 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   Most office furniture is made of laminated wood, and requires
assembly. If you'd rather someone else handle the screwdriver and
bolts, expect to pay an additional fee ranging from $35 to $125,
depending on the size of the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Desks and workstations are available in more than just
dark-stained wood, although that's still most common. Homeowners
can order hues from whitewash to cherry to match their decor.
</P>
<P>
   Armoires have become the fastest selling home-office components
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Like entertainment centers, armoires allow owners to ``hide''
their computer behind closed doors when not in use. The armoire
then blends in with other furniture in the room, so the ``office''
literally closes up at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   If space is tight, the all-inclusive computer cart may be the
answer. Since it's on wheels, the computer can be rolled out for
work, then stashed away in a closet when done.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting into a space just 42-inches wide, the cart has space for
a computer, keyboard, monitor, printer and copy holder. It's a
popular option for a bedroom office.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for carts range from about $39 to $200, with a variety in
the $100 range. A matching hutch would cost about $50 more.
</P>
<P>
   Armoires and carts make even more sense these days as increasing
technology continues to shrink hardware. When home offices require
printers, copiers and fax machines, some companies have responded
with the ``all in one'' machine.
</P>
<P>
   These space savers combine a fax machine, printer, scanner,
copier, answering machine and telephone in a unit the size of a
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Himowitz, who writes about his techno-addiction in
Fortune magazine, says his home office was greatly simplified by
the Concerto Switchboard, a $495 gadget from Centrepoint
Technologies that gives a home office the equivalent of a ``fancy
corporate phone system.'' It routes, screens or transfers calls,
coordinates the phone, fax and PC, and can even play music or
prerecorded messages while customers are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Since one of the big advantages of home offices is comfort, make
sure furnishings provide ergonomic support.
</P>
<P>
   Use chairs that raise and lower pneumatically to match keyboard
height. Prices range from $20 for simple models to $400 for leather
desk chairs.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget inexpensive copy holders, mouse pads, wrist
pads, cord ducts or cable guides for hiding cords from view and
preventing tangling.
</P>
<P>
   Other items to consider are power strips with plug-ins for all
electronic equipment and a master switch to turn everything off at
once. They run about $50, with surge protectors built in.
</P>
<P>
   Functional desk lamps needn't be elaborate or expensive ($9 to
$60). Reading lamps with soft-white bulbs work well, regardless of
whether they're floor or desk models.

SHIFT GEARS...NOW!

<P>
   Barry Wine graduated from Tufts University in the mid-'60s with
a degree in science. The following year he entered the University
of Chicago Law School. His academic success landed him a job with a
prestigious Wall Street firm; his future seemed set.
</P>
<P>
   Within a short time, Wine decided he would be happier pursuing a
simpler lifestyle. He and his wife moved to a small town near
Manhattan and he hung out his shingle.
</P>
<P>
   His love and study of nouvelle French cuisine prompted him to
fulfill a romantic dream. He opened The Quilted Giraffe, a pricey,
25-seat restaurant. One night, when the chef didn't make it to
work, Wine stepped into the kitchen. He has never practiced law
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I knew we wouldn't starve,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Quilted Giraffe has earned a four-star rating, more than
tripled in size, became world famous and provided a glamorous,
time-consuming career, Wine said.
</P>
<P>
   The story reads like an endorsement for the best selling
inspirational career guide, ``Do What You Love, The Money Will
Follow'' by Marsha Sinetar, California organizational psychologist
and author of the new book ``The Mentor's Spirit'' (St. Martin's
Press, $16.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are successful and fulfilled tend to be doing the
work they are suited for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But surveys show that, at best, only 25 percent of the work
force are clearly happy with their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, don't be discouraged if you haven't found your
niche.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lore, a Maryland resident and author of ``The
Pathfinder: How to Choose or Change Your Career for a Lifetime of
Satisfaction and Success'' ( Fireside/Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998, $14.)
said it frequently takes three jobs until the right career match is
found.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Musgrove, an Ohio licensed professional counselor for 30
years identifies two midlife points at which many people rethink
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between the ages of 28 to 32, those who feel that what they
are doing isn't right for them begin to realize that time is
ticking.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the mid-40s to early 50s, dissatisfied individuals address
the important questions of life with respect to their career and
overall contentment.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Sinetar says that the only way people, regardless
of age, can achieve personal harmony is to use their natural
talents, contribute to others, continue to grow and work in a way
that fits their personality, needs and desires.
</P>
<P>
   Changing to meet those criteria is no an easy task. There is no
guarantee of success. ``But if you want a guarantee, buy a
toaster,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Work feels good in any setting when the right match is made
between a persson's talents and the job requirements, experts
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Ives, a graduate of New York University School of
Physical Education, loves going to work every day - at Ives and
Associates, her 19-year-old based executive search firm in
Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am definitely where I should have been all along. Business
keeps my mental juices flowing. I have taken some of my teaching
skills and applied them to a sales environment.''
</P>
<P>
   And she's financially successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a zoo, you want to have lions,'' Lore said. ``If
you have a business, you want to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much money you earn, however, it isn't worth it if
you don't find fulfillment career coaches say.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Arnold, 29, was on the fast track to financial success
before he left a sports marketing firm in Washington D.C. A few
years ago, he abandoned his goal of a master's in business
administration from a top school and decided to follow his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that the salary was something competitive for me. I
did it to tell people I could earn six figures. Now I use that same
ambition for getting acting roles,'' said Arnold will appear in two
consecutive parts of the NBC show ``Homicide: Life on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lore's vernacular, what Arnold did was look into his personal
tool box of possibilities. Arnold decided that an acting career was
not a pipe dream, determined what he would have to do to get it
started and began to make the possibility a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think that chasing your personal star necessitates giving
up all convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Moskowitz, a Cleveland, Ohio psychotherapist and
artist, is represented by numerous galleries, has had shows in
several states and sells many of his works. He chose to piggy-back
his painting career on top of his medical profession when the
limits of managed care frustrated and diminished his satisfaction
in psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an extreme fantasy of moving to Santa Fe and living
above a studio gallery and seeing a few patients in
psychotherapy,'' he said. ``I call it an extreme fantasy because it
was partially rooted in fear. I was afraid I couldn't make enough
money to maintain the life my wife and kids were used to and that I
would be forced to cater to public tastes. That wouldn't be as
gratifying.''

</P>
<P>
   SIDE BAR: HOW TO BEGIN?
</P>
<P>
   Lore offers these suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   1) Change from wishful thinking to committed action.
</P>
<P>
   2) Revise your basis for making decisions to include more
current observations.
</P>
<P>
   3) Do not procrastinate by finding excuses not to act.
</P>
<P>
   4) Don't expect someone else to make this important decision for
you.
</P>
<P>
   5) Set new goals.
</P>
<P>
   6) Be excited by the prospect of not fully knowing the outcome
of your exploration.
</P>
<P>
   7) Design your future career in terms of your temperament,
personality, passions, natural talents and mission.
</P>
<P>
   8) Don't be entirely a dreamer or someone who is too grounded to
take a step.
</P>
<P>
   Be a little of both, Lore advises, then ask yourself, What have
you not even imagined that could give your life more satisfaction
and pleasure and fill your goals.?
</P>
<P>
   What is your answer?_ R.R.

GIANTS TO PLACE WOOTEN AND GRAY IN EXPANSION DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, every National Football League team _ except the
four still in the Super Bowl playoffs _ must submit the names of
five players who will be available for next month's expansion draft
to stock the roster of the 1999 Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   The league has said it will make the names of the 130 players
public by Friday, but Giants officials who spoke on the condition
of anonymity said that starting free safety Tito Wooten and nickel
cornerback Carlton Gray were expected to be among the five listed
by the team. The Giants seem eager to part with Wooten.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected to be on the Giants' list was little-used
cornerback Kory Blackwell. Team officials said in meetings last
week that the team considered placing the starting defensive
tackle. Robert Harris. and a reserve safety, Brandon Sanders, on
the list of five. But Harris apparently escaped the list.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion draft is Feb. 9. The four teams still in the
post-season have been granted extensions and do not have to
identify their five players until after their seasons have ended.
No team can lose more than two players in the draft, and once a
team has had a player selected by Cleveland, that team can withdraw
two others from its list of five.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten, Gray and Harris are each scheduled to make in excess of
$2 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   If a team is considering cutting a high-salaried player, as the
Giants are with Wooten, there is a salary cap advantage to having
him selected by the Browns since the majority of his contract is
removed from his former team's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Wooten's poor play and conditioning lapses last season irked
teammates. It is unlikely that the Browns will take him, both
because of Wooten's declining level of play and his off-the-field
problems in previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Browns are required to use 38 percent of their 1999
salary cap _ estimated to be in the $60 million range _ on players
they select in the expansion draft. So Cleveland will have to take
some high- or medium-priced NFL veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, signed off waivers at the start of the 1998 season, is one
of four starting or former starting cornerbacks under contract to
the Giants. The others are Phillippi Sparks, Jason Sehorn and
Conrad Hamilton. Hamilton is a restricted free agent whom the
Giants expect to retain even if it means matching most any offer he
receives.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, it seems Gray is the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has said he does not want to remain with the Giants unless
given a chance to start, but that may not be possible given the
logjam at cornerback. The Giants have said in the past that they
will try to trade Gray if he isn't happy.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, one of the stars of the division-winning 1997 Giants,
had an injury-prone year. His value also dropped with the improving
play of his backup, Christian Peter. The Giants think that Peter
has improved enough to start.
</P>
<P>
   Another Giant in the spotlight this off season will be
linebacker Marcus Buckley, who was ineffective against the run this
season as the team's new strongside linebacker. Ryan Phillips may
take over that job anyway, or the Giants may have to sign a veteran
run-stopping linebacker to play on first down for Buckley, who is
more suited to pass coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Coach Jim Fassel interviewed Tony Wise, the former
Chicago Bears and Dallas Cowboys line coach, for the team's vacant
offensive line coach's job. Wise is the Giants' first choice for
the job filled by John Matsko the last two seasons. Matsko was
dismissed by Fassel last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' other top candidate is Jim McNally, the former
Carolina Panthers line coach. &QL;

SUPPLEMENT OF WONDER
</HEADLINE>
  By KEN MCALPINE 
 c.1999 Ken McAlpine

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is the short list of facts about creatine, the athletic
supplement:
</P>
<P>
   It works.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from talk show hosts to the salesman at your local
health food store is spouting off about the stuff (``Sure, take the
whole jar. That's why they make them big.'').
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kreide, associate professor at the University of
Memphis, is one of the country's foremost experts on creatine,
having conducted creatine supplementation studies of his own and
reviewed dozens of others. Equally important, Kreider was an
athlete before he was a scientist. ``Athletes should know the
facts,'' he said. ``Anyone who is thinking about taking creatine
should know what it is, what it does and what it doesn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   And so:
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is an amino acid, one of the twenty naturally occurring
amino acids that form protein molecules. Your body manufactures
creatine in the liver, pancreas and kidneys. Most people produce a
gram or two a day, about half your daily needs. By eating high
protein sources, you can get the rest through diet (a pound of beef
contains two grams of creatine; ditto for a pound of salmon).
</P>
<P>
   Protein's main job is to construct and repair tissue, so it's
not hard to see why protein comes in handy in exercise and sport,
activities that basically tear your muscles down and then rely on
you to repair them.
</P>
<P>
   But why, with a bunch of other amino acids involved in the job,
is creatine so important? As your body makes creatine, or as you
ingest it as food or a supplement, it's whisked through the blood
stream to your muscles, where it's converted to phosphocreatine, is
an important store of energy in the muscle cells.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine supplementation doesn't build muscle and power
directly. What it does is boost phosphocreatine levels in your
muscle cells. That allows you to work out more intensely. And that
translates to all of creatine's proven benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased one-rep maximum lifting strength, improved vertical
jump performance, enhanced sprint performance in sprints lasting
six to thirty seconds, improved high-intensity performance in
events lasting ninety to three hundred seconds, an increase in the
total amount of exercise performed, increased total body mass and
an increase in fat-free mass,'' says Kreider. ``The science is
virtually indisputable.''
</P>
<P>
   In layman's terms, bigger, stronger, faster.
</P>
<P>
   And the effects can be dramatic. Research has shown that
creatine supplementation can increase strength from 5 to 15
percent. In studies, short-term supplementation, as little as a
week, added roughly a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of muscle to some
athletes' frames. Longer studies, two to twenty weeks of
supplementation, showed muscle gains as high as 5.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is no scientific evidence to suggest any
concern,'' says Kreider. ``To date the only side effect reported
from clinical studies on athletes, untrained people and hospital
patients is weight gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreider isn't the only one to give creatine a blemish-free bill
of health to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be irresponsible of me as a scientist to say that
there's absolutely nothing that could go wrong if you use creatine
supplements,'' says David Pearson, an exercise physiologist at Ball
State University in Indiana. ``But personally I have very little
concern about our athletes using them in controlled doses. Creatine
is a naturally occurring substance in food. If you were eating meat
you'd be getting creatine anyway. ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if recreational athletes -- the weekend basketball player
who wants to recover faster, the 40-year-old weightlifter who
wouldn't mind a bit more muscle - could benefit from creatine,
Kreider gives them the green light, as long as they use the
supplement in a reasoned dose.
</P>
<P>
   But Pearson disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real benefits of creatine come from very, very intense
training,'' says Pearson. ``If you're just a jogger, a cyclist, a
swimmer or a three-day a week weightlifter who is training for
fitness benefit, don't mess with it. There is absolutely no
scientific evidence to support that creatine has a positive effect
on just the person who is working out for fitness reasons only.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson has a broader concern too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think creatine has been portrayed as much more important
than it really is,'' he says. ``Believe me, the changes that we see
with most individuals are less than dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine is not a quick fix for anybody's workout. It's a
supplement that appears to enhance strength and power under very
intense training conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other concerns shared by experts who aren't on a
supplement providers payroll.
</P>
<P>
   First, that those who use creatine don't abuse it. The typical
recommended - and scientifically proven safe -- ``loading'' regimen
for a 160-pound athlete (dosages vary slightly depending on the
athlete's weight) is a 5-gram dose four times a day for 5 to 7
days, then 3-5 grams of creatine each day after that to maintain
the muscles' elevated creatine content.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern, that those who do use creatine don't just go
out and buy the first, or cheapest, stuff they can get their hands
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be blunt,'' says Steven Plisk, director of sports
conditioning at Yale University and a certified strength and
conditioning specialist with the National Strength and Conditioning
Association. ``There's a lot of crap out there. Probably the most
insidious problem on the creatine market right now is the
counterfeit stuff that's coming in, especially from overseas. ''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, though Yale University won't supply creatine to
its athletes, Plisk makes sure he knows where the athletes are
getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the question of the long-term effects of
creatine use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lingering question is, `Is it safe?' and we will certainly
be researching that,'' says Kreider. ``But athletes have been using
creatine as a nutritional supplement for over ten years, and to my
knowledge there have been no serious problems. Certainly, more
long-term studies are needed. But right now there is no evidence
that creatine supplementation results in any adverse effects when
taken in recommended dosages.''
</P>
<P>
   Krieder and Plisk take creatine. Pearson does not.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, you may have already reached this decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to try it, fine,'' says Kreider. ``If you don't
want to try it, fine.''

CLEAR THE AIR WITH LIVING FILTERS
</HEADLINE>
  By TRACEY C. REMBERT 
 c.1999 ``E'' magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To lower stress, many physicians recommend a relaxing hobby like
gardening. But cultivating plants indoors may also lower the risk
of asthma, allergies and ``sick building syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency cites indoor air pollution
as one of the top five public health threats in America, and the
main culprit in the 60 percent rise in asthma over the last decade.
Now researchers are looking to houseplants for a solution to
polluted indoor air.
</P>
<P>
   The energy crisis of the 1970s led many Americans to
superinsulate their homes and offices against energy loss. Man-made
materials like particle board, synthetic fibers and plastic--which
emit harmful formaldehyde, trichloroethylene (TCE), benzene and
other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over years of
exposure--have also become ubiquitous indoors. And while air
filters are adequate at capturing particles like dust and dander,
they do little to eliminate noxious VOCs.
</P>
<P>
   Though debates have raged for over a decade as to just how
effective houseplants are in improving indoor air, studies in
Europe and the U.S. have reported that particular plant species can
lower VOC levels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, NASA senior research scientist Bill Wolverton tested
houseplants for their ability to maintain clean air for future
habitable lunar bases. Testing in sealed chambers, Wolverton found
that philodendrons and golden pothos were excellent formaldehyde
controllers; gerbera daisy and chrysanthemums were impressive
benzene purgers; pot mums and peace lilies were highly rated for
TCE removal.
</P>
<P>
   His initial findings suggested that one to three mature plants
were enough to improve the air in a 100-cubic-foot area. He also
found that it wasn't just plants doing the clean-up work, but the
microbes that were specific to the plants' roots.
</P>
<P>
   Wolverton's personal favorites are the lady palm, peace lily and
``Janet Craig'' dracaena--''because they're easy to grow, resist
insects and work wonders'' for a variety of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   His latest book, ``How to Grow Fresh Air: Fifty Houseplants That
Purify Your Home or Office'' (Penguin Books, $15.95), additionally
lists the areca and bamboo palms, English ivy and rubber plant as
top pollutant controllers.
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers are unconvinced. For years, the EPA'S
Office of Indoor Air Quality has remained skeptical. ``Under a
tightly controlled situation, using plants may have some merit, but
people bring in contaminants when they enter a room,'' said Skip
Boat, who writes the office's newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Axelrad, former director of the EPA Indoor Air Division,
said NASA's studies did little to simulate the air changes of a
typical home or office. ``Our calculations indicate that a much
higher density of plants would be required (hundreds of plants in
the typical house) to achieve these results,'' writes Axelrad.

ENERGY SECRETARY HAS CONCERNS ABOUT UTILITIES, `Y2K BUG' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson has reiterated worries
that some electric utilities are falling behind an industry
timetable to fix the computer software problem known as the ``Y2K
bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the results of a survey released Monday by a trade group,
Richardson said Monday he is generally pleased with the work power
providers are doing to prevent blackouts come Jan. 1, 2000. The
trade group, the North American Electric Reliability Council,
issued a forecast that the date change would have a ``minimal
impact'' on electric systems operations in North America.
</P>
<P>
   But various utilities expect to miss the industry's self-imposed
June 30 deadline for fixing potential problems in their critical
operating systems. Richardson called this ``a matter of significant
concern,'' and added that ``in the Y2K readiness league, our goal
must be to have a 1.000 batting average.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson threatened to cite specific firms unless they
demonstrate progress. ``I applaud industry's intention to apply
peer pressure to advance the programs of those who may be falling
behind,'' Richardson said at a press conference in Washington. ``I
am fully prepared to add my own voice to these efforts if
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Y2K problem'' refers to the trouble that many computers
will have keeping track of the date change at the start of next
year. To avoid blackouts, utilities nationwide are spending
hundreds of millions of dollars to review and upgrade their
systems. Also, because of the importance of the electric system to
the rest of the economy, the utility trade group set several
deadlines meant to guide timetables for Y2K remediation work.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the group reccommended that by June 30 its
members complete reviews of the systems most critical to the
distribution of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, timetables at several local utilities
lag that date. Northeast Utilities, which serves most of western
Massachusetts among other areas, says it doesn't expect to have
finished the all critical reviews until the end of July. Boston
Edison Co. says that upgrades of one software system won't be
completed until mid-July. In response to Richardson's comments,
Boston Edison spokesman Michael Monahan said the company is
``making every effort to expedite'' work on the software system to
meet the June 30 target.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Northeast couldn't be reached for comment late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In its report Monday, the reliability council found that North
American utilities ``are well on their way to being Y2K ready.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen to this point suggests that the rollover to
the Year 2000 will create only a minimal impact on electric system
operations,'' said Michehl Gent, president of the trade group.
``Computer errors found thus far do not appear likely to threaten
electricity supplies to customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Meyer, a spokesman for the U.S. Senate's special committee
on Y2K issues, said members were ``comfortable'' with the report
because it ``shows the industry is making signficant progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line is, are they going to make the deadlines?
The bulk of their work is still ahead of them,'' Meyer said. He was
also concerned, he said, by the report's note that 20 out of 66
nuclear-generation facilities in the country are expected to miss
the remediation deadline. The reported didn't specify those plants.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Unglesbee , a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute,
a Washington trade group, said that the plant schedules still
conformed to a separate set of guidelines from the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. In some cases, Y2K remediation work may be
postponed until scheduled refueling outages, he said.

ADMINISTRATION UNVEILS PLAN TO PRESERVE OPEN SPACE AND COMBAT
SPRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Story includes previously budgeted GORE-POLITICS) 
(sw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost 50 years after new federal highways and the
G.I. Bill made it easier for Americans to move from crowded cities
to leafy suburbs, the Clinton administration is proposing an
ambitious program to combat the modern-day consequences of the
exodus: traffic jams and sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its latest budget request, the administration is
seeking to commit almost $10 billion _ more than $1 billion of it
in new spending _ to local governments and communities for programs
that preserve open space, ease traffic congestion and promote
economic development in a way that some states are calling ``smart
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which the administration calls its Livability
Agenda, draws together and expands programs from more than a dozen
agencies, making it the largest commitment ever by the federal
government to the issue of planned growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In too many places across America, the beauty of local vistas
has been degraded by decades of ill-planned and ill-coordinated
development,'' Vice President Al Gore said on Monday, announcing
the program. ``Plan well, and you have a community that nurtures
commerce and private life. Plan badly, you have what so many of us
suffer from first-hand _ gridlock, sprawl and that uniquely modern
evil of all too little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was careful to explain that the proposal limits the federal
role to encouraging neighboring jurisdictions to solve problems
together. The government's role, he said, ``should never be that of
beauty commissar.''
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials are promoting the proposal as a
bold stroke, bringing together such traditional adversaries as
environmentalists and developers, states like Maryland, Oregon and
New Jersey, as well as many local communities and conservation
groups, have been attacking problems of boundless growth for years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that the problems finally attracted large-scale
federal attention because so many state and local officials have
been trumpeting their efforts and clamoring for federal help. In
last year's election, he said to illustrate the point, more than
200 jurisdictions had growth initiatives on the ballot, ``and most
of them passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Parris Glendening of Maryland, a Democrat and a leading
promoter of ``smart growth'' development, accompanied Gore on
Monday and said in an interview, ``The federal government has been
behind the states on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the most important thing,'' he added, ``is that the
federal government has paused to consider to what extent American
politics has contributed to the sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's announcement on Monday was the first of several he
intends to make this week, highlighting administration budget
requests. As is typical of such proposals, the administration did
not explain how it expects to pay for the new spending. The
Republican Congress regards many administration initiatives as just
a starting point in budget negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that Gore has been chosen to present
issues like sprawl, worker training and Empowerment Zones largely
because he has been the administration's point man on them for six
years. On Tuesday, President Clinton is scheduled to expand upon
the issue of preserving open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcements also put the vice president in a spotlight
for issues his aides say will become major themes of his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single item of new spending in the administration
growth proposal is a five-year $700 million program that will allow
state and local governments to issue no-interest ``Better America
Bonds'' to lenders, who would claim a tax credit for the life of
the bond, rather than receive interest. The money would be used to
preserve parks and open spaces, protect water supplies and develop
abandoned industrial sites for commercial use _ all vital
components to controlled growth.
</P>
<P>
   Gore predicted that the bonds could leverage as much as $10
billion in investment around planned growth areas.
</P>
<P>
   Another component of the proposal is what Gore described as the
largest ever federal budget request for public transportation _
$6.1 billion, a 16 percent increase over last year _ to help pay
for new projects that ease traffic congestion and reduce air
pollution through regional cooperation in fixing roads, expanding
public transportation systems and developing alternative routes.
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposal was generally praised by
environmental groups like the Sierra Club, whose executive
director, Carl Pope, called it ``a good first step,'' toward
reversing 50 years of sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   But business groups, including the National Association of Home
Builders, whose members would seem to be affected by restrictions
on developement, also found something to cheer. Charlie Ruma, the
in-coming president of the home buildings group, said the proposal
would help by clearly defining zoning regulations. But he objected
to the notion that the federal government would be helping
communities buy land to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``States should not be in the business of buying property,''
Ruma said.

FIDELITY TO BEEF UP ADVERTISING ON LESSER-KNOWN FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Chastened by weak sales, Fidelity Investments says it
is inching back into tried-and-true solutions to peddle its mutual
funds. The nation's largest fund firm hopes to overcome a gaping
chasm between its fund returns, among the best in the business, and
fund sales, which have plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging it may be a while before investors return in
force, Fidelity is tweaking its much-watched advertising campaign
to focus on products and homespun investing wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more product advertising,'' Robert C.
Pozen, head of Fidelity's investment business, said Monday.
``You're going to see a shift in the advertising that follows up
with focuses on specific funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The change, already evident in Boston-based Fidelity's
5-month-old television and print advertisements, starring investing
icon Peter Lynch, represents how Fidelity is racing to turn the
tide against a sharp falloff in sales.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the company has performance numbers to sell.
Fidelity stock funds were the top gainers among the industry's 10
largest fund firms last year, according to new figures released
Monday by Kanon Bloch Carre, an investment consulting firm in
Boston. The ranking was calculated according to asset weighting,
which compares large fund firms with each other rather than with
smaller, fleet-footed shops that can more easily produce hot gains
in their first years.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, as Fidelity struggled with high turnover among
portfolio managers and internal chaos, it ranked last out of 10 in
the survey. Since then, Pozen has whipped things into shape,
expanding research units, making it more attractive for portfolio
managers to stay on board, and more rigorously analyzing which
stocks do well and why.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have paid off. According to Kanon Bloch, Fidelity's
US diversified equity funds returned a hefty average 26.07 percent
last year. The Vanguard Group, whose sales of index and other funds
have alarmed other fund firms, ranked third, with an average return
of 20.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the payoff for Fidelity has been only partial. Despite lower
returns, Malvern, Pa.-based Vanguard has trampled Fidelity and
everyone else in sales, vending four times as many funds, or $44
billion worth, as Fidelity over the the first 11 months of last
year, according to Financial Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Fidelity quietly began placing newspaper ads
touting specific funds and their Morningstar ratings, a key selling
point. Previous Fidelity campaigns earlier this decade touted
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in focus comes amid criticism of Fidelity's original,
Lynch-led advertising campaign, whose costars, comedians Don
Rickles and Lily Tomlin, have been lost on some viewers. Fidelity
wants to lend a new generation of lesser-known funds marquee appeal
after well-known funds such as Magellan _ which produced
eye-popping returns under Lynch _ and Contrafund were closed to new
investors for size reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while for people to shift focus from those very
popular brand names to lesser known funds,'' Pozen said, citing,
among others, Dividend Growth, Blue Chip Growth, and Fidelity Fund.
In other words, good performance takes a while to translate into
stronger sales, since investors ruminate over past returns before
buying new funds.
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio managers at Fidelity, which has around $716 billion in
assets under management, pulled off strong gains last year by
piling into the large growth stocks that have hogged most of Wall
Street's returns.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a news release from Oliver, Wyman &AMP; Co. said
Fidelity's former chief risk officer, James Lam, had joined the New
York-based consulting firm as director of a new unit focused on
global risk strategies.

CARL ELLIOTT, 85, CONGRESSMAN FROM ALABAMA
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ala., Miss.)  (ms) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Rep. Carl Elliott, a Democrat from rural Alabama who
sacrificed his political career to the principles of social
justice, died Jan. 9 at his home in Jasper, Ala. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up poor, Elliott took pride in serving as a prime
mover of the National Defense Education Act of 1958, which
supported millions of poor college students, and the Library
Assistance Act, which helped libraries in the poorest regions of
the country. He also pushed for enactment of other Great Society
programs, like Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Shunning racial demagogy, he often found himself casting crucial
votes on social legislation to advance federal initiatives in
education, health and civil rights. But as the forces of
segregation and states' rights, spearheaded by Gov. George Wallace,
came to dominate Alabama politics, they drove him from office in
1964 after eight terms in the House. Elliott came in ninth in an
at-large Democratic primary for eight House seats, a loss seen as a
victory for Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was in poor health and nearly destitute when his service
received a belated tribute in 1990 with the inaugural Profiles in
Courage Award bestowed by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.
The award, named after the president's book, honors public servants
who show unusual courage in defiance of the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was the eldest of nine children growing up on a farm in
Franklin, near Jasper. He worked his way through the University of
Alabama in the 1930s, waiting tables, shoveling coal for a campus
boiler, clipping shrubs and shining shoes.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he practiced law in Jasper until winning a seat
in Congress in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, broad-shouldered and easy-going, he displayed unexpected
skills in calming and coordinating dissident factions. He was one
of the rare Southern politicians who campaigned for Kennedy in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   The following year Speaker Sam Rayburn put him on the powerful
rules committee to shepherd the president's programs. Teaming up
with Sen. Lister Hill, a fellow Alabama Democrat, he managed the
education aid bill in the House and, after more than two decades,
accomplished what had been deemed an impossible mission.
</P>
<P>
   Once ousted by the Wallace camp, he made a run for governor in
1966 but lost to Lurleen Wallace, the governor's first wife. He
tirelessly spoke out against the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch
Society.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign debts forced him to cash in his congressional
pension. Spurned by Alabama's political establishment and using a
wheelchair, he was living on a meager Social Security check when
the Kennedy Library chose to honor him.
</P>
<P>
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., the library foundation's chairman at the time,
noted that Elliott had ``faced intense public scorn, and suffered
personal abuse and eventual political defeat, while achieving
victories for the good of a nation he loved.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Elliott called the award, which came with a
stipend, ``a nice gesture by these folks.'' But he added: ``As far
as I'm concerned, I didn't think much vindication was required. I
saw myself making social change.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jane Hamilton Elliott, died several years ago. Elliott
is survived by two daughters, Lenora E. Cannon of Jasper, and
Martha E. Russell of Jackson, Miss.; two brothers, Ernie O. of
Vina, Ala., and Gober of Florence, Ala.; four sisters, Mable
Carpenter of Tuscumbia, Ala., Jewel Peters and Martha Jean Williams
of Florence, and Willie Mae McKinney of Russellville, Ala.; seven
grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

FREYDA KOPLOW, 91; 1ST FEMALE MASSACHUSETTS BANKING COMMISSIONER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Freyda (Peck) Koplow, Massachusetts' first female
banking commissioner, died in her sleep Sunday at Deaconess Waltham
Hospital. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   As banking commissioner, Mrs. Koplow was the first woman to head
a major department of the executive branch of the state government.
She was appointed by Governor John Volpe in 1967 and reappointed by
Governor Frank Sargent in 1970. She served until 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, she served as a Brookline representative in the
Legislature from 1955 to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   When she took over as state banking commissioner in 1967, she
oversaw 1,800 state banks, credit unions, finance companies, and
collection agencies with combined assets of $13.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   An article in the Feb. 10, 1968, issue of Business Week magazine
described her as a ``soft-spoken, no-nonsense grandmother of six,''
who ``has played her new role with the aplomb of a State Street
banker _ whether conducting a hearing on a proposed merger,
inspecting a site for a new savings bank branch or licensing a
small loan company. With equal imperturbability, she summons top
officers of the state's banks to iron out problems uncovered by her
150 bank examiners.''
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Mrs. Koplow spoke of her devotion to her job:
``I'm not the type who whips up a bowl of batter while scanning the
latest issue of American Banker.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Willimantic, Conn., she graduated from Boston University
in 1930 and earned a master's degree in social research at Simmons
College in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   While raising her children, she was active with the Brookline
chapter of the League of Women's Voters. She made her first
successful run for state representative after her children were off
to college.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, she was appointed by President Ford to a Presidential
Commission on Electronic Funds Transfer that helped to lay the
groundwork for automated teller machines and other forms of
electronic banking.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves three sons, Richard of Lexington, Michael of Woburn,
and Kenneth of Cambridge; three sisters, Edna Sulman of Madison,
Wis., Mildred Robinson of Boca Raton, Fla., and Ruth Swatsburg of
Waterford, Conn; a brother, Albert Peck of Delray Beach, Fla.;
seven grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    Falcons notebook: Brooks to feel the heat
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every coach in Suwanee will be working quadruple
overtime this week, but perhaps Falcons defensive coordinator Rich
Brooks is going to have to apply himself more than ever .
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons (15-2) line up against the Vikings (16-1)
Sunday in Atlanta's first-ever NFC Championship game, the team in
purple will bring the highest-scoring offense in NFL history to the
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can get to (quarterback Randall) Cunningham before he
launches those passes, you've got a chance,'' Brooks said. ''But
even when you get pressure, he's got the mobility to buy time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, people focus on the combination of wide
receivers Cris Carter (78 catches, 1,011 yards, 12 touchdowns) and
rookie Randy Moss (69 catches, 1,313 yards, 17 touchdowns).
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will mix up their secondary coverages as much or
more as they did against San Francisco in last Saturday's 20-18
playoff win.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Moss was not on that team, and they had Bolliver Shagnasty
out there at receiver, you would double Carter all the time but you
can't do that,'' Brooks said. ''Then you expose the rest of your
defense to the running game, and (Andrew) Glover's a pretty fair
tight end, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will be off today, although coaches will work well
into the evening formulating game plans. They will practice
Wednesday and Thursday, likely in Suwanee rather than the Georgia
Dome if the weather warms. After a light practice Friday morning,
the team will depart for Minnesota, as per NFL rules.
</P>
<P>
   Not talking turkey
</P>
<P>
   James Sims, the agent for running back Jamal Anderson, met
Friday with Falcons general manager Harold Richardson to talk again
about extending the fifth-year player's contract, which expires
after next season. No deal is imminent, and little or no progress
is expected the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would describe (the talks) as assessment discussions,
looking at where everything stands,'' Sims said. ''We're going to
let the dust settle.''
</P>
<P>
   No Moss here
</P>
<P>
   Falcon coach Dan Reeves said that in last April's draft he
didn't give a thought to using the team's No. 13 pick in the first
round to select Moss instead of Georgia Tech linebacker Keith
Brooking. The talented player's questionable background made the
decision for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings took Moss with the No. 21 pick.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was never a consideration here,'' Reeves said. ''I felt his
past was such that we couldn't take a chance. He's a guy you pull
for . . . he's done so much for the league. But at the point we
were picking, there was no way we could gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were trying to get people in the stands, and we couldn't
stand the negative publicity that you would get if you take someone
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said cornerback Ronnie Bradford, who did not play
Saturday after suffering a slight shoulder separation Dec. 27
against Miami, could have played, but a decision was made to let
the shoulder continue resting. . . . Reserve safety Devin Bush, who
plays chiefly in the nickel and dime defenses, has a strained
hamstring that is the most serious injury suffered Saturday. He
anticipates practicing Wednesday, however. . . . Fullback Bob
Christian, whose season ended Dec. 13 when he tore ligaments in his
left knee, was supposed to have surgery today, but pushed it back
to early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves cited the play of wide receiver Mathis (five
catches, 71 yards), Anderson (113 yards, two touchdowns on 29
carries), and quarterback Chandler (13 of 19, 169 yards) on offense
for the Falcons' win Saturday over the 49ers. Defensively, he
mentioned linebackers Cornelius Bennett (eight tackles) and Jessie
Tuggle (eight tackles), and strong safety William White (two
tackles, two interceptions). . . . The play of the linebackers was
a reflection of the fact the defensive line did an outstanding job
tying up 49er blockers. . . . Brooks said crowd noise had nothing
to do with the decision to stunt less along the defensive line in
the second half against the 49ers.

BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO WILL BUY ROTHMANS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ British American Tobacco PLC announced
plans Monday to acquire Rothmans International for about $7.5
billion, the biggest but probably not the last cigarette-industry
combination this year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would unite the second- and fourth-largest tobacco
companies in the world and put British American within striking
distance of the Philip Morris Cos. It comes at a time when
cigarette producers, under heavy criticism in the United States,
have been racing to consolidate their worldwide positions.
</P>
<P>
   Through its American subsidiary, Brown &AMP; Williamson, British
American Tobacco owns brands like Lucky Strike, Benson &AMP; Hedges,
Kent and Viceroy. Its cigarettes are also top sellers in China and
other parts of Asia. Rothmans, based in the Netherlands, has little
presence in the United States but has a strong base in Europe and
Africa with relatively expensive brands like Rothmans, Players and
Dunhill.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies together produce about 900 billion cigarettes
a year, or 16 percent of the world's total. Their combined revenue
would be about 10 billion pounds or more than $16 billion, compared
with revenue around $25 billion for Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal would probably accelerate the
consolidation and reorganization in the industry as smaller
companies slip further and further behind the top two competitors.
The RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., whose R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is
the world's third-biggest tobacco concern, has already indicated
that it will try to sell or spin off its international cigarette
business _ possibly in the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger is likely to trigger further global
tobacco-industry consolidation,'' said Martin Feldman, an analyst
with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``Philip Morris is a very
aggressive competitor, and the new No. 2 company will be well
capitalized, have a good management and a very powerful balance
sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothmans is owned by Richemont A.G., a financial holding company
based in Switzerland, and the Rembrandt Group, a South African
investment company. Both of those are effectively controlled by the
Rupert family of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, BAT will issue a mixture of new common and
preferred stock that will give Richemont a 35 percent stake in the
enlarged company _ also to be called British American Tobacco. It
will pay its current shareholders a final dividend of 16 pence and
a special interim dividend of 4 pence on July 1. Rothmans, in turn,
will pay a dividend of 150 million pounds to Richemont and
Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after a year of drastic change. Like all other
tobacco companies active in the United States, British American is
settling class-action suits brought by smokers and state
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the pressure from those suits, the former BAT
Industries spun off its nontobacco businesses, mostly insurance
companies, last year by pooling them with a business owned by the
Zurich Group of Switzerland. British American Tobacco is the
leftover tobacco business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move would strengthen BAT both in terms of its
market position and its financial strength. The strength of
Rothmans lies in premium brands, and its business is outside the
United States. BAT's brands are mostly sold at standard prices, and
the company has heavy exposure in the United States. As a result,
the two companies complement each other.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rothmans comes to the deal with a stronger balance
sheet, which should shore up BAT.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger represents a major step forward in the achievement
of our vision to become the world's leading international tobacco
company,'' British American Chairman Martin Broughton said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were pleased by the announcements, quickly bidding up
shares of British American Tobacco. In New York, the company's
American depository receipts rose $2.6875, or nearly 15 percent, to
$20.625.
</P>
<P>
   Richemont's stock, traded in Switzerland, and Rembrandt's stock,

   Until Monday, many experts had predicted that BAT might try to
acquire RJR Nabisco's international cigarette businesses. RJR has
been under heavy pressure from the investor Carl Icahn to sell its
international operations, and company executives have strongly
indicated their interest in soon doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition announcement makes it much less likely that BAT
will bid for the business. But both Broughton and Johann Rupert,
chief executive of Richemont and chairman of Rembrandt, made it
clear at a news conference in Switzerland that they were interested
in additional acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Broughton and I have spent a lot of time discussing the
enlarged British American Tobacco group's future strategy,'' Rupert
said, adding that the strategy would be ``a mix of organic growth,
investment in new markets and selective acquisitions.''

 &HT;    Enough with happytalk, Dolphins have real problems
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's time to stop whistling past the
aquarium, er, graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Enough, in other words, with the They're Close Theory. That's
nothing more than happytalk, and happytalk is almost always a bunch
of fibs.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins, in current composition, are not close to
winning a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   They're not even close to playing in one.
</P>
<P>
   Not unless you think the matter of finding a game-breaking wide
receiver and _ that's and _ a dangerous running back capable of
consistent production is as simple as stopping by the (free-agent)
market or plucking something off the shelves of the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the aftermath of the Dolphins' 38-3 weekend loss to the
Denver Broncos in the second round of the playoffs, the general
mood over Miami suggests it might be a good idea to place an order
for noisemakers and balloons sometime soon for a South Florida
championship party.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should think first about ordering an offense.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Dolphins, when in possession of the football, are
too often inept.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's offense is mediocre, at best, when measured against the
entire NFL. When measured against playoff teams, it's just plain
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Did you check out the Saturday and Sunday point totals of the
four teams advancing to the upcoming conference championship games?
Minnesota scored 41. Denver hung the 38 on the Dolphins. New York's
Jets went flying for 34. Among the NFL's Final Four, only Atlanta
(20 points) arrived without bags stuffed full of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine that Jimmy Johnson has, in three seasons as head
coach, constructed a Miami defense that is usually very good and
sometimes excellent. But the Dolphins, quite frankly, would be
better off with a mediocre defense coupled with an offense that is
usually very good and sometimes excellent.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new age.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are more about scoring than they're about defense
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Super Bowls. The winning teams in the nine played in
the '90s have averaged 37.3 points per game against a defensive
yield of 19.0 points per game. That's way up from games played in
the previous decade when the average score was 33.4-14.8. And it's
way, way up from the pre-1980s when the average score was
24.3-11.2.
</P>
<P>
   Old CW: The best offense is a good defense.
</P>
<P>
   New CW: The best defense is a good offense.
</P>
<P>
   Miami won't be close to winning an NFL title until it finds a
couple of Johnson's precious ``playmakers'' who actually make those
plays on offense.
</P>
<P>
   It's very nice that the Dolphins _ and this is the umpteenth
acknowledgement _ have improved over each of Johnson's three
seasons. But he has used up the grace period. Miami played five
games this season against three teams _ Denver (twice), New York
(twice) and Atlanta _ still in the Super Bowl chase, and went 1-4.
And the four losses were by a combined 73 points.
</P>
<P>
   Close to excellence?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets won the AFC East crown right there in the Dolphins' own
division. Miami is closer, much closer, to being a Seattle or a
Tennessee than it is to being a New York or a Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Whistle past that.

GROUP TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ High-ranking US and Israeli officials will meet in
Washington Tuesday to begin outlining a higher level of formal
cooperation on the defense and deterrence capabilities of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called joint strategic planning committee was created by
an almost unnoticed provision of the Wye Plantation Agreement,
which was signed at the White House last October. The memorandum of
agreement marks the first time that leaders of both countries have
signed a formal document of cooperation on Israeli security against
weapons of mass destruction. Their signatures are more significant,
officials said, than the more celebrated ``hiccups'' in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Uzi Arad, the foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, outlined the agreement for the new commission
in a talk with foreign policy specialists Monday at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge. The agreement, noting
the threats of biological and nuclear weapons posed by a growing
number of countries, commits the United States and Israel to
achieving two specific goals: enhancing Israel's defense and
deterrent power; and ``upgrading'' military, strategic, and
technical cooperation between the US National Security Council and
the Defense and State departments, and their counterparts in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about to cross the threshold from a partnership to a
virtual strategic alliance,'' Arad said. ``Clearly there is a
desire to move to an elevated stage in our cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The language of the agreement is very far reaching,'' said
Graham Allison, the director of the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs at the Kennedy School, where Arad spoke to a
group of international security specialists. ``This is a major step
in the Israeli relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists questioned the benefits of the cooperation,
suggesting it could entangle the United States in Middle East
conflicts without providing any significant benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But Arad said the agreement was necessary to stop the
proliferation of biological weapons, and Russian sales to Iran of
materials and expertise to make nuclear weapons, which he
characterized as an even greater threat to Mideast security than
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will you deter another Saddam, perhaps better equipped?''
he asked. ``That is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions against Iran, he said, have not stopped the sale of
technology and expertise from Russia. Instead, those sales have
moved underground through different countries, or simply continued
in defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``For commercial reasons, or strategic reasons, it has gotten
deeper,'' Arad said.
</P>
<P>
   A former Mossad official educated in the United States, Arad
defended his country against accusations that it was too nervous
about the threat from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to err on the side of underestimation and denial,'' he
said. In fact, he added, Israel has ignored for too long the
Iranian creation of the Shihad 3 short-range missle and is now
scrambling to improve its defense against a newer threat, the
Shihad 4.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the policy experts at the Belfar Center, which has
for several years cooperated in a so-called ``strategic dialogue''
with Israeli academics, questioned whether the agreement favors
Israel at the expense of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In broad public conversations, its almost embarrassing to
ask,'' Allison said, echoing the comments of several of his
colleagues. ``But it's the right question to ask: What's in it for
the US?''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Arad responded, ``The United States and Israel have a
joint interest in stability in the Middle East. Finding ways and
means to stabilize the Middle East in the face of developing
threats from missile and unconventional weapons in the possession
of rogue governments, we should be as partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The precedent concerned some at Harvard Monday. Other countries,
they said, could claim to be equally threatened by nuclear or
biological weapons and demand similar agreements with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense of being threatened is very genuine,'' Arad replied.
``I don't think there is any country in the world that has the same
kind of animosity and real threat as opposed to imagined threat,
than Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's meeting in Washington, representatives of the
National Security Council, the State Department and the Department
of Defense will plan the agenda for a more formal meeting in the
United States in February. At that time, officials will formulate
specific recommendations for cooperation.

 &HT;    Mourning on the defensive
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When Alonzo Mourning decided to be a strong voice in the
union, he just figured his image could not get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reputation was tainted before I was part of the negotiating
committee,'' Mourning said Monday as he reported to the Heat's
practice facility for the first time in more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned about that. Now that we have a deal,
I have a job to do and I can't control people's feelings about me.
Throughout this whole process, I'm sorry if I stepped on anybody's
toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning stepped on them, and twist his heel into the entire
foot. Nobody had a stronger opinion and nobody made more
controversial comments than Mourning, who already is one of the
least popular players in the league.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody, with the possible exception of union president
Patrick Ewing, was more criticized.
</P>
<P>
   But Mourning isn't worried about the reception he'll receive
from his teammates or the fans. In fact, Mourning isn't convinced
he came out of this long, bitter labor dispute as the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys made me the target,'' he said to a small group of
writers. ``You all talked about me worse than (his teammates and
fans) did. Regardless of what was said and what was talked about,
it didn't stop me from accomplishing that goal to get the best
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning's teammates, specifically Tim Hardaway, questioned his
judgment when he said race was playing a part in the negotiations.
And other Heat, without mentioning Mourning, said a gag order
needed to be imposed on their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew going through this whole process that we weren't going
to be able to please everybody,'' Mourning said. ``Everybody is
entitled to their own opinion, everybody forced their own opinion.
Everybody was saying the guys were getting antsy and there was
dissension developing. That didn't stop the negotiating committee
from doing their job to get the best possible deal for the
masses.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat owner Micky Arison, who was in the room opposite Mourning
during several negotiating sessions, admires Mourning for his
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to give them a lot of credit for being the ones who
were willing to roll up their sleeves and work hard while other
guys sat at home and didn't care,'' Arison said. ``The fact that
certain things were said during a heated session hopefully
everybody will put it behind them and start to play ball because
that's what these guys do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning expects that's what will happen. He has talked with
Keith Askins, the most outspoken among Heat players against the
union, and both players said they respected each other's position.
Askins and Mourning are the Heat's co-captains.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning and Hardaway said everything is forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my colleagues and my teammates can't separate business and
playing basketball, and trying to accomplish a goal together, then
we have a big problem,'' Mourning said. ``And I don't think we'll
have that problem at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Knicks CEO Dave Checketts said he is concerned Ewing's union
commitments the last five months cut into his conditioning.
Mourning, who is one of the hardest-working, dedicated players in
the league, said Pat Riley need no share those worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is in game shape,'' he said.? ``I maintained. I ain't
walking in here with no gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning may have set himself up for a larger role with the
union in the future as a successor to Ewing, who is 36.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about it, but if the opportunity presents
itself in the future, I would consider it,'' he said.

 &HT;    Smithsonian heralds new racial era in Stone Mountain
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In 1923, when Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum
began carving his massive bas-relief on Stone Mountain (Ga.), the
Ku Klux Klan began holding annual rallies at the memorial and in
the neighboring town of that name. Seventy-five years later, the
faces of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall''
Jackson are as vivid as ever in the granite mountain, but the
imprint of the Klan has faded. In the January Smithsonian ($4),
writer Minna Morse talks to some of the town's 7,000 residents and
finds that, despite a number of Confederates in the attic, racism
is fast becoming a thing of the past. Stone Mountain's first black
mayor, Chuck Burris, says he hopes the world begins looking at the
mountain ``not as a symbol of racial hatred, but as a symbol of
racial healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the future: The Force will be with us _ again _ when the
``Star Wars'' prequel, ``The Phantom Menace,'' opens in theaters
May 21. In a rare interview, director George Lucas talks to Vanity
Fair ($3.95) about the film many in Hollywood expect to eclipse
``Titanic'' as the biggest money-maker of all time. If early
interest is any indication, the predictions are true. In New York
City, when three theaters showed a trailer for ``The Phantom
Menace,'' grown men took the day off from work to commute 90
minutes from Connecticut to witness the two-minute preview paired
with the dud ``Meet Joe Black.'' Starring Ewan McGregor as a young
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Liam Neeson as Qui-Con Jinn, the Jedi knight's
mentor, the film will introduce the typical ``Star Wars''
menagerie. One of Qui-Con Jinn's sidekicks is Jar Jar Binks, an
upright lizard, and Darth Maul, a menacing villain with a tattooed
face, will engage Obi-Wan in at least one light-saber battle. Annie
Leibovitz's dazzling pictures of the actors at work should whip
``Star Wars'' fans into a frenzy of anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Southern lit: It's amazing what an influx of cash will do.
Cushioned with contributions from publisher John Grisham, The
Oxford American ($5.25) keeps getting better. In the
January/February issue, the literary magazine publishes ``Young
Nuclear Physicist,'' a previously unpublished short story by the
late Walker Percy. The story centers on Ralph Budd, a homesick
Southerner in New York City, who takes out a personal ad in a
literary magazine. When he is flooded with responses, ``Ralph
reflected that he had discovered a new law in the economy of human
relations: that one makes a gain in the social field only with a
certain loss of dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   In another article of note, John Shelton Reed weighs in on
Atlanta's reaction to Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' with the
admonition that the city's residents should rejoice about being the
focus of the best-selling novel.
</P>
<P>
   More lit: Launching a magazine in the current crowded market is
a risky proposition. Launching a magazine about books is even
riskier. But three months after the premiere of Book ($4.95), the
Chicago-based publication has been chosen one of the year's
successful new magazines by Samir Husni, author of ``Guide to New
Consumer Magazines.'' With the returned popularity of reading,
Husni says, ``there's a better chance now than ever before that
this magazine will make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who loves books should embrace the new issue. In addition
to a cover story on T. Coraghessan Boyle, the magazine reprints
John Updike's address at the National Book Awards and looks at the
use _ and overuse _ of highly technical details in novels by
Patricia Cornwell, Tom Clancy and others. Other articles worth
reading include interviews with Haitian author Edwidge Danticat and
sci-fi master Ray Bradbury and a piece on the pros and cons of
using professional group leaders in book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Apocalypse pretty soon: Despite groups of cult members marching
with signs proclaiming ``The End of the World,'' the chances of
Armageddon are pretty slim, Time ($2.95) reports. Yes, the Y2K bug
will cause a few glitches, but there's no need for anyone to cash
in his or her 401(k) funds, buy dehydrated food and move into a
cave. Well, not unless you're from Montana or you're a follower of
TV evangelist Pat Robertson, who insists that President Clinton
might use the predicted computer chaos as an opportunity to seize
power as a dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Radio ringmaster: Don Imus regularly skewers the high and mighty
on his syndicated radio show, and yet guests such as NBC's Andrea
Mitchell and ABC's Cokie Roberts keep returning. Even New York
Times columnist Maureen Dowd, incensed with Imus' airing of her
love life, admitted she would be back, Newsweek ($3.50) reports in
its cover story on the talk show host. Imus' secret, says Mitchell,
is his ability ``to get us to say what we really think. It's like
the conversation you have with your sources before the mike goes
on, before it gets all solemn.''

 &HT;    An empty cage leaves an empty spot in our hearts and our daily
routine
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ground was hard from two nights of cold, and an
old shovel was the best we had. I wasn't able to attend the
service, held beneath a pair of tall loblolly pines in the back
yard, but arrived in time to see my son spreading mulch and then a
thick blanket of dead leaves over the spot. It was there they had
dug deep enough for the Starbucks box in which they wrapped her.
</P>
<P>
   Noah, I was told afterward, presided over the interment, his
mother and sister also present. One by one they offered their
thoughts on the solemn occasion, and then laid her to rest.
</P>
<P>
   There was no autopsy, no known cause of death, no sign of foul
play. Most likely, she had come to the end of her natural cycle and
that was it. A guinea pig lives about six years, and this one lived
four of them with us.
</P>
<P>
   I had opposed the idea from the start, knowing it would be left
to me to keep food in the bowl and water in the dispenser. I told
them so the first time I found both empty, and the second time and
the third time. I told them so and told them so.
</P>
<P>
   With pets come responsibilities, but gradually, and rather to my
surprise, they were carried out with reasonable regularity.
Cleaning the cage was always the one that got left to last, and it
was the one I wasn't going to do. I would feed her, and did. I
would clean and refill the water dispenser that hung from the side
of the cage, and did that also.
</P>
<P>
   In time, although I never admitted it, they became a routine
from which I took a private satisfaction _ so much so that I'd
sometimes tell Noah, ``Don't worry about Ginny. I know how busy you
are. I'll feed her and fill the water up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was fine with him, and it won me points for chipping in
with the chores.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first death in our family, only the least
significant. My children and I had returned home from a holiday in
Asheville, N.C., my wife staying behind, when I heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any interesting mail?'' I asked once the bags were unloaded
and in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but there was one thing _ Ginny died,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   She could see it caught me short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I filled her water on Friday,'' she said, ``and noticed on
Saturday she hadn't drunk much. Then, this morning, I looked again
and she was in her little hutch, on her side. I felt her and she
was stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife gently lifted her out of the cage in which she nibbled
daily at the green pellets in her bowl, snoozed at will and
daydreamed whatever guinea pigs daydream about and laid her in the
cardboard box for burial later. It fit her just right. She weighed
about 1 pound, most of it fur.
</P>
<P>
   With us, personal effects are left behind and it falls to
someone else to sort through them, not always certain what they
might have meant to us, discarding some, passing others along to
survivors for whom they sometimes are clues to thoughts
unexpressed.
</P>
<P>
   No such inventorying attends the death of a pet. You gather up
the accouterments of its existence for curbside pickup or, perhaps,
someone else's pet. In our case, these included a cage, a bowl and
water dispenser, a plastic canister in which her food was stored.
It was 10 minutes' work, no more.
</P>
<P>
   E.B. White once wrote of the death of a pig _ the kind that
squeals and gives bacon and ham, not this kind _ on his farm in
Maine and of the ``directness and dispatch about animal burial.''
The postmortems are businesslike and no one marks the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there is a sense of absence if not bereavement. Our
son's bedroom is across a hall from ours, and to the left. Passing
it in the mornings I was in the habit of glancing in and noticing
the cage in the corner. For a few days afterward I had to remind
myself that there was no need to check on the water anymore or the
food.
</P>
<P>
   On the kitchen island, a wedge of apple _ an occasional treat,
as rapaciously consumed as a child's dessert _ still reminds me of
her quick movements when a break from her unappetizing,
nutritionally balanced meal was dropped into the cage. It was the
only time I saw her move with alacrity. Seizing it in her jaws,
she'd scurry through the tunnel into the covered hutch where she
slept. To her, it must have been a hidey hole, safe from the world.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the neighborhood word passed quickly. Next door,
Stephanie Nash, 4, was upset; she enjoyed coming over, holding her
and stroking her. The pet manuals say guinea pigs like this,
although I was content to let the children do it.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Sarah Tyler, 10, was likewise sad. But she
was busy with a burial of her own. Her frog died, quite
unexpectedly. Ours is a cul-de-sac crowded with kids. They will
have other pets, grow up and move on, leaving behind them the
unmarked graves where they learned that life is transitory and, for
that reason, all the more precious.

 &HT;    Fox Theatre has become `Cats' cradle
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta, international city, can put another feather
in its cap: It has hosted the touring show of ``Cats'' more than
anyplace else.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're not among the 20,000 ticket holders for this week's
run, beginning tonight at the Fox Theatre, don't panic.
</P>
<P>
   The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is virtually assured of
returning in 2000, according to Theater of the Stars producer
Christopher B. Manos.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the recent release of the ``Cats'' video has done
little to slow metro ticket sales for the show, Broadway's
longest-running musical and poster pet for blockbuster
whimsicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year I've looked at how well sales are going in Atlanta
as a barometer of how `Cats' is going to sell elsewhere,'' says Jim
Kerber, the show's press representative. ``The city sets the trend
for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In feline celebration, we offer a numerical look at the show
that just won't stay away:
</P>
<P>
   13 _ The number of times the national touring company has come
to the Fox. (Memphis, in second place, has hosted it 10 times.)
</P>
<P>
   165 _ The number of cities to host the musical more than once.
</P>
<P>
   2 _ The number of cast members in this production from the metro
area: Jennifer Paige Chambers, who plays Cassandra, is from
Lawrenceville (Ga.). David Kirby of Atlanta is a standby for four
roles.
</P>
<P>
   7 _ The number of Tony Awards the show won in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   1981 _ The year ``Cats'' opened in London's West End, where it
is still playing.
</P>
<P>
   4,518 _ The number of seats at the Fox Theatre for ``Cats,'' the
largest venue at which the national tour performs. (The 900-seat
Lexington Opera House in Kentucky is the smallest.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats'' runs tonight through Sunday. $41-$19 at Ticketmaster.
Fox Theatre, 660 Peachtree St. N.E. , Atlanta, Ga. 404-817-8700.

 &HT;    David Lynch plotting return to series TV
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ David Lynch, the filmmaker whose TV series
``Twin Peaks'' was one of the most talked-about shows ever before
it crashed and burned, is developing a new series for ABC called
``Mulholland Drive,'' named after a famous Los Angeles road. The
pilot starts shooting next month for a possible date on ABC's fall
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vintage David Lynch _ very reminiscent of `Twin Peaks,'
'' said Stu Bloomberg, chairman of ABC Entertainment, speaking to
the nation's TV critics here. But he added that Lynch and ABC
learned some lessons from the unraveling of ``Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has it really mapped out,'' said Bloomberg. ``He said,
`There are things if I had to do it over again I'd do differently.
I want to correct the mistakes I made with this new show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said ``Mulholland'' will have a large cast, like
``Peaks,'' and will have some of its characters in show business.
</P>
<P>
   Also ahead for ABC this fall:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Once Again,'' a drama created by Ed Zwick (co-producer of
``Shakespeare in Love'') and Marshall Herskovitz, about a divorced
couple who get a second chance at their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Snoops,'' a drama about private eyes from David E. Kelley.
Kelley says he will create the show and then let others write it,
so he can concentrate on writing ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The
Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``True Love,'' a romantic comedy starring Adam Goldberg
(``Saving Private Ryan'') and Julie Delpy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Guide,'' a comedy about relationships starring Christine
Taylor (``The Brady Bunch Movie'').
</P>
<P>
   And one that we won't be seeing: The proposed sitcom that would
reunite Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper is officially dead.

CELLUCCI PROPOSES 0.95% CUT IN PERSONAL INCOME TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In his first official act as governor, Paul Cellucci
Monday filed legislation to lower the state income tax rate to 5
percent from 5.95 percent over the next three years, ultimately
saving the average family $600 a year, according to administration
figures.
</P>
<P>
   His plan immediately hit a wall of skepticism when Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham said he favored a more progressive
approach of increasing earned income tax exemptions rather than
restoring the rate to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the Legislature have supported tax cuts which provide
the same dollar benefits to everybody,'' said Birmingham, a Chelsea
Democrat. ``The governor's proposal provides a lot more to the
wealthier people and a lot less to the vast majority of middle- and
working-class taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci's plan appeared to have at least one Democratic
ally: The fiscally conservative House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's some sentiment in the House for doing just a
very straightforward, simple approach on rates, but that was
articulated pretty aggressively last year,'' the Mattapan lawmaker
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, like Birmingham, Finneran said the size of the fiscal
year-end budget surplus would largely influence how much of a tax
cut will be granted.
</P>
<P>
   Some expect that the budget surplus could be as much as $350
million by the end of the fiscal year, less than half of 1998's
level. And one fiscal watchdog group believes the surplus should be
used to help allay an impending ``crisis'' over the state's capital
budget, which pays for improvements for roads, bridges, and public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation Monday said it expects a
fiscal disaster brought on by the huge cost of the Central Artery
project, a reduction in federal highway funds to pay for the Big
Dig, and a growing need to fix the state's roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran and Birmingham said the report was worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci rejected its premise and said the tax cut was a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also continues what we've been trying to do over the last
eight years, and that is to make life more affordable for the
people of our state,'' Cellucci said. ``Tax cuts go into the
pockets of families and I believe they can spend those dollars a
lot better than the government can.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current framework, the state gives just about everyone
the same earned income exemption, regardless of how much money they
make each year. For tax year 1998, single filers will be exempted
$4,400, for a savings of $131; joint filers $8,800, for a $262
rebate, and heads of households $6,800 per year, for a $202 return.
There was also an additional, one-time tax cut worth $200 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Cellucci's rate-cut plan would give an average
family of four earning $75,000 a year $600 in savings each year;
single parents earning $35,000 with one child would get $228 back;
and a single person earning $25,000 would get $154.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said lawmakers should honor the ``promise'' they made
nearly a decade ago to restore the income tax rate to 5 percent
once the economy was again sound and debt was retired.
</P>
<P>
   That time is now, the governor said, noting that the state has
an overflowing billion-dollar rainy day fund and an astounding 2.9
percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said he is more inclined to support a plan like last
year's doubling of the earned income tax exemption, which will cost
the state more than $400 million a year once it is phased in
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   He is questioning whether the state can afford Cellucci's plan,
which would cost more than $1 billion annually, especially when
more money is needed to improve education and the Central Artery
project is siphoning money from the state's strained capital
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said he did not believe a promise was made during the
1989 budget debate. But if one were: ``We've given back in tax cuts
multiples of a billion dollars already,'' he said. ``Dollar for
dollar, the promise, if one was made, has been redeemed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci filed the same tax cut proposal last year that he
proposed Monday, but he was forced to compromise with the
Legislature, getting an increase in the earned income exemption
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said lawmakers would once again be more likely to
approve an increase in the exemption over the rate reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``It's too early to tell in the budgetary
process.''

GROUP TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC DEFENSE OF ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ High-ranking US and Israeli officials will meet in
Washington Tuesday to begin outlining a higher level of formal
cooperation on the defense and deterrence capabilities of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called joint strategic planning committee was created by
an almost unnoticed provision of the Wye Plantation Agreement,
which was signed at the White House last October. The memorandum of
agreement marks the first time that leaders of both countries have
signed a formal document of cooperation on Israeli security against
weapons of mass destruction. Their signatures are more significant,
officials said, than the more celebrated ``hiccups'' in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Uzi Arad, the foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, outlined the agreement for the new commission
in a talk with foreign policy specialists Monday at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge. The agreement, noting
the threats of biological and nuclear weapons posed by a growing
number of countries, commits the United States and Israel to
achieving two specific goals: enhancing Israel's defense and
deterrent power; and ``upgrading'' military, strategic, and
technical cooperation between the US National Security Council and
the Defense and State departments, and their counterparts in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about to cross the threshold from a partnership to a
virtual strategic alliance,'' Arad said. ``Clearly there is a
desire to move to an elevated stage in our cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The language of the agreement is very far reaching,'' said
Graham Allison, the director of the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs at the Kennedy School, where Arad spoke to a
group of international security specialists. ``This is a major step
in the Israeli relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists questioned the benefits of the cooperation,
suggesting it could entangle the United States in Middle East
conflicts without providing any significant benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But Arad said the agreement was necessary to stop the
proliferation of biological weapons, and Russian sales to Iran of
materials and expertise to make nuclear weapons, which he
characterized as an even greater threat to Mideast security than
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will you deter another Saddam, perhaps better equipped?''
he asked. ``That is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions against Iran, he said, have not stopped the sale of
technology and expertise from Russia. Instead, those sales have
moved underground through different countries, or simply continued
in defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``For commercial reasons, or strategic reasons, it has gotten
deeper,'' Arad said.
</P>
<P>
   A former Mossad official educated in the United States, Arad
defended his country against accusations that it was too nervous
about the threat from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to err on the side of underestimation and denial,'' he
said. In fact, he added, Israel has ignored for too long the
Iranian creation of the Shihad 3 short-range missle and is now
scrambling to improve its defense against a newer threat, the
Shihad 4.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the policy experts at the Belfar Center, which has
for several years cooperated in a so-called ``strategic dialogue''
with Israeli academics, questioned whether the agreement favors
Israel at the expense of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In broad public conversations, its almost embarrassing to
ask,'' Allison said, echoing the comments of several of his
colleagues. ``But it's the right question to ask: What's in it for
the US?''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Arad responded, ``The United States and Israel have a
joint interest in stability in the Middle East. Finding ways and
means to stabilize the Middle East in the face of developing
threats from missile and unconventional weapons in the possession
of rogue governments, we should be as partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The precedent concerned some at Harvard Monday. Other countries,
they said, could claim to be equally threatened by nuclear or
biological weapons and demand similar agreements with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense of being threatened is very genuine,'' Arad replied.
``I don't think there is any country in the world that has the same
kind of animosity and real threat as opposed to imagined threat,
than Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's meeting in Washington, representatives of the
National Security Council, the State Department and the Department
of Defense will plan the agenda for a more formal meeting in the
United States in February. At that time, officials will formulate
specific recommendations for cooperation.

OLYMPIC SCANDAL TARNISHES SALT LAKE CITY'S MODERN IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ For the past decade, Salt Lake City has been on
a roll. It has boomed as a Western high-tech center, one of the
nation's fastest-growing cities, and shed its image as a backwater
whose only claim was that it was the capital of the Mormon
religion. The 2002 Winter Olympics Games were supposed to be the
city's chance to show the world just how far it has come.
</P>
<P>
   But a scandal involving bribery allegations against top Olympic
officials has tarnished this city's effort to project a new a more
cosmopolitan image to the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the evolving scandal apparently claimed its latest
victim, one who has not been publicly linked with any corruption
allegations: Salt Lake City's mayor, Deedee Corradini, announced
she would not run for a third term, crushing her dream of presiding
over the Olympics here. Only a year ago, the mayor, smiling
radiantly and dressed in a flame orange jumpsuit, accepted the
Olympic flag at the end of the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, the 54-year mayor, with tears welling in
her eyes, alluded to the growing scandal only in passing, ``Despite
all the controversy swirling around Salt Lake City these days, I
want you to know this is a purely personal decision.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee board since she took
office seven years ago, Ms. Corradini maintained warm relations
with the International Olympic Committee, telling reporters on
several occasions in recent months that committee members were
urging her to run in 2000 for a third term. But now four official
inquiries into the two Olympic committees are under way. On Friday,
she sat stolidly as the resignations were announced of the top
leadership of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee: Frank Joklik, the
president, and Dave Johnson, the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Utah's governor, Michael Leavitt, called for ``quick
and complete'' disclosure of any wrongdoing in the bidding process
by Salt Lake City for the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This did not start in Salt Lake City, but it needs to stop
here,'' the Governor, a Republican, said in an interview. Referring
to the president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan
Antonio Samaranch, he said, ``President Samaranch has given me his
personal assurance that those involved will be expelled.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a state panel could produce its report as early as
next week, the governor continued: ``This needs to be a turning
point for the IOC. The Olympic movement gains power from trust.
Unless that is restored, the Olympic movement will be powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   The games are expected to cost $1.45 billion, and organizers are
worried that corporate sponsors may shy away if scandal taints the
selection process. Last week, U S West Inc., the official
telecommunications sponsor, announced it was delaying a $5 million
payment, pending answers to a series of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assurance I have had with the corporate sponsors I have
talked with has been that they will see this through,'' the
governor said, noting that he had talked to two companies. ``We are
still very much on track for what we believe will be one of the
best Winter Olympic Games ever held.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Utahans had started pursuing the Winter
Olympics as a golden opportunity to show the world their state's
modern face.
</P>
<P>
   Greater Salt Lake now boasts of having more high-tech companies
_ 2,120 _ than fast food restaurants. And Salt Lake has the
nation's highest proportion of households with personal computers,
about 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive over its national image as a square city, dominated by
Mormons who shun coffee and alcohol, city promoters once gave
visiting sports reporters bottles of local beer and pointedly noted
that the city's first Starbucks coffee shop had just opened.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the Olympics, Salt Lake has become a vast
pre-Olympic construction site. Crews are building projects worth
more than $2 billion: a new runway and a refurbished terminal for
the international airport, a European-style light-rail system, new
hotels, an athlete's village, a winter sports park and an expansion
of the local football stadium to 50,000 seats. Commuters have
endured epic traffic jams as the north-south Interstate here, I-15,
is widened from six lanes to 10 lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Forty minutes to the east, in the snow-covered mountains of the
Wasatch Front, workers are putting the finishing touches on the
Olympic venues: ski jumps, luge runs, bobsled runs and Nordic
trails. Utah's 14 ski resorts are investing heavily, hoping to use
favorable Olympics publicity to catch up with Colorado, their
winter sports rival on the other side of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   On a state level, Utahans were so eager to get the Olympics that
they voted a sales tax to build Olympic facilities in 1989, six
years before the International Olympic Committee gave the state the
nod in the summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent airing of the Olympics selection
committee's dirty laundry, the Winter Games were backed by 62
percent of 423 Utah voters interviewed last weekend for a
KASL/Deseret News poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are demanding the right to review the books, but I
don't think they will lose the Olympics,'' said Dan Jones, whose
polling company conducted the survey. Noting that popular support
was in the midrange for polls conducted in the last five years, he
predicted that ``Governor Leavitt will turn over every stone'' to
clarify the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Utah's sometimes squeaky clean image, the state has been
plagued in past years by white collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, only weeks after her election, Ms. Corradini, a
Democrat, was embroiled in the collapse of the Bonneville Pacific
Corporation, an alternative energy company. Several company
principals went to jail in the case. Ms. Corradini, who was an
officer of a related corporate entity, agreed to an $800,000
settlement with Bonneville's bankrupcy trustee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a few months after the mayor was narrowly re-elected,
it became known that to pay the bankrupcy settlement she had
solicited and received $231,000 in gifts and loans from prominent
residents. A report on to the City Council about the gifts found
that half of the 24 individuals who gave or loaned money to the
mayor had business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Gunnarson, the Salt Lake County District Attorney and a
friend of the mayor, decided not to file charges in the affair,
citing the city's vaguely worded laws on conflicts of interest.
When she was not indicted, Ms. Corradini claimed vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics scandal really was what has ended her political
career,'' Deeda Seed, a Democratic member of the City Council, said
Monday.

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A diamond cartel is forever.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimers, nearly so.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the death rattles of the cartel, which sets prices
for most of the world's uncut diamonds, are said to be heard. In
1905, it was synthetic diamonds. In 1942, Roosevelt's anger. In
1960, Russian finds. In 1977, Israeli hoarding. In 1983, Australian
finds and Zaire's defection.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, the cartel outwitted fate. While OPEC has withered
and the tin cartel collapsed, diamonds have glittered on.
</P>
<P>
   It has different names, but the cartel is De Beers, and De Beers
is the Oppenheimers _ as is Anglo American Corp., South Africa's
dominant conglomerate. In a silicon world, diamonds and gold aren't
quite what they used to be, but the Oppenheimers are still the
richest of their countrymen and the most important business figures
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Now the third generation is officially in charge. Nicholas Frank
Oppenheimer, 53 _ also known as Nicky, or NFO, or the Cuban because
of his beard _ became chairman of De Beers a year ago and in
November opened its new headquarters, outside the Anglo-American
complex downtown.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an easy time. Last month, the company announced that
because of falling Asian demand, it sold fewer diamonds than it had
for 12 years, a mere $3.4 billion worth. The mines are cutting
back; the executives admit to sleepless nights. But not to panic.
This has happened before.
</P>
<P>
   In company lore, Oppenheimer's grandfather, Sir Ernest, was the
daring entrepreneur, his father, Harry, the philosopher king, and
Nicky is _ well, something different. ``Man of action'' is the take
on him, but it seems silly.
</P>
<P>
   He is a genial teddy bear who wears funny socks and is relaxed
enough to be photographed pounding an African drum with miners at a
company ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he is the helmsman who negotiates
billion-dollar deals with the Russians, who insist on dealing with
a family member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much nicer to be known as Nice Guy than Nasty Guy,'' he
jokes. ``But you've got to have lines _ and when you hit the line,
that's the end of the story, nice guy or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, where he spends half his time, Oppenheimer commutes
by helicopter, which he pilots. In South Africa, he has his own
cricket team and personal stadium, his ``grand folly,'' he says. In
return for a $17,000-a-match donation to youth cricket, his team
gets the first match with visiting national teams _ if the New York
Yankees played cricket and toured, in South Africa, they would have
to take on the Nicky Oppenheimer XI first. There are even
statuettes of him inside his stadium, but they're not imperial _
they're goofy, like souvenir salt shakers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he has his own team, he explains in his typically
self-deprecating way, ``If you're as bad a cricketer as I am, it's
the only way you get to play.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, Oppenheimer is modest and often pokes fun at himself.
His obligatory military service in the 1960s, he said, was spent as
second-in-command of a parking lot near Pretoria, signing vehicles
in and out. ``The army taught me to sign my name very quickly, and
that's stood me in good stead the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And he takes umbrage at an old report that as a student, he
drove a beat-up little car with a ``Jesus Saves'' bumper sticker.
``Small, yes. Not `Jesus Saves' but something like that. But never
beat-up. Never. I take great offense at the idea that I didn't look
after my car.''
</P>
<P>
   His own personality is in stark contrast to the ruthless
reputation of the cartel's Central Selling Organization in London,
which estimates that 70 percent of the world's rough diamonds are
bought through it. (The figure was once nearly 100 percent, but
Australia's output, Russia's excess gems, stolen stones and many
that slip out of war-torn Africa find their own way to cutters.)
</P>
<P>
   The CSO is still capable of freezing out diamond dealers who
cross it. And as the biggest buyer of diamonds throughout Africa,
it is still the ultimate source of funds, whether wittingly or not,
for some of the world's most vile killers who control diamond
mines, including rebel movements in Angola and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicky Oppenheimer has brought glasnost to the business,
running the CSO since 1985 in a way very unlike that of his uncle
Phillip, who was an icy and inflexible figure. He is, for example,
not afraid to admit that diamonds are intrinsically worthless
``except for the deep psychological need they fill'' _ a need that
hundreds of millions of dollars in De Beers' ``A Diamond Is
Forever'' advertising helps create.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he mind calling a cartel a cartel, though he prefers to
refer to it as ``single-channel marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And he views with wry amusement the fact that he cannot visit
the United States, by far the company's biggest market, because of
a legacy of unresolved antitrust cases stretching back decades. He
has been there in the past to ski and to see relatives in San
Francisco, but since an indictment charging De Beers with fixing
the prices of industrial diamonds was handed up more than four
years ago, no De Beers director will enter the United States for
fear of being subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Of American antitrust laws, he says: ``Obviously I'm biased, but
I don't think in this case they are sensible. It's a strange thing
_ here I am a believer in free enterprise and competition, all the
good liberal values, and yet I'm chairman of a business which talks
ultimately about single-channel marketing, control, all those sort
of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer says he leads ``a very normal life,'' driving his
own car, feeling no need for bodyguards, going out to movies or
stores unpestered by paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live that life, if you go to the places where people
take pictures of you, then you have your picture taken, I suppose.
I'm not sure I necessarily go to the right places,'' he says.
``Thank goodness.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he is focused on the reorganization of the De
Beers-Anglo-Minorco consortium. Anglo, one of the world's biggest
mining companies in gold, platinum and other minerals, is absorbing
Minorco, a Luxembourg subsidiary created to evade anti-apartheid
sanctions. The resulting company, Anglo American PLC, will move its
headquarters and stock exchange listing to London from
Johannesburg, to give it access to more capital.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer denies what some analysts say _ that the move to
London is also a way for Anglo to improve its image in the United
States, where it now owns two gold mines, with an eye toward going
deeper into that market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the reorganization, hundreds of De Beers workers
on the Anglo payroll are being shifted back to De Beers. And De
Beers has moved its head office out of Anglo's downtown
headquarters to a south Johannesburg amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   But the cross-ownership between De Beers and Anglo is not being
undone, nor is the Oppenheimer stake in both, Oppenheimer says. De
Beers still owns roughly 40 percent of Anglo, essentially as a cash
cow and as collateral for the billions it must borrow to get
through bad diamond years. To keep diamond prices ever rising
gently, De Beers must buy and hold raw stones. When jewelry demand
sinks, that is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer says it is ``clearly rubbish'' that the family
controls both De Beers and Anglo because it ``directly owns'' only
8 percent of Anglo. But that has been the family line for decades.
He is also the nonexecutive deputy chairman of Anglo, while his son
Jonathan, 27, is rising through the Anglo ranks in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Nicky Oppenheimer's father, Harry, now retired after leading the
companies from 1957 to 1994, celebrated his 90th birthday last
year. He spends hours in his library, some of it reading Byron, but
still goes into the office most mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Harry was a member of Parliament for nine years, a critic of
apartheid and later a force behind liberal parties and newspapers.
Sir Ernest, Nicky's grandfather, also served in Parliament and got
into furious fights with the government during the Depression,
threatening to close his mines if it kept threatening to
nationalize them.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, the company was often criticized by
anti-apartheid leaders for growing rich on underpaid migrant labor
enforced by the apartheid system. It apologized to the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission in November 1997 for ``many missed
opportunities and many mistakes made in Anglo's corporate
citizenship,'' including failing to house workers with their
families, to desegregate work places and to promote blacks. In its
defense, it pleaded that the apartheid government forbade it to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   While professing no interest in politics, Nicky enjoys good
relations with the new government. He is on the board of Nelson
Mandela's Children's Fund and he signed the deals that arranged for
black ownership of substantial portions of two Anglo subsidiaries,
Johnnic and JCI.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many years in the 1980s, when there was absolutely
no contact between Anglo and De Beers and the government of the
day,'' he says. ``We never saw them, never talked. And that's
really weird. With the present government, things have finally
become normal. One feels the government is doing what it should in
supporting business endeavors, and that's extremely healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   What, he is asked, would he like to be remembered for?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I always find questions like that terribly difficult. One
doesn't necessarily have a mission. I don't know _ for being fair
and reasonable, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a trick question, he is told. He was asked it by someone
else 15 years before and his answer was noted.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles. ``What was it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``For not being boring. For having lived a worthwhile life. For
having been polite to people all one's life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' he said. ``Sounds rather boring, if you ask me.''

BRONCOS SECONDARY WILL TRY TO DISRUPT TESTAVERDE'S RHYTHM
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Denver Broncos' strong safety, Tyrone Braxton, said
he knows how to bring out the worst in Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a great quarterback, but he's a streaky
quarterback,'' Braxton said Monday. ``You need to get pressure on
him where you get him in a bad rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, though, Braxton acknowledged that his opinion is
based on getting Testaverde, the Jets' quarterback, to revert back
to old habits, aware that the story line has changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't throw as many interceptions as he used to, so
that's going to be frustrating for us,'' Braxton said. ``We need to
be in the right place to make the plays when we have the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' pass defense has been viewed as the team's weak
link. But last weekend, it sent the Miami Dolphins' Dan Marino home
with a touchdown-less two-interception day in a 38-3 loss at
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five cornerbacks who can start for other teams, and I
don't think any other team can say that,'' cornerback Tito Paul
said. ``Plus both our safeties are Pro Bowlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this criticism has kind of taken us aback. We think it was
unfair and unwarranted. We've got pretty much the same secondary
that won the Super Bowl last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Braxton, a 12-year pro, is again a big part of it. He was
replaced late in the preseason by rookie Eric Brown, was a backup
for much of the year but is a starter again.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday's American Football Conference championship game
against the Jets will be his 18th National Football League playoff
game, his fifth for the conference title. He played on Denver's AFC
championship clubs in 1987, '89 and '97 and on the '91 team that
reached the title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have an experienced player like Tyrone,'' said
Coach Mike Shanahan. ``Not only has he played well, but he's played
exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Braxton, 34, is just glad he did not allow his confidence to
wane once he suffered the embarrassment of being replaced by a
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a down time for sure, because I didn't feel like I was
contributing,'' he said. ``I was making a play here or a play
there, but it just wasn't the same feeling I've had _ each game
making a lot of plays. But I just had to adjust _ and stay ready _
and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Braxton has only one other notable blot on his resume. He spent
much of the 1994 season languishing in Miami with the Dolphins,
having signed with them as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But the time in Miami may have saved his career. The Dolphins
moved him from cornerback to strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got to practice at safety without getting any pressure on
me, against one of the best quarterbacks ever in Dan Marino,'' he
said. ``When I came back here to compete for a job, it was like I
had played safety for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Braxton sees it, Denver's pass defense will determine
the team's fate on Sunday. And he's quite aware that the Jets have
a 1,000-yard rusher in Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been great against the run all year, so there's no
reason for me to believe we can't stop their run,'' he said. ``The
pass, we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Braxton believes the sellout crowd at 76,273-seat Mile High
Stadium will give the Broncos a distinct advantage no matter what
plays the Jets use. He said the crowd noise ``will be at a whole
another level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to use hand signals, because it's going to be so loud
it won't do any good to yell,'' Braxton said. ``No one can hear you
out there. So we'll work on getting our hand signals down.''
</P>
<P>
   Braxton said it's no coincidence that veteran quarterbacks will
guide the teams in both conference title games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need some leadership because in a playoff game, anything
can happen,'' he said. ``You practice certain plays during the week
that you want to run, but then they always come out with something
different. You've got to be able to adjust, and you need a
quarterback who can adjust on the fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, the Broncos showed the 37-year-old Marino some
new coverages. And despite Marino's 16 years in the league, the
Dolphins were never in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Braxton promised that the Broncos will have a little something
different to show Testaverde. ``We'll see how he adjusts,'' he
said.

A KILLER's IGNORANCE ADDS POIGNANCY TO BIKO CASE 
 (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The release Monday of the full text
of a decision to deny amnesty to a police officer involved in the
death of the anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko contains an
interesting twist on history: The officer, who helped kill Biko in
1977, may have had no idea how important he was.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission found that the officer's amnesty application failed on
two grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Since he said the police had tackled Biko in self-defense, he
did not admit to a crime, so he could not be pardoned for one. And
by maintaining that he knew little about Biko, the founder of the
Black Consciousness Movement, the officer could not plead political
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for amnesty, the officer would have had to prove that
his crime was committed to suppress the anti-apartheid movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not satisfied that the application in respect of the
death of Mr . Biko complies with the act, and consequently, the
application is refused,'' said the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Gideon Nieuwoudt, who is in jail for other crimes,
maintained that Biko became violent, and that the officers were
defending themselves when they ``accidentally'' rammed his head
into a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Biko's injuries were apparent almost right away, the officers
said. But for days he was left handcuffed in a ``crucifix''
position. Eventually driven a great distance for treatment, he died
before receiving any.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Nieuwoudt could face prosecution in the case. But
murder charges would require proving intent, and the statute of
limitations on lesser charges has run out.

2 MORE ANTIAIRCRAFT INCIDENTS IN NORTH IRAQ

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American fighter jets attacked antiaircraft
batteries in northern Iraq in two skirmishes Monday as Baghdad
continued its defiance of American and British control of its
skies.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the American fighters had attacked after the
batteries had tracked them with radar, apparently in preparation to
fire. But the Iraqi antiaircraft forces did not fire, and the jets
returned safely to their base at Incirlik, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the strikes destroyed the batteries,
the Pentagon said, because of clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's incidents fit an increasingly familiar pattern. Almost
every day now, Iraqi aircraft or antiaircraft weapons are
challenging American and British jets patrolling the northern and
southern no-flight zones established after the Persian Gulf war in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Iraqi MIG jets entered the southern zone Monday but
quickly left, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges follow a series of defiant threats, and some
retreats, from President Saddam Hussein's government, which has
vowed to end all cooperation with United Nations, including weapons
inspections and efforts by international relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Iraqi Parliament postponed a vote to reject United
Nations resolutions, including one that established its border with
Kuwait and those that the United States cited to created the
no-flight zones to protect Kurds in Iraq's north and Shiite Muslims
in its south.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, traveling to Japan, warned
Monday that any move by Iraq to withdraw recognition of Kuwait
would be ``a flagrant violation'' of resolutions that have stood
for nearly eight years.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the United States would strike again if Saddam
threatened Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or used force to crack down on
Iraqi Kurds. ``What we have said is that to the extent that he
poses a threat or moves against Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or the Kurds
in the north, that we are prepared to respond,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they believe that Saddam is trying
to find and exploit international divisions over how to enforce the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the challenges to American and British aircraft have
done little except invite strikes on Iraq's antiaircraft weapons.
And Baghdad's public statements have exposed its isolation from
important Arab countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright is to visit those two countries this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Monday's incidents occurred Monday morning near the city
of Mosul, Pentagon officials said. In one instance, two F-15E
fighter jets fired guided missiles at an antiaircraft battery after
detecting that the Iraqis had targeted them with radar, Pentagon
officials said. An F-16 fired a radar-seeking missile at an SA-6
surface-to-air missile launcher, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the commander of American forces in the region, Gen.
Anthony Zinni, announced that the United States would bolster its
force in the region. Eight more F-16s and four aerial refuelers
will join 182 aircraft now enforcing the southern no-flight zone.

GREEN GROUPS EYE CELLUCCI BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HILARY SARGENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A statewide coalition of environmental groups Monday
urged Governor Paul Cellucci to add about $20 million to next
year's state budget to protect water, curb sprawl, and ensure
``environmental justice'' in poor communities plagued by pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still playing catch-up in terms of dollars for
environmental programs,'' said Namrita Kapur, legislative director
for the Environmental League. ``New problems and responsibilities
have arisen over the last decade, but the environmental budget has
actually lost ground.''
</P>
<P>
   At a State House press conference, the coalition released its
recommendations for increased environmental funding in the Green
Budget 2000, which it hopes will influence Cellucci as he prepares
to submit his first budget later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended increase of $19.4 million calls for increased
support in three areas _ water quality, land use, and environmental
justice. These priorities reflect the consensus view among the
state's main environmental lobbies on where the state should focus
environmental funding.
</P>
<P>
   Kapur said insufficient environmental funding has created a
``deficit,'' but called the Green Budget a ``modest proposal'' that
would address the deficit over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed recommendations for water quality include $1.9 million
in pollution prevention, $1.5 million to enforce the federal Clean
Water Act, and $1 million to control non-native aquatic species
often responsible for clogging rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Massachusetts' increasing loss of farmland and open space
to development, the Green Budget calls for a $2 million increase to
fund farm preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental League also referred to environmental justice,
and called for $2 million in improvements at the state's
Metropolitan District Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about communities usually economically
disadvantaged, that are bearing a disproportionate burden of
unwanted environmental impacts,'' said Sha-King Alston, executive
director of the Environmental Diversity Forum. ``We have to do a
better job of making sure that poor communities and communities of
color have access to the resources to address and prevent
environmental problems,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposed increases included $925,000 for public tree
planting and $1 million to help local conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the governor followed the recommendations ``almost
line item for line item,'' Kapur said. ``I expect an even warmer
reception than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Durand, who Monday was sworn in as secretary of the
Office of Environmental Affairs, said that the Green Budget's
priorities are similar to his.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to work within the administration's budget,
but obviously there are priorities that I care about, and that the
administration cares about,'' Durand said. ``I think the governor
fully understands the need to protect our land.''

COURT DEALS FINAL BLOW TO SWEEPING ENGLISH-ONLY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ill., Pa.)  (jw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday turned down a
last-ditch defense of an Arizona law requiring public employees to
speak only English on the job. Without comment, the justices let
stand a ruling by the Arizona Supreme Court that the measure, the
most sweeping of two dozen state ``English-only'' laws, was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The state itself declined to defend the law, which has been a
divisive issue ever since Arizona voters approved it as a voter
initiative in 1988 by a bare 50.5 percent majority. Earlier,
Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods had interpreted the law
narrowly to require only that official state acts be pronounced in
English, and had defended it on that basis.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arizona Supreme Court, in its ruling in April, said the
measure had to be given its literal meaning, to require English to
be used by ``all government officials and employees during the
performance of government business.'' Read so broadly, the law
raised ``constitutional problems,'' Woods told the justices in a
brief that Gov. Jane Dee Hull joined.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal from the state Supreme Court ruling was filed by
Arizonans for Official English, the group that had sponsored the
initiative. The state court had deprived the government of the
right to control its own speech, the group told the justices. The
group's brief said that, contrary to the conclusion of the Arizona
Supreme Court, the law presented no problem under the First
Amendment because it involved no effort to control the content of
employees' speech.
</P>
<P>
   The state court held the measure violated the First Amendment
``by depriving elected officials and public employees of the
ability to communicate with their constituents and with the
public.'' Even when state employees are willing and able to speak
with residents whose English proficiency is limited, ``meaningful
communication in those cases is barred,'' the court said, also
ruling that the law violated the constitutional guarantee of equal
protection as well as the right to petition the government and to
participate in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two states have made English their official language,
most since the English-only political movement gained force in the
mid-1980s. Most of the laws are essentially symbolic statements,
however, and do not impose restrictions on employees' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time the Arizona law came before the Supreme
Court. Two years ago, the justices agreed to hear an appeal from a
federal court decision striking down the law, but dismissed the
case after deciding that it was moot; the Spanish-speaking state
employee who had challenged the law had left her job.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, a parallel lawsuit was working its way through the
state courts, brought by a group of elected officials, state
employees and a public school teacher. Once the state Supreme Court
had ruled and the state itself declined to appeal, it was a
question of some doubt whether the private group had standing to
pursue the appeal. The justices avoided that question Monday by
declining to hear the case, Arizonans for Official English vs.
Arizona, No. 98-167.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These were among the other cases the court dealt with Monday.
</P>
<P>
   GARBAGE CAN SEARCH
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court refused to consider a case raising
the issue of whether police have the right to conduct a warrantless
search of a homeowner's trash when the trash can is adjacent to the
house or garage, well within the property line.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1988 case, the court upheld the search of a garbage can
left at the curb. But in the case Monday, an appeal from a
narcotics conviction, an ordinance in Urbana, Ill., prohibited
leaving trash at the curb, so Joseph Redmon, the owner of a town
house, placed his can for collection at the top of his 28-foot-long
driveway. A drug task force, which had him under surveillance,
searched the trash and found evidence of cocaine. That enabled the
agents to get a warrant to search the house, where they found more
incriminating evidence and arrested Redmon.
</P>
<P>
   The case produced a sharp split on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago, which upheld the search and conviction by an
8-5 vote with several vigorously argued opinions. ``Most urban
dwellers would be shocked to learn that the portion of a driveway
immediately adjacent to the garage door is considered by this court
to be an `open field,' '' Judge Ilana Rovner said in one of the
dissenting opinions. Under Supreme Court precedents, police do not
need a warrant to search an open field. The case Monday was Redmon
vs. U.S., No. 98-243.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-ABORTION MESSAGE
</P>
<P>
   Also without comment, the court turned down an appeal by the
Philadelphia public transportation agency from a federal court
ruling that it violated the First Amendment rights of an
anti-abortion group when it removed the group's posters from 25
subway and rail stations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The posters, for which Christ's Bride Ministries Inc. had
contracted and paid, contained the message: ``Women who choose
abortion suffer more &AMP; deadlier breast cancer.'' After obtaining a
letter from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that
this health claim was misleading, inaccurate, and ``unduly
alarming,'' the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
canceled the contract.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion in June, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Philadelphia ruled that the agency's previous acceptance of ads on
abortion had established a public forum on the issue and prevented
the agency from censoring a particular message. The case was SEPTA
vs. Christ's Bride Ministries, No. 98-654.

DEMOCRATS DEBATING WHEN TO INTRODUCE CENSURE RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-RULES) 
(sw) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just days before opening arguments in the
impeachment trial of President Clinton begin in the Senate,
Democrats are debating when would be the best time to try to put
forward a censure resolution, with some advocating sooner rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats argued on Monday that a resolution would stand a
stronger chance of passing immediately after opening arguments and
the first series of votes, tentatively scheduled for Jan. 26 _ one
on a motion to dismiss the charges, followed immediately by a
motion to depose witnesses. But many Republicans who oppose censure
and even Democrats who support it dismissed the prospect of a deal
so early in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The first vote on dismissing the charges, which is unlikely to
garner the simple majority required to pass, would nevertheless
serve as an indicator of whether the Senate can muster the 67 votes
needed to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If it is clear that the Senate does not have the votes to
convict at that time, an outcome many senators have predicted from
the start, several Democrats say it would provide the perfect
opportunity to push for a tough censure deal that may draw
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that brokering a deal on censure would be most likely
to succeed before taking an up-or-down vote on whether to convict
or acquit Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice. They
contend that if Clinton were already acquitted, he would not be
inclined to accept a censure deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have a greater chance to build a bipartisan
coalition if the case is dismissed,'' said Sen. Robert G.
Torricelli, D-N.J. ``After acquittal, it may be difficult to build
a majority for censure.''
</P>
<P>
   There are as many as six different censure resolutions being
drafted by Democrats. The final resolution would likely embrace the
prevailing ideas in all of them to formulate one central proposal,
and is likely not to include any sort of fine or penalty that
Clinton would have to sign off on.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and some Democrats counter that the push for an
early censure resolution is likely to fail so early in the
proceedings. The idea is further complicated by the fact that any
censure resolution would require the cooperation of Sen. Trent Lott
of Mississippi, the majority leader, who is not disposed to turn to
censure so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans, and a few Democrats, oppose censure, either
because they view it as setting a bad precedent and unnecessary in
the wake of a deciding vote on Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that that's in the cards,'' said Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman, D-Conn. ``I don't think you will get people to support a
combination of motion to dismiss and a censure right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Democrats would have a better chance drawing
Republican support for censure after an up-or-down vote on whether
to convict or acquit Clinton. It is highly unlikely that 67
senators would vote to convict Clinton _ there are 45 Democrats and
55 Republicans in the Senate _ but it would nevertheless give many
Republicans what they desire: a chance to vote to convict and
remove Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, some of them may be willing to soften their
position on censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of dealing with the issue of censure, a lot of people
really want to bring the impeachment trial to closure before
consideration of censure,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe, a moderate
Republican from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Another moderate Republican, Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode
Island, agreed. Censure, he said, ``ought to be postponed until we
have completed the work assigned to us under the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats pushing an early censure proposal return to the
argument that prospects for a tough censure resolution dim
significantly if and when Clinton is acquitted; Clinton may not be
willing to negotiate once he is off the hook, they say.
</P>
<P>
   What the Senate would likely wind up with, they say, is a
watered down ``sense of the Senate resolution'' that would be
earmarked for oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think Republicans would conclude that the best time to
exact a pound of flesh, the only time to exact a pound of flesh is
at the moment it is clear he won't be convicted and before the case
goes to a vote,'' said one Democratic senator.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who is not keen on censure, said he
would be willing to agree to a censure resolution immediately after
the first votes.
</P>
<P>
   It is at that time, he said, that ``you still have leverage over
the president.''

BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS MAY PUT 76TH LEGISLATURE UNDER
SPOTLIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ending an 18-month lull in lawmaking, the 76th
Legislature will be sworn in at noon Tuesday in family-oriented,
standing-room-only ceremonies in the House and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Though pomp and circumstance will dominate Capitol activities
for several weeks, the session will eventually get down to the
serious business of mapping a two-year spending plan; exploring
tax-relief options and dealing with a rare surplus of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Other contentious issues on the agenda include electric utility
deregulation and proposals to allow state-funded vouchers for
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   When the debates begin in earnest, leaders believe the
Legislature will be under a national media spotlight because of the
presidential ambitions of Gov. George W. Bush, who insists he won't
be distracted from his goals of lowering taxes, improving schools
and promoting a conservative agenda that includes toughening
welfare and abortion rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we meet the basic needs, it's important for us to have a
tax cut,'' Bush declared. He's hoping that disputes over how to
spend surplus tax revenues and a multibillion-dollar tobacco
settlement don't mar the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 181 opinions coming, most of whom are fresh off
elections, and it's going to be an interesting session,'' Bush
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a Democrat, will preside over the
GOP-dominated Senate until the Jan. 19 inauguration of his
successor, Rick Perry, a Republican. This week the only essential
business on the Senate agenda is to adopt operating rules that
Perry predicted will not change dramatically from the 1997 session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to balance a lot of competing interests. I'm going
to balance competing philosophies,'' Perry said, adding that
non-Texans might be tuning in as the session progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in a special spotlight and that's fine. We'll show
the rest of the country how we address some of these important
issues, like our children's education and electric deregulation,''
Perry added.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-member House will be sworn in by Bush's new Secretary of
State Elton Bomer, who took his own oath Monday. Then the House,
which still has a slight Democratic majority, will elect one of its
own _ Rep. Pete Laney, D-Hale Center _ to a fourth two-year term as
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them seem to be ready to go to work. Eager,'' said
Laney, whose chamber includes a cross-section of Texans _ lawyers,
teachers, businessmen, ranchers and homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Laney expects no major changes in his chamber's rules, though he
said members will take steps to avert the procedural flaws that
nullify measures when they reach the House floor. He said a new
system of bill analysis is being crafted to reduce the number of
fatal ``points of order,'' which are objections based on
parliamentary mistakes during the committee review process.
</P>
<P>
   Though the session's opening week might not be substantive, it
will allow members to get acquainted, move into offices and
organize staffs. The 25 new House members and two new senators will
be introduced to colleagues. Numerous newly elected GOP statewide
office-holders will be making the rounds, as will scores of the
1,400 registered lobbyists and citizens here to support their
elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Both legislative chambers could see significant changes in key
committee and leadership assignments, and members are anxiously
waiting to find out if they won chairmanships or appointments to
prestigious roles on the House Appropriations Committee and the
Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Perry reveals his committee structure next week, but Laney isn't
predicting when he'll make public his selections. For now, it's all
being mapped out the old-fashioned way _ on a bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   The 140-day session ends May 31, Memorial Day. Lawmakers have
until mid-March to file bills without special permission from
colleagues.

AT FIRST, JETS WILL BE IN A MENTAL GAME WITH BRONCOS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ It has been so long since they have let a game
get away from them _ back on Nov. 15, at Indianapolis _ that the
Jets have forgotten what it is like to lose their heads, or become
distracted, or get in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   That memory loss _ and the confidence that comes from it _ could
be the biggest factor of all in as they prepare for Sunday's
American Football Conference title game in Denver. Most teams have
been crushed by the Broncos before they even get warm, a pitfall
the Jets will have to avoid if they want to compete against a team
that has outscored the opposition in the first half by an
astounding 321-144.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go there thinking we have to score points to
win,'' Jets Coach Bill Parcells said Monday, a day after his team
advanced in the playoffs with a 34-24 victory over Jacksonville.
``Any team can be aggressive when it has the lead. The other team
presses a bit more. You have to stop that from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have a good halftime record themselves, with a 220-145
scoring edge. And they have been competitive in every game they
played except a 30-10 loss at St. Louis, a game in which Vinny
Testaverde replaced Glenn Foley at quarterback, then took over as
the starter.
</P>
<P>
   In those games, the Jets were never far behind, and it allowed
them to continue to run Curtis Martin. Most teams have to crank up
a passing game when they fall behind, abandoning the running game
and allowing the opponent to concentrate on the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has kept the club out of trouble while the Jets
patiently produced comebacks. Since he took over as the starter in
Game 6, the Jets have trailed at halftime only twice _ by 4 points
at New England and by 8 at the Meadowlands against Seattle. The
Jets came back to win both times. Testaverde overall record as a
starter is 13-1.
</P>
<P>
   That is a trait the Broncos' opposition has not shown this year,
although Denver defeated only five clubs with winning records,
including a crushing 38-3 defeat of Miami in their playoff game
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While several Jets spoke respectfully about the Broncos'
performance against Miami _ ``Wow!'' said Chad Cascadden _ the
players also felt that the Dolphins failed to show any aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``After winning in Kansas City, Miami, Buffalo and New
England,'' said fullback Keith Byars, ``we don't have to go on the
road and wonder if we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Parcells sounded upbeat Monday about the prospects of
a good effort against the defending champions. His team put on a
powerful offensive show, and did not allow several mental and
physical blips to stop them from defeating the Jaguars in what was
the first playoff game for more than half the Jets. It was also
their seventh straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a quick start will be the Jets' game plan, Parcells said
Monday. In fact, aggressiveness has become a Jets' trademark in
Parcells' two seasons. That and an ability to control the clock.
</P>
<P>
   This season's Jets have an extremely high third-down completion
percentage _ 46 percent _ and a better-than four minutes' edge in
time of possession. Would this help against the Broncos?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if we score,'' said Parcells. ``We'll have to be prepared
to score, but it's the same for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He is conceding nothing to the Broncos, a team he has faced only
twice in the 1990s. Both games occurred when Parcells coached the
Patriots and Mike Shanahan coached the Broncos, and both were
Denver routs. Parcells was not putting too much stock in those past
performances, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a good Patriots team the first time we played
them,'' he said. ``The second time the game got out of hand and
anyway we played them early in the season. We were a much better
team by the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have their own inconclusive history against the
Broncos. They have not defeated them in Denver since 1978. They
have only faced them in Mile High Stadium three times since. The
last one opened the 1996 season, and was won by the Broncos, 31-6,
in Neil O'Donnell's debut at Jets' quarterback. The Jets finished
that season 1-15.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Jets and Broncos have played 26 times _
dating to 1960, when they were original American Football League
members. The Jets won 12 and tied 1. Testaverde is 0-2 against the
Broncos, losing in 1994, with Cleveland, and in 1996, with
Baltimore. John Elway is 3-2 vs. the Jets, dating to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, a Parcells team did have an easy time against the
Broncos. But that was many years ago. His Giants captured Super
Bowl XXI against them. &QL;

2 SENATORS PUSH FOR OPEN IMPEACHMENT DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Democratic senators said Monday that they would
try to change the 19th-century Senate rule that requires closed
sessions for all debates on impeachment in which senators speak,
but odds are strong that the rule will be retained.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules established in 1868 for the trial of President
Andrew Johnson and still in force, senators must sit silently while
arguments are made and witnesses are questioned in open session.
When senators discuss among themselves motions on procedures and
even the final verdict, they must retire behind closed doors. Only
the final vote would be in public.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic senators, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone
of Minnesota, said at a news conference that the rule was a vestige
of a time when the Senate did most of its work in secret. Today,
most of the Senate's business is conducted not only in public but
on television, and in the case of impeachment, Wellstone
maintained, ``people in the country should have the opportunity to
watch this debate and be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But many other senators disagree. It would require a two-thirds
majority to change the rule. As a practical matter, Senate rules
are almost never changed except by unanimous consent.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday on CNN, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
held that the impeachment debate would be more fruitful without
instant public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are much better able to relate to each other and reach
compromises,'' McConnell said, ``when we are not under the glare of
cameras, which I must confess leads some to the temptation to
grandstand and be partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating that this position was not strictly a Republican
one, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., agreed with McConnell. On the
same CNN program, ``Late Edition,'' Dodd said, ``Nothing will
compel the Senate more to move more rapidly, in my view, than the
notion they will have to sit there gagged day after day.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican senator, Slade Gorton of Washington, said in
an interview that he was not sure deliberations on preliminary
questions should be in public but that he favored opening the final
debate on the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said the motion to change the rule would probably not be
offered for a couple of weeks _ after the opening statements by the
House managers and President Clinton's lawyers and a period set
aside for senators to pose questions to both sides by submitting
them in writing and having them read by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, the presiding officer during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said he was bringing the matter up now because he did not
think the public realized that senators would not have public
debates on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The opening statements and the question period will be in public
session and on television. But unless Harkin and Wellstone prevail,
the next big step, a debate among the senators over whether to call
witnesses, would be closed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the debate on the Harkin-Wellstone motion to change the
rule on open sessions would itself be closed. But as would be the
case with all other closed sessions in which the Senate is
officially sitting as an impeachment jury, a transcript would be
kept and presumably released quickly to the public.

GREEN SAYS CONTRACT EXTENSION MADE HIM A BETTER COACH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Like Bill Parcells in New York, Dan Reeves in
Atlanta and Mike Shanahan in Denver, Dennis Green, the Minnesota
Vikings' coach, is the biggest reason his team is one step away
from the Super Bowl. Green has guided the Vikings to the National
Football Conference title game against the Falcons on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Green is also on the verge of a financial windfall. A
victory against Atlanta and then a Super Bowl victory would make
Green the highest-paid coach in the league without a general
manager title.
</P>
<P>
   There are now two tiers of head coaches in the National Football
League; those like Seattle's Mike Holmgren or Parcells, who have
final say on everything, and others, like Green, who do not have
complete control written into their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If Green reaches his final two contractual incentives, meaning
the Vikings win a championship, it will put him at the top salary
tier of the latter group of coaches. He would rank ahead of coaches
like New Orleans' Mike Ditka, who earns a salary between $1.5
million and $2 million, San Francisco's Steve Mariucci, expected to
sign a contract worth about $1.5 million a season, and New
England's Pete Carroll, who earns between $1 million and $1.5
million a season.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the Vikings' owner, Red McCombs, signed Green to
a three-year, $4.65 million contract extension. Since the Vikings
finished the regular season 15-1 and are in the conference
championship game, Green has reached many of the incentives in his
contract, making the deal much more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person with knowledge of Green's contract, the
Vikings coach has triggered five of seven incentives in his deal,
including bonuses for making the playoffs, winning the division,
securing home-field advantage, selling out the Metrodome for each
regular-season home game and surpassing a specific number of
overall victories (the exact number is not known).
</P>
<P>
   Reaching those incentives have already netted Green an
additional $325,000 to his base salary of about $1.55 million. If
Green goes on to beat the Falcons, he would earn an additional
$125,000, and if the Vikings win the Super Bowl, he would receive
another $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's a total of $700,000 in additional money Green could earn,
putting his possible total contract over $2.2 million for this
year, pushing him well past any coach who is also not a general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches remaining in the playoffs have similar bonuses in
their contracts, but a league executive said he believed Green was
one of the few with an attendance-incentive clause.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings this year were just the third team in league history
to post 15 regular-season victories, joining the 1984 San Francisco
49ers and 1985 Chicago Bears. They set a league record for points
in a season with 556, finished undefeated at home for the first
time since 1989, and Green's regular-season winning percentage of
.634 surpassed that of Bud Grant, the former Vikings' coach who had
a .620 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the contract gave him peace of mind. He insisted that
Minnesota would not be 16-1 if he wasn't signed to a long-term deal
and was forced to be thinking about his future while trying to
coach.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, the only thing on Green's mind are the Falcons,
one of the biggest tests the Vikings have faced all year.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is the only team hotter than the Vikings. While
Minnesota hasn't lost since Nov. 1 against Tampa Bay, winning eight
straight games, the Falcons are on a 20-4 run going back to last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the first thing Minnesota would have to do to stop
Atlanta was stop running back Jamal Anderson, who this year rushed
for 1,846 yards and an NFC-high 14 touchdowns. What irritated Green
was that his defense missed too many tackles against Arizona's
Adrian Murrell on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't tackle well,'' Green said after the victory.
``That's something we're really going to have to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's defensive coaches weren't happy with some other
things that happened against the Cardinals, like the two penalties
in the red zone, allowing 1-yard touchdown runs on fourth down by
Arizona backs and the failure to sack quarterback Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between good and great is extraordinary
determination,'' Vikings defensive lineman Jerry Ball said. ``We
have to do better against Atlanta.''

2 NFL TEAMS HIRE COACHES; SCHOTTENHEIMER QUITS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coaching merry-go-round in the National Football League spun
wildly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Rhodes, dismissed two weeks ago as coach of the Philadelphia
Eagles, was named coach of the Green Bay Packers. Andy Reid, Brett
Favre's quarterback coach with the Packers, was named to succeed
Rhodes with the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   As an extra twist, Marty Schottenheimer resigned after 10 years
of coaching the Kansas City Chiefs to great success in the regular
season but not the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A key figure in all the twists and turns was Mike Holmgren, who
left the Packers last Friday to become the coach and general
manager of the Seattle Seahawks. The Eagles wanted Holmgren to
replace Rhodes, but with Holmgren unavailable, the Eagles took
Reid, a Packer assistant for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers needed a replacement for Holmgren and seemingly
wanted someone tougher. They turned to Rhodes and gave him a
four-year contract reported to be worth $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   At Philadelphia, Reid got a five-year contract believed to pay
$1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes' hiring had to please the league's hierarchy, which had
been concerned that since Tony Dungy became the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers' coach after the 1995 season, the 23 head coaches hired
were all white, and blacks had rarely been interviewed. Now the
league, which has 31 teams, again has three black head coaches _
Dennis Green of the Minnesota Vikings, Rhodes and Dungy.
</P>
<P>
   Three head-coaching vacancies remain _ with the Baltimore
Ravens, the Chicago Bears and the expansion Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old Rhodes earned five Super Bowl rings as a San
Francisco 49ers assistant, coaching there with Holmgren. When
Holmgren became the Packers' coach, Rhodes went with him. In 1994,
Rhodes left the Packers to become the 49ers' defensive coordinator.
He spent the last four years with the Eagles, starting with two
10-6 seasons and playoff berths before slumping to 6-9-1 and this
season's 3-13. His final Eagles team was last in the league in both
total offense and passing offense.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay finished this season 11-5 and lost the wild-card
playoff game to the 49ers. Ron Wolf, the Packers' general manager,
had said he wanted a coach who could provide ``a little electrical
shock'' for the players. Leroy Butler, their safety and a defensive
leader, expanded on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team will be tougher,'' Butler told The Milwaukee
Journal Sentinel. ``I think last year we had a lot of games where
we weren't tough and physical enough. Guys played tight. They
weren't worried about getting cut, but getting ridiculed.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Rhodes' return to Green Bay was unexpected. The
city's black population is small, and when he left he talked of a
limited social life and his daughters' isolation and loneliness
there.
</P>
<P>
   When Rhodes was the Packers' defensive coordinator in 1992 and
1993, Reid was an assistant on the staff, and they became close
friends. Still, Reid said last week that when the Eagles approached
him he did not talk to Rhodes about the job because, he said, ``I
don't want any influence like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles also interviewed Jim Haslett, the Pittsburgh
Steelers' defensive coordinator; Dom Capers, the Carolina Panthers'
deposed head coach, and Willie Shaw, the Oakland Raiders' defensive
coordinator. The Eagles signed Reid before he could go to Seattle
as Holmgren's offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   So at 40, Reid, who had never been a head coach at any level,
became the NFL's second-youngest head coach behind 35-year-old Jon
Gruden of the Oakland Raiders. Reid also became Holmgren's fourth
assistant _ after Rhodes, Gruden and the 49ers' Steve Mariucci _ to
become an NFL head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said he planned a West Coast passing offense with a
dominant quarterback, although he lacks one. But he impressed
Jeffrey Lurie, the Eagles' owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's confidence comes right at you,'' Lurie said. ``His
preparedness, his commanding presence, his sense of leadership, it
was pretty dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who needed more assurance, Reid provided it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to be pretty good at it,'' he said of his
new job.
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer was more than pretty good at Kansas City, where
his teams posted a 101-58-1 record over 10 years, second only in
the NFL to the 49ers' 123-37. Seven of his Chiefs teams made the
playoffs, but only one reached a championship game and Kansas City
lost it.
</P>
<P>
   His teams missed the playoffs the last two years, and this
season's team, with a 7-9 record, gave him his first losing season
in his 15 years as an NFL head coach. The worst moment came in a
Monday night game in November when the Chiefs committed five
personal fouls on the Denver Broncos' last touchdown drive in a
30-7 loss. Schottenheimer apologized. Lamar Hunt, the Chiefs'
owner, said the players' actions were a disgrace to the team and
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer, 55, said he did not know whether he would return
to pro football.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it boils down to is this _ 32 years in professional
football,'' he said. ``I've been coaching for 25 years. I just felt
that given 10 years to get it done and we really didn't accomplish
it, I thought it was time to let somebody else step in and take
over.''

CLINTON FORMALLY DENIES IMPEACHMENT CHARGES, SEEKS DISMISSAL OF
CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton formally denied the impeachment
charges against him Monday and asked the Senate to eventually
dismiss the case because it fails to meet the constitutional
standard for ending his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors, all Republicans, immediately responded that
the Democratic president's behavior in trying to conceal his affair
with Monica Lewinsky ``warrants conviction and removal'' from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In a refrain made familiar long before his historic impeachment
trial opened in the Senate last week, Clinton again acknowledged
his affair with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, but denied
lying to a grand jury or obstructing justice as he tried to keep
the affair secret.
</P>
<P>
   In a 13-page response to the two articles of impeachment
approved by the House, the president said the charges ``do not rise
to the level of `high crimes and misdemeanors' as contemplated by
the founding fathers, and they do not satisfy the rigorous
constitutional standard applied through our nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   While similar to arguments by the president's legal team and
Democratic supporters during the House impeachment hearings and
debate, the response filed Monday was the first since the Senate
last week officially opened his trial.
</P>
<P>
   While denying ``each and every'' allegation in the two articles
of impeachment, Clinton decided against filing motions at this time
seeking to dismiss the case until the Senate hears arguments from
House prosecutors and his legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the House prosecutors, or managers, filed no motions.
However, the 13-member team of managers, led by Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., is expected later to seek Senate permission to call
witnesses, including Lewinsky, to bolster the case against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart was asked whether the
president would personally answer questions at his Senate trial.
``I have no reason to believe that he will testify,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial, the first of a president since Andrew
Johnson in 1868, and only the second in U.S. history, resumes later
this week with the 55 Republican and 45 Democratic senators sitting
as jurors. A two-thirds majority is needed to convict and remove a
president. A simple majority is needed to dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging some resentment among House Republicans over the
Senate's unanimous decision last week to postpone any decision on
calling witnesses, Hyde said Monday this was ``not the time to get
angry.'' The senators will weigh the House prosecutors' evidence
and arguments.
</P>
<P>
   House managers will be prepared to present ``a compelling case''
for removing Clinton and hope the Senate will later be in ``a more
generous mood'' on the question of witnesses, Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``we wouldn't want to hang our hat just on the
question of witnesses,'' the Chicago Republican said during a break
in a closed-door strategy session with his team of managers.
</P>
<P>
   The documents filed Monday by Clinton's legal team and his House
prosecutors were a preview of their trial arguments and offered no
fresh perspectives on the evidence that fueled the Dec. 19,
party-line vote in the House to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's filing, his lawyers _ six private attorneys and
five members of the White House counsel's office _ outlined a
two-pronged rebuttal to the two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   First, the allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice are
unconstitutional because they are ``too vague to permit conviction
and removal of a duly elected president,'' Clinton's lawyers argue.
In addition, several accusations are unfairly lumped together in a
series under each charge.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Clinton is innocent of the charges, his lawyers assert
in the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they say, the charges that Clinton lied or misled
grand jurors about his relationship with Lewinsky are false.
``There is a myth about President Clinton's testimony before the
grand jury, that the president failed to admit his improper
intimate relationship with Ms. Monica Lewinsky,'' the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton denied committing perjury when he answered
questions before the grand jury about earlier testimony in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, in statements he permitted
his attorney to make in the case, and in connection with his
responses to questions about alleged efforts to influence others'
testimony in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the article alleging obstruction of justice,
Clinton denied encouraging Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in
the Jones case, encouraging her to testify falsely if called to
testify or sought to conceal evidence in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   He also denied obstructing justice by trying to help Lewinsky
secure a job in New York, by allowing his attorney to make
allegedly false statements, by relating false statements to a
potential witness, presidential secretary Betty Currie, and by
making false statements to his aides.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecution team disagreed, saying the allegations in
the articles of impeachment are examples of ``an ongoing pattern of
obstruction of justice and witness tampering over a period of
several months'' which compromised ``the integrity of the entire
judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the seriousness of the charges against Clinton, the House,
in a 105-page rebuttal to Clinton's filing, noted that two of the
three federal judges impeached in recent years ``were removed for
perjury that had nothing to do with their official duties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for the presidency as an
institution, because if the president is not convicted as a
consequence of the conduct that has been portrayed, then no House
of Representatives will ever be able to impeach again and no Senate
will ever convict,'' the team of prosecutors wrote. ``The bar will
be so high that only a convicted felon or a traitor will need to be
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine a future president, faced with possible
impeachment, pointing to the perjuries, lies, obstructions and
tampering with witnesses by the current occupant of the office as
not rising to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors?'' the
House prosecutors said. ``If this is not enough, what is?''

GAUGING NFL TEAM VALUE ON SEATS AND SUITES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last September, when Alfred Lerner bought the expansion
Cleveland Browns for $530 million, Howard Milstein insisted that
the economics of the deal kept him from budging above $450 million.
On Sunday, Milstein and his partner, Daniel Snyder, agreed to pay
the estate of Jack Kent Cooke $800 million for the Washington
Redskins and their stadium, the most ever paid for a domestic
sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   So if a team that hasn't played a game is worth $530 million and
another that lost more than it won this season is worth 50 percent
more, what is the value of the Jets, who are 13-4, including
Sunday's playoff victory?
</P>
<P>
   How can the Jets not be soaring in value, like Yahoo or
Amazon.com? The team is playing Denver for the American Football
Conference championship; no-shows at Giants Stadium are virtually
nil; sales of league-licensed Jets merchandise are ascending, and
Coach Bill Parcells is a turnaround specialist in the mold of Louis
Gerstner, who masterminded the resuscitation of IBM.
</P>
<P>
   So how high has the Jets' value soared? Not much, say sports
finance experts, despite the team's improved fortunes. What
separates the Jets from the Browns and Redskins is stadium
economics, not won-lost record. In this world, your luxury suites
matter more than your quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' cash flow from Giants Stadium is mediocre. But the
Browns' cash take will be terrific. And the Redskins' pockets
runneth over with money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets don't have good economics,'' said Paul Much, of
Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, an investment banking firm in
Chicago. ``The big difference is the revenues from luxury suites,
concessions, advertising and parking.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ozanian, statistics editor of Forbes magazine, which
recently valued the Jets at $259 million and the Giants at $288
million, said: ``The Jets' stadium economics is in the lower third
of the league. They won't get much better. I don't think it's
possible for them to get much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Those economics create a divide between teams because while the
National Football League shares more revenues than any other major
sport, there are some that it does not. All national television and
licensing revenues are shared equally. Visiting teams take home 40
percent of gate receipts, including revenue from club seats and the
game tickets for luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   But owners do not share the annual luxury suite rentals and
revenue from concessions, parking, advertising and stadium naming
rights. Teams with the most unshared money have more for free
agents and rich signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The leases for the Jets, Browns and Redskins show who is
winning:
</P>
<P>
   _ In a lease that expires in 2008, the Jets pay 15 percent of
gross receipts as rent to the New Jersey Sports &AMP; Exposition
Authority. The team gets 14{ percent of gross rentals from the 72
older luxury suites and one-third from 46 new suites and 120 club
seats (the revenue from the new suites and the club seats is split
with the Giants and the sports authority). The Jets also get half
the concessions cash from their games and 25 percent of the
authority's share from Giants games; 25 percent of net parking
revenues and 25 percent of the authority's share from Giants games
and 30 percent of revenues from nonscoreboard advertising.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Browns will get nearly every cent from their new
city-owned stadium _ except for annual rent of $250,000 _ including
the revenues from 116 luxury suites and 9,500 club seats, which
pays for waiter service on cushy chairs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Redskins get everything from Jack Kent Cooke Stadium,
because the late Redskins owner built it for $170 million (plus
$70.5 million from Maryland for infrastructure work), and all the
cash glories that come with it: 80,116 seats selling for $40 to $60
each; 280 luxury suites renting for $60,000 to $160,000 a year, and
15,044 luxury suites going for $995 to $1,995 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein, whose family real estate and banking holdings are
worth billions, knew he was buying more than a team struggling on
the field. He was buying another bank. Whether the Redskins are
worth $800 million is questionable. Ozanian recently valued the
team at $403 million, based on the 1997 season, and figured it
would sell for $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they'd come in for less than the Browns because the
Browns have no major competition; the Redskins have the Ravens
nearby,'' he said. ``I am astonished. I just don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozanian suggested that Milstein and Snyder could sell part of
the Redskins to the public, a structure the NFL frowns upon but may
have to consider as franchise prices move toward the billion-dollar
level.
</P>
<P>
   With his football dream nearly complete _ pending NFL owners'
approval _ Milstein will sell his and his brother Edward's 45
percent share of the Islanders. The Milsteins thought it would be
easier to negotiate a deal with Nassau County to replace
revenue-scarce Nassau Coliseum. But even a new arena would never be
a hockey equivalent of the Cooke Mint _ or any other where the team
owns the arena _ because revenues would have to be shared with the
county.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gluckstern, who owns 45 percent of the Islanders, said in
a statement: ``We have been approached by and may consider a number
of potential partners who would reflect my own commitment to a
stable, strong and resourceful ownership group.''

ADVISERS RECOMMEND THAT CLINTON DENY CLEMENCY TO POLLARD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's key national security advisers
have recommended that Clinton deny clemency to Jonathan Jay
Pollard, an American who spied for Israel, administration officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has informed the White
House that there is no compelling foreign policy reason to release
Pollard, the officials said. The director of central intelligence,
George Tenet, sent a letter to the president Monday urging that
Clinton keep Pollard in federal prison, where he is serving a life
sentence for espionage. Secretary of Defense William Cohen made the
same recommendation more than a week ago, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The senior officials were responding to a White House request to
provide recommendations on the Pollard case by Monday. Attorney
General Janet Reno, the other senior administration official asked
to make a recommendation, has not yet responded, officials said.
But the Federal Bureau of Investigation has urged her to ask the
president not to free Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   During the Middle East talks at Wye, Md., in October, the
president agreed to conduct an accelerated review of the case in
order to placate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and
win his support for the peace agreement. On the last day of the
talks, Netanyahu demanded Pollard's freedom in exchange for
agreeing to the peace deal. But Clinton agreed only to review the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in other agencies saw Ms. Albright's recommendation as
significant, since the Israeli request for Pollard's release had
come as part of diplomatic negotiations. Her response that the
Pollard matter was not a significant factor in American-Israeli
relations could make it difficult for Clinton to argue that he must
release Pollard in order to save the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three reviews by the Clinton administration has been
prompted by Israeli pressure on the White House, but each time
Clinton's advisers have unanimously opposed Pollard's release. They
have consistently argued that Pollard was one of the most damaging
spies in recent American history, one who betrayed costly high-tech
spy satellites as well as agents working under cover overseas. A
former Naval intelligence analyst, Pollard spied for Israel for at
least 18 months in 1984 and 1985, and turned over enough highly
classified documents to fill a room, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was arrested in November 1985, and, after pleading
guilty, was sentenced to life in prison in 1987 after then-Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger provided the judge in the case with a
classified report detailing the extent of Pollard's espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pollard, with the help of the Israeli government and some
Jewish-American groups, has mounted a long-running lobbying
campaign designed to win his release. They have argued that, while
he did spy, he worked on behalf of an ally rather than an American
enemy. They add that he has already served long enough, and that
the government reneged on an agreement not to seek life in prison
at the time of his sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected such pleas in his two previous reviews of the
case in 1993 and 1996. But many in the national security community
have been deeply concerned that Clinton would finally give in this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet was so concerned that, during the Wye talks, he told
Clinton he would be forced to resign if Clinton released Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, officials said that the president has not
yet decided whether to release Pollard, and has no deadline for
making the decision. `Once we get in the viewpoints from the
relevant agencies, we will assess what direction the review needs
to take,'' said a White House official. ``This is not necessarily
going to be a highly structured thing.'' White House counsel
Charles Ruff and National Security Adviser Samuel Berger will play
key roles in advising the president on the decision, officials
added.

U.S. BECOMING ISOLATED IN U.N. ON IRAQ SANCTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also IRAQ-U.S.) 
(sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States is finding itself
increasingly isolated in its Iraq policy as a growing number of
Security Council members and Arab nations support lifting an
embargo on Iraqi oil sales or significantly relaxing sanctions in
other ways to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to what the Iraqis may hope, there is also solid
agreement that long-term international supervision is needed to
prevent Iraq from acquiring or developing prohibited weapons. Among
proposals to be discussed are the creation of a new inspection
system and ways to monitor money that Iraq would earn if it sold
oil freely.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to retain the existing system
and the right to use the military to enforce it, although the
majority of Security Council members oppose further use of force
without council approval.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has focused on keeping sanctions in force until Iraq
complies with all disarmament requirements. The United States would
be willing only to expand a program that allows Iraq to sell a
limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the American representative on the council, said
in an interview on Monday night that undoing existing resolutions
that govern those policies would not be easy and that no other
delegation has proposed a concrete way to make the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole body of what I think everyone would agree is
international law can't just be wished away,'' he said, adding,
``The disarmament issue is the key to the lifting of sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not convinced that the proposals for the lifting of
sanctions are actually gaining a wide momentum,'' he said. ``While
there are various delegations and governments that are making
comments about the lifting of sanctions or the modification of
sanctions, how those would relate to the body of resolutions
pertaining to Iraq is not at all clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Although any change in Security Council policies could be
blocked by an American veto, Washington wants its policy to have
the backing of the council and does not want to find itself alone.
Administration officials have also acknowledged that if the United
States uses its veto to keep sanctions in force, over time they
could erode.
</P>
<P>
   Some council members say the debate is an urgent one because
there are no inspectors in Iraq now and no work is being done
there. On Monday, the chief arms inspector, Richard Butler, said
that he had suspended surveillance flights by American U-2's and
French aircraft while the Security Council discusses the crisis.
But the council has no timetable for the discussions, which could
take weeks or even months.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is finding that the core group opposed to its
policies on Iraq _ formed around Russia, China, France and
sometimes Brazil _ has strengthened with the entry of at least two
new council members, Malaysia and Namibia, which will hold two-year
rotating seats. Malaysia in particular is opposed to sanctions in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats are also watching Canada and the Netherlands,
two other new members, for signs of where they will stand. In
Amsterdam on Monday, the Dutch representative on the United Nations
Special Commission to disarm Iraq supported the view that sanctions
could be rewritten while the arms inspections system remained in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, Koos Ooms, said this would rebuild unity in
the Security Council and ``would at least snatch away from Saddam
Hussein the weapon of being able to say that the Iraqi people are
suffering because of the sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The French government says it is preparing new proposals for the
council to end the oil embargo but institute other controls.
Lifting the embargo would free up the economy and permit increased
imports, allowing those Iraqis who can afford it to use their money
to buy food and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Even the British, the strongest ally of the United States on
Iraq policy, now favor a new inspection system, Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Monday in an open letter to the French newspaper
Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, the chief arms inspector, also acknowledged on Monday
that a change in the inspection system seems inevitable. He said
whatever system emerges from the council debates ``would be a bit
different from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization and this job of mine is under a microscope
at the moment,'' he said on Monday at an arms control conference in
Washington sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in Moscow, Russia's Foreign Ministry called again for
the dismissal of Butler, the executive chairman of the Special
Commission, after reports last week that the United States used the
commission for espionage. The commission, known as UNSCOM, has been
responsible for disarming Iraq since 1991. The sanctions, imposed
in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, were linked to arms inspections
at the end of the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan defended Butler on Monday. ``I
don't think the issue is Butler,'' he told reporters, after
repeating that he had no evidence that Butler had cooperated with
United States in spying on Iraq. ``I don't think the issue is
UNSCOM. We are dealing with much larger issues about compliance of
Iraq and stability in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Blair, in his letter to Liberation, wrote that Britain agreed
with the United States that an expansion of the ``oil for food''
program would be the best way to aid Iraqi civilians. Iraq is now
permitted to sell up to $5.2 billion in oil every six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are holding talks with France and other eminent members of
the Security Council to find a formula allowing monitoring to
resume in Iraq,'' he wrote, ``but under a new system that would
avoid the inspectors' presence creating a new crisis every three
months.''
</P>
<P>
   For the council, the major problem is how to separate the
sanctions issues from disarmament without giving any ground, real
or psychological, to Saddam, whom even some Arab nations now openly
condemn. Furthermore, no one has put forward a plan for winning
Iraq's cooperation or creating an enforcement system.
</P>
<P>
   The council will meet on Tuesday to look at the relief situation
in Iraq, its president for January, Celso L.N. Amorim of Brazil,
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we're able to address the broader political issues of
Iraq,'' he said, ``we have to address some concrete steps that can
be taken both on the humanitarian file and the disarmament file.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the inertia that has seized the council on the
subject of Iraq, Amorim, said, ``There was a general feeling that
the Security Council has to deal substantively with the issue,
which is hasn't been doing for the past two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Arabs, the moment is a particularly delicate one, said
Clovis Maksoud, a former Arab League representative at the United
Nations who is now director of the Center for the Global South at
American University in Washington. He said recent American and
British actions _ including the December air strikes and possible
misuse of the Special Commission for spying by Washington _ have
created crises in both the United Nations and the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
   Although few if any diplomats would have predicted less than a
month ago, when American and British air strikes hit Iraq, that
Saddam would be this isolated at a critical moment for him, Arabs
say their governments are aware of how volatile public opinion in
the Middle East can be.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Saddamcalled on Arab populations to overthrow
governments critical of him. Arab governments, with Egypt in the
lead, are sending emissaries to Baghdad to ask the Iraqis to cool
the polemics, diplomats said. They saw some success in the
relatively muted session of the Iraqi Parliament held over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While there are Arab leaders who would like to see Saddam out of
power, they would have trouble supporting more American attacks and
would not be able to back an overthrow from outside, Maksoud said.
</P>
<P>
   But among the Arabs, Maksoud said, there would be great support
for a change in sanctions that helped free, at least economically,
the Iraqi middle class while arms control inspections remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a widespread crisis of conscience about the Iraqi
people,'' he said. At the same time, Arabs do not want to see the
United States or Britain portray themselves as the Iraqis'
protectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rubs the Arab psyche very badly,'' Maksoud said.

CHARGES `TOO VAGUE,' CLINTON LAWYERS ARGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers opened their defense
Monday in his impeachment trial, arguing that the Senate should
drop the charges because they are grounded in ``myth,'' are ``too
vague,'' and are too minor to constitute ``high crimes and
misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Also meeting deadlines to file written briefs in the first
presidential impeachment trial in 131 years, House managers said
they will present ``overwhelming'' evidence that Clinton deserves
to be removed from office on charges that he lied to a federal
grand jury and obstructed justice to try to conceal his affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence contained in the record, when viewed as a unified
whole, overwhelmingly supports both charges,'' the House managers
argued in a 105-page brief. ``If this is not enough, what is?''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, as they have for months, presented starkly opposing
views of the evidence and summarized their cases in sharply
contrasting styles. The House produced a voluminous brief with
flourishes of outrage at Clinton's alleged actions, while Clinton's
team filed a tersely worded document aimed at scoring precise legal
points.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers, echoing an argument that failed in the House,
filed a 13-page document portraying the president's ``wrongdoing''
as the product of an adulterous husband trying to avoid public
embarrassment rather than corruptly interfere with a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   With House managers scheduled to begin opening arguments on
Thursday, the president's lawyers asserted that the charges ``do
not rise to the level of `high crimes and misdemeanors' as
contemplated by the Founding Fathers, and they do not satisfy the
rigorous consititutional standard applied throughout our Nation's
history. Accordingly, the Articles of Impeachment should be
dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the House managers, all conservative Republicans,
cast the impeachment trial as crucial to the nation's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for the presidency as an institution
because if the president is not convicted as a consequence of the
conduct that has been portrayed, then no House of Representatives
will ever be able to impeach again and no Senate will ever
convict,'' the House managers concluded in their brief. ``The bar
will be so high that only a convicted felon or a traitor will need
to be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, on the advice of Senate Democrats, decided to
forgo filing a motion to dismiss the charges until after both sides
have presented their opening statements. The House also waived its
right to file pretrial motions, which means the Senate will not be
in session Wednesday to rule on motions.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bipartisan pact reached last week, the Senate agreed to
postpone until Jan. 25 or Jan. 26 the questions of whether to
dismiss the charges or whether to extend the trial by granting a
request by the House managers to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Henry J. Hyde, the lead House manager as chairman
of the Judiciary Committee, Monday reiterated the group's desire to
call as many as 10 witnesses but refrained from criticizing the
Senate for putting off the question. ``This is a difficult time,''
Hyde said. ``This is not the time to get angry at the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde added: ``We feel that we will do a very good job and then
when we reach the point of asking for witnesses, we think the
senators will be in a more generous mood having heard our case.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hyde gives a brief introduction on Thursday,
Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin will deliver
for the House his opening statement, which he said Monday will be
``action packed.'' Representative Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas is in
charge of orchestrating the rest of the House's presentation, which
could continue Friday and Saturday, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have 24 hours over three days to present their
opening statements. Clinton's 11-member legal defense team is
scheduled to begin its opening statement next Tuesday, Jan. 19,
just hours before the president plans to deliver his State of the
Union address to a joint session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As the president's lawyers and House managers prepared for the
first presidential impeachment trial since Andrew Johnson's in
1868, Clinton met during the day with Argentine President Carlos
Menem and entertained him Monday night with a black-tie state
dinner featuring a tango performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House broke with longstanding tradition by
refusing to permit reporters to cover the start of the meetings and
deciding against holding a joint news conference, even though Menem
had expected one.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the impeachment case and Lewinsky scandal were
expected to dominate the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``In looking at the schedule, we didn't think it was the most
productive use of his time,'' said Joseph Lockhart, the White House
spokesman. ``I also think that, given the prerogatives of the
Senate, that's where the discussions will be going forward on this
issue, and that's where it should go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Both briefs that were filed Monday strayed little from the
positions each side took during impeachment proceedings in the
House, where the two charges were approved on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   In a new twist, though, Clinton's lawyers argued that the
impeachment articles violate Senate rules by dividing the charges
into multiple counts: four of lying under oath, and seven of
obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   With a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, required to convict
Clinton of either charge, his lawyers argued that Clinton
ostensibly could be convicted of lying under oath, for instance, if
four different groups of 17 senators _ a total of 68 _ each
supported only one element of the four-count offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creates the very real possibility that conviction could
occur even though senators were in wide disagreement as to the
alleged wrong committed,'' Clinton's lawyers stated. ``By charging
multiple wrongs in one article, the House of Representatives has
made it impossible for the Senate to comply with the Constitutional
mandate that any conviction be by the concurrence of two-thirds of
the members.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers also argued that both impeachment charges
are too vague because they fail to cite specific statements in
which Clinton allegedly lied to the grand jury and the specific
acts he allegedly undertook to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   The House document laid out a general account of the allegations
in each count, all of which were raised in the House proceedings.
But the brief promised more specifics during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The document states that ``it is not, and is not intended to be,
a substitute for a trial at which all of the relevant facts will be
developed.''

ARIZONA'S `OFFICIAL ENGLISH LAW' DEAD _ OR IS IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona's ``official English'' law is dead after more
than a decade of legal wrangling, but a national group, U.S.
English, is vowing to put the issue back on the state's ballot in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of the road,'' Bob Park of Arizonans for
Official English said Monday after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected
the group's appeal to revive the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's ruling, made without comment, represented the
final blow for Arizona's constitutional amendment, which declared
English the state's official language and required its use in most
government transactions. The Arizona Supreme Court struck it down
in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anyplace else for us to go,'' Park, of Prescott,
said. ``It's over and done with.'' Park ran for governor in 1998 on
the Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Yet national official English groups and their political allies,
including Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., cast Monday's decision as merely
a speed bump.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect is localized to Arizona,'' said Eric Stone,
research director for U.S. English, a 1.3 million-member group
pushing to make English the country's official language.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said his group likely will return to the state in 2000
with a less-restrictive official English ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to rectify the situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four other states have passed laws designating English as
their official language. Arizona's law was seen as the toughest,
although it was put in legal limbo almost immediately after voters
narrowly approved it in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The measure declared English ``the language of the ballot, the
public schools and all government functions and actions.'' It
applied to all government officials and employees on government
business.
</P>
<P>
   Other languages could be used only to help students learn
English, to teach foreign languages, comply with federal laws,
protect public health or safety, or protect the rights of criminal
defendants or crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney Stephen Montoya, who filed the original lawsuit
challenging the measure, called Monday's ruling the end of a ``long
and hard fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did I know that it would take 11 years to resolve the
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A group of elected officials and public employees joined Montoya
in challenging the amendment in state court in 1992. They said they
regularly speak Spanish with members of the public, many of whom do
not speak English well, and that a ban on doing so would keep them
from serving the public.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, and
the Arizona Supreme Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment violates the federal Constitution's free-speech
and equal-protection guarantees by creating ``a linguistic barrier
between persons and the government they have a right to petition,''
the state's top court said.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya predicted the U.S. Supreme Court's action would undercut
efforts by a California group to export a ballot measure banning
bilingual education to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion has affirmed the right of teachers to communicate
with their students in languages other than English,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any anti-bilingual education legislation that would undermine
the right of a teacher to communicate with a student other than in
English is going to be subject to some type of challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Stump last week introduced a bill modeled on Arizona's law,
making English the official language of the federal government and
requiring that all official government business be conducted solely
in English. It also would ban bilingual education and bilingual
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Stump called Monday's decision disappointing,
but added, ``I do not consider it a defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling may be an indication that this is an area in which
Congress should act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates of official English agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some feeling that Congress can get away with
passing a very minimal law or leaving it up to the states. The
Supreme Court has foreclosed that option,'' said Jim Boulet Jr.,
executive director of English First, a national official English
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for Congress to fish or cut bait,'' Boulet said.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya hopes Monday's ruling ends the official English debate
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Arizona realizes now that this issue is not
worthwhile,'' he said. ``English is not being threatened. Everyone
in Arizona either speaks English, is learning English or direly
wants to learn English.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the whole predicate for English only in Arizona _ that
English was somehow endangered or mortally challenged _ I think it
has been exposed to be a fallacy.'' &QL;

DEMOCRATS SPLIT ON CLINTON MESSAGE TO CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week before President Clinton is scheduled to
deliver his annual State of the Union address, many of his
Democratic allies in the Senate are divided over whether he should
postpone the Jan. 19 speech because of his impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has caused a rare split between the two Massachusetts
senators _ Edward M. Kennedy, who wants Clinton to give the speech
as scheduled, and John F. Kerry, who backs a delay.
</P>
<P>
   In all, half of the six Democratic senators from New England
favor Clinton putting off his appearance before a joint session of
the House and Senate until the trial ends, while the others want
him to go ahead with it.
</P>
<P>
   With the White House, at least temporarily, refusing to delay
the president's date with Congress, the issue has caused a crack in
the Democratic unity seen so far in the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats _ ranging from the highly respected defender of Senate
prerogatives, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, to California Senator
Dianne Feinstein and Connecticut's two senators, Joseph I.
Lieberman and Christopher J. Dodd _ have joined some Republicans in
calling for Clinton to postpone his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Kerry, in one of his first public comments on the issue,
joined that chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to be blind or obtuse not to acknowledge a certain
awkwardness in the evening, which could conceivably foster some
anger, and I would want to be very wary of that,'' Kerry said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally see no harm whatsoever'' in delaying the speech,
he added. ``I don't think people will interpret it as business
isn't being done. It's just acknowledging that a certain
presumptive process is going on on the Hill and you are going to be
deferential to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy and Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island,
said Clinton should go ahead with his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the president does not delay his address,'' Kennedy
said. ``The nation's business is too important.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed agreed, saying Clinton ``should continue to advocate an
agenda for the American people, and one of the best places to do
that is the State of the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, said Clinton
should delay the speech if the Senate trial is a day or two from
ending. But if the trial has weeks to go by next Tuesday, he should
deliver the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop of Democratic division, the House
Republican leadership Monday signaled it was moving ahead with the
scheduled date, ignoring some lawmakers' suggestions that the House
could ``disinvite'' the president.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``Dear Republican Colleague'' letter sent Monday, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and House Majority Leader
Richard Armey of Texas outlined the legislative calendar for the
next few weeks. It begins: ``The House will meet on January 19th
for the State of the Union Address.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton met Monday with advisers on his State of
the Union, while aides insisted he would go ahead with it. The
speech could come only hours after his lawyers are scheduled to
begin their opening statements in the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to give the speech on the 19th,'' said White House
press secretary Joseph Lockhart. ``I have every reason to believe
and no reason to believe otherwise that he won't be there on
January 19th, giving his State of the Union.''
</P>
<P>
   From the White House perspective, the prime-time address
presents the perfect juxtaposition for Clinton: He can show himself
focused on the nation's business, even as senators are holding an
impeachment trial that few believe will result in his removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not allow himself to get sidetracked from the people's
business,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he understood Clinton's rationale for not postponing
the speech. ``He thinks it's important to do the business of the
country, and this is the business of the country. He obviously
doesn't agree with the charges, and he does feel, as many of us do,
that the process was biased and partisan'' in the House, Kerry
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's really up to him,'' Kerry continued. ``It's a
judgment he's got to make in the context of his agenda. But I
personally don't see anything perjorative in delaying it. It might
even be taken as a sign of good will in respect to the obvious
awkwardness of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution does not require an annual State of the Union
address. It simply states that the president ``shall from time to
time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union.''
It does not specify when or how often.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington gave a brief State of the Union speech in
January 1790, but presidents from Thomas Jefferson to Theodore
Roosevelt have been content to send written messages to Congress.
Woodrow Wilson revived the speech format for the State of the
Union, and Harry Truman was the first president to use it to lay
out specific policy ideas, as Clinton now does.
</P>
<P>
   Political science professor Stephen Wayne of Georgetown
University, an expert on both Congress and the presidency, said
Clinton ``needs all the friends he can get up there right now, and
to the extent that some of them tell him don't do it, then I don't
think he should do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You don't want to alienate anybody at this point.''

JETS NOTEBOOK: PARCELLS WANTS TO WEED OUT ERRORS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The two old friends, a pair of obsessive
coaches, were gabbing in the Giants Stadium parking lot Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells' Jets had just defeated Tom Coughlin's Jaguars to
advance to the American Football Conference championship game. They
spoke for only five minutes. They go back to the Super Bowl Giants
of 1991, when Parcells was the boss and Coughlin was the receivers
coach.
</P>
<P>
   So, were they talking of old times? Or how heartbreaking defeat
was for Jacksonville? Or of how far Parcells had taken the Jets?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. They were discussing mistakes. This is what
drives them, and almost drove Parcells, crazy.
</P>
<P>
   For despite the 34-24 victory, Parcells had moments when he
wondered whether the Jets might blow this thing, that their playoff
inexperience was showing, that the dumb plays he warned could send
a team home might actually be unfolding before him. And he berated
himself for his own questionable call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you believe our guy tried to lateral?'' Coughlin moaned
to Parcells about one of the game's big plays, when Chris Hudson
unwisely tried a lateral after picking up Curtis Martin's fumble.
The ball was recovered by Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you believe the play at the half?'' countered Parcells,
speaking of how Otis Smith and Jerome Henderson were beaten by
Jimmy Smith on a 52-yard touchdown strike as the half ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe our guy tried to get it out of the end zone?''
retorted Coughlin, still smarting over the fact that Donovin Darius
unwisely tried to run out an interception, but instead was tackled
at the 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells came back with still another ``Do you believe ... .''
and then concluded, ``That's the way kids are today.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have mentioned special teamers being suckered by a
faked lateral from Reggie Barlow, who returned a kickoff 88 yards.
``We had someone assigned there,'' Parcells said Monday, ``and
three guys ran over and that left a bit of a hole up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the Vinny Testaverde interception, as well as a Wayne
Chrebet fumble and the Martin fumble. And there was Parcells' odd
decision for Testaverde to throw the ball into the end zone when a
field goal would have virtually clinched the game. (''I thought we
could have surprised them,'' Parcells said.)
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Parcells seemed unwilling Monday to dwell on errors. In
fact, he seemed almost solicitous of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you make mistakes the first time you play in cold
weather,'' he explained. ``We practiced in it, but it's not the
same. The last-second play at the half allowed them to breathe. The
pressure of these games _ I wouldn't excuse it, but it's our first
time in it. Maybe we're over it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the game did highlight his distress at some of the
special teams' play this season. That 88-yard return was the
longest the club had yielded. It has given up a punt return for a
touchdown during the regular campaign, something that the Jets
prevented all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has said that when next season's summer camp begins, he
will involve his experienced players more in the special teams. One
of them, Chris Hayes, produced three tackles against the Jaguars
and has been a strong performer all year.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells isn't happy unless he's unhappy, and he had a few
items to groan about Monday. He seemed to turn his attention more
quickly to Denver, though. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JUST 2 FUMBLES FOR MARTIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells has always warned his players: ``If you fumble, I
won't play you.'' Curtis Martin has run 405 times this season,
including the playoffs. The lost fumble was only his second. That
average of one lost ball about every 200 carries is double that of
his predecessor, Adrian Murrell, now with Arizona, who fumbled
twice as often.
</P>
<P>
   A SUPER COMPARISON? &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jumbo Elliott compared the Jets' task on Sunday to his Super
Bowl-winning Giants' team following the 1990 season. The left
tackle recalled that the Giants played the National Conference
championship at San Francisco, which was heavily favored. They were
the defending Super Bowl champions. The Broncos, this year's
defenders, are favored by 8 points on Sunday for the American
Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Parcells said this is not the same. ``Certainly, San
Francisco was formidable, but they were the two-time Super Bowl
champions,'' Parcells said. And he believes his 1990 Giants team
had a better defense.

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton formally defended himself on
Monday for the first time against removal from office by the
Senate, arguing that he had committed no crimes and that the
charges against him are so vague and muddled that they are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, prosecutors drawn from the House of Representatives
released a scorching memorandum mapping out the case for a criminal
presidential coverup that they will begin to present on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling documents, filed in response to deadlines imposed by
the Senate, drew on the same body of evidence to provide
night-and-day versions of whether Clinton lied under oath and
obstructed justice to hide his affair with Monica Lewinsky _ and
whether the charges against him could warrant ejecting a president
from office for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   None of the wrongdoing of which the president is accused, his
lawyers argued, reaches the level of ``high crimes or
misdemeanors,'' the constitutional standard for removal from
office. ``The charges in the two articles of impeachment do not
permit the conviction and removal from office of a duly elected
president,'' they wrote in their 13-page brief.
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors took a far different view of the
charges and the stakes. ``If the president is not convicted as a
consequence of the conduct that has been portrayed,'' they wrote,
reprising arguments made before the House Judiciary Committee,
``then no House of Representatives will ever be able to impeach
again and no Senate will ever convict. The bar will be so high that
only a convicted felon or a traitor will need to be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In an intensifying flurry of paper, the filings came as each
side refined its legal and political arguments in preparation for
Thursday. The defense filing on Monday was in response to a summons
from the Senate last Friday. On Wednesday, the president's team is
expected to provide the Senate with a fuller brief rebutting
Monday's prosecutorial document, which at 105 pages contained much
more detail.
</P>
<P>
   Although he met briefly with his lawyers and political team this
morning, Clinton did not comment in public on his filing. Instead,
he presided over the state visit by President Carlos Menem of
Argentina, greeting him in the Grand Foyer on Monday morning,
meeting with him at length and holding a state dinner for him this
evening. In an unusual move, the White House did not schedule a
joint press conference for the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton sat down with Menem at the White House, nine of
the 13 House prosecutors toured the floor of the Senate, where new
tables were installed over the weekend for the prosecution and
defense tea
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spent two hours Monday afternoon in the Oval Office
with his senior advisers to discuss his State of the Union Message.
The White House said that despite the objections even of some
Democrats, Clinton still planned to give the speech to both houses
of Congress on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   To contest charges that Clinton lied under oath and obstructed
justice, his lawyers boiled down their previous lengthy factual
arguments into a tightly focused summary. They attacked what they
called myths about his sworn testimony before the grand jury
investigating his relationship with Lewinsky. He simply did not
tell lies that the House accused him of telling, they said.
</P>
<P>
   They said, for example, that it was a myth ``that the president
failed to admit his improper intimate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they noted, Clinton read a prepared statement at the
beginning of his testimony acknowledging ``inappropriate intimate
contact.'' The statement's intent, the lawyers wrote, was to permit
prosecutors to ``obtain necessary information without unduly
dwelling on the salacious details of the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors tried to turn that same statement
against the president, saying that it ``contained totally false
assertions and other clearly misleading information.''
</P>
<P>
   On the charges of obstruction of justice, the president's
lawyers saw sweeping vindication where the prosecutors saw an
absurdly narrow interpretation of the facts. Clinton's defense, as
presented on Monday, relies heavily on Lewinsky statement to the
grand jury _ unprompted by prosecutors _ that ``no one every asked
me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Expecting that argument, the prosecutors had prepared a salvo of
derision, turning against Clinton a favorite White House term for
describing his ability to divide his attention. The evidence, they
wrote, ``cannot be compartmentalized.'' Events and words that seem
innocent, they added, ``may well take on a sinister, or even
criminal, connotation when observed in the context of the whole
plot.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House brief was delivered to the Secretary of the
Senate at 11:48 a.m. by G. Timothy Saunders, Clinton's executive
clerk, who routinely ferries White House documents to the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   While it responded on Monday as mandated to the Senate summons,
the White House passed up an opportunity to file motions
challenging the charges or the conduct of the trial by 5 p.m. Such
motions, White House aides said, could have delayed the trial for
weeks, and they are eager to move it along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the judgment that the Senate should go forward in the
way they're going forward, and we shouldn't try to pre-empt this
process before both sides have had a chance to make their case,''
said Joseph Lockhart, the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican senators voted unanimously on Friday
to approve the procedure for conducting the trial, and if the White
House had objected, it may have appeared to be playing the spoiler.
The move might have alienated some of the jurors Clinton needs.
Filing motions, said one senior Clinton adviser, ``didn't seem like
something that would be welcomed or effective.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House signaled that if the Senate chooses to
extend the trial beyond prosecution and defense presentations to
the calling of witnesses, it will probably file motions challenging
the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Those motions could include one arguing that the charges against
Clinton should be dropped because they are woefully imprecise. For
the first time on Monday, Clinton's lawyers advanced that line of
reasoning in their brief, using it to assault each of the two
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the article accusing Clinton of perjury
identifies no specific perjurious statements. ``One of the
fundamental principles of our law and the Constitution is that a
person has a right to know what specific charges he or she is
facing,'' the lawyers wrote, warning that otherwise a trial
``becomes a moving target for the accused.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, they argued, the first article is ``fatally flawed''
because it bundles together multiple accusations of perjury by
Clinton in his grand jury testimony, without listing individual
statements. As a result, they wrote, Clinton could be convicted by
senators who disagreed widely about his wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if 34 senators agreed that Clinton perjured himself in
Answer X, and a different 34 senators agreed that he perjured
himself in Answer Y, the Senate would have the requisite 68 votes
to convict him _ even though the 68 senators did not all agree
about what he had done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also argued that the second article of impeachment,
accusing the president of obstruction of justice ``provides little
or no concrete information about the specific acts in which the
president is alleged to have engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brief the lawyers drew heavily on Lewinsky's testimony in
attacking the charge of obstruction of justice, but not in
attacking the charge of perjury. The reason is that Lewinsky's
testimony conflicts with the president's on some issues central to
the perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are seizing on the portions of Lewinsky's testimony
that they find helpful while downplaying those that hurt.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Lockhart was pressed to say whether, in
including Lewinsky's testimony in their filing, Clinton's lawyers
were endorsing her truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that they were not. ``The inclusion of her
testimony is an acknowledgment of her testimony,'' he said. He
called the quotations in the brief ``a useful piece of information
for the senators as they move forward to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart repeated a previous assertion that the White House
would not attack Lewinsky's credibility. ``For a year now, people
in this building have not atacked her, and I don't expect that to
change,'' he said.

<P>
   AMARILLO, Texas _ On the very cold morning of Sept. 7, 1804,
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark climbed to the domed top of a
70-foot Nebraska mound overlooking the Missouri River, where they
``discovered a Village of Small animals,'' their journal says. In
their travels all the way to the Rocky Mountains, they saw millions
of the little yapping things, which they first called ground rats,
then barking squirrels and eventually prairie dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two centuries later, seated behind the battered metal
desk in his office on old Route 66 just west of Amarillo, George
Carlisle, an exterminator who has been fumigating grain and
poisoning prairie dogs for more than 40 years, rolled a small gray
disk of aluminum phosphide between his thumb and forefinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do, you see, is we take three or four of these and we
just chunk 'em down a prairie dog hole and then cover it up with
dirt or crumpled newspaper,'' he said. ``They'll sit down there and
the moisture will cause them to give off the poison. Prairie dogs
are cute, but they're a nuisance. They eat up the grass, create all
these holes that livestock can step in, carry disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost any day now, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will
announce, in response to a petition from the National Wildlife
Federation, whether it sees sufficient cause for a nine-month study
to decide if black-tailed prairie dogs, whose numbers once ran into
the billions, should be listed as a threatened species. That
designation would provide them with protection on public land and
give the government some power to protect them on private lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People either hate these animals or they love them,'' Kevin
Mote, a Texas state biologist in Lubbock, said of the prairie dog.
``I happen to work with those who love them. But it's probably the
most controversial conservation issue that we have in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   To many private landowners _ especially in places, like the
Texas cattle country, where the governing ethos is ``don't tell me
what to do with my land'' _ prairie dogs are more numerous than the
trees and are regarded as nothing but pests.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of declaring such creatures threatened, and giving
the government another lever to dictate the use of private land, is
greeted by most ranchers and farmers with the same sort of
incredulity that might greet declaring cockroaches a threatened
species in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, the prairie dog has few friends out there on the
prairie, and many enemies,'' said Thomas France, chief counsel for
the National Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists say two centuries of human encroachment have
brought the species close to a crisis. Urban and agricultural
growth have cut their habitat, once more than 100 million acres
scattered between the Dakotas and the escarpments of Central Texas,
by more than 99 percent, down to an estimated 700,000 acres.
Individual prairie dog villages, which once covered as much as 100
miles and had more than a million residents, have become small,
isolated and endangered enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   None of the states that are home to prairie dogs have policies
to protect them, though each has policies regarding their control
or extermination. Hunters can shoot as many prairie dogs as they
like, and routinely use the creatures for target practice.
</P>
<P>
   There are still considerable populations of black-tailed prairie
dogs in Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming. But in other places,
including Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas and New
Mexico, their numbers have dropped sharply. In Arizona, they are
extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the prairie dog does need some
additional conservation,'' said Tim Heron, a spokesman for the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
   But, he and others ask, does that mean they need federal
protection?
</P>
<P>
   ``These animals are a serious hazard to agriculture and
potentially human health, because of the danger of a cowboy's horse
stepping into one of these holes and breaking a leg,'' said Texas
state Sen. Teel Bivins. ``They eat the grass, nub it down to
nothing, which takes food away from livestock. And during droughts,
like this summer, they can actually kill the plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists say such fears are based on misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impacts to ranching are not supported by science, and the
kind of poisoning campaigns that are conducted are based on myth
and anecdotal information,'' France said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the oft-repeated warning that livestock and horses might
step into a prairie dog hole and break a leg or throw a rider,
conservationists say, there is not one verified incident of that
ever happening. And while prairie dogs do eat grass, no study has
ever concluded that their consumption has any effect on livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern, France said, is that entire
mini-ecosystems are built around prairie dogs. The holes in prairie
dog villages provide shelter for rabbits, snakes, salamanders and
other creatures. And the animals themselves provide food for
numerous predators, including the bald eagle, the swift fox, and,
most important, the black-footed ferret, an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife federation filed its petition last summer, asking
the Fish and Wildlife Service to issue an emergency declaration
putting prairie dogs on the threatened list. Specifically, the
federation wanted a moratorium on poisoning and hunting prairie
dogs on public land, plus some sort of governmental oversight on
private land.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the federal government declined the request for an
emergency declaration, but it agreed to a 90-day review to decide
whether the nine-month study should be conducted. The 90 days were
up in late November. Conservationists said they expected a ruling
fairly soon, probably in February. The delay, they said, is
probably due to a desire to make the decision as scientifically
sound as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think certainly the Fish and Wildlife Service regards this
as a sensitive petition,'' France said. ``If they don't have a firm
position, carefully thought out, the politics of the situation will
overrun them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials are hoping to forestall federal protection
of the prairie dogs by creating a voluntary regional plan to
conserve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that we can develop a regional conservation plan
as opposed to a listing of the species as endangered or
threatened,'' Bivins said. ``I personally think that the Endangered
Species Act is rife with problems and real unenforceability. In
many instances, there are serious policy questions about who is God
here. Is it the U.S. Congress or is it a higher power?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A compromise plan may involve strict management of prairie dogs
on public lands and something more voluntary on private lands.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, many state officials and private landowners are
just waiting to see what happens. Some ranchers who were contacted
said they did not want to go on the record acknowledging the
presence of prairie dogs on their land because they feared doing so
would make them a target for regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of in a no man's land regarding regulations or no
regulations,'' said Mote, the state biologist. ``So for the moment
it's still business as usual, poison at will.''

POINT GUARD-PR MAN ANDERSON TRIES TO GET IT ALL IN CONTEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ We bring you a tale of two Kenny Andersons. First,
there is Kenny The Point Guard.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Anderson who had a great offseason. His sore knees
didn't bother him, as they did the first half of 1998. He played
pickup ball with teammates Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce. He got
himself into shape, working with a trainer at UCLA. This is the
Anderson who is so confident in his conditioning that he doesn't
fear the beginning of PitinoBall next week at Brandeis University
in Waltham because, as he said Monday, ``I wasn't b.s.-ing over the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Kenny The Public Relations Man. Before we get
into that, you should know that this Anderson did not major in PR
while attending Georgia Tech. Or, saying it another way: If
Anderson handled the basketball the same way he handled his words
in the offseason, he forever would be rooted to Rick Pitino's
bench.
</P>
<P>
   During the NBA lockout, Anderson joked that he would have to
sell one of his luxury cars to bring in additional funds.
</P>
<P>
   The joke bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the lockout was lifted, he rushed to his car and
appeared to tell a young autograph-seeking fan to ``get outta
here.'' The video was shown over and over on television. Anderson
said the cameras and microphones did not put the words into
context.
</P>
<P>
   So his jokes weren't funny and the media failed him. This is not
what you would call good PR. Anderson knew people would want to
talk about his interesting summer (and winter) when he arrived here
Monday. He walked into the Celtics' voluntary strength and
conditioning session promising to tell his story and clear his name
from the ridicule of commentary pages and talk-radio shows.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old from Queens, N.Y., knew he had plenty to
explain. He started with the fan, who had approached as Anderson
left a midtown Manhattan office building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more to it than what you saw on TV,'' Anderson said.
``There was a heckler on the left side of me and he was just
swearing me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson explained later that the heckler had cursed him, called
him a jerk and ``this that and the other. I looked at him and he
looked, kinda, like he was drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The heckler's words began to chime in with those of the other
fans walking beside Anderson. The point guard had spent part of the
morning on a red-eye from LA to New York for the players' meeting.
So he was tired. And it was cold. And he doesn't even remember the
young fan. He says the cameras didn't show that he actually was
talking to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid must have been talking (behind me), 'cause I wasn't
looking at him,'' Anderson said. ``I was talking to my camera man,
who works for CNN, (saying) that I have to find my car and that `I
have to get outta here.' That's what that was about. It turned out
to make me look like I was being rude to a fan. Those who know
Kenny Anderson know I'm not like that. Fans made me what I am
today. I've done community work. During the lockout, Thanksgiving
week, I gave out 500 turkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Portland, Ore., can attest to that. Anderson was one
of the more popular figures in that community before being traded
last February. But he realizes now that the post-lockout frenzy was
no time for mistakes _ or misunderstandings _ with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the wrong time,'' he said. ``We had just come off a
(lockout) and the fans missed out on basketball. That's how it was
made to look by y'all in the media and the paper. I expect y'all to
do things like that. My skin is thick. If I worry about what y'all
write about me, what y'all say about me, then I'm definitely in the
wrong business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson does worry about what the fan thinks of him. If he
can find the young man, he'd like to invite him to a game. He also
would like to explain the circumstances that led to this PR mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of cameras, a lot of people pushing,'' he said.
``It was just a hectic environment. I'm not saying it was the right
thing to do, but maybe I made a mistake. Like I said, if that fan
is watching me, I'll invite him to one of the Boston games and be
my guest. I'll give him two tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the chances of finding that fan are minimal. He would
be tough to find in Boston, where less than a million people live
in the city itself. New York? Millions and millions and millions of
people? Nearly impossible. Anderson wants the fan to contact the
Celtics. That definitely will lead to some memorable calls for Jeff
Twiss, the team's public relations director.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it could be like 100, 200 people'' calling the
offices, Anderson said. He wasn't trying to be funny when he said
that. But people still laughed. That's how most jokes work, anyway.
Unforced. Anderson knows he forced one when he, a man who makes
more than $5 million a season, joked about selling a few of his
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another thing,'' he said. ``It was a joke. I have cars.
So I said that if the lockout goes any longer, I'll sell one. It
was a joke. And people ran with it. So, I don't know what to say
about that one. I just was joking.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson smiled a few times and then went to work out with
strength and conditioning coach Shaun Brown. If you are a Celtic
fan, you know what an in-shape Anderson means. It means that you
will happy to have someone like him leading your offense. And
you'll also be happy when someone else is telling the jokes.

ECONOMIST REBUTS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AT MICROSOFT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-BUG) 
(mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. began its defense in the
government's antitrust lawsuit Monday with an economist from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology bearing a massive tome of
written testimony with a simple message: Microsoft's business
practices are good for consumers, and any government meddling with
the software industry would likely do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The 328-page testimony by Richard Schmalensee of MIT is a
blunderbuss rebuttal to the Justice Department's
two-and-a-half-month attempt to prove that Microsoft used its
monopoly in personal-computer operating system software to thwart
competitive challenges posed by the rise of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case, Schmalensee wrote in his direct
testimony, amounts to ``speculation'' based on a ``morass of
e-mails'' from Microsoft executives that at first glance may seem
damaging, but are not. Forget the atmospherics, he tells the court,
and focus on the outcome _ what he insists is a lack of measureable
harm, current or future, to consumers from Microsoft's business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proper economic inquiry into whether a company is engaged in
anticompetitive conduct should end if it concludes that consumers
have not been harmed by the conduct at issue and are not likely to
be harmed in the future,'' Schmalensee wrote.
</P>
<P>
   High and rising product prices are typically the litmus test of
whether a monopolist has the power to punish competitors and gouge
consumers. The government's evidence shows that Microsoft has
increased the price it charges personal-computer makers for its
Windows operating system in recent years, even as the prices of
other components of computer systems have declined. Still, the cost
of Windows accounts for less than 5 percent of the price of a
typical personal computer _ not really evidence of the kind of
price-gouging normally associated with a monopolist, as some
economists have noted.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's case is focused as much on the future as on
the recent past. If Microsoft is allowed to continue to thwart
competition, the Justice Department says, consumers will surely
suffer from less product choice, less innovation and higher prices
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be decided by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in
this nonjury trial based on his determination of which side the
``preponderance of the evidence'' favors. Microsoft's objective is
to convince the court that there are enough flaws in the
government's case that the balance should tip toward the company.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Schmalensee describes the suit by the Justice
Department and 19 states as ``fundamentally inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The government asserts, he notes, that Microsoft has an enduring
monopoly because its Windows operating system controls the basic
operations on more than 90 percent of personal computers sold, and
that barriers to entry in that market are high. On the other hand,
he adds, the government says Microsoft invested hundreds of
millions of dollars because it was scared of losing its dominance
to an upstart maker of Internet browser software, Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is striking about the late-night e-mails and the almost
frantic concern over competitive threats is that they show that
Microsoft itself was extremely insecure about its leadership in
operating systems,'' Schmalensee said.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, replies
that Microsoft was indeed deeply worried and ``did work to improve
its software, but it also had its thumb on the scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has made several allegations against Microsoft,
but a central one is that the company used its market power to prod
personal-computer makers, Internet service suppliers and Internet
programmers to enter into ``exclusionary'' contracts that limited
the distribution and promotion of Netscape's rival browsing
software.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft defense, again, is that the outcome in the
marketplace shows that Netscape could and did widely distribute
many millions of copies of its browser despite Microsoft's
purportedly anticompetitive business practices. In the last two
years, Schmalensee notes, Netscape has gained an additional 14
million users of its browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   But to gain these 14 million users, the government replies,
Netscape distributed about 200 million copies of its browsing
software at considerable extra cost, even as Microsoft gave away
its browser for free and bundled it with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Such Microsoft tactics, the Justice Department asserts, are part
of a pattern of predatory practices intended to stifle competition.
Schmalensee counters that Microsoft's contracts requiring
personal-computer makers to ship the company's browser with Windows
``offers more choices to consumers'' and are ``therefore
pro-competitive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His testimony is an advocate's brief, so Schmalensee, like the
12 prosecution witnesses, seems to interpret the evidence to suit
his argument. For example, when the experience of America Online
Inc. supports the Justice Department, Schmalensee refers to the
leading online-services company as ``Microsoft's fickle partner and
bitter rival.''
</P>
<P>
   But roughly 200 pages later in his testimony, Schmalensee cites
America Online's success against Microsoft's MSN online service as
proof that bundled placement on the Windows desktop screen _ an
advantage MSN enjoyed since 1995 _ does not thwart rival products
from being distributed. America Online, Schmalensee writes,
``skillfully exploited the many distribution channels open to it
(or any other competitor) to beat MSN.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being the most valuable real estate in cyberspace,
Schmalensee declares, the Windows desktop is not an ``even
particularly important channel of distribution'' _ a view not held
by Microsoft executives, according to several internal e-mail
messages in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee also attacks the government's case for trying to
apply outdated ``textbook models of competition'' and ``chalk-board
theories'' to the fast-changing facts of the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   The government replies that the economist's stance amounts to
trying to get an antitrust exemption for Microsoft and the software
business. ``He is very close to saying you should never intervene
in dynamic, high-technology industries,'' said Daniel Rubinfeld, a
senior economic adviser to the Justice Department's antitrust
division.
</P>
<P>
   In courtroom action Monday, Jackson closed the trial to the news
media and public while he heard testimony from Franklin Fisher, an
economist and government witness, about the prices Microsoft
charges personal-computer makers for Windows. The
company-by-company pricing data, the judge explained, was
``confidential, sensitive, commercial information.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for several media organizations appealed. But they only
asked that the closed sessions be as limited as possible and that
the judge consider releasing transcripts with the sensitive price
data redacted. The judge reopened the courtroom in the afternoon,
and Fisher continued his testimony, which is expected to end
Tuesday.

FIRST GOAL FOR KNICKS IS SIGNING WARD
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ It was like a mixer, casual attire only. Topped
with a hairdo from the Bob Marley collection, an amiable Charles
Oakley popped into the Knicks' facility and met his replacement,
Marcus Camby, without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Mingling with various fringe free agents and local pickup-game
players, Allan Houston, John Starks and Charlie Ward also attended
the first day of informal workouts allowed by the league. After a
light scrimmage, Ward's future was one of the hotter conversation
topics. Facing an abbreviated training camp beginning around Jan.
18, the Knicks are in a bind to re-sign Ward as their point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Ward has leverage, and his agent has a few contract numbers in
mind. With Chris Childs, the Knicks' demoted starter of last
season, setting the bar by making an average of $4 million over six
years, Ward's agent, Craig McKenzie, said Monday that a $5 million
salary ``was something we're looking at and is probably a good
starting point for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   As a part of an anticipated seven-year deal, Ward's contract
would be worth more than $35 million if he re-signs with the
Knicks. McKenzie also added that Ward, whose wife, Tonja, is a
lawyer with a successful career in New York, wants a no-trade
clause added to his contract. In the end, stability and loyalty may
mean as much to Ward as money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that is an issue,'' said McKenzie, who spoke to
the Knicks' president, Ernie Grunfeld, Monday. ``We haven't gotten
down to exact terms, yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although teams cannot officially re-sign players until the new
collective bargaining agreement is reduced to writing around Jan.
18, McKenzie said that he expected an offer from the Knicks by the
end of the week. Other offers are bound to be spilling in as well.
Team officials from Toronto, Detroit and Orlando have also
contacted Ward's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the best opportunity and hopefully the Knicks will
be there,'' Ward said. ``Money is not going to send me one way or
the other. Money doesn't sway me. I enjoy playing here, and I've
been here for four years. This is the only place I know. The only
other place I'd feel comfortable would be Orlando. It's close to
home, and I visit there on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward has choices, but Oakley does not. Unless he is traded to a
team like the Lakers _ ``Hey, tell the Lakers I'm fit,'' Oakley
said as he went to work out _ he will finish out the
lockout-shortened season in Toronto. Oakley, who has a car wash
business in town and maintains a home in the New York area, ducked
in for a scrimmage. It was the five Knicks, past and present,
against a collection of free agents and local players.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd turn of events, Oakley found himself on the same side
as the player he was traded for. That put Camby in the awkward
position of being the host in Oakley's old home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached each other once we noticed each other was in
here,'' Camby said. ``It was like, `Hey, how you doing?' There was
no animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if he'd been to Toronto yet. He said that hadn't
been up there. That's a wise move because it's about 10 below zero
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a warmth surrounding Monday's workout. It was not the
turnout some of the Knicks had hoped for, but by the end of the
week, most of the Knicks are expected to be in town in preparation
for the opening of training camp next week. Among the main players
absent Monday were Larry Johnson, Chris Mills, Terry Cummings, Buck
Williams, Childs and Patrick Ewing, who left town for a
mini-vacation after leading the union through a draining six-month
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ewing is carrying about 20 extra pounds after hours of
inactivity during meetings and negotiating sessions, his teammates
did not seem concerned. Those who showed up Monday appeared in good
shape. Perhaps the non-Knick, Oakley, at age 35, was the fittest of
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a chance to run up and down with Oakley today,'' Starks
said. ``He gave us our fair warning: Don't come down the lane.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks don't want to lose anymore to the other side,
especially Ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important,'' Houston said, referring to
re-signing Ward. ``When you think about the core guys who have been
here, and are familiar with each other, Charlie is definitely one
of the guys high on the list. I think the whole team is comfortable
with him.''

DAVID LYNCH WORKING ON DRAMA SERIES FOR ABC 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Eight years after ``Twin Peaks'' flamed out
on ABC, director and producer David Lynch is preparing a new drama
for the same network.
</P>
<P>
   The show is called ``Mulholland Drive,'' and it will be a
candidate for ABC's fall schedule, Stu Bloomberg, ABC Entertainment
chairman, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said Lynch's pilot script arrived at the network last
week, ``and it is vintage David Lynch, very reminiscent of `Twin
Peaks,' and it was a blast to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg described the project as a contemporary drama set in
Los Angeles and featuring a large cast with ``their relationships
and their dreams and their turmoils.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch's previous experience on ABC was spotty. ``Twin Peaks,''
the quirky drama he co-created with Mark Frost, premiered to
critical praise and healthy ratings in 1990 but had run its course
a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch tried a sitcom on ABC the next year. Called ``On the
Air,'' it was a manic comedy about television. It lasted less than
a month.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of ``Twin Peaks'' is generally attributed to a
creative stall on the part of Lynch and Frost, who seemed unwilling
to advance the show's gummy story line.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said that Lynch was aware of the ``Twin Peaks''
shortcomings and that in the case of ``Mulholland Drive,'' he ``has
it really mapped out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other dramas in development for ABC include ``Once Again,'' from
``thirtysomething'' creators Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz,
and ``Snoops,'' from TV's hottest drama producer, David E. Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Again'' involves a divorced couple that reunites,
Bloomberg said. ``Snoops'' is a detective show. Kelley is creating
``Snoops,'' but he told critics he expects to be less involved with
it than with ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   On the comedy front, ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses
said the proposed ``Mary Tyler Moore Show'' sequel with Moore and
Valerie Harper has been killed.

BOEING TO LAUNCH SATELLITES FOR GLOBALSTAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co.'s commercial satellite launch business
continues to be one of the company's best opportunities for future
growth, as evidence by Monday's announcement that Boeing will
launch 28 satellites for the Globalstar telephone network.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar, which is 42 percent owned by Loral Space &AMP;
Communications Ltd., apparently decided to use Boeing's Delta II
rockets after a Ukrainian rocket exploded in September, destroying
a dozen Globalstar satellites it carried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased we were able to respond quickly to Loral's
needs,'' said Gale Schluter, vice president and general manager of
Boeing Expendable Launch Systems in Huntington Beach., Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``These additional missions give us a robust launch manifest for
1999.'
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will launch six Delta II rockets this year and one in
2000 to place the 28 Globalstar satellites into low Earth orbits.
The rockets will be launched form Cape Cavaveral, Fla., and from
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Boeing has 22 Delta II missions scheduled for this year,
including the six for Globalstar. Through 2001, Boeing's Delta II
launch manifest now shows 42 planned missions, though that is
certain to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications is potentially a $100-billion business, said
Marco Caceres, aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, a market
research firm. His speciality is commercial launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future growth for Boeing is clearly in space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing will not disclose financial terms of its launch
business, it reportedly gets about $55 million for a typical Delta
II launch.
</P>
<P>
   In February and April of last year, Boeing's Delta II placed the
first 8 Globalstar satellites into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The Globalstar system will need 48 satellites to become
operational, which should be in the third quarter of 1999. That is
later than planned because of the setback when the Ukrainian Zenit
rocket blew up shortly after launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition to our revised launch schedule of seven firm
launches on the highly reliable Delta II rocket substantially
increases our launch flexibility and robustness,'' Bernard
Schwartz, Loral's chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar will provide worldwide mobile and fixed
telecommunications services through its satellite constellation. It
will be the second such system in orbit. It's main competition is
Iridium, which completed its satellite constellation late last
year. Many of the Iridium satellites were launched on Boeing's
Delta II.

 Cashing In Savings Bonds  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I have several U.S. savings bonds that are 12 years old
and no longer drawing interest. I contacted two banks, but they
won't cash the bonds for me. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  I can't imagine why those banks blew you off. Most
commercial banks are willing to cash up to $1,000 worth of E or EE
savings bonds at a time, even for noncustomers. They don't cash H
or HH bonds, but they will help you get the money by forwarding the
bonds to a Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
   So try another bank. Wells Fargo, for one, will help you.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't a customer, bring along your driver's license or
other ID, such as your Social Security card. The bank will want to
be certain that you are entitled to cash the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If you have more than $1,000 worth of bonds, you may have to
make multiple trips to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than do that, you might prefer to cash the bonds by mail.
Call the Federal Reserve's toll-free customer service line at (800)
333-2919 and request Form SD-120. Fill it out and send it back with
the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Eckert, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco, warns you to copy the serial numbers, so the bonds can
be replaced if your packet gets lost. Savings bonds are
automatically insured by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   After you cash your bonds, the institution handling the
transaction will send you (and the Internal Revenue Service) a form
indicating how much interest you received. The interest is subject
to federal income tax, but not to state or local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Too Old for an IRA?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am 64 years old, and my only retirement income will come
from Social Security. Is it too late to start an Individual
Retirement Account? I plan to work until at least age 70.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not too late _ and you should do it. If you depend
entirely on Social Security income, you will find it awfully
difficult to enjoy your sunset years.
</P>
<P>
   Make it a Roth IRA, rather than a traditional one. The great
thing about a Roth is that your investment gains accumulate
tax-free. With the other types of IRAs, you must pay taxes on the
gains when you withdraw the money.
</P>
<P>
   You can contribute up to $2,000 of your earned income per year
to a Roth for as long as you like. With the traditional deductible
and nondeductible IRAs, you must stop contributing no later than
age 701/2 and then must start withdrawing your money.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you contribute $2,000 annually to a Roth, and invest the
money in the stock market, or in a mutual fund that tracks the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index. That is an aggressive and risky
strategy for someone your age _ but given your otherwise bleak
financial prospects, you might want to chance it.
</P>
<P>
   If you invest $2,000 per year until you reach age 75, and then
retire, your contributions will total $22,000. If your investments
compound at 10 percent annually _ the long-term stock-market
average _ your account will grow to more than $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock market scares you, and you invest instead in
essentially risk-free U.S. Treasury issues or money market funds,
you will earn perhaps 5 percent per year. At age 75, your $22,000
in contributions will have grown to slightly less than $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Government Pensions
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a federal employee, entitled to a federal pension when I
retire. I have the option of taking less pension income during my
lifetime to provide a survivor benefit for my wife after my death.
My wife also works _ at a nongovernment job _ and will receive
Social Security after she retires. Would her Social Security
benefits be reduced if she also receives the survivor benefit from
the federal government?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: No _ but I can understand why you are puzzled. The rules
regarding Social Security offsets from government pensions are
extremely complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The key to your situation, says Leslie Walker, spokeswoman for
the Social Security Administration, is that your wife earned Social
Security benefits from her own job. Therefore, those benefits are
exempt from any offsets.
</P>
<P>
   If the situation is reversed, with your wife dying first, you
yourself could get hit by offsets. Because you will get a federal
pension, your survivor benefits from your wife's Social Security
account could be reduced or even eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Offsets stem from the fact that before 1984, government
employees did not pay Social Security taxes. Congress decided it
was unfair for these employees to draw full survivor benefits from
a spouse's Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   All federal employees hired from January 1, 1984, to the present
have been required to pay Social Security taxes, so the offsets
don't apply to them. But many people who worked for the government
before then did not pay the taxes and still don't.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who needs to know more about government pension offsets
should obtain Publications 05-10007 and 05-10045 from the Social
Security Administration. These publications will help you determine
whether you are subject to offsets, and to what extent.
</P>
<P>
   The toll-free telephone number is (800) 772-1213, and you also
can contact Social Security through its Internet Web site at
 &LR; www.ssa.gov. &LR;

 Tech Stocks May Put on Brakes  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Those astonishingly fast-moving high-technology stocks had another
great day yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index hit its seventh-straight
record, jumping 40.18 points to 2,384.59. It has risen 68 percent
since hitting a 52-week low on October 8.
</P>
<P>
   That phenomenal streak has some market experts worrying that the
high-tech race car may be nearing the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies are at the cutting edge of the U.S. economy, and
as a group, they are likely to enjoy outstanding sales and earnings
gains well into the coming century. But many of them are selling at
70, 80, 100 or more times earnings for the latest 12 months. A lot
of market-watchers find that tough to justify.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart J. Pillette of Pillette Investment Management in San
Francisco predicts a 10 to 20 percent ``near-term'' drop in tech
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Danville investment counselor Richard DelMonte extols high
technology as ``the engine that drives the economy.'' But he &LR; 
 &LR; expects tech stocks to lose at least 15 percent of their value in
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Intel, the chipmaker; Cisco, the
network-equipment-maker; and Lucent Technologies, which makes
telecommunications equipment, have ``great'' futures, DelMonte
says. ``They are making the hardware for companies that want an
Internet presence _ the Internet is going to grow on their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   But he thinks that Cisco's stock is vulnerable at nearly 80
times earnings, while Lucent's is even more so at nearly 150 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other group offers more dynamic growth opportunities than
high tech,'' says Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Son in St. Louis. ``But this group has been up, up and
away lately.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that investors who are itching to buy tech shares
invest only half their money now. He advises saving the other half
for significant price pullbacks _ which he considers likely.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite tech stocks include Compaq Computer and Applied
Materials, which are ``dominating their segments of the market and
have a good history of growth and proven managements.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of reasons why tech stocks have surged lately.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, the economic outlook has improved. Tech
companies tend to be very sensitive to economic cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian contagion, which generated so much terror among
investors during last summer's stock market sell-off, has caused
scarcely a sniffle on this side of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any worries about a marked slowdown in U.S. growth are
dissipating,'' says Gary Schlossberg, an economist with Wells
Capital Management in San Francisco. ``We are not looking at a
recession or even a dramatic slowdown, though growth will be
somewhat slower.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg says most tech companies are humming on all
cylinders. They have shown ``an ability to generate good unit
volume growth, and they also have been successful in cutting costs
to sustain profit margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg's colleague Jon Hickman, managing director and
senior portfolio manager with Wells Capital, says the ``backdrop
for tech spending is really positive.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be more and more traffic over networks of all kinds,
he says, ``not just the Internet, but corporate networks.
Telecommunications and data communications are going to be big
spending areas this year and in coming years.''
</P>
<P>
   While Y2K compliance has produced a flood of new business for
the software industry, Hickman says, there's no reason to fear a
slowdown after the problem is solved. He says a further flood will
follow as firms buy other system upgrades that had to be postponed
because of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Among software companies, he particularly likes Keane Inc.,
which provides applications software and services to companies,
government agencies and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman also figures that data-storage companies, such as
disk-drive-maker Seagate Technology, ``are a place you want to be
for the future. As more and more things go digital, there will be
the need to store more and more data.''
</P>
<P>
   In line with that reasoning, he also likes Documentum, which
provides data-management products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Acuff, market strategist with Salomon Smith Barney in
New York, observes that most tech companies have brought their
inventories down from the swollen levels of a year ago _ a big
plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech is in the sweet spot right now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he warns: ``There's the potential that between now and late
spring, there might be some profit-taking _ people taking some of
the money they've made off the table.''

 Ascend Rises on Takeover Rumor  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Shares of Ascend Communications Corp. jumped 8 percent yesterday as
rumors of a potential acquisition by Lucent Technologies began a
fresh wave of takeover speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Alameda's Ascend, which makes computer-networking gear, and New
Jersey's Lucent, the nation's largest telecommunications equipment
provider, have long been mentioned as potential partners, but
industry watchers said the two companies may be days away from
announcing a $17 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   A pairing of the two, first reported Sunday in London's
Financial Times, would create a data networking powerhouse capable
of challenging Cisco Systems and 3Com Corp. in the market for
computer gear sold to phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said the two companies are expected to meet
today. Lucent chief executive Rich McGinn will be in town to give a
speech at the Churchill Club in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Lucent and Ascend have been trying to partner for
some time but have been unable to agree on a price. Now that
Lucent's stock has more than doubled since October, the two may
finally have agreed on an $80 per share price for Ascend, sources
said. That figure is a 12 percent premium over's Ascend's Friday
close of $71.44 and just slightly above yesterday's close of $76.75
a share.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Christin Armacost, a telecom analyst with Everen Securities
in Chicago, said the two companies have been in discussions for
``an extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a question of whether Lucent is willing to pay the
price for Ascend. I don't think they had been able in the past to
agree on a fair valuation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Donovan, a spokesman for Ascend, said the rumors are ``all
speculation'' and that reports of a merger between the two have
been percolating for months. ``There's nothing new to report,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is imminent, it appears to have evolved rather
quickly, industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, 11 top executives at Ascend filed to sell 685,000
shares of stock at a share price significantly lower than where
Ascend's price has been the past week. Ascend President and CEO
Mory Ejabat sold 100,000 shares at prices that ranged from $47.50
to $51.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1, Ascend stock has risen about 46 percent. Ascend
was up $5.31 yesterday. Even on Friday, days before the rumor began
circulating, Ascend was above $71. Lucent ended yesterday down
$2.31 at $112.94.
</P>
<P>
   Since mergers tend to boost the stock price of an acquired
company, some industry watchers said it was unusual for Ejabat and
other executives to sell shares if a deal with Lucent was on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not logical,'' said Bob Gabele, director of research for
Investnet, a Baltimore company that tracks insider selling. ``There
probably is not that much chance of a merger.''
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is imminent, Gabele said, there may be two
explanations: ``Either something materialized recently or,
possibly, the insiders at that time didn't feel the deal with
Lucent would carry out much of a premium,'' Gabele said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the merger happens this week, analysts
expect Lucent and Ascend to join hands at some point.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Ascend, which develops switches that transmit
data over networks, is an attractive takeover target for Lucent,
which has a very weak networking presence, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend's most valuable asset is its asynchronous transfer mode
switch, or ATM, which can seamlessly carry voice, video and data
traffic over the same network.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications providers, such as phone companies, are
looking toward ATM as a way to converge all phone calls, Internet
traffic and other data onto the same network. Using ATM is cheaper
and more efficient than the fractured network phone companies use
today and also allows companies to do a better job of managing the
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big conversion taking place in telecommunications
and the major purchasers are spending a significantly greater
portion on data equipment,'' said Gregory S. Geiling, an analyst at
J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   While Lucent has great name recognition and strong customer
relations with the biggest names in telecommunications _ AT&AMP;T, SBC
Communications and AirTouch Communications, to name a few _ it
doesn't have the new technology these companies are demanding for
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   That weakness has given new competitors, such as Cisco, Bay
Networks and 3Com, a chance to snatch market share away from the
AT&AMP;T spin-off.
</P>
<P>
   In order to compete in the 21st century, Geiling said, Lucent
needs to offer ATM to its customers, and the easiest way to achieve
that would be to buy Ascend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only hole Lucent has is that they don't have great data
technology, such as ATM,'' Geiling said. ``Ascend has a very strong
standpoint in ATM and if you put Lucent's customer relations with
Ascend's customer base, it makes all the sense in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A merger would give Ascend access to a broader base of customers
and the backing of a financially solid company. Lucent has
experienced tremendous growth since it was spun off from AT&AMP;T a
little more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, Lucent's revenue has soared from $23.3 billion in
1996 to $30 billion in 1998. Ascend's 1997 revenue was $1.16
billion. Lucent, whose market value is $148 billion, has been so
successful because its products run everything from traditional
phone systems to wireless phones to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of Lucent and Ascend is advantageous because
it broadens the market potential that Ascend can reach,'' said
Armacost, with Everen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said Ascend should go for a merger with Lucent
because it would help Ascend avoid being squeezed out by the
inevitable pricing pressure that will evolve in the ATM market over
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The ATM market is valued at about $2 billion and as competitors
flood the marketplace, companies will be forced to lower their
prices. That will be easier for a combined Ascend/Lucent to handle
than it would be for Ascend on its own, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   If Lucent does buy Ascend, it won't be the first time the New
Jersey company has snapped up a Silicon Valley firm. In 1997,
Lucent bought Livingston of Pleasanton, a data-networking company,
and Octel Communications Corp., a voice mail and messaging company
in Milpitas.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation for months that Lucent would buy
Ascend or some other networking company. In October, Lucent was
finally able to make large acquisitions without being penalized by
certain accounting rules that apply to spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Just yesterday, Lucent announced a deal to pay $1.5 billion in
stock for Kenan Systems Corp., a Cambridge, Mass., company which
makes software for billing and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend also made news yesterday. The company agreed to sell
assets it acquired as part of its October 19 purchase of Stratus
Computer Inc. to an investor group led by Investcorp, an
international investment bank based in Bahrain. Ascend said it
would divest other nontelecommunications businesses later this
month.

 &HT;    Odds are weather about to change
 &HT;    By Brandon Peterson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For a meteorologist, predicting an accurate
weather forecast is sometimes equivalent to hitting the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most difficult part of our job here,'' said John
Franks, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in
Wilmington. ``During the winter, we try to forecast a day or two in
advance, and after we find out how much water is expected to fall,
we have to determine whether it's going to be rain, sleet, or snow.
. .along with what kind of temperatures and accumulation goes with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Miami Valley residents _ especially school administrators
and road crews _ hope this weeks' premature weather predictions
proves to be a jackpot. Forecasters predict only a chance of snow
this week with warmer temperatures on the way by the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   But don't break out the suntan lotion and tank tops yet. It's
still going to be cold.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures are expected to be around 30 degrees this morning
and remaining steady most of the day, according to the NWS.
Forecasters expect a 50 percent chance of rain changing to light
snow tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Though the weather can be as surprising as a snow-covered
potholes, one thing is for sure _ many Miami Valley schools will be
closed again today and snow and ice covered roads will continue to
cause major accidents and headaches for police.
</P>
<P>
   Wet pavement and blowing snow was the cause of a wreck involving
nearly 20 vehicles on southbound Interstate 75 near Needmore Road
on Monday afternoon, according to Sgt. Greg Menke with the
Montgomery County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Menke said the accident left one car pinned between two semi
trucks. Other vehicles then spun out of control and landed in
ditches and medians. There were a few minor injuries in the pileup,
Menke said.
</P>
<P>
   Various agencies around the Miami Valley are hoping for a
reprieve after trying to cope with a ferocious winter.
</P>
<P>
   Already this winter, nearly 17 inches of snow have been dumped
on the Miami Valley. Though the snow has come in dramatic waves,
it's way off the record-setting snowfall of 67 inches the area got
in 1977-78, meteorologists say. The average snowfall for the winter
season is 30 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The area is above the mark for January though. Nearly 14 inches
of snow has fallen already this month, with the average being close
to 9 inches.

 Levi's President, COO Peter Jacobi Resigns  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Peter Jacobi resigned as Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.'s president and chief
operating officer yesterday, saying a fresh perspective is needed
to turn around the ailing jeans-maker.
</P>
<P>
   The exit by Jacobi, who started his Levi's career in 1970 as a
low-level production assistant, signifies the struggle that engulfs
the 146-year-old company as it tries to overcome its entrenched
corporate culture and become more responsive to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, what really made me think seriously (about
leaving) was watching Bill Chiasson, our new chief financial
officer'' who joined the company in August, Jacobi said yesterday.
``He started asking questions about why we do certain things, and
as we went through the discussion I realized that things that
seemed so logical in our own inbred mentality'' didn't necessarily
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `There really are new ways to be looking at
things,' '' said Jacobi, 54, who will remain until a replacement is
found from outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's chief executive Robert Haas, the great-great-grandnephew
of company founder Levi Strauss, credited Jacobi with instituting
painful measures such as factory closings and a $200 million
cost-cutting effort that should have been implemented years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Jacobi was promoted to president, he saw a company
that, while growing, faced ''falling market share among young
consumers, a cost structure that was getting out of line,
overcapacity in our sewing facilities in the U.S. and abroad, a
lack of product relevance and marketing that had become a little
too predictable,'' said Haas.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi responded by closing plants, laying off thousands of
workers, hiring a new advertising agency, moving toward trendier
fashions and restructuring management to focus more on branding.
The company is only one year into its two-year project of slashing
20 percent of its overhead costs, and more layoffs are expected in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's sales, meanwhile, declined 4 percent in 1997 and are
expected to have dropped even more when the company reports its
1998 sales next month. Although the company's Slates and Dockers
lines are growing rapidly, its Levi's jeans market share has
declined to about half the 30 percent level it enjoyed in 1990,
according to Tactical Retail Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the company's overhaul is well under way, ``there need
to be changes, and I think the good news here is that they're
finally recognizing it and saying `We must grow our sales,' '' said
Helen Bulwik, director of global retailing for Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to their future is bringing in a president and chief
operating officer who has the background to understand who their
customer is,'' said Bulwik. ``There's still room left for Levi's,
because of the strength of its brand, to see some significant
revenue increases.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the concrete changes he instituted, Jacobi pushed
for an overhaul of the company's debilitatingly democratic
corporate culture, which has been guided since 1987 by a document
called ``the Aspiration Statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi's employees were thoroughly trained to cultivate the values
of the Aspiration Statement, which encouraged mutual respect and a
diversity of opinions. Workers' compliance with the document was an
important benchmark in performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement had a devastating impact on company
effectiveness, according to people close to Levi's. Staff were
afraid to debate company strategy because arguing violated the
Aspiration Statement. On issues in which no consensus could be
reached, all too often, no action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Haas, a former Peace Corps volunteer whose goal for the
Aspiration Statement was to create a more humanitarian company,
admits now that it spawned a ``dysfunctional'' culture. While
Levi's remains a values-driven concern, the document is undergoing
some ``fine tuning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One offshoot is that Levi's has stopped trying to reach
consensus on all issues among its nine senior level executives.
Now, issues are debated at meetings, the decisions are made by the
chief executive and chief operating officers, ``and we move on,''
Haas said.

LUCENT TO PAY $1.4 BILLION FOR SMALL BAY STATE FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Kenan Sahin has always been unusual in the world of
high technology. For 16 years, the Turkish-born entrepreneur
quietly built his software company in an industry that craves the
limelight. He didn't hire outside publicists and rarely issued
press releases to tout his business. After starting his business in
1982 with just $1,000, he never took on outside investors,
remaining its sole owner.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed Monday when the 57-year-old former
professor became the nation's newest billionaire. In a deal that
catapulted him out of anonymity, Sahin agreed to sell his
750-employee software firm, Kenan Systems Corp. of Cambridge, to
giant Lucent Technologies Inc. for $1.45 billion in Lucent stock _
all of which will go to Sahin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have maintained a deep privacy _ in a company setting and
personally,'' said Sahin, acknowledging trepidation about being in
he spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Sahin's instant fortune reflects the rich opportunities possible
in the fast-moving field of telecommunications, where companies
like Lucent will pay huge amounts to buy technology and products
that let them get ahead of other global competitors. Indeed, huge
megabillion dollar deals are becoming commonplace these days in
telecommunicatoins as companies like Lucent prowl for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent saw a gem in Kenan Systems' arcane but sophisticated
software, used by leading phone carriers for tracking all kinds of
communications services and putting them on one customer bill.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Sahin said part of his megafortune will go into an
educational foundation that he expects to launch in 2000. He said
it will focus on adapting classroom instructional material for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to work with many people in education and other areas
before I begin the foundation next year,'' said Sahin, who spent
almost 16 years teaching at the MIT's Sloan School of Management,
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Harvard University's
School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Sahin, who clearly is uncomfortable with his sudden fame and
fortune, preferred to play down his windfall. ``I try not to think
about these things. The exciting thing is not so much the
price...but our success in the marketplace, our employees and our
contribution to the software industry in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahin came to the United States in 1963 to study at MIT. Two
years after graduating, he earned a business degree from Sloan. He
taught information systems and management science at the university
level from the late 1960s to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Four years before leaving Sloan, he plunked down $1,000 to form
his company, then called Consultants for Management Decisions. He
later left Sloan to focus on his business, which had 20 employees
and was soon doing management consulting for the US Postal Service
before getting into communications software. In 1990, he changed
the company's name to Kenan Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software is a tricky area, it's not science, it's an art. One
of the biggest challenges is being able to have large groups of
companies work with the same software for billing and customer
care,'' said Sahin.
</P>
<P>
   Sahin saw his big opportunity in 1992 when fancy new
telecommunications services, such as cellular, Internet and other
technologies, started to become popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public reads newspaper ads for cellular phones, that don't
talk about the quality of the reception but about pricing like
getting 100 minutes and weekends free and discounts for this and
that. Telecommunications carriers today want to put all these
different offerings...together in a single bill.'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Systems began developing software that was snapped up by
the leading telecommunications players. In the past three years
revenues have skyrocketed from about $40 million to $175 million
and the company's work force has grown from 100 employees to 750 _
half in Cambridge and half elsewhere in the United States and in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Sahin, who employs two of his three sons in the
business, shunned the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenan treasures his company's autonomy and he turned down
offers to become a publicly traded company because he did not want
to be distracted by shareholder interactions or annual meetings,''
said Robert M. Kiburz , Kenan Systems senior vice president of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   He never accepted venture capital or Wall Street financing
offers, and he turned down numerous buyout offers.
</P>
<P>
   Sahin said decided to sell his business after realizing, during
a ``long walk'' during a London business trip, that remaining an
independent software firm has its limitations amid the
telecommunications revolution of the 1990s. He concluded that
Lucent, an AT&AMP;T Corp. spinoff that is a longtime Kenan Systems'
customer, would be a good partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the conclusion that we had done very well, but if
were to jump to the next level, we could not do it alone and if I
did not affiliate with Lucent I would expose the company to
subsequent stagnation and possible dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lucent, which had tried last year to acquire Kenan Systems
but was rebuffed by Sahin, buying the Cambridge company helps it
broaden beyond telecommunications equipment and become a major
software player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't a player in this (telecommunicaitons billing and
customer care) space, so we decided to jump to the head of the pack
by acquiring the hottest player in the business,'' said Dan
Stanzione, Lucent executive vice president who is chief operating
and president of Bell Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Sahin, who will address his employees Tuesday morning, will
continue to run Kenan Systems, which is expected to remain in
Cambridge as a Lucent subidiary. He will gain the additional title
of vice president of software technology at Bell Labs. Lucent said
it will give employees bonuses and Lucent stock to remain with
Kenan Systems.
</P>
<P>
   While announcing its deal to buy Kenan Systems, Lucent Monday
appeared to be on the verge of making an even bigger acquisition.
The New Jersey-based telecommunications giant reportedly is in
talks to buy Ascend Communications Inc. of Alameda, Calif., a big
data switch maker, for $15 billion to $16 billion. Some analysts
expect a merger announcement as early as Wednesday. In reaction to
the merger reports, Ascend stock Monday jumped 5 1/4 to close at 76
11/16, while Lucent fell 2 5/16 to $112 15/16.

 Vacationers Can't Cash in on Euro  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Castles, statues and mountain vistas may be on your agenda this
year if you're taking a vacation in Europe. One thing you won't
see, however, is the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Although 11 European countries began converting to the new joint
currency on January 1, actual cash and coin won't be available
until Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   You still can make purchases in euros, which are worth about
$1.16 _ but only with traveler's checks and credit cards. Any
change you receive will be in the currency of the ``Euroland''
country you are visiting _ Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal or
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Three other members of the European Union, &UR;  &LR; Denmark, Sweden and
the United Kingdom, as well as non-EU members such as Switzerland
and Poland, are keeping their national currencies. Greece, an EU
member, wants to convert to euros but is having trouble meeting
financial requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Major credit and charge card companies, such as Visa and
American Express, have made the conversion to the euro, as have
traveler's check issuers like Thomas Cooke. If you buy an item in
euros with your credit card, it will appear on your monthly
statement with a dollar conversion at that day's exchange rate, the
same system used for other foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
   By July 2002, you will be able to use the euro for all
transactions in the Euroland countries, which will make it easier
to compare prices between countries and also calculate how much you
are spending in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, you can't use euros everywhere. While euro
charges are accepted by some tourist-oriented enterprises such as
Marks &AMP; Spencer and EuroDisney, most have not made the change.
</P>
<P>
   American Express spokeswoman Victoria Handwerk recommends that
Europe-bound travelers continue to take with them a mix of local
currencies, travelers checks and credit or charge cards.
</P>
<P>
   The more transactions you make in euros, the more you will save
in money-changing fees. If you wind up with too many euro checks,
most exchange bureaus and banks in Euroland countries will convert
them into national currencies without charging a fee. However, if
you change them into dollars or other non-Euroland currencies, you
may be charged for the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   What to do if you have the option of making a payment in either
the euro or a traditional currency like the French franc or the
Dutch guilder?
</P>
<P>
   Nick Colannino, a spokesman for the European Commission, the
governing body for the EU, says it doesn't make any difference. As
soon as the euro became active, all 11 Euroland currencies were
pegged to it and are moving collectively relative to other
currencies such as the dollar.

MAN OF `ACTION': TRAVOLTA, SERIOUS IN LATEST FILM, IS AT HEART
A  CLOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``I should like,'' John Travolta declares in a
tony British accent, ``to perform an interpretive dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopting an expression of the most sublime suffering, the actor
flails across the length of his palatial hotel suite, where he's
ensconced to talk about his new movie ``A Civil Action.'' But film
is the last thing on his mind as he wails a lyric from the musical
``Rent'' like an existential mantra: ``Won't you light my (set
ital)caaaandle(end ital) / Light my (set ital)caaaandle(end ital)
...'' He doubles over, giggling.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta is just getting warmed up. Settling back into his
straight-backed Edwardian chair, he adopts a Viennese accent and
leans conspiratorially across a glass table. ``Do not think of me
as your psychoanalyst but as your well-qualified friend,'' he
whispers to an interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   It's 10 a.m., the sun is shining, the suite is white and
Travolta is dressed entirely in black. ``Muhammad Ali once told me,
`Always wear black, 'cause it slims ya down.''' He pats his round
belly. ``Even then I knew of my proclivity for ... what's that word
again? Corpulence.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta's suit boasts casually clean lines that hint at wealth
and languid chic. The famous Travolta looks are intact, if packing
a little more padding since their '70s salad days.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old actor still knows how to shake his booty. In ``A
Civil Action,'' on the other hand, Travolta offers a study in
understatement as Jan Schlichtmann, a snaky personal-injury
attorney who sacrifices his career to champion the cause of a town
that claims its children are dying from water laced with toxic
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta, who met the real Schlichtmann while filming in Boston,
acknowledges that at first he had a hard time getting his head
around playing an ambulance-chasing attorney _ albeit one who
experienced a life-changing epiphany and turned environmental
crusader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept reminding myself that I didn't have to like him,
because I don't know if I could really like a guy who chooses that
kind of a life, even if in the end he evolves into a pretty soulful
guy,'' Travolta confesses, staring thoughtfully _ perhaps
suspiciously _ at his water glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think Schlichtmann as a character is necessarily
unlikable, though his tactics are. I think that `A Civil Action'
will let audiences see for the first time some of the realities of
the practice of law. Now (set ital)those(end ital) are unlikable.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta does share his character's love of fast machines _ in a
pivotal scene in the film, Schlichtmann gets a ticket for speeding
in his Porsche _ and Travolta flies, expertly, his own fleet of
four jets. He piloted a 707 to San Francisco the night before his
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally nocturnal,'' he explains. ``My average sleep time
is 5 or 6 a.m. I've been this way my entire life. Even in school I
would go to bed at 1 a.m. if my mom would let me stay up. I have a
theory, and it's pretty obvious, so it's not a great one, but here
it is: If your perceptions are acute, you're perceiving everybody's
s_ in the daytime and it's acting as an antagonism. Then suddenly
everybody goes to bed, and you can just be who you are. I think I'm
more who I am from midnight to 5.''
</P>
<P>
   The wee hours of the morning weren't always times for serene
reflection. During his days as a stage actor touring with musicals
such as ``Grease,'' Travolta suffered from insomnia. ``I was so
lonely. I wasn't really friends with anybody, and I just wanted to
be coddled, maybe because I come from a sheltered background. And
there's no one interested in coddling you when you're 18 or 19. I
was very naive about what life should be.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses to gaze out the window. ``Awww, now you're making me
cry. But that's really what I wanted. That's what I still want, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta grew up in a dramatic household. His parents were
involved in theater and encouraged their youngest son (out of six
children) to perform musical numbers in their living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually I forced (set ital)them,(end ital)'' he chuckles. ``I
wanted to be one of those kids in `Gypsy' who held a balloon. I was
worse than a stage mother. I was a bratty stage kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Travolta is on his feet again, laughing, swirling
across an imaginary stage. For the next five minutes, movie star
and interviewer proceed to dance, execute heinous interpretations
of flowering trees and recite random passages from Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you love this?'' Travolta says, pausing for breath and
still giggling. ``There's this unfortunate James Dean thing that
some actors get into, where they think pain and death is art.
Uh-uh, baby. The pleasures in life are harder to find. That's the
real challenge in acting.''

ABC SUDDENLY APPRECIATES (GASP) QUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It's too late for ``Maximum Bob'' and other
good shows that died too soon, but ABC's programming pooh-bahs seem
to have heard what viewers and TV columnists have been screaming
about for several years. Jamie Tarses and Stu Bloomberg said Monday
they are convinced that good new shows like ``Sports Night'' and
``Cupid'' need time to build an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Well, duh!
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give shows more time for people to find them,''
said Tarses, president of ABC Entertainment. ``If you've got a good
show, you want to have the luxury of letting it fail by virtue of
the fact that people are rejecting it, not that they simply were
unaware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to photocopy this for use as ammunition the next time
ABC yanks a promising new show.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner is ...
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   The losers are other shows that have created a mini-industry on
Oscar night by airing pre-Oscar programs rooted in the red-carpet
romp of the glitterati.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy's contract with ABC prohibits anyone other than ABC
from airing live footage during the half hour before the March 21
ceremony _ when many of Hollywood's big-name celebrities will
emerge from their limos to greet the vernal equinox. That's because
the Academy and ABC will do their own pre-gala show for the first
time, hosted by Oscar winner Geena Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Academy president Robert Rehme said no one has griped to him
yet, but Gil Cates, producer of the Oscar telecast, said, ``I'm
sure over the next six to eight weeks we'll have complaints, and
we'll deal with them as we get them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar telecast this year moves to Sunday, the only day on
which the Academy Awards have never been presented. The preliminary
show airs at 5 p.m. Pacific time, the actual ceremony at 5:30.
</P>
<P>
   A few words from producer David E. Kelley on Marla Sokoloff, who
plays Lucy Hatcher, the bratty office manager who pushes everyone's
buttons on ``The Practice'':
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were looking for in the character, more than anything
else, is someone who could come in and, with one line, make an
impression, either good or bad, with our characters. ... She just
captivated us from the very beginning. She's funny. She's able to
punch lines easily and quickly. You believe her intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers hoping to see loose-lipped Lucy get a pink slip will be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assure you,'' Kelley said, ``she's not finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' ends its run on Fox, possibly
this season or maybe next, producers Aaron Spelling and E. Duke
Vincent are ready with ``90210: The New Years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to do it again,'' Spelling said, `` ... with
different characters, with a mixed ethnic group _ a mistake we made
with the first `90210' _ and we're looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   And now for the real truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good franchise,'' Spelling confessed, ``and easy to
sell overseas.''

 &HT;    Taft tackles literacy in inaugural address
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper and Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Gov. Bob Taft used his inaugural speech Monday
to call for 20,000 Ohioans to volunteer to teach children to read,
and said that under his leadership, Ohio will become the ``Reading
State of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft, 57, was officially sworn in as Ohio's 67th governor in a
private ceremony just after midnight Sunday. Twelve hours later, he
ceremonially took the oath of office before an audience of about
4,000 in the elegant Ohio Theatre in downtown Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Anna, 19, administered the oath while his wife,
Hope, held his family Bible. It was the same Bible Taft's
great-grandfather, U.S. President William Howard Taft, bought in a
Cincinnati bookstore and used for his swearing-in as president in
1909.
</P>
<P>
   Also taking oaths of office Monday were Lt. Gov. Maureen
O'Connor; Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, who has been
Ohio treasurer; incumbent Attorney General Betty Montgomery;
incumbent Auditor Jim Petro; and new Treasurer Joseph Deters,
former Hamilton County prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the governor and his wife attended three balls:
the $1,000 per ticket Governor's Ball, the $250 per person Capitol
Ball and the $25 Buckeye Bash. The proceeds are to pay for the
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Taft said he has the opportunity to do what only
one other person has done: ``Be at the helm when our state closes
the door on one century and opens the door to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 20th century, he said, Ohio was a giant
on the industrial frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, the frontier is not the western edge of America or
the cutting edge of industry. Our frontier is knowledge and
technology _ a place where Ohio must be a leader among states and
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   To become that leader, he said, Ohio must make sure schools are
``adequately funded, safely built, well-maintained, and
laser-focused on academic achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the court order to overhaul Ohio's school funding
system, Taft said no other issue has triggered so many harsh words.
Now, he said, barricades must be replaced with bridges.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that fewer than half of Ohio's fourth graders passed
the ``reading'' portion of the state proficiency test, and he said,
``There is no single educational challenge of greater urgency than
the need to make sure every Ohioan learns how to read because no
matter how advanced our technology is in the next frontier, reading
is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, he had pledged to create a volunteer force
of 10,000 reading tutors for students in the kindergarten through
fourth grade. On Monday, he said he would double the program, and
called for 20,000 tutors.
</P>
<P>
   He said next week he will begin tutoring a student at Kent
Elementary School in Columbus, and he called on his ``partners in
state government'' to become reading tutors for children in need.
</P>
<P>
   Taft praised his wife for devoting herself to a crusade against
drug and alcohol abuse and said she will personally lead a new
campaign to engage parents, neighborhoods and others in abuse
prevention and education.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks and months ahead, Taft said he will present details
of his ``opportunity agenda'' to Ohioans and the legislature. On
Monday, he said he favors changing the tax code to recognize that
``lifelong learning leads to lifelong earning'' by making college
tuition and job training costs more affordable. He also said
patients must have access to the medical care they need and judges
should be given the tools to prevent juvenile delinquents from
becoming juvenile criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The address was well received by both Democratic and Republican
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rhine McLin, D-Dayton, said the emphasis on reading
is better and more focused than former Gov. George Voinovich's
pledge to be the education governor.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Jim Buchy, R-Greenville, said Taft's promise to run
an ethical administration may have been the most important part of
the speech. ``If that occurs over the next eight years, no matter
what else happens, he will have been successful as governor,''
Buchy said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. J. Donald Mottley, R-West Carrollton, was pleased
with Taft's emphasis on technology, and said, ``Our region has some
unique things to bring to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He touched all the right notes,'' said state Rep. Jeff
Jacobson, R-Phillisburg. ``He is obviously very enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Richard Finan, who, like Taft, is also a
Republican from Cincinnati, said he has fielded many questions
about the fact key state posts are now held by Cincinnatians,
including Blackwell and Deters. Finan said Hamilton County ``has
been known for good government'' and he expects that tradition to
continue under Taft.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Elsie Snider, a 73-year-old retiree from
Elmore in northwest Ohio, said she'd like to volunteer as a reading
tutor. ``I was glad to hear him talk about education. It's such a
big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Snider and others stood in a two- to three-hour receiving line
to get a chance to greet the governor and his wife at a reception
inside the theatre's Galbreath Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Taft succeeds Gov. Nancy Hollister, the state's first woman
governor, who completed the last 11 days Gov. George Voinovich's
term, after he left for a seat in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Taft's first executive order, signed Monday afternoon, froze
hiring in all state agencies under the governor's office. For six
months all vacant positions will be reviewed by the department of
budget and management and filled only if they are essential to
running state government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state, even though our economy is good today, faces
serious budgetary challenges,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Montgomery on Monday identified several broad
areas of concern for her second term, including health care,
juvenile crime and protecting the elderly from fraud and abuse.

 &HT;    Texas house expected to support Laney
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas House Speaker James ``Pete'' Laney has
heard the partisan horror stories from his counterparts in the
other 49 states: Massive staff layoffs after one party grabs
control of a chamber from the other. Laptops distributed to the
majority party, but withheld from the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the best job there is in state government anywhere in
the United States,'' said the 55-year-old cotton farmer from Hale
Center, a town of 2,000 near Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an extraordinary turn of events, the Democrat will be
holding on to his dream job, which he has held since 1993, for at
least the next two years. The 150 members of the traditionally
nonpartisan Texas House will elect a speaker shortly after the
session begins at noonon Tuesday _ as part of a political play that
began almost two years ago. In fact, the real election for speaker
occurred between sessions, when a majority of representatives
signed written pledges of support for Laney. Laney's fourth term
was virtually confirmed on election night, when Democrats retained
control of the House and quashed the possibility of a Republican
challenge to his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, Laney has tremendous influence over the day-to-day
workings of the House _ and the fate of individual bills.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several weeks, Laney will choose the chairmen and
vice-chairmen of House committees and assign members to fill many
of the slots. When the House and Senate pass different versions of
bills, the speaker assigns representatives to meet with senators to
hammer out a final version.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker also assigns bills to committees, meaning that Laney
can send legislation he supports to panels where they are likely to
get a favorable hearing. Members can't speak on the floor without
his permission, so he can prevent them from offering certain
amendments or expressing unwanted views.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the powers of the speaker's office enable
Laney to make the House focus on his priorities. But because Laney
is famously reticent _ and deferential, at least publicly, to the
will of his colleagues _ it's hard to say what those priorities
are.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview in his Capitol office, Laney mentioned
education and utility deregulation, and suggested that there may be
action to curb the high cost of campaigns, which he believes is
dampening political participation.
</P>
<P>
   But his response to a question on how the multi-billion dollar
state budget surplus should be spent was typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been bashful about saying that I would like to see
us look at the big picture and a long-term investment of this money
so it's not just a dividing up of the pie type deal,'' Laney said
rather cryptically. ``(We should) just make sure that the money
goes where it produces positive results.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   But Laney's low-key approach has produced positive results,
according to many of his colleagues. He's earned accolades from
nearly everyone, for example, for his efforts to let the sun shine
on previously secret House proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Laney took the House helm at a time of mounting concern over
backroom dealing and ethical lapses by lawmakers. His predecessor,
Gib Lewis, had been indicted on an ethics charge accusing him of
accepting an illegal gift from a San Antonio law firm, and
legislators were under fire for lobbyist-paid vacations and other
perks. Lewis pleaded no contest to a lesser charge and did not seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Laney had been one of Lewis' lieutenants, but he promised
reforms to open the House's legislative sausage-making to the
public. The House Calendars Committee, which schedules bills for
floor debate _ or doesn't, effectively killing them _ would
deliberate openly for the first time, he said. Lawmakers no longer
would have to vote on bills or amendments before they had a chance
to read them, and there would be fewer late-night decisions after
marathon floor sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Many legislators and good government advocates say Laney has
largely fulfilled his promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's done an excellent job in reforming the rules of
the House and restoring credibility to the House,'' said Suzy
Woodford of Common Cause. ``In terms of the legislative process,
it's clearly become more open.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kent Grusendorf, R-Arlington, who was a vocal critic of the
secret powers of the Calendars Committee, said opening the doors of
that panel is ``the number one improvement'' of Laney's tenure.
Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, contrasted the committee's
operations during his first term, when Lewis was speaker, to the
current rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several bills that I sponsored my first term which never made
it out of the Calendars Committee, for reasons unknown to me, in
subsequent sessions became laws,'' Naishtat said.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant change, according to both Grusendorf and
Woodford, is that under Laney the House has reformed its rules so
that a speaker no longer can punish rebellious chairs by replacing
them during a session.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Smith of Public Citizen praised Laney for having ``a steady
and true gavel in terms of generally siding with long-held
precedents'' on procedural rulings, rather than ruling according to
his whims.
</P>
<P>
   But Laney hasn't kept another promise he made when he was first
elected _ to remain in the speaker's post for only two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1970s, speakers customarily served for two terms. Bill
Clayton broke with that tradition by remaining speaker for four
sessions between 1975 and 1982. Clayton was succeeded by Lewis, who
served a record five terms. When Lewis was indicted, many observers
said that too much power had become concentrated in the speaker's
office during his long tenure.
</P>
<P>
   But Laney now says his 1993 pledge was ``to stay as long as the
membership desires me to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not foresee leaving before redistricting,'' he said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith of Public Citizen said he isn't bothered by that
broken promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete Laney is a classic example of why we don't believe in
term limits,'' Smith said. ``When you have good leader, there's no
point in replacing him.''

GOLDMAN SACHS SHAKES UP TOP MANAGEMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill.)   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. shook up senior management Monday
after suffering steep losses in bond trading and delaying its plan
to go public last year, with Jon Corzine, the co-chairman and chief
executive, withdrawing from day-to-day management.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, 52, ceded management responsibilities to Henry Paulson
Jr., 52, his co-chairman and chief executive. Corzine will continue
at the firm as a senior partner and non-executive chairman. Goldman
also named John Thain, 43, and John Thornton, 45, co-chief
operating officers reporting to Paulson, a move that formally
establishes the duo as the heirs apparent of Wall Street's last big
private partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman called the changes a natural evolution toward a more
corporate-style management structure in line with plans to revive
the public stock offering sometime this year. As part of the
overhaul, Goldman named a 15-member management team consisting of
division heads to replace the five partners who now make most big
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But some Goldman bankers said privately that the moves amounted
to a power play by Paulson, Thain and Thornton, who seized on weak
results in last year's fourth quarter to speed up a leadership
transition.
</P>
<P>
   The management shift was made final last week in a meeting of
Goldman's executive committee over the objections of Corzine,
people at the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who has led Goldman since 1994 and who served as sole
chairman and chief executive until he promoted Paulson to join him
in May, had long envisioned promoting a team of new managers to
take over some of his duties. But Corzine was described as opposed
to a proposal to make such changes now and agreed to it only under
pressure, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, a native of Illinois noted for his laid-back demeanor
and professorial speaking style, rose through the firm's cutthroat
bond business and was the top executive most closely associated
with its risky trading operations. Goldman suffered heavy trading
losses estimated at half a billion dollars last fall. The losses
caused Goldman to record an 80 percent decline in fourth quarter
earnings and pushed annual profits below the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's image also suffered when Goldman delayed its
much-anticipated initial public offering in September. He had
shepherded the plan to go public for years, overcoming substantial
opposition within the firm, but had to retreat when market
conditions soured. Goldman executives stressed that the public
offering was still on track and that Corzine would continue to
focus on preparing to sell stock in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson, in an interview Monday, described the suggestion that
his accession amounted to a palace coup as ``inaccurate in every
respect.'' He said the management changes had nothing to do with
Goldman's trading losses or the delay in the public offering,
adding that he would continue to work closely with Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an evolutionary transition in management and
governance, something that made long-term sense for the firm,''
said Paulson, a Chicago native who earned his Goldman stripes
advising companies and arranging big banking deals. ``The firm is
doing very well, and we thought it made sense to put it in place
these changes in place before the public offering.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Corzine said he has every intention of remaining active at
Goldman. He said that the firm's performance in 1998 was good given
the poor market conditions. ``This was a volatile period in the
business, not something that's unique to Goldman Sachs or Jon
Corzine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quick shifts in leadership are not unusual on Wall Street during
tough times. Corzine himself took control of Goldman in 1994,
during one of the toughest years in its recent history. Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. fired or demoted executives in its bond and risk
management division after suffering a loss in last year's third
quarter. James Dimon, the president of Citigroup, resigned under
pressure after the bank's Salomon Smith Barney investment banking
unit suffered steep trading losses and the newly merged firm had
difficulty integrating its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said they were surprised by the changes at
Goldman. But some said there were logical reasons that the firm
would want to de-emphasize trading as it prepared to go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corzine came up from the trading side, and the trading side
has not done so well,'' said Hal Schroeder, an investment banking
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``As you go public, the risk
profile of the organization has the change. To the extent you are
making this change you need new leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman relies much more on trading than many of its peers,
including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch. Those firms
have larger fee-generating money-management divisions and retail
brokerage operations. In the first half of this year, which was
highly profitable for Goldman, the firm earned 43 percent of its
profits from trading on behalf of customers and for its own
account.
</P>
<P>
   Weak earnings during the downturn in stock and bond markets were
not unique to Goldman. Merrill suffered an outright loss in this
year's third quarter. But Morgan Stanley powered ahead to record
earnings both for the fourth quarter and for the year. Lehman
Brothers, which like Goldman derives the largest slice of its
earnings from trading, had a smaller fourth-quarter decline than
Goldman and posted record earnings for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare them to Lehman and Morgan, Goldman got the
worst of it,'' said Raphael Soifer, brokerage analyst at Brown
Brothers Harriman. ``I'm not sure that calls for major strategic
rethinking, but it has to be of some concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes at Goldman indicate that Thain and Thornton are in
line to take over leadership of the firm. The two have been viewed
as a close team since they jointly managed Goldman's European
operations in the mid-1990s. Before their promotions to chief
operation officers, Thain, considered a protege of Corzine, served
as chief financial officer. Thornton, who is based in London,
manages Goldman's extensive international banking business.
</P>
<P>
   The two are seen as complementary. Thain, like Corzine, comes
from Goldman's fixed-income division and succeeded Corzine as chief
financial officer. Thornton, like Paulson, specializes in advising
major companies and led the firm's highly successful push to become
a major player in European and Asian investment banking. Thornton's
client list includes Ford Motor, Laura Ashley and Richard Branson,
the British entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a logical step for two strong young leaders,'' said
Paulson, adding that he fully expects them to succeed him down the
road. ``We like to do things in an orderly manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman insiders said that in the debate over whether to go
public, Thain was seen as lukewarm to the idea and Thornton was
known to be strongly opposed. But Paulson said that has changed. He
emphasized that the entire management team now stood solidly behind
the plan to sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if we do not go public in 1999,'' he
said.

BRUINS STRUGGLE TO PICK UP SLACK LEFT BY INJURED BOURQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With Ray Bourque sidelined by a hip flexor strain, he
knew he was going to have to work harder, much harder. He knew he
was going to have to play more, much more. But Kyle McLaren said he
had no inkling that he was going to be in the lineup for 36 minutes
and 38 seconds of Saturday's game against the Maple Leafs in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 37 minutes of torture, too, as the Bruins were
shellacked by Toronto, 6-3, after the Leafs had taken a 4-0 lead
only 14 minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The only player who was on the ice more than McLaren was
goaltender Rob Tallas, who relieved Byron Dafoe at 4-0 and played
45:46.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns went with four defensemen for the most part,
with Brandon Smith, in his NHL debut, playing just 1:37. Don
Sweeney, who played 28:46, was one of four Bruins and the only
defenseman to finish with a plus.Darren Van Impe, suffering from
the flu, logged one second shy of 30 minutes and Hal Gill was on
for 21:38. But it was up to McLaren to pull yeoman's duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I played that much,'' said the 21-year-old
McLaren, who is emerging in his fourth season as one of the best
blue liners. ``I knew I played a lot because I felt like it, but
almost 37 minutes, that's a lot of ice time
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired, not really mentally but physically. I had nothing
in my legs. I got a little tired and you try to slow your game down
a little bit, and with that team, you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The first clue he had that he was logging a heavy load was when
someone told him he had played 26 minutes in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're in the game, you're going and going,'' said
McLaren. ``Even when I play 20 minutes, I'm tired some shifts out
there. With four defensemen, I knew I was going to get a lot of ice
time, everybody was. Five is OK. Six is good but four is tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even feel like I came off in the second period.
You're there for a couple of seconds, you catch your breath, get
some water, take a deep breath, and you're right back out there.
You don't really have time to think about being tired. You're just
going and going and doing your job. You try to get breaks during
whistles and stops in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's absence was sorely felt, literally and figuratively,
as the undermanned Bruins tried to fill their captain's
considerable shoes. It didn't help that, of the available players,
two were fighting the flu, two others had a total of two games of
NHL experience, and another had played just eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is truly our heart and soul and has been for many years,
even before I got here,'' said McLaren, who was mentored by Bourque
during his rookie year. ``I think this team can play without him if
he's hurt. I don't think it's a sign of anything to come with him
missing one game. You look at what he brings to the team and it's
everything. It's not just offense or defense, it's the whole game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're missing your key guy, I can't pick up his slack.
Donny can't pick up his slack. It has to be the 20 guys on the ice
who are playing that night. They have to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said that if Saturday's disaster taught the young
defensemen anything, it was to appreciate the workload Bourque
carries. That message wasn't lost on McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 38 years old playing 30 minutes _ I don't know how he
does it,'' said McLaren. ``I'm 21 and I'm barely getting over 25
and I'm very tired after games. He's a machine. Look at his legs,
they're tree trunks. He's in the best shape I've seen a guy in.
When I miss the net, you can see I'm upset. When he misses the net
or something, it's the same face as always. I'm still astonished by
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bourque is the steady, strong two-way player, McLaren's
trademark is his mean streak. When he first broke in, he would have
the jump on opposing players who tried to challenge him physically
because he's lefthanded. He figured if he could get the first shot
in, he'd have a good chance. After 3 1/2 years, he still has an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still don't know I'm lefthanded,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Burns thinks McLaren is at his best when he's nasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I've seen of him this year,'' said the coach. ``He
gets lackadaisical sometimes. He's getting close to that point
where he could become a great player in this league. I love when
he's dirty, and he can be dirty, too. He can be a mean SOB. I
wouldn't want to play against him when he's in that mood, and we
try to get him in that mood.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren gets frustrated when he doesn't play that way. When he
goes home after games, he watches the replay on TV and cringes when
he sees himself not playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm hitting and being the meanest guy out there, I help
this team out,'' he said. ``When I'm quiet or timid on hitting
guys, that's when I feel myself being an average player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be 6-4 and go out there and play like I'm 5-2. I know
sometimes I do that, I play like I'm small, and that's not good.
When I go out and hit guys, the crowd gets into it. That's the best
feeling I get, when the crowd goes nuts after a big hit.''

TIME-RELATED BUG FOUND IN MICROSOFT WINDOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-TRIAL) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if all the panic over the infamous Year 2000 computer glitch
were not enough of a problem, experts now reveal that the omission
of a single equal sign has created a time-related error in
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows family of operating systems that will
next appear on April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The timing, it turns out, has nothing to do with April fools
jokes but rather with an error in calculating the beginning of
daylight savings time. The bug causes Windows applications to
behave as if it is one hour earlier than the correct time shown on
the Windows clock. The problem will continue for one week, until
April 8, 2001, when the applications will shift to daylight time
and again be in synch with the operating system and the rest of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The bug, which affects programs running under Windows 95, 98 and
NT, was discovered by a Massachusetts programmer and was confirmed
by Microsoft Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While not as threatening as the Year 2000 problem, the flaw
could prove significant for programs that require precise time
information.
</P>
<P>
   One possible widespread nuisance, for example, could be
inaccurate alarms from thousands of hotel wake-up systems that
automatically ring the phones of sleeping guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in a hotel when 50 people don't get their wakeup
call on time?'' said Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software
and the programmer who discovered the error and published it in an
industry list of software bugs last week. ``Multiply this by 10,000
hotels and you're going to have a lot of angry people.''
</P>
<P>
   The defect is in a ``dynamic link library,'' a kind of file that
ends with a period followed by the letters ``DLL.'' The way Windows
is structured, such libraries contain instructions and data that
are shared by any number of different programs written to run on
the Windows system.
</P>
<P>
   The program will not have a significant impact on most home
users, Smith predicted, but he said that ``financial institutions
like banks, stock brokers and e-commerce sites are going to care a
lot about this bug; they need accurate records of all transactions
for accounting purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a major headache and expense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bug's ultimate impact is difficult to determine,
Smith estimated that as many as 40 to 50 million computers could be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw, Smith said, results from the fact that April 1, 2001,
falls on a Sunday, which confused a small algorithm in the library
file that checks for the start of daylight time.
</P>
<P>
   The library, he said, contains a less-than symbol where it
should have a less-than-or-equal symbol. This causes a one-week
delay in invoking the start of daylight time.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that preliminary checks of other operating systems
indicated that the bug did not appear in Sun Microsystems Inc.'s
Solaris and that it appeared to have been corrected in a test
version of Windows 2000. He had no data on Apple's Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, it will be possible to fix the problem by simply
obtaining a new version of the flawed library, he said. However, in
some cases, certain programs will not be corrected by simply
replacing the flawed library, MSVCRT.DLL. Certain applications that
depend on that library might need to be fixed independently by the
original software developer, Smith said.

OLYMPIC OFFICIALS QUESTION JOBS OF IOC MEMBERS' RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Texas) 
 (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
  Relatives of International Olympic Committee members from Ecuador
and Finland were employed by the Salt Lake City bid committee while
it pursued the 2002 Winter Games, Olympic officials said Monday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A daughter of Agustin Carlos Arroyo, an IOC member from Ecuador,
and the husband of Pirjo Haggman, an IOC member from Finland,
worked briefly for the bid committee, Olympic officials said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   These revelations were the latest in a growing scandal involving
cash payments, tuition aid and lavish gifts in which vote-buying by
Salt Lake City officials has been alleged by Marc Hodler, a senior
IOC member from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo's daughter worked for a couple of weeks for the Utah
Department of Economic Development as a commercial artist, but her
skills were found to be lacking, an Olympic official said. She was
then hired to answer phones for the Salt Lake City bid committee
for a month and was eventually given tuition aid to attend school
in Texas for about six months and may have received living
expenses, the Olympic official said. The official said that the
daughter was hired without the urging or apparent knowledge of her
father.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone Monday in Guayaquil, Ecuador, Arroyo said
that his stepdaughter, Nancy Rignault, who is an American citizen,
had worked briefly in Salt Lake City on some type of restoration
project before returning to Texas, but that he was positive she had
not worked for the bid committee. He later said that he was not
sure and that he would check on the matter, ``because I have
nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo, a 75-year-old lawyer and industrialist who has been an
IOC member since 1968, also said that he may have received a cash
payment from the bid committee, but that it would have been as
reimbursement for travel expenses he and his wife, Raquel, incurred
when they visited Salt Lake City before the June 1995 vote in which
it was awarded the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   It is customary for Olympic bid cities to provide first-class
airfare for IOC members and a guest when they make three-day
inspection visits. Arroyo said that the total cost of the two
first-class tickets might have been $5,000, but that he was not
certain. He said it was his habit to buy his own tickets when
traveling and then to be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only thing that could have been given to me in
cash,'' he said, adding that he had received nothing else from Salt
Lake City officials other than customary hotel accommodations,
meals and small gifts such as a watch and a necktie.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the bid process, Haggman's husband was hired to do
an environmental study for the Salt Lake City bid committee, an
Olympic official said. The official said that the couple were
separated at the time. Haggman, 47, an IOC member since 1981, did
not respond to a fax seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini said
unexpectedly that she would not seek a third term in office.
Corradini, who was active in securing the 2002 Winter Games, has
denied knowing of any wrongdoing in the mushrooming Olympic scandal
and said it played no role in her decision not to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler told The Associated Press on Monday that public and
corporate discontent could force the 2002 Games to be moved from
Salt Lake City or canceled. However, the IOC leadership has stated
firmly that it does not intend to move the Games from Salt Lake
City. Officials of the United States Olympic Committee have said
they can raise enough money to satisfy a $1.45 billion budget for
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully anticipate the Winter Games of 2002 will be held in
Salt Lake City,'' said Bill Hybl, president of the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Welch, who was president of the Salt Lake City bid
committee, has acknowledged giving a $50,000 cash payment to
Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member from Congo Republic, to be used
for children in the strife-torn African nation. Investigators have
said that Ganga received a series of payments totaling $70,000. One
Olympic official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday
that $20,000 paid to Ganga had been claimed by the bid committee as
reimbursement for travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Welch has repeatedly denied any attempt to bribe IOC members. In
a weekend interview with French radio, Ganga denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not become rich because I voted for Salt Lake City,''
he said. ``That is why I am so serene.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga said that a profitable land deal arranged for him by
Bennie Smith, a member of the Salt Lake City bid committee, several
months after Salt Lake City won the Games, was ``normal.'' Because
the land deal occurred after the vote on the site, Ganga told
French radio, ``it couldn't have influenced me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had offered to pay for treatment for hepatitis
while in Salt Lake City, but that the bid committee had an
arrangement with the hospital. Ganga said Salt Lake City won the
2002 Games, not by bribery, but ``because they were the best.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Lawmaker urges one overseer for schools, colleges
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state's public education system, from
kindergarten through college, should be governed by a single
commissioner and a super-board, the head of the House Higher
Education Committee said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you have one commissioner, that commissioner
would be equally concerned about public education and higher
education,'' said Chairwoman Irma Rangel, D-Kingsville, speaking to
participants at a higher education symposium in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools have dragged their feet in developing curricula
that adequately prepare students to make a smooth transition from
high school to college, Rangel said. And colleges and universities
have been slow in focusing their resources on public schools to
help them prepare students for the rigors of college, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between what subjects students need to earn their
diplomas and what academic requirements they need to be admitted to
college could best be closed by a single commissioner and
super-board focused on both sectors of education, Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said she intends to capture her thoughts in legislation.
Her comments came at the first Higher Education Issues and the 76th
Texas Legislature forum at the University of Texas. The symposium
brought together college admissions officials, lending institutions
and policymakers to examine bills and proposals lawmakers will
consider to increase financial aid, improve college graduation
rates and increase enrollment of Hispanic and black students
without using affirmative action criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, nine states _ mostly small ones _ and Washington,
D.C., and Puerto Rico have one commissioner and a super-board. The
states include Hawaii, Rhode Island, Utah, Nevada, North Dakota and
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   But larger states, such as Georgia, Maryland and Ohio, are
examining the concept of administering education from kindergarten
through college _ called ``K-16'' _ instead of the traditional
kindergarten through grade 12 model. Such a model aims to create
seamless transitions between public school and college, improve
teacher preparation and balance spending among public schools, said
Amy Cook, a research assistant for the Education Commission of the
States in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the separation of powers, that transition is not as
seamless as some would like it,'' Cook said. ``High school
graduation requirements don't necessarily match up with college
admissions requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia in 1995 created a prekindergarten through 16 council to
deal with those issues as well as governance issues affecting
public schools and state colleges and universities, she said. The
state still has two commissioners, however, one for public
education and another for higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said her proposal likely ``won't go anywhere'' this
session but at least it will call attention to educational
disparities between high schools and colleges and urge stronger
partnerships between colleges and universities and their pipeline _
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like public schools and colleges and universities would
have a better partnership by having one commissioner instead of
two,'' she said.
</P>

MOTOR CITY: WHERE THE ROADS OUTSIDE ARE FRIGHTFUL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ill., Ohio, N.Y., Ga., D.C.)   (jw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Every city reacts in its own way to snow. Atlantans
panic and drive badly. Washington closes government offices early
and sends everyone home. Chicagoans expect their politicians to
have the streets plowed immediately _ or face the consequences at
the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit has another, more surprising approach to snow: Ignore
it.
</P>
<P>
   For as far back as this city has been able to check its records,
close to half a century, it has had a policy of not plowing
residential streets. As a result, it has just 59 snowplows,
compared with 750 in Chicago, whose area is just slightly larger.
Only large avenues, highways and the streets in front of schools
are plowed here, and even those are done slowly.
</P>
<P>
   But with many Detroit neighborhoods still impassable from the
foot of snow that fell on Jan. 2, and with three more snowfalls
since then having added a half-foot, a lot of people here are
suddenly angry about the policy. To make matters worse, the
temperature has seldom climbed even into the 20s since the first of
the year, and never above the freezing mark, while nighttime
temperatures have dropped as low as 10 below zero, unusually cold
for southeastern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is no thaw in sight, and the snow is turning to
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have had trouble reaching their jobs. Schools were
closed for most of last week, and few children have been able to
reach them since they reopened on Friday. Food distributors' trucks
have had trouble supplying corner grocery stores, which remain
common here because the city's poverty and crime have scared off
most supermarket chains.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy snowfall nine days ago caused particular trouble at
Detroit's airport, where dozens of arriving Northwest Airlines
flights waited for hours before unloading passengers because the
airline did not have ground crews available. The airline, the city
and Wayne County have been trading accusations ever since over
whether Northwest should have diverted the flights to other cities
or whether Detroit's snow removal policies prevented the airline's
workers from reaching the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn Johnson, 23, has been unable to walk her 6-year-old
son, Demar, to school because the snow is too deep for his short
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to walk in the streets,'' Ms. Johnson said angrily,
``and the streets are no better.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her neighbors, James E. Barksdale, 75, has lived at his
home for 50 years, and in all that time the street in front of it
has never been plowed, he said as he stood in 3-degree weather late
Monday morning. He was digging a path down his driveway to the
road, where the snow had been tamped down by the repeated passing
of sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Dennis Archer has taken the brunt of the criticism. He
waited five days to start paying suburban governments to send 17
snowplows here to help clear the streets. Then the suburbs, most of
which try to plow all their streets, quickly recalled their trucks
when more snow began falling last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Archer has asked for a citywide volunteer effort to shovel
streets and sidewalks. But that has had limited effect in a
sprawling city that is six times the size of Manhattan and has less
than half the population.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, the city had been planning to improve its snow
removal efforts this winter, having ordered 42 new trucks with
snowplows for delivery last autumn. But the trucks have not
arrived, because, Archer said in an interview, the manufacturer of
the trucks' transmissions is behind schedule.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The policy of letting residential neighborhoods fend for
themselves is rooted in the city's peculiar combination of climate
and history.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Great Lakes ports like Cleveland and Buffalo,
Detroit gets little ``lake effect'' snow, because it is situated on
the Detroit River, 20 miles upwind of Lake Erie and across the
state from Lake Michigan. So the city usually gets its snow three
or four inches at a time; in a city of self-reliant auto workers,
driving over a little snow is not viewed as a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's population has also plummeted, from a peak of 2.2
million in the mid-1950s to some 950,000 now. Four-fifths of the
city's white population moved to the suburbs, mainly after the
riots of 1967. While there have been recent hints of an economic
recovery, the city remains among the poorest in the nation, with
thousands of abandoned houses on which no taxes are paid. What tax
revenue there is brings many demands other than snow removal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all that is the fact that Detroit, though largely a city
of single-family homes, has a scarcity of home garages. Few
residents have anywhere to park their cars except on the street,
which would make snow removal a headache in any case.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as five years ago, when 10 inches of snow
immobilized Detroit just as Archer was being inaugurated for his
first term, the snow removal policy did not create controversy. But
the mayor seems to have raised expectations since then by promising
to improve services.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Michael Bilandic of Chicago lost an election in 1979
because of his city's difficulties in cleaning up after a blizzard
that year, and Mayor John Lindsay of New York had trouble winning
re-election in 1969 after streets in Queens were not cleared
quickly following a snowstorm. But Archer, a Democrat, said he
believed that Detroit voters would not hold the current problems
against him. In any event, he is only one year into his second
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that even as several more inches of
snow fell Monday night, the mayor's reputation was suffering but
might yet recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically he's damaged,'' said Mario Morrow, a political
analyst here. ``I wouldn't say he's buried at this point.''

FAMILIES STILL CUT OFF FROM CULT MEMBERS

<P>
   DENVER _ Family and friends of members of an apocalyptic cult
who were deported from Jerusalem kept vigil Monday in hopes of
seeing grandchildren they had never met or sons and daughters who
had disappeared months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Eight adults and six children were deported on Saturday by the
Israeli authorities, who cited fears of violence by the parents,
who are members of Concerned Christians, a group led by Monte Kim
Miller, a former resident of Denver. The Denver police, citing
security concerns, moved the deportees from the airport before the
families could get in touch with them, taking them to a Holiday Inn
downtown, where some of the relatives still waited Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like a yo-yo of emotions,'' said Sherry Clark of
Carbondale, Colo., who spoke for the waiting families. ``It's been
great disappointment, despair for parents, anger, crushing our hope
beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Dyck, the father of James Dyck, 20, who joined the group
with his wife and their infant son, hoped for a moment of contact.
``I just wanted to say, `I love you, we miss you,' and maybe that
was all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday a police officer escorted at least four of the adults to
a state motor vehicle office, as their driver's licenses were left
behind in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the families have tried sending notes. Most said they
had not heard a word, but one family member apparently received a
four-word note. A local television station said the note read,
``Mom, I love you.''

 &HT;    Carnival death going back to grand jury
 &HT;    By Leah Quin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The case of carnival owners and workers charged
with murder in the death of a Wells Branch teen-ager killed on a
ride will head back to the grand jury this spring, prosecutors said
Monday. The announcement prompted cautious optimism from defense
attorneys and industry officials who said the original charges are
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors handling the case declined to say exactly why
they're presenting the case again. However, they referred to first
assistant district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg's statement in
September that the indictments might be fine-tuned and the charges
might be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   No new evidence has surfaced since a Travis County grand jury
returned nine charges of murder this fall against the owners,
operators, maintenance workers and inspectors for B&AMP;B Amusements,
said prosecutor Brian Kingston. All nine were charged in the death
of 15-year-old Leslie Lane, who was killed March 19 while riding
the Himalaya, a circular coaster, at the Austin-Travis County
Livestock Show &AMP; Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to look at the charges and see if they're
supportive of the evidence,'' Kingston said. ``That's all we're
going to do. There's been no new light shed on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand juries often re-indict cases, sometimes just changing the
wording of the original charges. But the panel would also have the
opportunity to reduce or drop charges against all or some of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we're hopeful,'' said David Wahlberg, an attorney
who represents maintenance worker Ottis Frasure of Yuma, Ariz. ``A
second grand jury may take a more critical look at the state's
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   When the charges first became known, legal experts and industry
officials were taken aback. Cases involving ride accidents are
rarely _ if ever _ tried in criminal court, and the charge of
murder, which implies intent to kill, is unprecedented in the
carnival ride business, said Bob Johnson, director of the Outdoor
Amusement Business Association, based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to minimize the tragedy,'' Johnson said Monday.
``But as an industry, we can't believe the case belongs in criminal
court.''
</P>
<P>
   All nine defendants, all of whom live out of state, appeared in
court Monday, though attorneys did little more than confer behind
closed doors for an hour and then agree what information would be
shared between prosecutors and defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they would present the case to the grand jury
within two months.
</P>

THREAT OF FIRE LEADS TO REQUEST FOR WIRING CHECKS ON PLANES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)   By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Canadian investigators have found extensive wiring
problems on several MD-11 airplanes, and United States safety
experts say more inspections are needed to avert the threat of
in-flight fires.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators began checking planes after the September crash of
a New York-to-Geneva Swissair flight, which killed all 229 people
aboard. Wires pulled from the wreckage, near Halifax, Nova Scotia,
showed signs of a potentially dangerous escape of electricity, or
arcing, and the Canadian authorities found other problems in MD-11s
they inspected that were still in service.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what the Canadian examinations found, the United States
agency in charge of investigating air crashes, the National
Transportation Safety Board, Monday asked the Federal Aviation
Administration to order checks of more wiring on MD-11s registered
in this country. The aviation agency said it was likely to order
such checks ``very shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Canadian crash, suspicion has centered on the
entertainment system, which used large amounts of electricity and
was unique to Swissair. Although investigators found wiring
problems with the entertainment system and other components, they
have not identified the cause of the crash. The areas of the
Swissair plane that showed arcing are common to all MD-11s, near
the circuit-breaker panel in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   In arcing, an electric current jumps from the copper wires to
the outside of the insulation, where it forms sparks. In a letter
dated Dec. 22 to Bernard Loeb, the director of aviation safety at
the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington, the
director of air investigations at the Canadian Transportation
Safety Board, J.L. Maxwell, said that the wires recovered from the
wreckage that showed arcing were two heavy-duty wires on the left
side of the plane, one carrying alternating current and the other
direct current. The wires carry power necessary to fly the plane in
an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few other wires that are identified as original aircraft
wiring show evidence of arcing, but could not be further identified
or physically located within the aircraft because the identifying
insulation covers are missing,'' Maxwell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter pointed out that it was well known that arcing could
be caused by a breakdown of insulation. Insulation, the letter
said, can be damaged by, among other things, vibration, moisture,
temperature extremes, strain and contact with rough surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts say the damaged wires may be an effect of the
crash, not the cause. The wires could have arced in the last
minutes of flight because of problems elsewhere on the plane, the
experts say, or might have been arcing for months.
</P>
<P>
   Other MD-11s, however, showed a variety of flaws, like wire with
insulation that was chafed, or bent tighter than manufacturers
allow, or not properly tightened. Electrical conduits that should
have been sealed were not, and ``various examples of damaged,
cracked, or chafed wires were found,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   It added that the investigating team ``has not established a
direct relationship between the wiring discrepancies discovered in
the in-service MD-11s that were recently inspected and the damaged
wire from the Swissair 111 wreckage.'' But because of the
inspections, Maxwell said in his letter, ``questions arise about
how widespread these phenomena might be within the MD-11 fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 65 MD-11s registered in the United States and 174
worldwide. McDonnell Douglas built the MD-11 as an improved version
of the DC-10, but after Boeing bought the company in 1997, it said
it would stop making the MD-11 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and a consultant to Swissair are helping by laying out
what should be inspected, Maxwell's letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times,
is a summation of findings that Canadian investigators have shared
over time with American participants in the inquiry into the
Swissair crash. As the letter noted, in December the Federal
Aviation Agency ordered a one-time inspection of wiring above the
front doors of MD-11s, and Boeing also told its customers to check
some of the wiring.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed into the Atlantic a few minutes after the
pilots radioed that they had smoke in the cockpit. For months,
Canadian investigators have stopped short of saying there was a
fire on board, but the letter says that ceiling panels forward and
aft of the wall that divided the cockpit from the passenger cabin
showed damage ``consistent with the effects of a fire in those
areas; the initiating source of the fire is not known.''

HOUSE MANAGERS OFFER A LEGAL BRIEF OF THEIR CASE AGAINST THE
PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-RULES, IMPEACH-CENSURE) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Henry Hyde and the 12 other impeachment
managers on Monday presented a road map of the case for removing
President Clinton that they plan to make to the Senate beginning on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 105-page document, with 250 pages of supporting evidence,
offers a highly circumstantial case that relies on persuading
senators that a chain of events, read in its entirety, demonstrates
a compelling argument for the president's ouster. Each senator will
receive a loose-leaf binder containing the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence contained in the record, when viewed as a unified
whole, overwhelmingly supports both charges,'' the document states.
The president is accused of perjury before a grand jury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The filing tracks the closing arguments made last month by David
P. Schippers, the chief House investigative counsel, and the House
Judiciary Committee's final report. Those presentations led the
Judiciary Committee and then the full House to approve along party
lines the two articles of impeachment against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, the House managers adopted a tone that was
alternately derisive and unyielding as they restated much of the
voluminous record that Hyde and the Judiciary Committee compiled in
their inquiry. Although they were restricted in their filing to the
House record, the managers' outline goes beyond bolstering the two
articles of impeachment. Even as it lists the number of sexual
encounters the president had with Monica S. Lewinsky, it asserts
that the sexual details of their affair need not be detailed either
in the brief or through witnesses' testimony at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is not about sex or private conduct,'' the brief
states. ``It is about multiple obstructions of justice, perjury,
false and misleading statements, and witness tampering _ all
committed or orchestrated by the President of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the managers' case is the charge that Clinton,
in his deposition in the sexual harassment suit brought by Paula
Jones, offered a cleverly worded lie about his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky and then schemed to cover up the affair.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the House managers argued, Clinton ``deliberately
and willfully testified falsely under oath'' before a federal grand
jury on Aug. 17. Clinton engaged in the scheme, the managers
asserted, to obstruct both the grand jury and the Jones civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the House managers said, obstructed justice in these
ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ Trying to influence the testimony of his secretary, Betty
Currie;
</P>
<P>
   _ Providing several of his top aides with ``elaborate lies''
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky;
</P>
<P>
   _ Orchestrating a campaign to discredit Ms. Lewinsky to undercut
her credibility, and
</P>
<P>
   _ Using the power of the presidency to help get Ms. Lewinsky a
job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing a frequent defense raised by the White House that
Ms. Lewinsky testified that no one told her to lie or bought her
silence, the House managers argue that her words are not
exculpatory if they are viewed in context along with a skein of
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course no one said, `Now Monica, you go in there and
lie,''' the document read. ``They didn't have to. Ms. Lewinsky knew
what was expected of her. Similary, nobody promised her a job, but
once she signed the false affidavit she got one.''
</P>
<P>
   And the managers stressed what they consider the gravity of the
president's offenses, saying they ``have the effect of seriously
compromising the integrity of the entire judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's misconduct has had ``devastating'' consequences,
they state. ``Make no mistake, the conduct of the President is
inextricably bound to the welfare of the people of the United
States,'' the managers said. ``Not only does it affect economic and
national defense, but even more directly, it affects the moral and
law-abiding fiber of the commonwealth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monday's filing marked the first step in a carefully scripted,
but still fragile, schedule the Senate unanimously adopted on
Friday, which postpones a decision on the polarizing issue of
whether to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to comment on the Senate's plan, Hyde told reporters:
``I'm in a difficult position. Now is not the time to get angry at
the Senate. At the same time, this is a strange process, one we're
not familiar with in terms of making a case. When we reach the
point of asking for witnesses, we feel that senators will be in
more generous mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the House managers and the White House have a total of 24
hours to present their cases. Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., said
the managers faced a ``strategic decision'' on whether to use all
of their time, because the Republicans don't want to ``test the
patience of those listening.'' House aides said on Monday night,
though, it appeared likely that the managers' presentation would
spill over to Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the managers' current plan, subject to changes, Hyde would
open their presentation with brief introductory remarks. Rep. F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin would then give a 40-to-50
minute overview of the House's case.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the managers' case would be divided into three
parts. One team of managers, which includes several former federal
prosecutors, would present the factual record of the case, drawing
heavily on material from the independent counsel's report.
</P>
<P>
   This presentation, which would include Reps. Ed Bryant of
Tennessee, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, James E. Rogan of California
and Bob Barr of Georgia, would last several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Following that, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida would lead a team
laying out the legal basis for the two articles of impeachment,
perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once the managers linked the factual record to a legal
framework, Canady and a group of managers would make the
Constitutional arguments as to why the charges against the
President rise to impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these parts, but especially in the factual
presentation, the managers will highlight conflicting testimony
that requires the calling of witnesses to clarify the disputed
points.
</P>
<P>
   The managers last week spoke of summoning as many as 18
witnesses, but lawmakers say they have narrowed that list about six
witnesses. At the top of the list, managers say, are Ms. Lewinsky,
Mrs. Curry, and Vernon Jordan, one of the president's confidants
who helped Ms. Lewinsky get a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate's trial plan, senators would vote up or down on
a list of witnesses requested by the House managers and the White
House. After taking depositions from the witnesses, the Senate
would vote on which, if any, of them would actually testify in the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rogan, Hyde and Rep. George W. Gekas of Pennsylvania,
will deliver the managers' closing arguments, with Hyde wrapping
up.

SPECIAL TEAMS INDEED SPECIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For five seasons, the Mighty Ducks' power play
was somewhat less than powerful. Anaheim's penalty killing unit
wasn't much to speak of, either.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Ducks' special teams were hardly anything
special. When the Ducks won, they usually won in spite of their
special teams, not because of them.
</P>
<P>
   But this season has been a special one for the Ducks' special
teams. Anaheim has the third-ranked power play in the NHL and the
penalty killing is ranked 10th.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers reflect a dramatic change for a team whose power
play had finished in the bottom three of the league four times in
five years. Moreover, the Ducks' penalty killing unit hasn't been
ranked higher than 17th since Anaheim's first season, when it was
the sixth best in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know how to explain it,'' said center Steve
Rucchin, a key contributor on both units, of this year's success.
``Obviously, it was something we stressed in the past, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood it. Being part of the special teams, it was
pretty frustrating. It seemed like every year we would end up with
low numbers and you wouldn't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the Ducks are putting up special numbers, a big part
of the reason they've been able to hang around the .500 mark
despite being outscored 54-52 at even strength.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim has scored 39 power play goals, while allowing only 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can win games for you,'' said Paul Kariya of special teams
play. ``Keep their power play off the board and score one or two of
your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play has won us some games, and in the past that
really hasn't been the case. We have more confidence in it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially at the Pond. Anaheim has the NHL's top-ranked power
play at home (26.3 percent). The Ducks have scored at least one
power play goal in 18 of 20 games at home. Sunday night they stole
a game from Edmonton by scoring three times with a two-man
advantage. Earlier in the year, Anaheim scored four power play
goals in a victory over Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see guys out there who are very determined to make the power
play work,'' said defenseman Fredrik Olausson. ``Guys who want to
win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Ducks had the 25th-ranked power play last year,
Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg insists ``the power play isn't a
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get surprised very much,'' he said, ``because with the
people we can put out there, we should have a good power play.''
</P>
<P>
   A move Hartsburg made in early November turned the power on for
Anaheim after the unit had stumbled out of the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were 4 for 45 with a man advantage when the Anaheim
coach moved Kariya back to the point -- a position just inside the
blue line where most plays are set up in such situations. The power
play has scored 35 goals in 31 games since the change and Kariya
leads the NHL with 26 power play points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a quarterback,'' said Hartsburg of the Ducks, who
hadn't had an effective one since Dmitri Mironov played the point
position on the '96-97 Anaheim power play, which finished ninth in
the league. ``Most good power plays have a guy back there who can
score and make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have three good players down low and if you have no
threat up top, I think you are easy to defend. It gives us more
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya did not play the point in college and only sporadically
during his first four NHL seasons, but the winger has made himself
right at home on the blue line this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is one of the few guys who can step in, play the point
and look natural at it,'' said Olausson, who often plays the other
point opposite Kariya and has contributed 17 power play points of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his intelligence and skills. Like getting shots through
to the net; that's the difference between a good player and a great
player.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Kariya tries to deflect the attention and praise,
preferring to credit the power play's overall chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a group that has played together for a while now,'' he
said, refering to Teemu Selanne, Olausson, Rucchin, and Marty
McInnis or Tomas Sandstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the coaches) have stuck with us and that has helped. In
the past we were always switching around. Now, you get to know
where somebody is and when somebody is going to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, who leads the team with nine power play goals, said
shooting is the key to power play success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how well you move the puck, if you don't
shoot,'' he said. ``You have to make the right decision when to
pass and when to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   The room the Ducks are getting on their power play is exactly
what they are trying to take away when they kill penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin says the Ducks are trying to do that by pressuring the
puck more and taking some of the pressure off goalie Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, they'd want us to pressure, but when the other
team got the puck, we'd kind of sit back in our box,'' he
explained. ``Now we want guys to be jumping players at all times
and it seems to be working. Obviously, the less time you have, the
less time you have to make a play.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The growth of Medicare slowed last year to a
virtual halt as spending in the giant health insurance program for
the elderly rose by just 1.5 percent, the smallest increase since
the beginning of the program in 1965, new government data show.
</P>
<P>
   The slower rate of growth will probably add a few years to the
life of the Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the
elderly. And it may temporarily relax the pressure on Congress to
redesign the program. But officials said that it does not
fundamentally alter the long-term outlook for Medicare, which will
incur immense new costs as baby boomers become eligible after 2010.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Medicare spending last year grew more slowly
than the federal budget as a whole, which increased by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown shows the effects of congressional curbs on
payments to hospitals and home health care agencies and the results
of a federal crusade against Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Medicare spending rose by an average of
$12.8 billion, or 10 percent, a year. But in 1998, it grew just
$3.1 billion, to a total of $213.6 billion, according to recent
statements of federal spending from the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are all rightly concerned about the growth of future
costs, Medicare right now is amazingly well behaved,'' said Robert
Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
``Nobody is really sure why Medicare spending has slowed down quite
as much as it has. The only thing we can be sure of is that it
won't last.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Medicare beneficiaries grew last year by slightly
more than 1 percent, to 39 million. So the average increase in
Medicare spending for each beneficiary was close to zero, budget
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The experts offer several explanations. Congress intentionally
curbed payments to hospitals, home health agencies and other health
care providers in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and the savings
so far have exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and hospitals have historically absorbed such cutbacks
without reducing services to patients, but there is evidence that
some beneficiaries are having difficulty gaining or keeping access
to home health care services.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay within their Medicare budgets, home health agencies
are avoiding higher-cost patients, chronically ill patients and
those who need the most care,'' said William Dombi, vice president
of the National Association for Home Care.
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations, saying their costs are rising
faster than the payments they receive, have dropped more than
400,000 Medicare patients from their rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Federal efforts to curb fraud and abuse also appear to have
slowed the growth of Medicare. Health care executives said the
federal investigation of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. had sent a
chill through the hospital industry and encouraged greater
compliance by health care providers of all types, including
doctors, who fear prosecution for submitting false claims.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has pumped money into such investigations for several
years, and June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of
Health and Human Services, has led a crackdown on Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Scully, president of the Federation of American Health
Systems, which represents 1,400 for-profit hospitals, said:
``People in hospitals _ the billing clerks and their supervisors _
are generally scared to death of being investigated for billing
errors, accidental or intentional. Revenues are dropping because
hospitals are being ultraconservative in their billing practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's growth last year was significantly slower than that
of private health insurance plans. In a recent survey of 207 large
employers, Towers Perrin, a management consulting concern, found
that the cost of employee health benefits increased 4 percent on
the average last year, with an increase of 7 percent forecast for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that
Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which pays hospital bills
for the elderly, would run out of money in 2010. But health policy
experts now say the trust fund will probably not be depleted until
some time after 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund had been expected to lose $4 billion in 1998, but
instead it posted a surplus of nearly $1 billion. The trust fund's
revenues, mainly from payroll taxes, were $2 billion higher than
expected, thanks to a strong economy, and spending was $3 billion
less than projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   Spending from the hospital trust fund declined last year by
one-half of 1 percent, to $136.7 billion. Spending for doctors'
services and other items covered by a separate trust fund rose by
5.1 percent, to $76.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Moon, a public trustee of the Medicare trust funds,
said, ``The 1997 Balanced Budget Act will do more than people
thought to hold down Medicare costs.'' For example, she said,
``spending on home health care declined from 1997 to 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays in the payment of claims also seem to have slowed the
growth of Medicare spending last year. Federal officials and
government contractors are taking more time to scrutinize claims
for errors and fraud, and these delays may have been worsened by
changes in Medicare computer systems, needed to get ready for the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, health officials said, government data show a greater lag
between the time when patients are treated and the time when
Medicare pays hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies for
those services.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays a fixed amount for each beneficiary admitted to a
hospital, and the government measures the average complexity, or
cost, of all the Medicare cases at each hospital. This ``case mix
index,'' which had been been rising for many years, declined last
year, officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Federal spending on Medicaid, the health program for poor
people, which also pays for large amounts of nursing home care,
rose last year by 5.9 percent, to $101 billion. This was larger
than the increases in 1995 and 1996, when Medicaid spending grew an
average of 3.6 percent a year. But, aside from those years, it was
the smallest increase since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The steep decline in welfare rolls has contributed to a
reduction in the number of Medicaid recipients, and this in turn
has held down Medicaid costs. Welfare officials acknowledge that
some people who leave welfare are entitled to Medicaid but do not
receive it, because they do not understand their rights or are
discouraged by the difficulties of obtaining coverage.

   (NYT20) DETROIT -- Jan. 11, 1999 -- DETROIT-CLEANUP, 1-11 -- For
close to half a century, Detroit has had a policy of not plowing
residential streets. ``Out of my 50 years, it has never been
plowed,'' says James E. Barksdale, a 75-year-old retired auto parts
worker, of the street in front of his home on the city's east side.

whether it sees sufficient cause for a nine-month study of whether
black-tailed prairie dogs, seen recently in a field, should be
listed as a threatened species. The notion of declaring the animals
threatened is greeted by most private ranchers and farmers in the

York in 1992. With ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Stoppard completes an
arc that began in 1967 with ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are

 &HT;    Gov. Bush endorses bill for religious freedom
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush gave a pre-session
endorsement Monday to legislation that would prohibit government
from interfering with the free exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country was founded on the rock of religious freedom,''
Bush said in a press conference. ``Yet recent court decisions have
begun chipping away at that rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas intends to restore it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which would replace
a national version struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1997,
would require government to have a ``compelling interest'' before
it could limit the free exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has bi-partisan support in the Texas House and Senate
and from a broad base of religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's enforcement strength, according to University of
Texas law professor Doug Laycock, is the right to ``sue for an
injunction to require the state agency to comply with the statute.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would waive the state's sovereign immunity,
clearing the way for anyone to sue the state for damages if the act
is violated. The act will apply to state and local governments and
any government-related entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill . . . puts the burden on government to have such a
compelling public interest before it in any way limits religious
expression,'' Bush said. ``Court decisions have made it easier for
government to encroach on people's religious rights, one small
action at at time: one bureaucratic rule; one regulatory decision;
one threatened lawsuit. That is unacceptable in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill parallels a national one that was passed by Congress,
signed by President Clinton in 1993, and struck down by the Supreme
Court in 1997. The court heard a case involving a Roman Catholic
church in Boerne _ about 80 miles southwest of Austin in the Hill
Country _ that wanted to expand its sanctuary but was refused a
building permit by local officials because the building was in a
historic district.
</P>
<P>
   The church countered that government was interfering with its
exercise of religion under the federal Religious Freedom
Restoration Act. Laycock, an expert on church-state issues, argued
the case before the Supreme Court on behalf of the church. The
court ruled in a 6-3 decision that Congress did not have the
authority to impose the law on the states.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, states are enacting their own laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in the most narrow and compelling of circumstances should
government interfere with a citizen's right to free exercise of
religion,'' said Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``When enforcement of regulation interferes with someone's
religious practice, it should be up to the government to prove that
enforcing the law in this particular case protects a vital public
need,'' added Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley and Hochberg are two of the bill's primary sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act was in response to
a 1990 Supreme Court decision that removed the longstanding
``strict scrutiny'' test, which said religions could not be unduly
burdened unless there was a ``compelling state interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Some liberal groups worried that the federal act might cause
discrimination, for example by offering rights to landlords who
refused to rent to non-married couples for religious reasons. That
concern does not apply to the Texas bill, Laycock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue can't arise in Texas because we don't prohibit
non-marital discrimination anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the law could offer prisoners some rights, Laycock
said. Under the act, any Texas prison that doesn't already
accommodate prisoners' religious dietary requirements probably
would have to, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But the law won't protect everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the act will not shield gang members, who can be
prohibited from wearing religious symbols in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a compelling public reason why you don't let gang
members wear religious icons,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is supported by mainline religious leaders throughout
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rare indeed when the religious community speaks with one
voice,'' said Phil Strickland of the Baptist General Convention of
Texas, who helped to build the religious community coalition
supporting the measure. Every religious leader that was asked to
support the bill has signed on, he added.
</P>

OLYMPIC SCANDAL TARNISHES SALT LAKE CITY'S MODERN IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 5th graf, A member ..., to CORRECT date of upcoming
election to November, sted 2000; ADDS quote 4th graph; minor
changes, tightening throughout.)  (pr) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ For the past decade, Salt Lake City has been on
a roll. It has boomed as a Western high-tech center, one of the
nation's fastest-growing cities, and shed its image as a backwater
whose only claim was that it was the capital of the Mormon
religion. The 2002 Winter Olympics Games were supposed to be the
city's chance to show the world just how far it has come.
</P>
<P>
   But a scandal involving bribery allegations against top Olympic
officials has tarnished this city's effort to project a new a more
cosmopolitan image to the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the evolving scandal apparently claimed its latest
victim, one who has not been publicly linked with any corruption
allegations, Salt Lake City's mayor. The mayor, Deedee Corradini,
announced she would not run for a third term, crushing her dream of
presiding over the Olympics here. Only a year ago, the mayor,
smiling radiantly and dressed in a flame orange jumpsuit, accepted
the Olympic flag at the end of the Winter Olympics in Nagano,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, the 54-year mayor, with tears in her eyes,
alluded to the growing scandal only in passing, ``Despite all the
controversy swirling around Salt Lake City these days, I want you
to know this is a purely personal decision.'' She added, ``You
don't make a four-year decision based on a two- week event.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee board since she took
office seven years ago, Ms. Corradini maintained warm relations
with the International Olympic Committee, telling reporters on
several occasions in recent months that committee members were
urging her to run in November for a third term. But now four
official inquiries into the two Olympic committees are under way.
On Friday, she sat stolidly as the resignations were announced of
the top leadership of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee: Frank
Joklik, the president, and Dave Johnson, the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Utah's governor, Michael O. Leavitt, called for
``quick and complete'' disclosure of any wrongdoing in the bidding
process by Salt Lake City for the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This did not start in Salt Lake City, but it needs to stop
here,'' the Governor, a Republican, said in an interview. Referring
to the president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan
Antonio Samaranch, he said, ``President Samaranch has given me his
personal assurance that those involved will be expelled.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a state panel could produce its report as early as
next week, the governor continued: ``This needs to be a turning
point for the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   The games are expected to cost $1.45 billion, and organizers are
worried that corporate sponsors may shy away if scandal taints the
selection process. Last week, U S West Inc., the official
telecommunications sponsor, announced it was delaying a $5 million
payment, pending answers to a series of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assurance I have had with the corporate sponsors I have
talked with has been that they will see this through,'' the
governor said, noting that he had talked to two companies.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Utahans had started pursuing the Winter
Olympics as an opportunity to show the world their state's modern
face.
</P>
<P>
   Greater Salt Lake now boasts of having more high-tech companies
_ 2,120 _ than fast food restaurants. And Salt Lake has the
nation's highest proportion of households with personal computers,
about 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive over its national image as a square city, dominated by
Mormons who shun coffee and alcohol, city promoters once gave
visiting sports reporters bottles of local beer and pointedly noted
that the city's first Starbucks coffee shop had just opened.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the Olympics, Salt Lake has become a vast
pre-Olympic construction site. Crews are building projects worth
more than $2 billion: a new runway and a refurbished terminal for
the international airport, a European-style light-rail system, new
hotels, an athlete's village, a winter sports park and an expansion
of the local football stadium to 50,000 seats. Commuters have
endured epic traffic jams as the north-south Interstate here, I-15,
is widened from six lanes to 10 lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Forty minutes to the east, in the snow-covered mountains of the
Wasatch Front, workers are putting the finishing touches on the
Olympic venues: ski jumps, luge runs, bobsled runs and Nordic
trails. Utah's 14 ski resorts are investing heavily, hoping to use
favorable Olympics publicity to catch up with Colorado, their
winter sports rival on the other side of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   On a state level, Utahans were so eager to get the Olympics that
they voted a sales tax to build Olympic facilities in 1989, six
years before the International Olympic Committee gave the state the
nod in the summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the recent airing of the Olympics selection
committee's dirty laundry, the Winter Games were backed by 62
percent of 423 Utah voters interviewed last weekend for a
KASL/Deseret News poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are demanding the right to review the books, but I
don't think they will lose the Olympics,'' said Dan Jones, whose
polling company conducted the survey. Noting that popular support
was in the midrange for polls conducted in the last five years, he
predicted that ``Governor Leavitt will turn over every stone'' to
clarify the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Utah's sometimes squeaky clean image, the state has been
plagued in past years by white collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, only weeks after her election, Ms. Corradini, a
Democrat, was embroiled in the collapse of the Bonneville Pacific
Corporation, an alternative energy company. Several company
principals went to jail in the case. Ms. Corradini, who was an
officer of a related corporate entity, agreed to an $800,000
settlement with Bonneville's bankrupcy trustee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a few months after the mayor was narrowly re-elected,
it became known that to pay the bankrupcy settlement she had
solicited and received $231,000 in gifts and loans from prominent
residents. A report on to the City Council about the gifts found
that half of the 24 individuals who gave or loaned money to the
mayor had business with the city.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Gunnarson, the Salt Lake County District Attorney and a
friend of the mayor, decided not to file charges in the affair,
citing the city's vaguely worded laws on conflicts of interest.
When she was not indicted, Ms. Corradini claimed vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics scandal really was what has ended her political
career,'' Deeda Seed, a Democratic member of the City Council, said
Monday.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola, the longest-running and biggest-spending
Olympic sponsor, said Monday the escalating bribery scandal
surrounding the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City could threaten
the corporation's future Olympic funding if not cleared up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not handled properly, this could have significant negative
impact on our involvement with the Games as well as that of other
sponsors,'' Coca-Cola Olympic marketing spokesman Ben Deutch said.
</P>
<P>
   Because corporate and public support is the lifeblood of the
Olympics, the International Olympic Committee is marshaling a
public relations campaign to preserve both as the scandal continued
to puncture the integrity of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing director in Lausanne,
Switzerland, is scheduled to meet with Coca-Cola officials today
and Wednesday in Atlanta to update them on the IOC's investigation
of the Salt Lake situation and to shore up support. Payne met with
officials of public relations powerhouse Hill &AMP; Knowlton in New
York on Monday. He will traverse the country to meet with other
worldwide sponsors, including Atlanta-based United Parcel Service,
Xerox and Visa, which pay upward of $40 million for a four-year
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate support remains an issue in Salt Lake, where $350
million of the $1.45 billion budget has yet to be raised.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Hodler, the IOC executive board member from Switzerland who
sparked the Olympic corruption investigation last month, said
Monday he believed the Salt Lake Games could be moved elsewhere or
canceled if organizers fall short of their budget in the event of
eroding corporate backing.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler ignited the biggest scandal in IOC history by alleging
that Salt Lake's efforts to secure the 2002 Games amounted to
bribery and by citing widespread corruption in other campaigns for
host cities, including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, IOC Vice President Anita DeFrantz indicated as many
as 12 committee members might be ousted in the ensuing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini, who helped win the
Winter Games for her city, said she has decided not to run for
re-election, but that it has nothing to do with the Olympic bribery
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to Olympic funding, Australia's Sydney Morning
Herald reported Monday that Caltex, a joint venture of the U.S. oil
companies Texaco and Chevron, had written to the organizing
committee for the Summer Games in 2000 that it was withdrawing from
an arrangement that would have set up a $6.3 million sponsorship
deal. A company spokesman cited a downturn in the oil industry, not
the Salt Lake scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is already committed to sponsoring the Summer and
Winter Games through 2008. Only one other corporate sponsor,
Time/Sports Illustrated, is locked into such a lengthy contract.
Many of the current worldwide sponsors, including UPS, have yet to
commit to Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic brand is everything to us,'' said Susan Rosenberg,
Olympic marketing spokeswoman for UPS. ``But it is now premature
for us to go into a tailspin and determine if there's been a
serious damage to the brand. They need to fix it in a way not only
addressing the specifics of what happened in Salt Lake City, but
(that) also establishes a standard so there can be nothing
misconstrued moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's worldwide marketing agency, Atlanta-based Meridian
Management, also is working to soothe sponsors' concerns. ``We are
communicating with our partners on a daily basis and making them
comfortable that the IOC is taking the steps they need to take,''
said Terrence Burns, who managed Delta Air Lines' Olympic marketing
program in 1996 before joining Meridian as a senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these folks have long-term relationships with the IOC.
They are interested in this thing being solved quickly and
correctly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has been a sponsor since 1928 and, as a result, wields
considerable influence. The company spent more than $200 million on
its sponsorship and marketing of the Atlanta Games and the Olympic
torch relay.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola executives have expressed their concerns to Payne and
to Dick Pound, the IOC executive board member overseeing the
investigation. They've also talked to officials with the U.S.
Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake committee, and are concerned
about the results of ongoing investigations by the U.S. Justice
Department as well as a USOC ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a problem here that has to get fixed,'' Deutch said.
``It's not only a public relations issue, it is an operational
issue if the allegations are true. There is a process here that has
been violated. If those things occurred, then there needs to be a
change in the process or an enforcement of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Joklik, president of Salt Lake's organizing committee,
resigned last week after detailing a pattern of giving
scholarships, free medical treatment, lavish gifts and cash
payments of up to $70,000 to IOC members and their families during
the city's bid for the 2002 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg of UPS said, ``It's not enough to just point fingers.
The mere fact that people stand up and say mea culpa, the mere act
of an individual resigning, is not enough for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see what decisive action is taken to prevent this
from happening in the future, what action taken will mitigate
damage to the brand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS will decide later this year if it will sign up for another
four-year Olympic sponsorship, Rosenberg noted. ``What happens will
factor into that decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns of Meridian Management said he believes the Olympics will
emerge unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are able to differentiate between the movement itself
and individuals in it,'' he said. ``The brand is 2,500 years old
and has been through a lot. And it has endured. It has, and will
continue to have, great attraction for sponsors and the public in
general, as long as it does things to maintain their confidence.''

 &HT;    Olympics could lose Coke deal
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General news and (f) Financial categories.)
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola, the longest-running and biggest-spending
Olympic sponsor, said Monday the escalating bribery scandal
surrounding the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City could threaten
the corporation's future Olympic funding if not cleared up quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not handled properly, this could have significant negative
impact on our involvement with the Games as well as that of other
sponsors,'' Coca-Cola Olympic marketing spokesman Ben Deutch said.
</P>
<P>
   Because corporate and public support is the lifeblood of the
Olympics, the International Olympic Committee is marshaling a
public relations campaign to preserve both as the scandal continued
to puncture the integrity of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing director in Lausanne,
Switzerland, is scheduled to meet with Coca-Cola officials today
and Wednesday in Atlanta to update them on the IOC's investigation
of the Salt Lake situation and to shore up support. Payne met with
officials of public relations powerhouse Hill &AMP; Knowlton in New
York on Monday. He will traverse the country to meet with other
worldwide sponsors, including Atlanta-based United Parcel Service,
Xerox and Visa, which pay upward of $40 million for a four-year
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate support remains an issue in Salt Lake, where $350
million of the $1.45 billion budget has yet to be raised.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Hodler, the IOC executive board member from Switzerland who
sparked the Olympic corruption investigation last month, said
Monday he believed the Salt Lake Games could be moved elsewhere or
canceled if organizers fall short of their budget in the event of
eroding corporate backing.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler ignited the biggest scandal in IOC history by alleging
that Salt Lake's efforts to secure the 2002 Games amounted to
bribery and by citing widespread corruption in other campaigns for
host cities, including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, IOC Vice President Anita DeFrantz indicated as many
as 12 committee members might be ousted in the ensuing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini, who helped win the
Winter Games for her city, said she has decided not to run for
re-election, but that it has nothing to do with the Olympic bribery
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to Olympic funding, Australia's Sydney Morning
Herald reported Monday that Caltex, a joint venture of the U.S. oil
companies Texaco and Chevron, had written to the organizing
committee for the Summer Games in 2000 that it was withdrawing from
an arrangement that would have set up a $6.3 million sponsorship
deal. A company spokesman cited a downturn in the oil industry, not
the Salt Lake scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is already committed to sponsoring the Summer and
Winter Games through 2008. Only one other corporate sponsor,
Time/Sports Illustrated, is locked into such a lengthy contract.
Many of the current worldwide sponsors, including UPS, have yet to
commit to Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic brand is everything to us,'' said Susan Rosenberg,
Olympic marketing spokeswoman for UPS. ``But it is now premature
for us to go into a tailspin and determine if there's been a
serious damage to the brand. They need to fix it in a way not only
addressing the specifics of what happened in Salt Lake City, but
(that) also establishes a standard so there can be nothing
misconstrued moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's worldwide marketing agency, Atlanta-based Meridian
Management, also is working to soothe sponsors' concerns. ``We are
communicating with our partners on a daily basis and making them
comfortable that the IOC is taking the steps they need to take,''
said Terrence Burns, who managed Delta Air Lines' Olympic marketing
program in 1996 before joining Meridian as a senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these folks have long-term relationships with the IOC.
They are interested in this thing being solved quickly and
correctly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has been a sponsor since 1928 and, as a result, wields
considerable influence. The company spent more than $200 million on
its sponsorship and marketing of the Atlanta Games and the Olympic
torch relay.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola executives have expressed their concerns to Payne and
to Dick Pound, the IOC executive board member overseeing the
investigation. They've also talked to officials with the U.S.
Olympic Committee and the Salt Lake committee, and are concerned
about the results of ongoing investigations by the U.S. Justice
Department as well as a USOC ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a problem here that has to get fixed,'' Deutch said.
``It's not only a public relations issue, it is an operational
issue if the allegations are true. There is a process here that has
been violated. If those things occurred, then there needs to be a
change in the process or an enforcement of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Joklik, president of Salt Lake's organizing committee,
resigned last week after detailing a pattern of giving
scholarships, free medical treatment, lavish gifts and cash
payments of up to $70,000 to IOC members and their families during
the city's bid for the 2002 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg of UPS said, ``It's not enough to just point fingers.
The mere fact that people stand up and say mea culpa, the mere act
of an individual resigning, is not enough for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see what decisive action is taken to prevent this
from happening in the future, what action taken will mitigate
damage to the brand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS will decide later this year if it will sign up for another
four-year Olympic sponsorship, Rosenberg noted. ``What happens will
factor into that decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns of Meridian Management said he believes the Olympics will
emerge unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are able to differentiate between the movement itself
and individuals in it,'' he said. ``The brand is 2,500 years old
and has been through a lot. And it has endured. It has, and will
continue to have, great attraction for sponsors and the public in
general, as long as it does things to maintain their confidence.''
</P>

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton formally defended himself on
Monday for the first time against removal from office by the
Senate, arguing that he had committed no crimes and that the
charges against him are so vague and muddled that they are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, prosecutors drawn from the House of Representatives
released a scorching memorandum mapping out the case for an illegal
presidential coverup that they will begin to present on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling documents, filed in response to deadlines imposed by
the Senate, drew on the same body of evidence to provide
night-and-day versions of whether Clinton lied under oath and
obstructed justice to hide his affair with Monica Lewinsky _ and
whether the charges against him could warrant ejecting a president
from office for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   None of the wrongdoing of which the president is accused, his
lawyers argued, reaches the level of ``high crimes or
misdemeanors,'' the constitutional standard for removal from
office. ``The charges in the two articles of impeachment do not
permit the conviction and removal from office of a duly elected
president,'' they wrote in their 13-page brief.
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors took a far different view of the
charges and the stakes. ``If the president is not convicted as a
consequence of the conduct that has been portrayed,'' they wrote,
reprising arguments made before the House Judiciary Committee,
``then no House of Representatives will ever be able to impeach
again and no Senate will ever convict. The bar will be so high that
only a convicted felon or a traitor will need to be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In an intensifying flurry of paper, the filings came as each
side refined its legal and political arguments in preparation for
Thursday. The defense filing on Monday was in response to a summons
from the Senate last Friday. On Wednesday, the president's team is
expected to provide the Senate with a fuller brief rebutting
Monday's prosecutorial document, which at 105 pages contained much
more detail.
</P>
<P>
   Although he met briefly with his lawyers and political team this
morning, Clinton did not comment in public on his filing. Instead,
he presided over the state visit by President Carlos Menem of
Argentina, greeting him in the Grand Foyer on Monday morning,
meeting with him at length and holding a state dinner for him this
evening. In an unusual move, the White House did not schedule a
joint press conference for the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton sat down with Menem at the White House, nine of
the 13 House prosecutors toured the floor of the Senate, where new
tables were installed over the weekend for the prosecution and
defense tea
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spent two hours Monday afternoon in the Oval Office
with his senior advisers to discuss his State of the Union Message.
The White House said that despite the objections even of some
Democrats, Clinton still planned to give the speech to both houses
of Congress on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   To contest charges that Clinton lied under oath and obstructed
justice, his lawyers boiled down their previous lengthy factual
arguments into a tightly focused summary. They attacked what they
called myths about his sworn testimony before the grand jury
investigating his relationship with Lewinsky. He simply did not
tell lies that the House accused him of telling, they said.
</P>
<P>
   They said, for example, that it was a myth ``that the president
failed to admit his improper intimate relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they noted, Clinton read a prepared statement at the
beginning of his testimony acknowledging ``inappropriate intimate
contact.'' The statement's intent, the lawyers wrote, was to permit
prosecutors to ``obtain necessary information without unduly
dwelling on the salacious details of the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House prosecutors tried to turn that same statement
against the president, saying that it ``contained totally false
assertions and other clearly misleading information.''
</P>
<P>
   On the charges of obstruction of justice, the president's
lawyers saw sweeping vindication where the prosecutors saw an
absurdly narrow interpretation of the facts. Clinton's defense, as
presented on Monday, relies heavily on Lewinsky statement to the
grand jury _ unprompted by prosecutors _ that ``no one every asked
me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Expecting that argument, the prosecutors had prepared a salvo of
derision, turning against Clinton a favorite White House term for
describing his ability to divide his attention. The evidence, they
wrote, ``cannot be compartmentalized.'' Events and words that seem
innocent, they added, ``may well take on a sinister, or even
criminal, connotation when observed in the context of the whole
plot.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House brief was delivered to the Secretary of the
Senate at 11:48 a.m. by G. Timothy Saunders, Clinton's executive
clerk, who routinely ferries White House documents to the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   While it responded on Monday as mandated to the Senate summons,
the White House passed up an opportunity to file motions
challenging the charges or the conduct of the trial by 5 p.m. Such
motions, White House aides said, could have delayed the trial for
weeks, and they are eager to move it along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the judgment that the Senate should go forward in the
way they're going forward, and we shouldn't try to pre-empt this
process before both sides have had a chance to make their case,''
said Joseph Lockhart, the White House press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican senators voted unanimously on Friday
to approve the procedure for conducting the trial, and if the White
House had objected, it may have appeared to be playing the spoiler.
The move might have alienated some of the jurors Clinton needs.
Filing motions, said one senior Clinton adviser, ``didn't seem like
something that would be welcomed or effective.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House signaled that if the Senate chooses to
extend the trial beyond prosecution and defense presentations to
the calling of witnesses, it will probably file motions challenging
the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Those motions could include one arguing that the charges against
Clinton should be dropped because they are woefully imprecise. For
the first time on Monday, Clinton's lawyers advanced that line of
reasoning in their brief, using it to assault each of the two
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the article accusing Clinton of perjury
identifies no specific perjurious statements. ``One of the
fundamental principles of our law and the Constitution is that a
person has a right to know what specific charges he or she is
facing,'' the lawyers wrote, warning that otherwise a trial
``becomes a moving target for the accused.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, they argued, the first article is ``fatally flawed''
because it bundles together multiple accusations of perjury by
Clinton in his grand jury testimony, without listing individual
statements. As a result, they wrote, Clinton could be convicted by
senators who disagreed widely about his wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if 34 senators agreed that Clinton perjured himself in
Answer X, and a different 34 senators agreed that he perjured
himself in Answer Y, the Senate would have the requisite 68 votes
to convict him _ even though the 68 senators did not all agree
about what he had done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also argued that the second article of impeachment,
accusing the president of obstruction of justice ``provides little
or no concrete information about the specific acts in which the
president is alleged to have engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brief the lawyers drew heavily on Lewinsky's testimony in
attacking the charge of obstruction of justice, but not in
attacking the charge of perjury. The reason is that Lewinsky's
testimony conflicts with the president's on some issues central to
the perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are seizing on the portions of Lewinsky's testimony
that they find helpful while downplaying those that hurt.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Lockhart was pressed to say whether, in
including Lewinsky's testimony in their filing, Clinton's lawyers
were endorsing her truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that they were not. ``The inclusion of her
testimony is an acknowledgment of her testimony,'' he said. He
called the quotations in the brief ``a useful piece of information
for the senators as they move forward to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart repeated a previous assertion that the White House
would not attack Lewinsky's credibility. ``For a year now, people
in this building have not atacked her, and I don't expect that to
change,'' he said.

 Gene Stalkers Draw Potential Investors  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The money-making potential of mapping disease-causing genes drew
overflow crowds of investors to two sessions at yesterday's
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist health care conference.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day H&AMP;Q conference in San Francisco offers 240 public
and private biotech firms a chance to explain their companies to
venture capitalists, financial analysts and stock fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees lined up to hear presentations from Incyte
Pharmaceuticals of Palo Alto and Genset SA of Paris, two of several
rivals in the ``genomics'' race to identify _ and patent _ the
genes that cause heart disease, cancer and other maladies. Armed
with this data, biotech firms can then develop ``designer drugs''
to attack or prevent these diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte portrayed the race as a new gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability here to discover every disease
pathway,'' Incyte chief executive Roy Whitfield promised the crowd
that spilled out of the Grand Ballroom at the Westin St. Francis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Whitfield's 30-minute presentation followed a similar talk by
Pascal Brandys, chief executive of Genset.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a race here, very clearly,'' Brandys said. ``As soon
as the gene is associated with a disease,'' a firm can file for a
patent.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte's Whitfield spent much of his presentation discussing the
fact that his firm, unlike many competitors, is already generating
a profit by selling some of the genetic information it has
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be several years before clear winners emerge in the
genomics sweepstakes, making investments now highly speculative,
according to Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock
Letter in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte gained $1.25 yesterday to close at $37.75. Genset, which
is traded on the Munich exchange, was unchanged at 69 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Lance, chief executive of Chiron Corp., used his 30-minute
talk to tell investors how he plans to refocus his Emeryville firm,
a biotech pioneer whose stock has stalled in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Lance, who took over Chiron last March, has sold off some
business units to push a handful of promising new cancer and
AIDS-fighting drugs though the Food and Drug Administration's
approval process.
</P>
<P>
   Now sitting on more than $1 billion in cash, Chiron is in the
enviable position of being able to buy up  &LR; young cash-starved
companies with promising technologies that have not been able to
stage initial public offerings because Wall Street has shied away
from small ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, said Chiron's size, cash hoard and new leadership ``make it
one of the most interesting companies around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last of the big biotech firms that hasn't had a stock
run-up,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Lance's solid but dull presentation failed to ignite much
interest yesterday as Chiron slipped 31 cents to close at $29.56.

 BofA's Investment Banking Arm Seems to Be Backing Off Biotech  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Is NationsBanc Montgomery Securities _ the investment banking arm
of the new BankAmerica _ pulling a Kevorkian with its biotech
business?
</P>
<P>
   Word in the hallways and salons of the annual Hambrecht &AMP; Quist
health care stock conference at the Westin St. Francis here is that
Montgomery is pulling the plug on its life sciences and medical
technology underwriting practices.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the move was news to BankAmerica Chairman and CEO Hugh
McColl, who launched his West Coast goodwill tour yesterday when he
met with a group of editors and reporters at The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that our company was one of the risk takers,''
McColl retorted, adding that he was unaware of such a decision by
his investment banking unit.
</P>
<P>
   A NationsBanc Montgomery Securities (yes, the legal name for the
underwriter is still NationsBanc Montgomery) was unable to confirm
the information before deadline. Investment bankers have long
speculated that NationsBanc Montgomery will shift its underwriting
emphasis away from risky, entrepreneurial sectors, such as high
tech and biotech, and concentrate on raising money for the parent
bank's existing commercial banking customers.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the silver-haired Southern dealmaker took the
opportunity to underscore why what is now BankAmerica bought
Montgomery in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery was an important acquisition to us because it would
enhance our underwriting ability,'' McColl said.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that he managed to build a significant investment
banking presence in bonds and other financial instruments prior to
the Montgomery buyout, but that the acquisition gave the new
BankAmerica the machinery necessary to underwrite initial public
offerings and other stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it been easy'' building an investment bank from the ground
up? McColl asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not. (And) we've had some of the same pain in (our
new) equity business, too,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McColl acknowledged that the second half of 1998 was
pretty rough for biotech. What's more, he underscored his bank's
fundamental strengths in underwriting energy and forest-related
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, with the prospects of a top competitor leaving the
biotech sector, H&AMP;Q Chairman Dan Case seized the opportunity to
remind potential clients that his firm is committed to the health
care and life sciences sector.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;Q is the last of four so-called technology banks that is still
independent (Robertson Stephens, Alex. Brown and Montgomery were
each acquired), and Case is banking that his firm will increase
this year the volume of biotech deals that it lead-manages.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, if Montgomery is de-emphasizing biotech, then its
research department will likely reduce coverage on many of the
companies that Montgomery helped take public. Sell-side analyst
coverage of young public companies is critical to the future growth
of their stock, and it is often one of the things investment
bankers pledge to provide after the IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview yesterday, Case couldn't help but fire a shot at
his Bay Area rivals. ``We've always believed in doing what we
promised our clients,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PULLING THE TRIGGER &LR; : From the better late than never file. ...
As reported last summer by Street Smarts, San Francisco's
MarketWatch.com (parent company of the financial Web site CBS
MarketWatch) is going forward with its plans for an initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company's underwriters are expected to price its shares as
early as this Thursday. About 2.75 million shares will go on the
market at a price estimated between $10 and $12 a share. The deal
is being lead-managed by BT Alex. Brown assisted by Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, MarketWatch management was shooting for a mid-August
IPO after several hot offerings had ignited the new issue market
last summer, especially those by Broadcast.com and Inktomi. But of
course, August's market meltdown placed most offerings on the back
burner for the fourth quarter of 1998.

FOR YEAR 2000, UTILITIES EXPECT NO BIG PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A succession of electric industry officials and the
secretary of energy said Monday that the utilities had made
substantial progress toward eradicating the threat of
computer-induced blackout on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to build public confidence in the industry on which so
much activity depends, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said at a
briefing for reporters, ``We can be cautiously optimistic about the
prospects for the industry meeting its Y2K challenge.'' Tests and
repairs are now more than half done, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Electric Reliability Council, an umbrella
group that in the past has mostly concerned itself with whether
enough generating stations and transmission lines were in operation
to meet demand, released a report that forecast only minor
problems. These ``do not appear to affect the ability to keep
generators and power delivery facilities in service and electricity
supplied to customers,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   North America's four major electric grids run from moment to
moment with the aid of complex digital computer systems, but
experts said that even if parts of those failed, the system was
mostly reliant on heavy equipment that would keep plodding along,
much of it controlled by old-fashioned nondigital components that
do not have software.
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials said they were still a little anxious
about the telephone system, without which they cannot operate. They
plan two major Year 2000 tests in the coming months but got started
too late to involve the phone companies in the tests, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that if the telecommunications and electric systems
hold together, all else will work or can at least be fixed. But
those two systems require each other, and if either fails,
disruptions will be more widespread and persistent, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem is an artifact of computer programmers'
decisions in years past to enter years as two-digit numbers; when
the clock rolls over from 99 to 00, some computers will shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities could be especially vulnerable because of their
interconnections, with hundreds of generators belonging to hundreds
of utilities mostly run by computers in 136 separate control
centers, which themselves are linked by computer and telephone
lines, swapping power among utilities and among centers minute by
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Michehl R. Gent, president of the reliability council, said,
``The networks are so tightly tied together that if we have some
kind of upset in Minneapolis, we can tell by frequency variations
in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Interconnection is generally considered to improve reliability,
because when all the generators pull together, the failure of a
single one is like a decision by a single rower on a big scull to
stop pulling; the boat continues almost unaffected. But unsure
about their neighbors, some utilities have lately speculated about
cutting themselves loose. Gent said Monday that this would be a
last-ditch tactic.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, appointed by President Clinton to coordinate the
federal government's Year 2000 efforts, said, ``In this industry,
our worst-case scenarios appear not to involve anything that looks
like a national failure.''

BANANA REPUBLIC CLERK CHARGED WITH FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sales clerk at a Banana Republic store on
Manhattan's Upper East Side has been arrested and accused of
defrauding the store out of more than $50,000 during the busy
pre-Christmas rush, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk, Carolyn Peters, 47, was arrested Sunday evening as
she left the store at 59th Street and Lexington Avenue and faces
charges of grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen
property, said Lt. Richard Ference of the Police Department's grand
larceny task force.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplice who did not work at the store, identified as Peter
Jamwant, 31, was arrested on the same charges, Ference said.
</P>
<P>
   Ference declined to explain how the scheme worked, except to say
that it involved ``the fraudulent use of a credit card.'' But a law
enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
that Ms. Peters was accused of taking merchandise from the shelves,
entering it into the store's computers as returned goods and then
having refunds added to the credit card accounts of friends and
accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Ms. Peters was also charged with stealing
clothes from the store and giving them to Jamwant, who is accused
of selling the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Both were being held Monday night awaiting arraignments on
charges of larceny and possession of stolen property, officials
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ference said Ms. Peters and Jamwant, who met while working
together at another store, were accused of stealing more than
$50,000. The law enforcement official said that detectives were
investigating the extent of the scheme and that the final tally
could reach as much as $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ference said that Banana Republic officials discovered the
problem after doing an audit and conducting their own
investigation. The main thefts took place on Dec. 23 and 24, he
said. The police were called in last week, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Banana Republic, Cindy Capobianco, declined to
comment.

 &HT;    Infant undergoes skin transplant operation
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a procedure that scientists say heralds a new era of
factory-harvested body parts, doctors here are replacing most of
the skin of a 2-month-old Broward County girl using a product grown
from human skin nurtured in a bed of cow collagen.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-minute operation performed Monday at the Jackson Children's
Hospital _ one of dozens Tori Cameron will undergo in the next few
months _ appeared virtually painless to the infant. Though the
product, called Apligraf, has been used to treat skin ulcers in
hundreds of patients, Tori is the youngest person to receive such a
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   She also is the first Apligraf patient with epidermolysis
bullosa, a rare disease that causes her skin to rub off at the
slightest friction and has left her covered in purple and black
blisters.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure performed Monday was the 15th graft Cameron has
received since she was 11 days old.
</P>
<P>
   University of Miami doctors gently placed a circular piece of
the pink-hued Apligraf over a raw, red sore on Tori's tiny right
calf. Then they covered it in anti-bacterial ointment and wrapped
it in gauze.
</P>
<P>
   In six days the area will be indistinguishable from healthy
patches of her natural skin, said Dr. William Eaglstein, the
chairman of dermatology at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is potentially, a very exciting therapeutic
breakthrough,'' said Dr. Lawrence Schachner, a professor of
pediatrics and dermatology at the University of Miami. ``There is
really no other treatment for this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Bio-engineered skin begins to realize medicine's potential to
grow custom body organs and nerves, Eaglstein said. Apligraf is the
first mass-produced substance containing living human cells to be
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to
Organogenesis, the Canton, Mass.-based company that makes it.
</P>
<P>
   Science is less than 20 years away from growing livers, hearts,
kidneys and even spinal cords, Eaglstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Apligraf is made by sterilizing the foreskin of circumcised
infants and nourishing it with protein of cow collagen. Kept at
body temperature in a company factory, the skin cells divide at a
phenomenal rate. One postal stamp-sized piece of foreskin can
multiply enough times in 21 days to cover six football fields.
</P>
<P>
   And because the nearly-transparent skin has no pigments or
immune-system cells, it will not be rejected by the recipient. In a
process scientists do not completely understand, Apligraf blends in
and actually stimulates the patient's own skin to rebuild itself.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, Lorraine and Randy Cameron hope the Apligraf will
eventually teach their daughter's skin to grow normally.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of epidermolysis bullosa do not have the normal
anchoring mechanisms that attach skin to flesh. As a result, the
slightest rubbing or friction causes sores and blisters as the skin
rubs off. About one in three babies born with this disease _ which
affects 100,000 people in the United States _ die before their
first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   It takes the Camerons up to 45 minutes to change Tori's diapers.
Her arms and legs are wrapped in gauze from previous grafts. The
dressing must be changed once a day, which can take an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go at her pace,'' said Lorraine Cameron. ``Whatever she can
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her parents' precautions, Tori is covered in blisters.
But on the 40 percent of her body where Apligraf has been applied,
almost no new blisters have appeared. Doctors plan to cover about
80 percent of her skin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anna Falabella, an assistant professor of dermatology,
perforates the Apligraf four times with a scalpel before placing it
on the baby. The holes allow the pusfrom Tori's blisters to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Just like real skin, Apligraf can heal itself. Because it is a
living organism, it is packed it a pinkish nutrient for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   It will stay alive only for five days between the laboratory and
the patient, and must be heated to body temperature before it is
applied. Each piece costs $975. Most insurers have paid for the
procedure when used to treat leg ulcers, Eaglstein said.

ADVERTISING AGENCIES STILL HAVE URGE TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo, Ill., Iowa, Ohio, Mass., Pa., Texas, Belgium,
Canada, England)  (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mergers and acquisitions on Madison Avenue continue
to be alive and well in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Any lingering doubts that 1999 would be another year of frenetic
deal-making along Madison Avenue are being dispelled with a spate
of agreements involving agencies specializing in assignments as
disparate as retail advertising, entertainment marketing, employee
communications and direct marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to merge is proving strong enough to stimulate renewed
speculation that some giant agency companies are poised to bid for
competitors. One subject of rumors over the weekend, Cordiant
Communications Group PLC in London, issued a statement Monday
denying reports that it was in negotiations to be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the realm of the real deal, the Integer Group in
Lakewood, Colo., said Monday that it had acquired Stern Advertising
in Cleveland. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has 80 employees in Cleveland and field offices in
Buffalo, N.Y.; Dayton, Ohio; Pittsburgh, and Syracuse, N.Y.,
handling accounts with capitalized billings estimated at $96
million for retailers like Homeplace Stores Inc., McDonald's Corp.
and Sterling Jewelers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Stern will operate autonomously as Stern Advertising, a member
of the Integer Group. William Stern, 52, president of Stern, will
stay in that job. Integer has 581 employees at three units _
Integer Denver, Integer Dallas and Kragie/Newell in Des Moines _
handling accounts with capitalized billings estimated at almost
$400 million for clients like the Blockbuster Entertainment unit of
Viacom Inc., McDonald's and the 7-Eleven unit of the Southland
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the field of entertainment marketing, five top employees of
Russek Advertising, a New York agency known for work for accounts
like Lincoln Center Theater, the Joyce Theater, the show ``Stomp''
and Columbia Artists Management, are joining Berenter Greenhouse &AMP;
Webster in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts represent about three-quarters of the clients of
Russek, said Jim Russek, president of Russek, which closed on Dec.
31 after grappling with what he described as debts incurred from
unsuccessful theatrical productions. Russek, 52, becomes a vice
president at Berenter Greenhouse, which has billings estimated at
$140 million from clients such as Bed Bath and Beyond, Noodle
Kidoodle and Starbucks Coffee Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim's experience could bring a lot to our retail accounts,''
said Bill Berenter, chairman and co-creative director at Berenter
Greenhouse, ``because entertainment plays a large part in the
success of retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   In employee communications, Ketchum in New York, the public
relations agency owned by Omnicom Group, acquired Sheppard
Associates in Glendale, Calif., for undisclosed terms.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard, with 85 employees in Glendale and seven other cities
like Boston, Chicago and Houston, will become the foundation for
what Ketchum describes as a new worldwide unit, the Workplace
Communication Practice, which will specialize in tasks like
internal communications, human resources and labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have been saying for years that employees are
important,'' said David Drobis, senior partner and chief executive
at Ketchum. ``Now they're starting to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fleischer, 45, partner and director of the Ketchum Chicago
office, was named to the additional position of heading the
workplace practice as partner there. Don Sheppard, 52, will remain
chief executive of Sheppard, which has $14 million in income from
clients like Media One and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to direct marketing, Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in Chicago
acquired CM Partners, a direct marketing agency in Rolling Meadows,
Ill., with billings estimated at $100 million from clients like
American Medical Association and Progressive Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wells, a spokeswoman at Foote, Cone, a unit of True North
Communications, said that CM Partners and its 70 employees would be
integrated into Impact Direct, the agency's marketing-services arm.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Land, 36, president of CM Partners, was named to the new
position of executive vice president and integrated communications
director at Foote, Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Clive MacLean, 39, who had been executive vice president and
managing director at CM Partners, will become an executive vice
president at Foote, Cone, and a co-director of Impact Direct. Scott
Grafft, 47, senior vice president and direct marketing director at
Foote, Cone, is being promoted to executive vice president as he
becomes the other co-director at Impact Direct.
</P>
<P>
   Another agency, Draft Worldwide, a unit of the Interpublic Group
of Cos. that offers direct marketing and integrated-marketing
services, acquired three integrated-marketing shops in Belgium,
Britain and Canada and a data base management company in France.
Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition in Canada, Gingko Group Ltd. of Toronto, marks
Draft's entry into that country.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, turning to the deal that apparently is not, the
statement issued by Cordiant came in response to reports in the
trade publication Adweek and a London newspaper that Cordiant was
in serious discussions to be acquired by True North.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Telegraph of London reported that True North planned
a cash bid of more than $574 million for Cordiant, which owns
agencies like Bates Worldwide. Adweek reported that the two agency
companies had exchanged financial data.
</P>
<P>
   The Cordiant statement acknowledged ``indications of interest in
the company'' since Cordiant was formed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' the statement continued, ``no discussions are
taking place which may lead to an offer being made for the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Harbour, a spokeswoman in Chicago for True North, which
acquired Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &AMP; Eckhardt at the end of 1997,
said: ``At this time, there are no discussions going on. There will
be no further comment because it is our policy not to comment on
acquisitions or mergers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordiant's American depository receipts rose sharply on the New
York Stock Exchange Monday on heavy trading volume, closing at
$11.8125, up $1.625. Shares of True North also rose, up $1.9375, to
$29.25.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Capping a string of unbroken legal victories for the
administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to hear an appeal Monday from sex shop owners and the New
York Civil Liberties Union that a new antipornography zoning law is
an unconstitutional infringement on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's success in carrying out the new law remains
checkered, with strip clubs and adult video stores continuing to
find legal loopholes, ranging from admitting minors to selling
enough nonadult products to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Since the city began enforcing the law in July, only 26 of the
61 sex shops that the city had sought to close have been shut down,
while 18 others have closed voluntarily, city officials said.
Scores more have yet to become the targets of the city's
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expected everyone to pack up and go out of business,''
said Herald Price Fahringer, a lawyer representing more than 100
sex shops. ``But they're standing their ground, and they're
succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the sex shops have repeatedly failed in their
effort to block the new zoning law, as shown by Monday's court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani called the development proof of the fairness of the new
zoning law, which limits adult establishments to manufacturing
areas and forbids them near schools, churches or other sex shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the court decision today is terrific,'' he said
Monday. ``It shows that you can have a sense of balance in all of
the ways that we deal with the Constitution, including the free
speech clause.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, lamented the decision. ``I think it's fair to say
that history will look back at the period and note that it was an
extremely repressive climate.''
</P>
<P>
   With the sex shops largely failing in their effort to defeat the
law, what has taken place instead has been a grinding war of legal
attrition, with the city battling to close each business one by
one, as the sex shops devise ways to skirt the law.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most highly publicized cases involves a Manhattan
strip club that avoids shutdown by allowing minors to enter,
thereby losing its label as an ``adult'' establishment. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Many more sex shops, particularly video stores, are avoiding
the impact of the law by building back rooms for pornographic
products, making the majority of their stock ``nonadult'' and
declaring themselves no longer adult entertainment businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains to be seen whether the owners of the sex shops
can outlast the campaign against them by city lawyers. Legal bills
are rising as the owners defend themselves through lengthy court
proceedings, and Fahringer said that profit margins have decreased
as the owners have cut the portion of their businesses devoted to
adult fare.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the two sides are locked in a seesaw battle. Each time
the sex shops appear to find a loophole in the law, the city
appeals to a higher court, and no clear standard has emerged that
would allow strip clubs to remain open.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ten's, a strip club on East 21st Street, was allowed to remain
open because it admitted minors. In a decision that Giuliani
assailed as ``nuts,'' Judge Stephen Crane ruled in November that
the club could remain open because the new law specifies that an
adult establishment is one that does not allow minors to enter.
</P>
<P>
   When a second strip club, the VIP club, on East 20th Street,
tried the same strategy, Crane rejected it. In a Nov. 19 ruling, he
said that because the VIP club had only recently started granting
admission to minors, the exemption did not apply. Ten's, by
contrast, had been allowing minors in for more than a year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   One week after VIP was padlocked, lawyers for the club presented
new arguments to Crane that persuaded him to reopen it. He has not
issued a written ruling explaining why he allowed the VIP Club to
reopen, but lawyers for sex shops are eagerly awaiting the reason
in the hope that they can emulate it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawyers for the city asked the Appellate Division of
the State Supreme Court to reverse Crane's ruling and throw out the
minors issue entirely. On Monday, Giuliani said the city was
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to win all of them because, like anything
else, judges interpret it differently,'' he said. ``But we've won
the vast majority of them.''

 &HT;    Tyson proves that biting pays
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ He trained in front of the cameras and crowd wearing
nothing but a black T-shirt that proclaimed ``Be Real,'' sockless
black boxing boots and fluorescent lime green bikini underwear.
</P>
<P>
   No trunks. No apologies. And certainly no humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrogance is an ingredient of greatness,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   This was Mike Tyson's return to Las Vegas and boxing, Monday,
and if you didn't understand where he was coming from, all you had
to do was sit back later in a secluded MGM Grand Garden dressing
room and listen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I lost to Holyfield. I bit his (expletive) ears. He's a
good fighter, but he's not Mike Tyson. He and Lennox Lewis are
going to fight and they can't sell out the Garden. I could sell out
Madison Square Garden, masturbating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I fight on the same night as these guys, they're out of a
job. I'm making $35 million fighting a 10 rounder this weekend. I'm
the champion even when I'm not the champ. I'm the king. Muhammad
Ali set the stage, but there's never been a fighter as big as Mike
Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   You might blanche at his imagery or argue his sense of history.
You can curse his brashness or condemn his petty-hood nastiness and
rap sheet atrocities. But one thing is true.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you consider him a hero or a villain _ whether you
define him as savage knock-out artist, self-tortured soul or
irredeemable thug _ Mike Tyson has an undeniable mystique. It's not
only made him boxing's most lucrative draw, but for one night's
work, he can command more money than any athlete in any sport in
the history of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson will prove that Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden,
when he returns to the ring for the first time since his banishment
after twice biting Evander Holyfield's ears in their title fight at
this same Las Vegas arena in June of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Though out of the game 19 months, Tyson is guaranteed $33
million for his 10-round bout with Frans Botha, the South African
born plodder who has lost once in 40 fights.
</P>
<P>
   In the six previous fights he's had since being released from an
Indiana prison where he served three years for rape, Tyson has been
paid close to $140 million. That last fight against Holyfield broke
all pay-per-view records when it was bought by 1.8 million
households and brought in over $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday night, plenty people will tune in again even though
Botha shouldn't last more than a few rounds. But with Tyson these
days, who knows what he has left or what he might do? And that's
the allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still incredibly exciting and you never know what's going
to happen,'' said veteran promoter Don Elbaum. ``When you watch
Tyson, you're seeing an animal. That's something you're not going
to get with a Roy Jones or Lennox Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Larkin, the executive producer of Showtime Championship
Boxing, recently said: ``Boxing fans traditionally care about more
than the fight. They care about the conflict behind the conflict.
And in terms of drama, few can compare to Tyson. Tyson the story
has eclipsed Tyson the boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true, not only because the fistic side of Tyson has
diminished dramatically _ the last world class fighter he has
beaten was Razor Ruddock almost eight years ago _ but because the
myth of Tyson gets more incredible as each day goes by.
</P>
<P>
   He's gone from juvenile delinquent to slaughterhouse superstar,
from troubled husband to convicted rapist, from rehabilitated
headliner to crazed ear biter. This is his last shot at redemption
and yet as he's prepares for Botha, one irony stands out.
</P>
<P>
   As reprehensible as it was, his ear-biting disqualification may
have helped his boxing career. Sure there was a 15-month ban
administered by the Nevada Athletic Commission, the whopping $3
million fine and the pillorying from every corner of the globe, but
his image of dark destroyer stayed in tact. In fact, it was
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   And were it not for the biting, he almost certainly would have
been beaten by Holyfield for the second time in seven months. With
that tarnish, Tyson would no longer be able to command $33 million
paydays.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the cannibalism fed the jumbled mystery that surrounds
the 32-year-old ex champ. And so Monday. the freak show began in
earnest once more.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a palpable sense of menace when Tyson enters the
room, but there's a noticeable difference to his entourage. He's
gotten rid of bombastic promoter Don King _ whom he is suing for
$100 million _ and has bounced former co-managers John Horne and
Rory Holloway, both of whom he also accuses of skimming his funds
and helping cause him to end up with a $13 million IRS bill.
Trainer Richie Giachetti has been replaced too, by Tommy Brooks,
who co-trained Evander Holyfield before this.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson looked fit, almost small during Monday's workout.
Afterward, came a free-wheeling, often bizarre session that
reminded you, as one backer has said, of the stream of conscience
rants of Robin Williams _ without the humor.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he said he might fight four more times and quit the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thinks he could really give up the one thing he's
been so successful at, he shrugged: ``Look, I'm not even supposed
to be here now. I'm supposed to be finished. I've been in prison.
Thorazined (sic), or what's that stuff they gave me? Lithium. Most
guys I fought are fighting crack problems or are in oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me I been on the bottom, hit the top, fell again and now am
coming back up. The difference with me is that I know how to get
back again. I was really screwed up before... and that was just a
couple of days ago. But now, now I'm the king.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, five days before his return to the ring and two days
past crazy, one thing was certain. Mike Tyson wore his arrogance
like his lime-green underwear.

U.S. TREASURIES ARE IN THE DOLDRUMS 
(ATTN: N.J.)
</HEADLINE>
  ( ms ) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Treasury market, an unexpectedly fine performer last year,
is not looking so attractive right now. And it may take another
rush of panic about the world's economy and global financial
stability to turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   Despite low _ and possibly declining _ inflation and the
forecast by many economists that the American economy is slowing
down, Treasury interest rates, from short-term notes to long-term
bonds, have shot sharply higher the last month. The yield on the
30-year bond is now 5.30 percent, well above the 4.96 percent of
just a month ago. In trading Monday, the yield rose as high as 5.36
percent before prices, which move in the opposite direction,
rallied to wipe out most of the day's losses.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the fact that Brazil has yet to complete its fiscal
reform program, that Latin America faces a severe economic slowdown
and there is no concrete sign that Japan has been able to turn its
economy around, Treasury yields could go higher.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's wrong? A lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the U.S. economy is not showing any signs of slowing
down, a fact made clear by the November and December jobs reports,
both of which were surprisingly strong. The November numbers were
reported on Dec. 4, just days before the bond rally peaked and the
30-year bond yield hit 4.96 percent. And December's 378,000 job
increase, announced on Friday, was even more surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs on Friday raised its growth forecast for the
fourth quarter to 4.2 percent from 3.5 percent, left the first
quarter at 2.7 percent but lifted the second quarter to 2.2 percent
from 1.9 percent. Upward revisions in growth don't help bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in the stock market to new highs is also likely to
keep consumer spending stronger in the months ahead, which should
help keep growth robust, though other crucial sectors, like capital
spending, are slowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This long-awaited slowdown just doesn't come,'' said Ward
McCarthy, managing director of Stone &AMP; McCarthy Research Associates
in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He also said ``the bond market has just had a tough time
competing with this stock market for attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the perception that the threat of a full-blown
world financial crisis has eased. And this, in turn, has reversed
the rush to the bond market for safety, known on Wall Street as a
flight to quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to think you should have a flight to quality with
the stock market at new highs,'' said Lewis Crandall, chief
economist at R.H. Wrightson &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, which has cut its interest rate target
three times since the end of September, and European central banks,
which made one rate cut at the end of last year, were major
contributors to this change in psychology. Rallies in emerging
stock and bond markets have also helped, though by any reasonable
measure the world economy still faces a lot of uncertainties, with
Brazil No. 1 on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed easing and the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy lead
to another problem for bonds. ``It is not likely that the Fed is
going to ease anytime soon,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief
economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. in Rye Brook, N.Y. So that hope for
bonds, which sparked the big fall rally in the first place, is
gone.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's weakness, especially against the Japanese yen, and
a move by some investors into the euro, the new European currency,
have also contributed to bond market weakness, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   What is not happening, both Barbera and Crandall argue, is an
inflation scare. ``It is not that inflation is going to come
back,'' Barbera said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president for the taxable
fixed-income division of Advest Inc., disagrees a little. ``We have
a classic inflation scare rasing its head again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the same breath, he argues that there should be no such
fear because ``companies cannot pass on price increases.'' But
although he thinks inflation concerns are unfounded, he said the
psychology had ``dynamically changed'' in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for bonds? Guild thinks that because the
inflation scare is phony, the bond selloff should be near its end.
He said he would be surprised if the yield on the 30-year bond
exceeded 5.40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall said that right now ``bonds are not perceived to have
as much upside'' as analysts thought just a month ago. This means
selling could push yields higher.
</P>
<P>
   But he is counting on two factors to turn the tide. One is that
the economy will slow, though maybe not as soon as he thought. The
other is that investors will have new reasons to worry about the
stability of world financial markets again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to have events in the first half of 1999 that
will give Treasuries a flight-to-quality boost,'' he said. ``Global
financial markets are going to remain accident prone.''

   CAMPBELL SOUP WARNS OF LOWER EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Blaming the weather for sluggish sales of its biggest brand,
Campbell Soup warned that its earnings in the current quarter and
fiscal year would be off by 18 to 23 cents a share, significantly
lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, the company said its sales
of condensed soup, those familiar red-and-white cans that make up
two-thirds of Campbell's sales and earnings, had been depressed by
warm weather in November and December and would not meaningfully
improve before its second quarter ends on Jan. 31. Dale Morrison,
Campbell's chief executive, said soup sales would grow by only 1
percent to 2 percent for the year.

   STOCKS MIXED AS NASDAQ RISES
</P>
<P>
   Stocks ended mixed with many issues pulling back after the rally
to records last week raised concern among investors that the market
is getting too expensive. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
23.43 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,619.89. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index declined 11.21 points, or nine-tenths of a
percent, to 1,263.88. Nasdaq reached a seventh consecutive record,
climbing 40.18 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,384.59.

ANTI-TOBACCO HERO RETHINKS A 2000 RACE 
PLAYING A POLITICAL NAME GAME 
THE HIGH PRICE OF THE PRESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Ill.)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the first state attorney general to win a health-costs
settlement from the nation's tobacco companies _ it was worth a
whopping $4 billion _ Michael Moore is a hero to many
Mississippians and something of a legal icon in the anti-tobacco
movement.
</P>
<P>
   So when Moore announced in October that he would try to parlay
his popularity into higher office by running for governor in 1999,
political handicappers made him the favorite to succeed the current
governor, Kirk Fordice, who cannot seek a third term under state
law.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore, a Democrat, has had second thoughts. He says now he
will not run for governor but will instead go after a fourth term
as attorney general so he can ``finish some of the work that we've
started,'' not the least of which will be wrapping up the details
of how the state will spend its tobacco money windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that my heart is not in that
race,'' Moore confessed in pulling out of the governor's contest
last week. ``I feel like a ton of bricks has been lifted off my
back. Being attorney general is a job that I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Close students of Mississippi politics say Moore's change of
mind may have been as pragmatic as heartfelt. They note that
Mississippi is known as a ``weak governor state,'' one whose laws
and organizational chart give top legislative leaders, the
lieutenant governor and, yes, the attorney general almost as much
clout as the governor.
</P>
<P>
   So with Moore no longer interested, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove is
left as the only big-name contender for the Democratic nomination
at this point.
</P>
<P>
   What's in a Name? Ask Moseley-Braun
</P>
<P>
   In politics, name recognition can often be, well, the name of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years in Chicago, for example, more than a few
candidates for alderman have adopted an ethnic middle name or a
catchy nickname in hopes of snaring a few extra votes. Thus, in
that city's ward elections next month, voters will find such middle
monikers on their ballots as Pookie, Junebug, Cosmos, Gator, Curly
and Butch.
</P>
<P>
   They may also find the name Carol Moseley-Braun.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Carol Moseley-Braun, the former Lauryn Kaye
Valentine _ no relation to Carol Moseley-Braun, the former U.S.
senator from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The former Ms. Valentine (henceforth, Ms. Moseley-Braun II) went
to court in September and asked permission to change her name to
Carol Moseley-Braun, telling the judge that the senator
(henceforth, Ms. Moseley-Braun I) was one of her heroes. The judge
required that Ms. Moseley-Braun II send word of the change to Ms.
Moseley-Braun I, who was then mired in a losing re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun II, a 21-year-old market researcher, sent a
letter to Ms. Moseley-Braun I that concluded: ``I'm not trying to
be you and I would never dishonor your name in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun I sent back word that there were probably
better ways to honor someone than a name change. Nevertheless, she
said, she was honored.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, Ms. Moseley-Braun II filed to run for alderman
in the 37th Ward, challenging the veteran incumbent, Percy Giles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun I cried ``identity theft'' and ``fraud.'' She
has since asked her lawyers to look into the possibility of
obtaining a court order to rescind the name change.
</P>
<P>
   Giles, asserting that ``someone is trying to trick voters'' with
``a name that outpowers mine,'' also put his lawyers to work. They
are trying to have Ms. Moseley-Braun II disqualified on the ground
that when she filed to run _ they say she started gathering the
required petition signatures within a month of her name change _
she was not re-registered to vote under her new name.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun II says she is ``incensed'' at the accusations
leveled by Ms. Moseley-Braun I and Giles.
</P>
<P>
   Next step: A hearing on Friday by the Chicago Board of Elections
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Presidency in 2000: $2,893 an Hour
</P>
<P>
   The cost of running for president spirals ever higher. With the
primary and caucus season more front-loaded now than ever,
candidates with any hope of being contenders must not only be able
to raise staggering amounts of money but must also be able to raise
it in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional political wisdom holds that in the 2000 election,
any candidate who on Jan. 1, the beginning of the primary and
caucus season, does not have $25 million in hand, may well be out
of the running.
</P>
<P>
   What does raising $25 million involve, keeping in mind that the
main source of money for most candidates early on is gifts from
individuals and that federal law limits each gift to $1,000?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the way The Hotline, a widely distributed political tip
service, calculated it on Jan. 5, with 360 days to go, give or take
a few ticks of the clock:
</P>
<P>
   ``If to run for president in 2000 will take raising $25 million
in 1999 from at least 25,000 different people giving up to $1,000
each, that's $69,444 every day for the rest of the year, every
Saturday and every Sunday included _ $2,893 an hour, 24 hours of
every single day. Just by taking the time to read this, you have
fallen another $34.73 behind.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The N.Y. Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pity the company that courts Wall Street while offending its
customers. Investors can turn out to be fickle friends, while
customers bear grudges.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago Kellogg, the breakfast cereal company, was a Wall
Street darling. Throughout the 1980s its stock price soared as it
pushed up the prices of its breakfast cereals. With more and more
women working, it was said, families no longer had time to cook
breakfast, and they would not worry about the rising cost of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked for a long time. But sometime in the early
1990s families began to be concerned about just how much that box
of cornflakes was costing, and Kellogg's fortunes began to fade.
Operating profits peaked in 1994, and although the stock price kept
rising, it did not keep up with most stocks. Kellogg responded with
aggressive cost-cutting. Plants were closed and workers were let
go.
</P>
<P>
   But the company still fell short of profit forecasts, and now,
with its stock price lower than it was in 1992, Kellogg's chief
executive officer, Arnold G. Langbo, has been eased out. He will
stay on as chairman of the board for a year, but the company will
be run by his successor, Carlos M. Gutierrez, who hopes to
emphasize products that can be eaten on the run. The new theory is
that busy families no longer have time even to pour out the milk.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than four years since Kellogg last increased
cereal prices, and it says average prices have declined a bit since
then. That has hurt profits, but has not done much for sales. ``The
perception out there,'' moans a company spokesman, ``is that these
prices are out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, it appears, have long memories.

JETTING IN VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The N.Y. Times says in an editorial, Tuesday, Jan. 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With New York's ecstatic fans barely done toasting the Yankees
as World Champions, the football Jets are now giving them new
reason to cheer. On a bright, cold Sunday afternoon in the
Meadowlands, the Jets dominated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 34-24, to
continue one of the most remarkable resuscitation efforts in recent
sports memory. Just two years ago the Jets were the worst team in
professional football, winning 1 game and losing 15. Now they are
bound for the American Football Conference championship game
against the Denver Broncos, last year's Super Bowl champions. This
is a comeback that can make even jaded New Yorkers dream of the
glory days of 30 years ago when Broadway Joe Namath carried the
Jets to an upset victory in Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   The din from the 79,000 fans showed they felt amply rewarded
with Jet heroics. The Jet offense moved with pleasing efficiency,
marching downfield at will on long drives that consumed lots of
time and usually led to scores. Vinny Testaverde, the relic who had
the highest quarterback rating in the conference this year, zipped
bullets to a wide array of receivers. Curtis Martin, behind superb
blocking, ground out the crucial running yardage needed to control
the game and make the passing attack work. Keyshawn Johnson, the
voluble receiver, finally let his deeds do most of his talking. He
caught a pass for one touchdown, ran a reverse for another,
recovered a key fumble and intercepted a desperation pass by the
Jaguars, in an all-around performance that sports scribes labeled
Thorpe-like.
</P>
<P>
   The only worrisome note was the Jets' tendency to let the
Jaguars back into the game with errors and mental breakdowns. Such
lapses could prove fatal against the talented and resourceful
Broncos, already installed as 8-point favorites. But there is
something comfortingly solid about this Jets team. Much like the
Yankees, it is a team whose whole seems greater than the sum of its
parts. Viewing Sunday's game from high up in the mezzanine, one had
the sense of an organizational triumph, an intricate machine

U.S. BECOMING ISOLATED IN U.N. ON IRAQ SANCTIONS

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States is finding itself
increasingly isolated in its Iraq policy as a growing number of
Security Council members and Arab nations support lifting an
embargo on Iraqi oil sales or significantly relaxing sanctions in
other ways to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to what the Iraqis may hope, there is also solid
agreement that long-term international supervision is needed to
prevent Iraq from acquiring or developing prohibited weapons. Among
proposals to be discussed are the creation of a new inspection
system and ways to monitor money that Iraq would earn if it sold
oil freely.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to retain the existing system
and the right to use the military to enforce it, although the
majority of Security Council members oppose further use of force
without council approval.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has focused on keeping sanctions in force until Iraq
complies with all disarmament requirements. The United States would
be willing only to expand a program that allows Iraq to sell a
limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the American representative on the council, said
in an interview on Monday night that undoing existing resolutions
that govern those policies would not be easy and that no other
delegation has proposed a concrete way to make the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole body of what I think everyone would agree is
international law can't just be wished away,'' he said, adding,
``The disarmament issue is the key to the lifting of sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not convinced that the proposals for the lifting of
sanctions are actually gaining a wide momentum,'' he said. ``While
there are various delegations and governments that are making
comments about the lifting of sanctions or the modification of
sanctions, how those would relate to the body of resolutions
pertaining to Iraq is not at all clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Although any change in Security Council policies could be
blocked by an American veto, Washington wants its policy to have
the backing of the council and does not want to find itself alone.
Administration officials have also acknowledged that if the United
States uses its veto to keep sanctions in force, over time they
could erode.
</P>
<P>
   Some council members say the debate is an urgent one because
there are no inspectors in Iraq now and no work is being done
there. On Monday, the chief arms inspector, Richard Butler, said
that he had suspended surveillance flights by American U-2's and
French aircraft while the Security Council discusses the crisis.
But the council has no timetable for the discussions, which could
take weeks or even months.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is finding that the core group opposed to its
policies on Iraq _ formed around Russia, China, France and
sometimes Brazil _ has strengthened with the entry of at least two
new council members, Malaysia and Namibia, which will hold two-year
rotating seats. Malaysia in particular is opposed to sanctions in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats are also watching Canada and the Netherlands,
two other new members, for signs of where they will stand. In
Amsterdam on Monday, the Dutch representative on the United Nations
Special Commission to disarm Iraq supported the view that sanctions
could be rewritten while the arms inspections system remained in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, Koos Ooms, said this would rebuild unity in
the Security Council and ``would at least snatch away from Saddam
Hussein the weapon of being able to say that the Iraqi people are
suffering because of the sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The French government says it is preparing new proposals for the
council to end the oil embargo but institute other controls.
Lifting the embargo would free up the economy and permit increased
imports, allowing those Iraqis who can afford it to use their money
to buy food and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Even the British, the strongest ally of the United States on
Iraq policy, now favor a new inspection system, Prime Minister Tony
Blair said on Monday in an open letter to the French newspaper
Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, the chief arms inspector, also acknowledged on Monday
that a change in the inspection system seems inevitable. He said
whatever system emerges from the council debates ``would be a bit
different from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization and this job of mine is under a microscope
at the moment,'' he said on Monday at an arms control conference in
Washington sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in Moscow, Russia's Foreign Ministry called again for
the dismissal of Butler, the executive chairman of the Special
Commission, after reports last week that the United States used the
commission for espionage. The commission, known as UNSCOM, has been
responsible for disarming Iraq since 1991. The sanctions, imposed
in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait, were linked to arms inspections
at the end of the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan defended Butler on Monday. ``I
don't think the issue is Butler,'' he told reporters, after
repeating that he had no evidence that Butler had cooperated with
United States in spying on Iraq. ``I don't think the issue is
UNSCOM. We are dealing with much larger issues about compliance of
Iraq and stability in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Blair, in his letter to Liberation, wrote that Britain agreed
with the United States that an expansion of the ``oil for food''
program would be the best way to aid Iraqi civilians. Iraq is now
permitted to sell up to $5.2 billion in oil every six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are holding talks with France and other eminent members of
the Security Council to find a formula allowing monitoring to
resume in Iraq,'' he wrote, ``but under a new system that would
avoid the inspectors' presence creating a new crisis every three
months.''
</P>
<P>
   For the council, the major problem is how to separate the
sanctions issues from disarmament without giving any ground, real
or psychological, to Saddam, whom even some Arab nations now openly
condemn. Furthermore, no one has put forward a plan for winning
Iraq's cooperation or creating an enforcement system.
</P>
<P>
   The council will meet on Tuesday to look at the relief situation
in Iraq, its president for January, Celso L.N. Amorim of Brazil,
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we're able to address the broader political issues of
Iraq,'' he said, ``we have to address some concrete steps that can
be taken both on the humanitarian file and the disarmament file.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the inertia that has seized the council on the
subject of Iraq, Amorim, said, ``There was a general feeling that
the Security Council has to deal substantively with the issue,
which is hasn't been doing for the past two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Arabs, the moment is a particularly delicate one, said
Clovis Maksoud, a former Arab League representative at the United
Nations who is now director of the Center for the Global South at
American University in Washington. He said recent American and
British actions _ including the December air strikes and possible
misuse of the Special Commission for spying by Washington _ have
created crises in both the United Nations and the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
   Although few if any diplomats would have predicted less than a
month ago, when American and British air strikes hit Iraq, that
Saddam would be this isolated at a critical moment for him, Arabs
say their governments are aware of how volatile public opinion in
the Middle East can be.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Saddamcalled on Arab populations to overthrow
governments critical of him. Arab governments, with Egypt in the
lead, are sending emissaries to Baghdad to ask the Iraqis to cool
the polemics, diplomats said. They saw some success in the
relatively muted session of the Iraqi Parliament held over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While there are Arab leaders who would like to see Saddam out of
power, they would have trouble supporting more American attacks and
would not be able to back an overthrow from outside, Maksoud said.
</P>
<P>
   But among the Arabs, Maksoud said, there would be great support
for a change in sanctions that helped free, at least economically,
the Iraqi middle class while arms control inspections remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a widespread crisis of conscience about the Iraqi
people,'' he said. At the same time, Arabs do not want to see the
United States or Britain portray themselves as the Iraqis'
protectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rubs the Arab psyche very badly,'' Maksoud said.

JORDAN WILL RETIRE, 2 OFFICIALS WITH NBA SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (EXCLUSIVE: 12:01 a.m. ET EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
 (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, basketball's pre-eminent player and the world's
best known athlete, will retire from the National Basketball
Association for the second time in five years, according to three
officials in the NBA with knowledge of Jordan's plans. They said
Monday night that they expected Jordan to make an announcement this
week, possibly as early as Wednesday, at a news conference in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's future has been the biggest issue in basketball in the
wake of the bitter labor dispute that ended last week after an
impasse that lasted six months and wiped out the early part of the
season. Aside from his athletic and entertainment value to the
league, he was viewed as &UR;  &LR; a cultural icon and ambassador for the
sport who would help bridge the gap to disenchanted fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls' star has not made a public statement
regarding his plans since the lockout ended, and his agent, David
Falk, declined Monday night to comment on the possibility of
Jordan's retirement. But the three officials said the decision had
been made.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, more and more signs had pointed to the game's most
prominent star re-retiring at the age of 35. Falk had not held any
contract discussions with the Bulls, and Jordan had not been
working out regularly. In addition, an editor of a new book by
Jordan, ``For the Love of the Game: My Own Story,'' acknowledged
that the publisher was counting on Jordan's retirement when it
decided to publish the book last fall, and had received positive
signals from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   His failure to announce a decision publicly put things on hold
for the Bulls, who won six league titles with Jordan as their
leader and top performer. While the franchise awaited his decision
on whether or not to re-sign, most of the components from Chicago's
championship team, his free-agent teammates, were in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   His decision would give the go-ahead for Bulls Chairman Jerry
Reinsdorf and General Manager Jerry Krause to rebuild and give his
teammates a chance to sign with other teams, should the Bulls not
re-sign them. The Bulls currently have only four players under
contract. Among the players whose futures are hinging on Jordan's
decision are all-star forward Scottie Pippen, whom Jordan has
called his ``little brother,'' and the league's leading rebounder,
Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's teammates acknowledged that the star has not been
consistently working out and getting in prime physical shape for a
shortened season _ a requisite for Jordan every year during the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been preparing, that's the biggest reason I think
he's not coming back,'' said Steve Kerr, a Bulls guard. ``Michael
hasn't told me anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was on vacation last week in the Bahamas, and it was
unclear whether he had returned home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 objective we have here as a franchise is to bring
Michael Jordan back, to bring the championship team back,'' Krause
said Monday. ``When Michael lets us know what he's going to do,
certainly, if he comes back, we intend to make a very concerted and
very serious effort to bring the rest of the championship team
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's history of changing direction in his professional life
left open the possibility that he may return _ if not this season,
than possibly the following year. He last retired in 1994. But he
ended a floundering career as a baseball player _ he never advanced
past the minor leagues _ in the spring of 1995 to return to the
game in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would be leaving the game on the highest note possible.
The five-time most valuable player led the Bulls to their third
championship in three seasons last June 16, carrying Chicago to its
sixth title in eight seasons with a dramatic 40-second sequence in
the clinching Game 6 victory over the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the game-winning shot with 5.3 seconds left, an 18-foot
jump shot that left a stunned gathering at the Delta Center in Salt
Lake City paralyzed. It was the final blow as the Bulls beat the
Jazz for the second season in a row in six games to the win the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's retirement would be the linchpin decision in the
disassembling of the Bulls, basketball's modern-day dynasty whose
six titles in eight seasons drew comparisons to the Bill
Russell-led Boston Celtics of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The first departure was the coach, Phil Jackson, who left the
franchise after the Bulls won the title in June, saying he would
take an extended sabbatical from the game before returning. Krause
hired former Iowa State coach Tim Floyd to replace Jackson under
the stipulation that if Jackson wanted to return, Floyd would
become an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had said all last season he would not play for another
coach, but seemed to be backing off that stance in the off season.
Falk said last week if the situation were right _ meaning that
Pippen, Rodman and most of the supporting cast were re-signed _
Jordan would consider playing again.
</P>
<P>
   But with the league recovering from the most damaging period in
its 52-year history _ a six-month labor dispute that cost players
and owners hundreds of millions of dollars and turned once-loyal
fans apathetic _ the thinking is that perhaps Jordan did not want
to be associated with a tainted image of the NBA. &QL;

A FRAYED DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA

<P>
   The N.Y. Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new and potentially volatile crisis is brewing between the
United States and North Korea. Pyongyang's reckless behavior
threatens to unravel a 1994 nuclear agreement with Washington. That
would effectively end diplomatic dialogue between the two countries
and could lead to heightened military tensions on the Korean
Peninsula. Late last year the Clinton administration appointed
William Perry, the former defense secretary, to review American
policy toward the North. He is now trying to learn more about what
Pyongyang is up to and to see if the growing tensions can be
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   But he cannot succeed if North Korea continues new construction
that would break its pledge to freeze nuclear weapons development
or if it alarms its neighbors with further missile tests. At best,
North Korea's actions are an attempt to extort new money and
concessions from the West. At worst they signal an intention to
break the nuclear agreement or even to threaten South Korea and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 agreement committed North Korea to freeze nuclear
programs that were producing bomb-grade materials. In return, a
group of Western countries led by the United States agreed to build
new civilian power reactors for the North and supply it with
imported fuel oil. Until now, both sides have formally complied
with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, American intelligence agencies spotted the
apparent beginnings of a new underground North Korean nuclear
complex. Pyongyang refuses to let Americans inspect this site
unless Washington makes large additional payments. Then last
August, North Korea launched a three-stage rocket over Japan. There
are signs that it may be readying another test. The missiles do not
violate the nuclear agreement, but they may drive Japan to stop
financing the nuclear deal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if North Korea is only advertising its rocket and missile
prowess to get the West to pay for freezing these programs as well,
it is a troubling development. Paying for a missile freeze might
lead to further demands as North Korea looks for ways to keep its
bankrupt dictatorship afloat.
</P>
<P>
   America should help North Korea deal with its devastating famine
and should offer support if the North begins to move away from its
disastrous command economy. But Perry must make clear to Pyongyang
that there are limits to American generosity and that Washington
expects the 1994 nuclear agreement to be honored in full.

EDITORIAL: LET CLINTON SPEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The N.Y. Times says in an editorial Tuesday, Jan. 12:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, understandably eager to change the subject,
wants to deliver his State of the Union address on schedule next
week. Senators who have sworn an oath to do ``impartial justice''
will no doubt feel awkward listening to Clinton proclaim his
achievements as if they were not sitting as jurors in his
impeachment trial. House Republicans may feel the same way. As a
result, many lawmakers are suggesting that Clinton put off the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   But the comfort level of the lawmakers should not be the
determining factor. The State of the Union address is too important
a part of the governmental calendar to put on hold indefinitely.
The fact that he has been impeached has not stripped Clinton of the
right to speak at a time of his choosing, even if his primary goal
is to strengthen his own hand. If he wants, at long last, to
address more fully his lies under oath and other misdeeds, so much
the better. If, on the other hand, he has nothing useful to add
about his signal failure to protect the rule of law, the public has
a right to know that too.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the Constitution requires any president to deliver a
State of the Union message at this time of year, or in person. But
Americans have come to expect a speech in January laying out a
president's priorities, and Clinton's appearances before a Congress
controlled by the opposition since 1995 have been among his most
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor Congress can escape the political shadow of
the impeachment process. No doubt many in Congress are sincere in
wanting to finish that process before the State of the Union
address. Since it seems unlikely Clinton will be thrown out of
office, there is something to be said for waiting until the end of
the trial. Then the speech could be given as a kind of final
catharsis, calling for a return to work on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment itself is inherently political. It feels
artificial to deprive Clinton of the opportunity to rally his
support and claim credit for the nation's extraordinary prosperity
at this critical moment. Just as the House has the right to put out
its best evidence, Clinton has a right to demonstrate that the
public does not want him removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of political calculation, the president, for his own
reasons, may decide to wait a few days and speak to Congress just
after the House impeachment managers and the White House defense
team have finished laying out their case in opening presentations.
That would be all right, too. A speech of confession just before
the Senate decides on whether to proceed to a full-blown trial,
with witnesses and cross-examination, might well tilt the balance
toward censure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cannot ignore the Senate trial. Neither can Congress put
all national business on hold while it focuses on finding the
appropriate punishment for his behavior. The best course is for the
legislators to accept graciously the larger rhythm of democracy,
listen to the State of the Union and demonstrate to Americans that
pressing foreign and domestic issues of the day are still getting
some thought and attention. &UR;  &LR;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from President Clinton's
response to the summons of the Senate to appear for trial, as
provided by the White House, but with subheadings provided by The
New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   The Honorable William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United
States, in response to the summons of the Senate of the United
States, answers the accusations made by the House of
Representatives of the United States in the two Articles of
Impeachment it has exhibited to the Senate as follows:
</P>
<P>
   PREAMBLE
</P>
<P>
   The charges in the articles do not constitute high crimes or
misdemeanors. The charges in the two articles of impeachment do not
permit the conviction and removal from office of a duly elected
President. The President has acknowledged conduct with Ms. Lewinsky
that was improper. But Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution
provides that the President shall be removed from office only upon
``impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery or other
high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The charges in the articles do not
rise to the level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as
contemplated by the Founding Fathers, and they do not satisfy the
rigorous constitutional standard applied throughout our nation's
history. Accordingly, the articles of impeachment should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The President did not commit perjury or obstruct justice. The
President denies each and every material allegation of the two
articles of impeachment not specifically admitted in this answer.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICLE I
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton denies that he made perjurious, false and
misleading statements before the Federal grand jury on Aug. 17,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Factual Responses
</P>
<P>
   Without waiving his affirmative defenses, President Clinton
offers the following factual responses to the allegations in
Article I:
</P>
<P>
   1. The President denies that he made perjurious, false and
misleading statements to the grand jury about ``the nature and
details of his relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   There is a myth about President Clinton's testimony before the
grand jury. The myth is that the President failed to admit his
improper intimate relationship with Ms. Monica Lewinsky. The myth
is perpetuated by Article I, which accuses the President of lying
about ``the nature and details of his relationship'' with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that the President specifically acknowledged to the
grand jury that he had an improper intimate relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. He said so, plainly and clearly: ``When I was alone with
Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in early
1997, I engaged in conduct that was wrong. These encounters ... did
involve inappropriate intimate contact.'' The President described
to the grand jury how the relationship began and how it ended at
his insistence early in 1997 _ long before any public attention or
scrutiny. He also described to the grand jury how he had attempted
to testify in the deposition in the Jones case months earlier
without having to acknowledge to the Jones lawyers what he
ultimately admitted to the grand jury, that he had an improper
intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The President read a prepared statement to the grand jury
acknowledging his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The statement was
offered at the beginning of his testimony to focus the questioning
in a manner that would allow the Office of Independent Counsel to
obtain necessary information without unduly dwelling on the
salacious details of the relationship. The President's statement
was followed by almost four hours of questioning. If it is charged
that his statement was in any respect perjurious, false and
misleading, the President denies it. The President also denies that
the statement was in any way an attempt to thwart the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The President states, as he did during his grand jury testimony,
that he engaged in improper physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky. The
President was truthful when he testified before the grand jury that
he did not engage in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky as he
understood that term to be defined by the Jones lawyers during
their questioning of him in that deposition. The President further
denies that his other statements to the grand jury about the nature
and details of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky were perjurious,
false, and misleading.
</P>
<P>
   2. The President denies that he made perjurious, false and
misleading statements to the grand jury when he testified about
statements he had made in the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   There is a second myth about the President's testimony before
the grand jury. The myth is that the President adopted his entire
Jones deposition testimony in the grand jury. The President was not
asked to and did not broadly restate or reaffirm his Jones
deposition testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the grand jury he discussed the bases for certain
answers he gave. The President testified truthfully in the grand
jury about statements he made in the Jones deposition. The
President stated to the grand jury that he did not attempt to be
helpful to or assist the lawyers in the Jones deposition in their
quest for information about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He
truthfully explained to the grand jury his efforts to answer the
questions in the Jones deposition without disclosing his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Accordingly, the full, underlying
Jones deposition is not before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the House specifically considered and rejected an
article of impeachment based on the President's deposition in the
Jones case. The House managers should not be allowed to prosecute
before the Senate an article of impeachment which the full House
has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   3. The President denies that he made perjurious, false and
misleading statements to the grand jury about ``statements he
allowed his attorney to make'' during the Jones deposition....
</P>
<P>
   The President was truthful when he explained to the grand jury
his understanding of certain statements made by his lawyer, Robert
Bennett, during the Jones deposition. The President also was
truthful when he testified that he was not focusing on the
prolonged and complicated exchange between the attorneys and Judge
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   4. The President denies that he made perjurious, false and
misleading statements to the grand jury concerning alleged efforts
``to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the
discovery of evidence'' in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   For the reasons discussed more fully in response to Article II,
the President denies that he attempted to influence the testimony
of any witness or to impede the discovery of evidence in the Jones
case. Thus, the President denies that he made perjurious, false and
misleading statements before the grand jury when he testified about
these matters.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to Meet Constitutional Standards
</P>
<P>
   For the same reasons set forth in the preamble of this answer,
Article I does not meet the rigorous constitutional standard for
conviction and removal from office of a duly elected President and
should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Vagueness
</P>
<P>
   Article I is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable person
could know what specific charges are being leveled against the
President. It alleges that the President provided the grand jury
with ``perjurious, false, and misleading testimony'' concerning
``one or more'' of four subject areas. But it fails to identify any
specific statement by the President that is alleged to be
perjurious, false and misleading. The House has left the Senate and
the President to guess at what it had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fundamental principles of our law and the
Constitution is that a person has a right to know what specific
charges he or she is facing. Without such fair warning, no one can
prepare the defense to which every person is entitled. The law and
the Constitution also mandate adequate notice to jurors so they may
know the basis for the vote they must make. Without a definite and
specific identification of false statements, a trial becomes a
moving target for the accused. In addition, the American people
deserve to know upon what specific statements the President is
being judged, given the gravity and effect of these proceedings,
namely nullifying the results of a national election.
</P>
<P>
   Article I sweeps broadly and fails to provide the required
definite and specific identification. Were it an indictment, it
would be dismissed. As an article of impeachment, it is
constitutionally defective and should fail.
</P>
<P>
   Charging Multiple Offenses
</P>
<P>
   Article I is fatally flawed because it charges multiple
instances of alleged perjurious, false and misleading statements in
one article. The Constitution provides that ``no person shall be
convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members
present,'' and Senate Rule XXIII provides that ``an article of
impeachment shall not be divisible for the purpose of voting
thereon at any time during the trial.'' By the express terms of
Article I, a senator may vote for impeachment if he or she finds
that there was perjurious, false and misleading testimony in ``one
or more'' of four topic areas. This creates the very real
possibility that conviction could occur even though senators were
in wide disagreement as to the alleged wrong committed. Put simply,
the structure of Article I presents the possibility that the
President could be convicted even though he would have been
acquitted if separate votes were taken on each allegedly perjurious
statement. For example, it would be possible for the President to
be convicted and removed from office with as few as 17 Senators
agreeing that any single statement was perjurious, because 17 votes
for each of the four categories in Article I would yield 68 votes,
one more than necessary to convict and remove.
</P>
<P>
   By charging multiple wrongs in one article, the House of
Representatives has made it impossible for the Senate to comply
with the Constitutional mandate that any conviction be by the
concurrence of two-thirds of the members. Accordingly, Article I
should fail.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICLE II
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton denies that he obstructed justice in either
the Jones case or the Lewinsky grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Factual Responses
</P>
<P>
   Without waiving his affirmative defenses, President Clinton
offers the following factual responses to the allegations in
Article II:
</P>
<P>
   1. The President denies that on or about Dec. 17, 1997, he
``corruptly encouraged'' Monica Lewinsky ``to execute a sworn
affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false
and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, the only witness cited in support of this
allegation, denies this allegation as well. Her testimony and
proffered statements are clear and unmistakable:
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for
my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   The President states that, sometime in December 1997, Ms.
Lewinsky asked him whether she might be able to avoid testifying in
the Jones case because she knew nothing about Ms. Jones or the
case. The President further states that he told her he believed
other witnesses had executed affidavits, and there was a chance
they would not have to testify. The President denies that he ever
asked, encouraged or suggested that Ms. Lewinsky file a false
affidavit or lie. The President states that he believed that Ms.
Lewinsky could have filed a limited but truthful affidavit that
might have enabled her to avoid having to testify in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   2. The President denies that on or about Dec. 17, 1997, he
``corruptly encouraged''Monica Lewinsky ``to give perjurious, false
and misleading testimony ... when called to testify personally'' in
the Jones litigation....
</P>
<P>
   The testimony and proffered statements of Monica Lewinsky, the
only witness cited in support of this allegation, are clear and
unmistakable:
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for
my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   The President states that, prior to Ms. Lewinsky's involvement
in the Jones case, he and Ms. Lewinsky might have talked about what
to do to conceal their relationship from others. Ms. Lewinsky was
not a witness in any legal proceeding at that time. Ms. Lewinsky's
own testimony and statements support the President's recollection.
Ms. Lewinsky testified that she ``pretty much can'' exclude the
possibility that she and the President ever had discussions about
denying the relationship after she learned she was a witness in the
Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky also stated that ``they did not discuss
the issue (of what to say about their relationship) in specific
relation to the Jones matter,'' and that ``she does not believe
they discussed the content of any deposition that (she) might be
involved in at a later date.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   3. The President denies that on or about Dec. 28, 1997, he
``corruptly engaged in, encouraged, or supported a scheme to
conceal evidence''in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The President denies that he engaged in, encouraged, or
supported any scheme to conceal evidence from discovery in the
Jones case, including any gifts he had given to Ms. Lewinsky. The
President states that he gave numerous gifts to Ms. Lewinsky prior
to Dec. 28, 1997. The President states that, sometime in December,
Ms. Lewinsky inquired as to what to do if she were asked in the
Jones case about the gifts he had given her, to which the President
responded that she would have to turn over whatever she had. The
President states that he was unconcerned about having given her
gifts and, in fact, that he gave Ms. Lewinsky additional gifts on
Dec. 28, 1997. The President denies that he ever asked his
secretary, Ms. Betty Currie, to retrieve gifts he had given Ms.
Lewinsky, or that he ever asked, encouraged, or suggested that Ms.
Lewinsky conceal the gifts. Ms. Currie told prosecutors as early as
January 1998 and repeatedly thereafter that it was Ms. Lewinsky who
had contacted her about retrieving gifts.
</P>
<P>
   4. The President denies that he obstructed justice in connection
with Monica Lewinsky's efforts to obtain a job in New York, to
``corruptly prevent'' her truthful testimony in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The President denies that he obstructed justice in connection
with Ms. Lewinsky' s job search in New York or sought to prevent
her truthful testimony in the Jones case. The President states that
he discussed with Ms. Lewinsky her desire to obtain a job in New
York months before she was listed as a potential witness in the
Jones case. Indeed, Ms. Lewinsky was offered a job in New York at
the United Nations more than a month before she was identified as a
possible witness. The President also states that he believes that
Ms. Lewinsky raised with him, again before she was ever listed as a
possible witness in the Jones case, the prospect of having Mr.
Vernon Jordan assist in her job search. Ms. Lewinsky corroborates
his recollection that it was her idea to ask for Mr. Jordan's help.
The President also states that he was aware that Mr. Jordan was
assisting Ms. Lewinsky to obtain employment in New York. The
President denies that any of these efforts had any connection
whatsoever to Ms. Lewinsky's status as a possible or actual witness
in the Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky forcefully confirmed the
President's denial when she testified, ``I was never promised a job
for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   5. The President denies that he ``corruptly allowed his attorney
to make false and misleading statements to a Federal judge''
concerning Monica Lewinsky's affidavit....
</P>
<P>
   The President denies that he was focusing his attention on the
prolonged and complicated exchange between his attorney and Judge
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   6. The President denies that he obstructed justice by relating
false and misleading statements'' to ``a potential witness, ``Betty
Currie, ``in order to corruptly influence (her) testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The President states that he spoke with Ms. Currie on Jan. 18,
1998. The President testified that, in that conversation, he was
trying to find out what the facts were, what Ms. Currie' s
perception was, and whether his own recollection was correct about
certain aspects of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Currie
testified that she felt no pressure ``whatsoever'' from the
President's statements and no pressure ``to agree with (her)
boss.'' The President denies knowing or believing that Ms. Currie
would be a witness in any proceeding at the time of this
conversation. Ms. Currie had not been on any of the witness lists
proffered by the Jones lawyers. President Clinton states that,
after the independent counsel investigation became public, when Ms.
Currie was scheduled to testify, he told Ms. Currie to ``tell the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   7. The President denies that he obstructed justice when he
misled his aides about the nature of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky in the days immediately following the public revelation of
the Lewinsky investigation. The President acknowledges that, in the
days following the Jan. 21, 1998 Washington Post article, he misled
his family, his friends and staff, and the nation to conceal the
nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He sought to avoid
disclosing his personal wrongdoing to protect his family and
himself from hurt and public embarrassment. The President
profoundly regrets his actions, and he has apologized to his
family, his friends and staff, and the nation. The President denies
that he had any corrupt purpose or any intent to influence the
ongoing grand jury proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to Meet Constitutional Standards
</P>
<P>
   For the reasons set forth in the PREAMBLE of this ANSWER,
Article II does not meet the constitutional standard for convicting
and removing a duly elected President from office and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Vagueness
</P>
<P>
   Article II is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable person
could know what specific charges are being leveled against the
President. Article II alleges that the President ``obstructed and
impeded the administration of justice'' in both the Jones case and
the grand jury investigation. But it provides little or no concrete
information about the specific acts in which the President is
alleged to have engaged, or with whom, or when, that allegedly
obstructed or otherwise impeded the administration of justice.
</P>
<P>
   As we set forth in the second affirmative defense to Article I,
one of the fundamental principles of our law and the Constitution
is that a person has the right to know what specific charges he or
she is facing. Without such fair warning, no one can mount the
defense to which every person is entitled. Fundamental to due
process is the right of the President to be adequately informed of
the charges so that he is able to confront those charges and defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Article II sweeps too broadly and provides too little definite
and specific identification. Were it an indictment, it would be
dismissed. As an article of impeachment, it is constitutionally
defective and should fail.
</P>
<P>
   Charging Multiple Offenses
</P>
<P>
   Article II is constitutionally defective because it charges
multiple instances of alleged acts of obstruction in one article,
which makes it impossible for the Senate to comply with the
Constitutional mandate that any conviction be by the concurrence of
the two-thirds of the members. Accordingly, Article II should fail.

COLUMN: THE SHOOTING STAR FROZEN IN OUR MEMORY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Michael Jordan considered retirement, it was from
baseball, not basketball. There was a lockout in professional
baseball in 1994 and he was then a minor-league fly-chaser. Would
he return to basketball and the Bulls because he had become
disgruntled with the labor impasse?
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts were being sold in Chicago that read, ``City Sweats. .
. . Michael Chills.'' Chicago is no longer sweating _ it's
freezing, below zero on the thermometer, snowdrifts up to the first
floor and long underwear selling like hot cakes. But Michael is
still chilling.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a lockout by the National Basketball Association
owners kept Michael on the links from LA to the Bahamas, and away
from the courts. Away also, it has been said, from his workout
routine, a routine that made him a supremely well-conditioned
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he hasn't spent much time in Chicago, and maybe the
weather as much as anything else has influenced his decision. He
could envision himself as frozen as the bronze statue of him in
middunk outside the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   It remains difficult in this corner to believe that Jordan is in
fact calling it a career. It's true that it would be a fantasy
ending if he packed it in after hitting the winning jump shot from
the key in the final seconds that sealed the Bulls' sixth
championship, in Utah last June. If he is gone for good, then
basketball fans will have forever frozen in memory that last,
luscious moment of the most spectacular player ever to climb into a
pair of sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling here has been that Jordan's competitiveness, his
retention of a high level of skill _ high level being a virtual
understatement because at the age of 35 (36 next month) he is still
the best player on the planet _ and a certain sense of
responsibility to the league and his fellow players would occasion
his return for one more season, and an abbreviated one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Something else. His great love for the game. Remember when he
was only in his second year in the NBA and broke an ankle, he came
back to play in schoolyards much to the dismay of Bulls management
because he missed the game so much. But he had written into his
contract a ``love of the game'' clause.
</P>
<P>
   It is remembered that when he retired from basketball to play
baseball in 1993 that he drove by playgrounds and watched longingly
from the window of his car.
</P>
<P>
   And every time one felt that Jordan couldn't go on _ he had a
terrible groin pull, he had a severely sprained ankle, he had, as
was seen in the Utah series, a 102-degree fever and was near
exhaustion _ he did, and succeeded beyond belief. Every time
someone told Michael he couldn't, or he shouldn't. His response
was: ``Oh, yeah. Just you wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember the Bulls' doctor for much of Jordan's career in
Chicago, John Hefferon, saying that Jordan had a body and a will
that were capable of things that amazed him.
</P>
<P>
   And I loved an answer to a question I posed to Ed Pinckney, when
he was a forward with the Celtics: ``Is Jordan the best leaper in
the league?'' Pinckney replied: ``There are others in the league
who can jump higher. I think Michael is the best floater in the
league.'' Imagine, the best floater. Like a genie on a carpet.
</P>
<P>
   A personal note, from my mother, regarding Jordan. My mother is
82 years old and lives in Chicago. She became a basketball fan only
during the Jordan years. Sometimes I'd sit and watch a Bulls game
with her. The Bulls might be down in the first half. ``I get
nervous'' she'd say. ``Michael always comes through in the second
half.'' Just as she had always told me to wear galoshes because it
might rain, she was right, again. Jordan came through.
</P>
<P>
   After the Miami Heat lost in the playoffs two years ago to the
Bulls, Pat Riley, the Heat coach, said, ``No one will win the
championship until Michael Jordan retires.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, now they all have a chance. Even, conceivably, the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would be giving up some $25 million in salary this
season. But he has never seemed to play solely for money. Perhaps
he felt it was just too much of an effort, with an aging Bulls
team, to try for a seventh championship.
</P>
<P>
   So if this is Michael Jeffrey Jordan's swan song, well, all one
can say is, some swan, some song.

JORDAN WILL RETIRE, 3 OFFICIALS WITH NBA SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (EXCLUSIVE: 12:01 a.m. ET EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
 (DUPLICATION WARNING: The following story is also being
transmitted with an n ``s'' category code.) 
(ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan, basketball's pre-eminent player and the world's
best known athlete, will retire from the National Basketball
Association for the second time in five years, according to three
officials in the NBA with knowledge of Jordan's plans. They said
Monday night that they expected Jordan to make an announcement this
week, possibly as early as Wednesday, at a news conference in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's future has been the biggest issue in basketball in the
wake of the bitter labor dispute that ended last week after an
impasse that lasted six months and wiped out the early part of the
season. Aside from his athletic and entertainment value to the
league, he was viewed as &UR;  &LR; a cultural icon and ambassador for the
sport who would help bridge the gap to disenchanted fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls' star has not made a public statement
regarding his plans since the lockout ended, and his agent, David
Falk, declined Monday night to comment on the possibility of
Jordan's retirement. But the three officials said the decision had
been made.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, more and more signs had pointed to the game's most
prominent star re-retiring at the age of 35. Falk had not held any
contract discussions with the Bulls, and Jordan had not been
working out regularly. In addition, an editor of a new book by
Jordan, ``For the Love of the Game: My Own Story,'' acknowledged
that the publisher was counting on Jordan's retirement when it
decided to publish the book last fall, and had received positive
signals from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   His failure to announce a decision publicly put things on hold
for the Bulls, who won six league titles with Jordan as their
leader and top performer. While the franchise awaited his decision
on whether or not to re-sign, his free-agent teammates were in
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   His decision would give the go-ahead for Bulls Chairman Jerry
Reinsdorf and General Manager Jerry Krause to rebuild and give his
teammates a chance to sign with other teams, should the Bulls not
re-sign them. The Bulls currently have only four players under
contract. Among the players whose futures are hinging on Jordan's
decision are all-star forward Scottie Pippen, whom Jordan has
called his ``little brother,'' and the league's leading rebounder,
Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's teammates acknowledged that the star has not been
consistently working out and getting in prime physical shape for a
shortened season _ a requisite for Jordan every year during the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been preparing, that's the biggest reason I think
he's not coming back,'' said Steve Kerr, a Bulls guard. ``Michael
hasn't told me anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was on vacation last week in the Bahamas, and it was
unclear whether he had returned home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 objective we have here as a franchise is to bring
Michael Jordan back, to bring the championship team back,'' Krause
said Monday. ``When Michael lets us know what he's going to do,
certainly, if he comes back, we intend to make a very concerted and
very serious effort to bring the rest of the championship team
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's history of changing direction in his professional life
left open the possibility that he may return _ if not this season,
than possibly the following year. He last retired in 1994. But he
ended a floundering career as a baseball player _ he never advanced
past the minor leagues _ in the spring of 1995 to return to the
game in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would be leaving the game on the highest note possible.
The five-time most valuable player led the Bulls to their third
championship in three seasons last June 16, carrying Chicago to its
sixth title in eight seasons with a dramatic 40-second sequence in
the clinching Game 6 victory over the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the game-winning shot with 5.3 seconds left, an 18-foot
jump shot that left a stunned gathering at the Delta Center in Salt
Lake City paralyzed. It was the final blow as the Bulls beat the
Jazz for the second season in a row in six games to the win the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's retirement would be the linchpin decision in the
disassembling of the Bulls, basketball's modern-day dynasty whose
six titles in eight seasons drew comparisons to the Bill
Russell-led Boston Celtics of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The first departure was the coach, Phil Jackson, who left the
franchise after the Bulls won the title in June, saying he would
take an extended sabbatical from the game before returning. Krause
hired former Iowa State coach Tim Floyd to replace Jackson under
the stipulation that if Jackson wanted to return, Floyd would
become an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had said all last season he would not play for another
coach, but seemed to be backing off that stance in the off season.
Falk said last week if the situation were right _ meaning that
Pippen, Rodman and most of the supporting cast were re-signed _
Jordan would consider playing again.
</P>
<P>
   But with the league recovering from the most damaging period in
its 52-year history _ a six-month labor dispute that cost players
and owners hundreds of millions of dollars and turned once-loyal
fans apathetic _ the thinking is that perhaps Jordan did not want
to be associated with a tainted image of the NBA. &QL;

   Oh, Devon. Over there is Gary Sheffield. Ummmm, wait . . . you
already know each other, right? Not from the Los Angeles Dodgers
but with the Florida Marlins. Before they were a minor-league
club.Right?
</P>
<P>
   That's what the well-attended first day of winter workouts were
like at Dodger Stadium on Monday. It was the first day of school
with a bunch of new transfer students and a new teacher. And the
principal is new, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around and saw these players, and that's something,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I was ready to start playing
some ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary winter workouts are an annual prelude to spring
training in Dodgerland, but this was different than others. Star
power was prevalent and even most of those who didn't attend had
reasons that general manager Kevin Malone found acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything is different about the Dodgers. Much of the
roster, the manager, the general manager. And, most importantly,
the expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Much like a month ago when the Dodgers and Brown agreed to a
seven-year, $105 million contract, the talk was mostly about the
World Series. And how the Dodgers are stocked to make a run at
their first title in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been around so many young veterans in my life,''
Hundley said. ``Half the team is in the prime of their careers and
the other half is coming into the prime of their careers. That's
why back on Memorial Day I went back to the Mets and had a limited
no-trade clause put in my contract, so that this type of situation
would come up and I wouldn't end up somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, the former Mets catcher who was, in essence, traded for
Mike Piazza, talked about handling a starting rotation of Brown,
Park, Darren Dreifort, Carlos Perez and Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   There's the anticipation of an outfield comprised of Sheffield
in left, White in center and Raul Mondesi in right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers certainly showed they want to win, and I like
that,'' said Brown, who's played in the World Series with the
Marlins and Padres the last two seasons. ``You know most of these
guys, but this is just a time to meet a few people and shake their
hands. I saw (Sheffield) and (White), guys I played with in
Florida, and there's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in attitude, which brings an aura of arrogance to the
Dodgers, was orchestrated by the megabucks the Fox Media Corp.
shelled out. But enveloping the whole situation is Johnson's
reputation, which says the days of a blase, lackadaisical,
noncompetitive atmosphere have ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been here there's been a lot of patience, and
that's good and that's bad,'' Karros said. ``There's some
stability. I like our chances going into this season as far as
being in this organization. This is probably as excited as I've
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those not at Dodger Stadium were Mondesi, third baseman
Adrian Beltre, Perez, catcher Angel Pena and pitcher Mel Rojas.
Malone said Rojas is working out in the Dominican Republic and the
others are playing in the Dominican Republic. All of which is
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are playing, so it makes no sense for them to quit
playing and come up here,'' Malone said. ``Beltre's got a chance to
be the MVP of the league, so it's better they keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The exuberance was bursting, yet it will fade away when most of
the prominent players return to other warm-weather retreats and
private training sessions at week's end and await the start of
spring training. But with overwhelming anticipation for a season
that will hold many expectations, it was enough to wet the baseball
appetite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 38 days away from pitchers and catcher reporting, so
it's kind of a springboard for getting into the '99 year,'' Malone
said. ``I just can't wait, and I think you see a lot of that on
this team with how many big-league guys showed up
here.'' &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end! &QL;

PLEA BARGAINS FOR THREE GOTTI CO-DEFENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a surprise move, federal prosecutors Monday
reached plea &UR; - &LR;  bargain deals with three co-defendants of John A.
Gotti, the reputed acting boss of the Gambino crime family, in a
broad racketeering case.
</P>
<P>
   The deals were made after the government reversed its own trial
strategy, in which it vowed to accept individual pleas in return
for reduced sentences only if Gotti, the top target in a three-year
mafia investigation, also admitted his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Plea negotiations for Gotti and seven other defendants in the
case seemed to break down two weeks ago when Gotti rejected a deal
that could have sent him to prison for up to eight years. At that
time, defense lawyers said that federal prosecutors were demanding
a global settlement in which all eight defendants facing trial on
organized-crime charges would have to plead guilty. Otherwise, the
lawyers said, no separate plea bargains would be accepted by
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But James J. DiPietro, a lawyer on the defense team, said that
prosecutors made new offers late last week and the three defendants
accepted the terms Monday morning at hearings in federal District
Court in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Two other defendants are expected to plead guilty Tuesday in
White Plains, whittling down Gotti's remaining co-defendants on
organized-crime charges to two when he goes on trial later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, 34, who is sometimes called Junior, is the son of John J.
Gotti, 58, who law enforcement officials say is the Gambino family
boss and still influences the Mafia faction while serving a life
term in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cutler, the younger Gotti's lawyer, said that Monday's
pleas might benefit his client at a trial scheduled for later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't hurt him,'' Cutler said. ``If anything,
it might help him by avoiding confusion among jurors over the
charges and the number of defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers in the case said that in reversing course and
agreeing to individual pleas, the government demanded longer prison
sentences than previously offered each defendant for a global
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At hearings Monday, John J. D'Amico, 64, pleaded guilty to a
single count of illegal gambling, and Louis Ricco, 68, to one count
of loan sharking. Both men have been identified by prosecutors as
Gambino capos, or heads of crews.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico, according to the FBI, was appointed by the elder Gotti
to a three-man committee that helped run the Gambino family after
he was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without the possibility
of parole.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico faces a prison sentence of one year and nine months to
two years and three months. Ricco, faces a minimum sentence of
three years and 10 months and a fine of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Antonicelli, 67, who prosecutors said was a Gambino
soldier, pleaded guilty Monday to a loan-sharking charge. His
minimum sentence, according to the deal, will be three years and
five months in prison and a fine of $26,000.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants who agreed to plea deals did obtain some
concessions. They will not be required to testify against Gotti or
have to admit to being members of the Gambino family.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Organized-crime investigators, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that prosecutors reversed themselves on holding out
for a global settlement for two main reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas, they said, assured prison terms and convictions of
two senior Gambino family capos and will allow prosecutors to focus
on the principal accusations against Gotti _ that he was part of
the extortion of about $1 million from the former owners and
employees of Scores, a Manhattan strip club.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and lawyers say that the prosecution plans to call
two former associates, or workers, in the Gambino family as
witnesses against Gotti on the Scores extortion accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, however, insisted that the deals reflected the
weakness of the government's overall case and that prosecutors were
willing to accept pleas to reduced charges from Gotti's
co-defendants rather than risk acquittals in a mass trial on the
more serious racketeering counts against them.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney
for the Southern District of New York, whose office is prosecuting
Gotti, declined to comment Monday on the reasons for the plea deals
and the strategy shift.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that two other co-defendants,
Gregory DePalma, 66, who was identified as an acting Gambino capo,
and his son Craig, 32, a suspected Gambino soldier, had agreed to
plead guilty Tuesday to reduced racketeering charges.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Following are excerpts from the House brief filed Monday in the
impeachment trial of President Clinton, as provided by the
Judiciary Committee on its Web site:
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the United States House of Representatives, by and
through its duly authorized managers, and respectfully submits to
the United States Senate its brief in connection with the
impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Summary
</P>
<P>
   The President is charged in two Articles with: 1) perjury and
false and misleading testimony and statements under oath before a
federal grand jury (Article I), and 2) engaging in a course of
conduct or scheme to delay and obstruct justice (Article II).
</P>
<P>
   The evidence contained in the record, when viewed as a unified
whole, overwhelmingly supports both charges.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury and False Statements Under Oath
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton deliberately and willfully testified falsely
under oath when he appeared before a Federal grand jury on Aug. 17,
1998. Although what follows is not exhaustive, some of the more
overt examples will serve to illustrate.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the very outset, the President read a prepared statement,
which itself contained totally false assertions and other clearly
misleading information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President relied on his statement 19 times in his
testimony when questioned about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ President Clinton falsely testified that he was not paying
attention when his lawyer employed Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit
at the Jones deposition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ He falsely claimed that his actions with Ms. Lewinsky did not
fall within the definition of ``sexual relations'' that was given
at his deposition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ He falsely testified that he answered questions truthfully at
his deposition concerning, among other subjects, whether he had
been alone with Ms. Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ He falsely testified that he instructed Ms. Lewinsky to turn
over the gifts if she were subpoenaed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ He falsely denied trying to influence Ms. Currie after his
deposition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ He falsely testified that he was truthful to his aides when he
gave accounts of his relationship, which accounts were subsequently
disseminated to the media and the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Obstruction of Justice
</P>
<P>
   The President engaged in an ongoing scheme to obstruct both the
Jones civil case and the grand jury. Further, he undertook a
continuing and concerted plan to tamper with witnesses and
prospective witnesses for the purpose of causing those witnesses to
provide false and misleading testimony. Examples abound:
</P>
<P>
   _ The President and Ms. Lewinsky concocted a cover story to
conceal their relationship, and the President suggested that she
employ that story if subpoenaed in the Jones case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President suggested that Ms. Lewinsky provide an affidavit
to avoid testifying in the Jones case, when he knew that the
affidavit would need to be false to accomplish its purpose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President knowingly and willfully allowed his attorney to
file Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit and to use it for the purpose
of obstructing justice in the Jones case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President suggested to Ms. Lewinsky that she provide a
false account of how she received her job at the Pentagon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President attempted to influence the expected testimony of
his secretary, Ms. Currie, by providing her with a false account of
his meetings with Ms. Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President provided several of his top aides with elaborate
lies about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, so that those aides
would convey the false information to the public and to the grand
jury. When he did this, he knew that those aides would likely be
called to testify, while he was declining several invitations to
testify. By this action, he obstructed and delayed the operation of
the grand jury. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President conspired with Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie to
conceal evidence that ... had been subpoenaed in the Jones case,
and thereby delayed and obstructed justice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President and his representatives orchestrated a campaign
to discredit Ms. Lewinsky in order to affect adversely her
credibility as a witness, and thereby attempted to obstruct justice
both in the Jones case and the grand jury. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President lied repeatedly under oath in his deposition in
the Jones case, and thereby obstructed justice in that case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President's lies and misleading statements under oath at
the grand jury were calculated to, and did obstruct, delay and
prevent the due administration of justice by that body. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The President employed the power of his office to procure a
job for Ms. Lewinsky after she signed the false affidavit by
causing his friend to exert extraordinary efforts for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The foregoing are merely accusations of an ongoing pattern of
obstruction of justice, and witness tampering extending over a
period of several months, and having the effect of seriously
compromising the integrity of the entire judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the President's misconduct has been devastating in
several respects.
</P>
<P>
   1. He violated repeatedly his oath to ``preserve, protect and
defend the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   2. He ignored his constitutional duty as chief law-enforcement
officer to ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.''
</P>
<P>
   3. He deliberately and unlawfully obstructed Paula Jones' rights
as a citizen to due process and the equal protection of the laws,
though he had sworn to protect those rights.
</P>
<P>
   4. By his pattern of lies under oath, misleading statements and
deceit, he has seriously undermined the integrity and credibility
of the Office of President and thereby the honor and integrity of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   5. His pattern of perjuries, obstruction of justice and witness
tampering has affected the truth-seeking process which is the
foundation of our legal system.
</P>
<P>
   6. By mounting an assault in the truth-seeking process, he has
attacked the entire judicial branch of Government.

 UNDATED: of Government. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The articles of impeachment that the House has preferred state
offenses that warrant, if proved, the conviction and removal from
office of President William Jefferson Clinton. The articles charge
that the President has committed perjury before a Federal grand
jury and that he obstructed justice in a Federal civil rights
action. The Senate's own precedents establish beyond doubt that
perjury warrants conviction and removal. During the 1980's, the
Senate convicted and removed three Federal judges for committing
perjury. Obstruction of justice undermines the judicial system in
the same fashion that perjury does, and it also warrants conviction
and removal.
</P>
<P>
   Under our Constitution, judges are impeached under the same
standard as Presidents _ treason, bribery or other high crimes and
misdemeanors. Thus, these judicial impeachments for perjury set the
standard here. Finally, the Senate's own precedents further
establish that the President's crimes need not arise directly out
of his official duties. Two of the three judges removed in the
1980's were removed for perjury that had nothing to do with their
official duties....
</P>
<P>
   The House impeachment resolution charges the President with high
crimes and misdemeanors in two articles. Article I alleges that
President Clinton ``willfully corrupted and manipulated the
judicial process of the United States for his personal gain and
exoneration, impeding the administration of justice'' in that he
willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to a
Federal grand jury on Aug. 17, 1998. Article II asserts that the
President ``has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the
administration of justice and engaged in a course of conduct or
scheme designed to delay, impede, cover up and conceal the
existence of evidence and testimony related to a Federal civil
rights action brought against him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of President represents to the American people and to
the world, the strength, the philosophy and most of all, the honor
and integrity that makes us a great nation and an example for the
world. Because all eyes are focused upon that high office, the
character and credibility of any temporary occupant of the Oval
Office is vital to the domestic and foreign welfare of the
citizens. Consequently, serious breaches of integrity and duty of
necessity adversely influence the reputation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This case is not about sex or private conduct. It is about
multiple obstructions of justice, perjury, false and misleading
statements, and witness tampering _ all committed or orchestrated
by the President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Before addressing the President's lies and obstruction, it is
important to place the events in the proper context. If this were
only about private sex we would not now be before the Senate. But
the manner in which the Lewinsky relationship arose and continued
is important because it is illustrative of the character of the
President and the decisions he made....
</P>
<P>
   The sexual details of the President's encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky, though relevant, need not be detailed either in this
document or through witness testimony. It is necessary, though,
briefly to outline that evidence, because it will demonstrate that
the President repeatedly lied about that sexual relationship in his
deposition, before the grand jury and in his responses to the
Judiciary Committee's questions. He has consistently maintained
that Ms. Lewinsky merely performed acts on him, while he never
touched her in a sexual manner. This characterization not only
directly contradicts Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, but it also
contradicts the sworn grand jury testimony of three of her friends
and the statements by two professional counselors with whom she
contemporaneously shared the details of her relationship.
</P>
<P>
   While his treatment of Ms. Lewinsky was offensive, it is much
more offensive for the President to expect the Senate to believe
that in 1995, 1996 and 1997, his intimate contact with Ms. Lewinsky
was so limited that it did not fall within his narrow
interpretation of a definition of ``sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   THE EVIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   We respectfully submit that the evidence and testimony must be
viewed as a whole; it cannot be compartmentalized. It is essential
to avoid considering each event in isolation, and then treating it
separately. Events and words that may seem innocent or even
exculpatory in a vacuum may well take on a sinister, or even
criminal connotation when observed in the context of the whole
plot. For example, everyone agrees that Monica Lewinsky testified
``No one ever told me to lie; nobody ever promised me a job.''
</P>
<P>
   When considered alone this would seem exculpatory. However, in
the context of the other evidence, another picture emerges. Of
course no one said, ``Now, Monica, you go in there and lie.'' They
didn't have to. Ms. Lewinsky knew what was expected of her.
Similarly, nobody promised her a job, but once she signed the false
affidavit, she got one.
</P>
<P>
   THE ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate issue is whether the President's course of conduct
is such as to affect adversely the Office of the President and also
upon the administration of justice, and whether he has acted in a
manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive to the
rule of law....
</P>
<P>
   CONCLUSION
</P>
<P>
   This is a defining moment for the Presidency as an institution,
because if the President is not convicted as a consequence of the
conduct that has been portrayed, then no House of Representatives
will ever be able to impeach again and no Senate will ever convict.
The bar will be so high that only a convicted felon or a traitor
will need to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Experts pointed to the fact that the House refused to impeach
President Nixon for lying on an income tax return. Can you imagine
a future President, faced with possible impeachment, pointing to
the perjuries, lies, obstructions, and tampering with witnesses by
the current occupant of the office as not rising to the level of
high crimes and misdemeanors? If this is not enough, what is? How
far can the standard be lowered without completely compromising the
credibility of the office for all time?

NEW LEADER OF NAVAJOS TRIUMPHED OVER `DARK WATERS' OF ALCOHOLISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BETTY REID AND BILL DONOVAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1975, Kelsey Begay was drowning in ``dark waters'' _ the
Navajo phrase for being swamped in the evils of alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from the jungles of Vietnam, the former soldier was living
on the streets of Los Angeles, a world away from his home in this
remote community on the Navajo Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Navajos, he'd fallen prey to the lure of alcohol. And
like many American soldiers, he used it to help him cope with
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to be crazy to go out into the jungle sober,'' Begay
said.
</P>
<P>
   With each drink, during the war and after, memories of Kaibito,
Ariz., slipped away. But Begay's destiny was not to end in the
alleys beneath the looming skyscrapers of urban America.
</P>
<P>
   Today, (TUESDAY) sober for more than two decades, Begay, 48,
will be sworn in as president of the Navajo Nation, becoming
caretaker of the largest tribe in America.
</P>
<P>
   After escaping from the trap of alcohol and drugs himself, Begay
gave others hope by counseling them about the dangers of addiction.
Now, he intends to give tribal members hope through a style of
leadership that emphasizes family values.
</P>
<P>
   Educated in public and federal reservation schools, Begay
aspired to be an evangelist, not a politician. Friends say one of
his favorite hobbies is strumming an electric guitar and belting
out songs ranging from Christian and blues to country music.
</P>
<P>
   To some, his personality doesn't seem very presidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people out there still don't believe I am president,''
said Begay, former speaker of the Navajo council.
</P>
<P>
   But Begay says he intends to draw on his background growing up
here to do an effective job.
</P>
<P>
   Kaibito, named after the willows that once flourished in a giant
wash, gave Begay the comforts of family and the beauty of nature,
minus basics like running water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs were rare. Kaibito was no different than other Navajo
communities whose youngsters must migrate to nearby bordertowns or
larger cities to find work.
</P>
<P>
   For Kaibito residents, that usually meant Page, Flagstaff,
Phoenix or Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Kaibito had in common with larger places was the
problem of alcohol. Alcohol had taken a toll, not on just the
Kaibito community, but the tribe in general. Alcohol ranks as the
number one cause of death on the Navajo reservation, according to
Navajo Area Indian Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   Page, which is nestled on an upsweep of sandstone just east of
the Glen Canyon Dam, also has had a history of scrimmages with
inebriated tribal members.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Begay turned his life around and started helping
others do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Grayeyes, residential director of Rainbow Bridge
Residential Treatment Center in Page, has heard Begay describe his
ordeal with alcohol. Grayeyes is director of what once was called
the Local Alcohol Reception Center, which Begay previously headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess after he came out of the Army, Kelsey returned here,
and was a frequent visitor to the water holes in Page,'' Grayeyes
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ended up at LARC, and through that connection, he was
counseled by an individual who changed his life. Begay became a
counselor himself.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 1976. Begay sobered up with the help of the 12-step
program and found God in a Pentecostal Church. But he said his
Christian faith does not erase who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Navajo first, Christian second.''
</P>
<P>
   And, following Navajo tradition, he identifies himself through
his maternal clan _ ``todichiinii,'' or ``bitter water''_ and his
paternal clan, ``tabaha,'' ``edgewater.''
</P>
<P>
   James Bilagody, a Tuba City leader who is Begay's friend, met
the tribal leader in the 1980s when Begay was head of the western
portion of the tribe's behavorial-health services.
</P>
<P>
   Bilagody, now on the Navajo council, believes that Begay relates
well with tribal members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Kelsey) is very dependable,'' Biligody said. ``He has
an administrative experience background. He is in tune with the
everyday problems of Navajo people - meaning a lot of
inconsistencies that are part of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay says there are several issues he intends to deal with as
president.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of his victory, Begay told supporters he would
investigate the tribe's scholarship program because many people
complained about it while he was campaigning. He also encourages
more Navajo youth to join tribal government.
</P>
<P>
   If Begay is to be successful, some Navajos say, he will do on
the strength of character rather than charisma. He's not known for
displaying the presence or passion of gifted English and Navajo
orators such as past tribal leaders Peter MacDonald and Albert
Hale.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, said former tribal president Peterson Zah. Zah said
the voters were not seeking charisma so much as a stable, older and
committed leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not the flashy, shoot-from-the-hip type person,'' Zah
said. ``He is very deliberate and thinks about what he is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanda MacDonald, wife of Peter MacDonald, said Begay is
dependable and believes in family values. Peter MacDonald is the
former tribal president serving a prison term for inciting a riot
at Window Rock following his removal from office for conspiracy and
taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Begay was more of a work horse than a race horse,`` she said.
``A race horse may look good but it is the work horse that will
accomplish the most.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kaibito, the people say Begay is compassionate and generous.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Kathleen Bennett, 52,a foster mother who lives in
a tiny ramshackle house in Kaibito. Though the three-room home has
electricity and running water, it's not large enough to accommodate
Bennett and the nine youngsters, including grandchildren, who live
with her.
</P>
<P>
   She says Begay helped one of her daughters to get a college
scholarship and in the late 1980s, when he was Kaibito chapter
president, he tried to get public assistance for her.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she contacted attorneys but was told that
emergency housing funds had run out. Her hope is that now that a
Kaibito man is president, some help will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like Begay to think of his people out here,'' Bennett
said. ``Too many people, once they become politicians, they move
east past White Mesa, past Black Mesa, dash to Window Rock and
forget their community.''
</P>
<P>
   In late December, two weeks before the inaugural ceremonies,
three Navajo ladies selling frybread, coffee and hamburger from the
back of their pickup across from the Kaibito supermarket also
expressed hope that Begay's presidency would bring good things to
their community.
</P>
<P>
   They stood, chattering about politics, as Navajo Mountain
shimmered in the background against spacious blue skies. Warmth
wafted from a steak grill.
</P>
<P>
   Etta Jackson, 33, worried that Begay might fall victim to brutal
politics in Window Rock, a five hour drive away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope people don't buck him,'' Jackson said. ``I hope people
treat him well in Window Rock. We worry about Kelsey and we say a
lot of prayers for him.''

NEWCOMERS SING HOUSING LAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some of the new Dodgers are learning about the
health of the Los Angeles real estate market, and it has taken them
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of the recent high-priced acquisitions arranged their
trip to Monday's opening day of winter workouts at Dodger Stadium
to coincide with afternoon meetings with real estate agents. But
it's such a sellers' market some of the players are having trouble
finding a viable living location.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found lots of houses I like, I'm just not sure,'' said
pitcher Kevin Brown, owner of a seven-year, $105 million contract.
``I'm a little sticker-shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not much better for center fielder Devon White, who signed
a three-year free-agent contract worth $12.4 million but can't find
a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to find a place to stay within my budget,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Contract talks: Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone is
hoping to speak with pitcher Chan Ho Park about a contract
extension within the next week. Park, who was 15-9 with a 3.71 ERA
last season, is in the last year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started here and I feel very comfortable with the Dodgers,
and even living in Los Angeles, it's like my second hometown, so
it's something I'd like to do,'' Park said. ``When I come here I
feel like I'm coming home. If it's a pretty good deal, I wouldn't
have to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who returned from Korea over the weekend, said he hasn't
thought about contract terms he's seeking.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hansen returns: The Dodgers announced Monday that infielder
Dave Hansen signed a one-year contract. He'll most likely be used
in a utility/pinch-hitter role.
</P>
<P>
   It's Hansen's second stint with the Dodgers. He was a
second-round pick by the Dodgers in the 1986 draft and hit .259
with 12 homers and 83 RBI in seven years with the team. The
30-year-old Hansen, who graduated from Rowland High in Walnut,
played for the Cubs in 1997 before spending 1998 in Japan with the
Hanshin Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Brown endowment: Brown announced he will give a $1 million
endowment to the Los Angeles chapter of the Reviving Baseball in
Innercities (RBI) program to establish the Kevin Brown RBI Academy
of Excellence.
</P>
<P>
   The academy will combine baseball instruction and academics,
which will help kids with SAT prep classes, time-management
seminars, human-development courses, retreats, college tours and
college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them the opportunity to get some instruction but also
a chance to prove themselves academically,'' Brown said. ``It's a
chance for the youth of the inner cities to be involved in
baseball.''

REPEATING TO ADD EMBARGO NOTE 
COLUMN: THE SHOOTING STAR FROZEN IN OUR MEMORY
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE: 12:01 a.m. ET EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
 (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Michael Jordan considered retirement, it was from
baseball, not basketball. There was a lockout in professional
baseball in 1994 and he was then a minor-league fly-chaser. Would
he return to basketball and the Bulls because he had become
disgruntled with the labor impasse?
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts were being sold in Chicago that read, ``City Sweats. .
. . Michael Chills.'' Chicago is no longer sweating _ it's
freezing, below zero on the thermometer, snowdrifts up to the first
floor and long underwear selling like hot cakes. But Michael is
still chilling.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a lockout by the National Basketball Association
owners kept Michael on the links from LA to the Bahamas, and away
from the courts. Away also, it has been said, from his workout
routine, a routine that made him a supremely well-conditioned
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he hasn't spent much time in Chicago, and maybe the
weather as much as anything else has influenced his decision. He
could envision himself as frozen as the bronze statue of him in
middunk outside the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   It remains difficult in this corner to believe that Jordan is in
fact calling it a career. It's true that it would be a fantasy
ending if he packed it in after hitting the winning jump shot from
the key in the final seconds that sealed the Bulls' sixth
championship, in Utah last June. If he is gone for good, then
basketball fans will have forever frozen in memory that last,
luscious moment of the most spectacular player ever to climb into a
pair of sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling here has been that Jordan's competitiveness, his
retention of a high level of skill _ high level being a virtual
understatement because at the age of 35 (36 next month) he is still
the best player on the planet _ and a certain sense of
responsibility to the league and his fellow players would occasion
his return for one more season, and an abbreviated one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Something else. His great love for the game. Remember when he
was only in his second year in the NBA and broke an ankle, he came
back to play in schoolyards much to the dismay of Bulls management
because he missed the game so much. But he had written into his
contract a ``love of the game'' clause.
</P>
<P>
   It is remembered that when he retired from basketball to play
baseball in 1993 that he drove by playgrounds and watched longingly
from the window of his car.
</P>
<P>
   And every time one felt that Jordan couldn't go on _ he had a
terrible groin pull, he had a severely sprained ankle, he had, as
was seen in the Utah series, a 102-degree fever and was near
exhaustion _ he did, and succeeded beyond belief. Every time
someone told Michael he couldn't, or he shouldn't. His response
was: ``Oh, yeah. Just you wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember the Bulls' doctor for much of Jordan's career in
Chicago, John Hefferon, saying that Jordan had a body and a will
that were capable of things that amazed him.
</P>
<P>
   And I loved an answer to a question I posed to Ed Pinckney, when
he was a forward with the Celtics: ``Is Jordan the best leaper in
the league?'' Pinckney replied: ``There are others in the league
who can jump higher. I think Michael is the best floater in the
league.'' Imagine, the best floater. Like a genie on a carpet.
</P>
<P>
   A personal note, from my mother, regarding Jordan. My mother is
82 years old and lives in Chicago. She became a basketball fan only
during the Jordan years. Sometimes I'd sit and watch a Bulls game
with her. The Bulls might be down in the first half. ``I get
nervous'' she'd say. ``Michael always comes through in the second
half.'' Just as she had always told me to wear galoshes because it
might rain, she was right, again. Jordan came through.
</P>
<P>
   After the Miami Heat lost in the playoffs two years ago to the
Bulls, Pat Riley, the Heat coach, said, ``No one will win the
championship until Michael Jordan retires.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, now they all have a chance. Even, conceivably, the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would be giving up some $25 million in salary this
season. But he has never seemed to play solely for money. Perhaps
he felt it was just too much of an effort, with an aging Bulls
team, to try for a seventh championship.
</P>
<P>
   So if this is Michael Jeffrey Jordan's swan song, well, all one
can say is, some swan, some song.

LUCENT TO BUY KENAN FOR $1.45 BILLION, BUT IS QUIET ON PURSUIT OF
ASCEND
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., N.J.)  (ms) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER AND LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies said Monday it would buy the Kenan Systems
Corp., a leader in billing software, but declined to talk about the
far bigger deal on Wall Street's mind, a possible acquisition of
the Ascend Corp., a leading data communications equipment maker.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent, the former telephone equipment manufacturing arm of
AT&AMP;T, said it would acquire all of Kenan from its founder and
president, Kenan Sahin, for 12.88 million shares valued at $1.45
billion, based on Monday's closing prices. Shares of Lucent fell
$2.50, to $112.75.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Sahin will become a vice president at Lucent's
Bell Labs research center and continue to run the billing software
business from Kenan's headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. He said the
bulk of his suddenly public fortune would go to a new foundation
dedicated to converting college-level classroom courses into
interactive software that will be distributed around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan develops software that allows phone companies like MCI
Worldcom and AT&AMP;T Worldnet to provide a single bill covering a
variety of services, including regular and wireless phone, data
transmission, Internet and broadband cable.
</P>
<P>
   The software also manages new service orders and helps clients
design and simulate new pricing and service plans. Phone companies
are eager to have flexible billing systems to bundle services and
quickly adjust marketing plans because customers are less likely to
jump to rivals if they buy several services.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan's sales have been doubling annually in recent years,
reaching $175 million last year, Sahin said. Lucent said that the
billing software niche was growing 30 percent a year, faster than
the broader $20 billion communications software market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to jump to the head of the pack by acquiring the
hottest player in the business,'' said Daniel C. Stanzione,
executive vice president and chief operating officer of Lucent,
based in Murray Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts liked the deal. Kenan is expected to add at least 3
cents a share to Lucent's earnings in the current year ending Sept.
30, which should hit $2.11 a share according to the First Call
Corp.'s consensus estimate from 27 analysts. Lucent earned $548
million, or 41 cents a diluted share before special charges on
revenue of $8 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent's strong position in the old regional Bell companies is
likely to generate new opportunities for Kenan. Meanwhile, Kenan's
overseas presence _ now 40 percent of its revenue _ should open
doors for Lucent equipment and services as it battles with rivals
like Alcatel of France and Siemens of Germany for market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great acquisition for Lucent,'' said Greg Geiling,
who follows Lucent for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not the primary deal on investors' minds. The drop
in Lucent shares was driven by nervousness about a possible deal
with Ascend. Based on current valuations, such a deal would be 10
times pricier than the Kenan acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has been rampant for more than a year that Lucent
might someday buy Ascend as it prepares to take on Cisco Systems,
the giant of data networking. As data networks like the Internet
and phone networks converge so that the same services can be
offered over both, newcomers like Cisco and Ascend are increasingly
competing directly with traditional telecommunications equipment
makers like Lucent and Northern Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent is continuing its talks with Ascend Communications, which
were first reported in The Financial Times, although it is not
known if or when an announced deal is likely, people close to the
talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have had talks over the last several months, but
Ascend had always asserted it could remain independent. In a recent
October conference call with analysts, Mory Ejabat, the president
and chief executive officer of Ascend, evaded the topic of a buyout
and said his company was then not having talks with Lucent
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like saying I have not had sexual relations
with that woman Monica Lewinsky,'' said Paul Sagawa, a senior
research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who took part in the
conference call. ``It was so clearly a Clintonesque response.''
</P>
<P>
   An Ascend acquisition would also be a departure from what Ken
Fehrnstrom, vice president for strategic business development for
Ascend, said in an interview late last month. He reiterated
Ascend's desire to remain independent and compared the company to a
``small dog that doesn't know it's a small dog. It will go after
the big dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   He also joked, ``Maybe some day we could acquire Nortel,''
referring to Lucent's $36 billion Canadian rival Northern Telecom.

TAX BREAK RULING DASHES HOPES FOR CHEAPER POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Even as it pushes for market competition as a
means to cheaper electricity, the Pataki administration has
withdrawn a tax break granted to businesses and individuals that
shop around for a power company.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, reversing a ruling made less than two years ago,
raises the cost of electricity by up to 4 percent for the small but
rapidly growing group of consumers who choose competing suppliers
over their established local utility.
</P>
<P>
   The move has infuriated companies trying to break into the vast
energy market in New York, whose electric rates are among the
country's highest. They had expected the earlier policy to stand,
but the reversal has made their product more expensive and less
attractive to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is raising taxes, raising rates and discouraging
competition,'' said Craig G. Goodman, president of the National
Energy Marketers Association, a trade group. ``We've got the state
encouraging choice, and then, when people take them up on it,
they're singled out for punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, he said, the reimposed tax has wiped out
whatever savings consumers enjoyed from buying cheaper power.
</P>
<P>
   Energy companies say most of the 72,000 customers statewide who
buy power on the open market do not yet know that their taxes have
increased.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the state department of taxation and finance,
which made the tax ruling, contends that all it has done is
reinterpret existing law and remove an unfair advantage that people
and businesses who bought power on the competitive market held over
those who remained traditional utility customers and must pay the
tax. ``This evens the playing field,'' said the spokeswoman, Leah
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the ruling would protect utilities from an unfair
advantage given to their new competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But the utilities insist that they did not want the tax imposed.
They have put considerable effort into revamping their operations
to prepare for the new market, and they hope that robust
competition will mean higher prices for their power plants, which
they are selling off as part of the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invested a lot in retail choice, and we don't want
something like this slowing it down,'' said Richard Mulieri, a
spokesman for Consolidated Edison.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could be a sensitive one for Gov. George E. Pataki,
whose proudest accomplishment has been cutting taxes. He has spoken
often about the need to lower electric rates to make New York more
competitive economically, and his administration has effected the
first rate cuts in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the paradox, the imposition of the tax falls most
heavily on large, electricity-hungry businesses, the very customers
the governor says need rate relief most.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office declined to comment on the tax ruling. But
administration officials say the governor's office had known about
it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The ruling has frustrated officials at another state agency, the
public service commission, which governs utilities. They fear that
it undermines the work that they have done to encourage power
companies to enter the New York market.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes as New York, like many other states, is
overhauling its electric power market, which has long belonged
exclusively to seven utilities, like Con Edison, each with a
regional monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, all customers will be able to choose from several
power suppliers, just as they do with long-distance telephone
companies. Companies that until recently were only energy
wholesalers are being allowed to sell directly to consumers,
competing with the established utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The transition is expected to take about five years, except on
Long Island, where it has been put off indefinitely by the partial
state takeover of the old Long Island Lighting Company.
</P>
<P>
   The tax dispute arises from the fact that an electric bill
reflects not one service but several, such as maintaining the
system, generating the power and transmitting it. In the past, the
utility provided all the services, which were lumped together in
one bill. But in a competitive market, the different services are
provided by different companies, so they can be itemized.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the state taxation and finance department ruled that
once competition began and it was possible to separate the charges,
the sales tax would not apply to the transmission part of the bill,
which experts say is usually 20 percent to 50 percent of the total.
In New York City, the sales tax on electric bills is 8.25 percent
for commercial users and 4.25 percent for residences, and it varies
slightly around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 decision meant that most users that chose their power
company would save 1 percent to 4 percent on their electric bills.
Traditional utility customers continued to pay sales tax on the
whole bill.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jan. 1, Steven U. Teitelbaum, deputy commissioner and
counsel at the taxation department _ the same official who wrote
the 1997 decision _ reversed himself and ruled that the sales tax
applied to the entire bill for all customers. He did not return
telephone calls on Friday or Monday.

BAD START TO SHORT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Five Los Angeles Lakers showed up for the first
unofficial practice of the truncated 1998-1999 campaign, proving
that it's easier to breathe new life into a dying NBA season than
resuscitate a team's weakly beating heart.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider that 10 Indiana Pacers found their way to the
gym on Monday (circumventing snow drifts, no less), it seems pretty
obvious that Lakers coach Del Harris doesn't need a veteran point
guard or a power forward as much as he does a defibrillator.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think being swept by Utah in the Western Conference finals
in May would have been just the shock to their faint hearts that
the Lakers needed. And for Derek Fisher and Shaquille O'Neal, it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the uncelebrated point guard and the superstar
center contacted the other 10 players with ties to the Lakers at
the beginning of the lockout in July and after its merciful end
last week, both times in an effort to drum up interest in an
organized practice group.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the response they got, you would have thought they were
dinner-time solicitors hawking newspaper subscriptions rather than
teammates trying to sell the concept of chemistry and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty sad when the baseball team in town holds its first
optional workout the same day as the Lakers, a full month before
the first players are due to report for spring training, and Kevin
Brown drops in from Macon and Todd Hundley gets to Chavez Ravine
from New York and Gary Sheffield (Elden Campbell, are you taking
notes?) flies in from Florida. While across town a practice being
held three weeks before the start of the NBA season can't even lure
Kobe Bryant from Pacific Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few were interested, a few were out of town, a few I never
heard back from,'' Fisher said, shrugging his shoulders. When he
resumed speaking, his tone left no doubt that he didn't suffer
gladly the players who didn't have the courtesy to call him back,
much less show up.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him for being upset? If the communication between
the starting point guard and his teammates breaks down that easily,
it doesn't bode well for a season, especially one of only 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I don't command as much respect as Shaq does,'' Fisher
said. ``But if a teammate calls you, you should have enough respect
to call him back.''
</P>
<P>
   And if your team captain is the one on the other end of the line
and he's throwing his weight, all 315 pounds of it, behind his
words, why would you dare turn a deaf ear to him?
</P>
<P>
   Is it jealousy that made some of O'Neal's teammates do it? Or
just a blatant lack of respect? Regardless of the underlying
reason, O'Neal's the last person (along with Harris) who should be
made the fall guy should the Lakers drown in their own talent again
this year.
</P>
<P>
   We'd love it if Harris borrowed a statement from UCLA coach
Steve Lavin and started the five who made the effort to show up for
trainer Gary Vitti's improvised practice in the season opener next
month. Lakers fans, introducing your starting lineup for the first
game of 1999: O'Neal, Fisher, rookie Tyronn Lue, Eddie Jones and
Sean Rooks.
</P>
<P>
   Rooks almost didn't make it. He got an earful from O'Neal when
he arrived at L.A. Southwest College well past 11 o'clock for a 10
o'clock practice, just in time to lift weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were you at?'' O'Neal said in the closest thing we've
ever heard to a shriek from The Softspoken One. ``Do you know what
time 10 o'clock is?''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal should have saved his breath for the guys who didn't show
at all. The only absent player who had an acceptable excuse was
forward Robert Horry, who stayed back in Houston to tend to his
ailing 3-year-old daughter, who requires 24-hour medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and O'Neal tried gamely to give the rest of their AWOL
teammates the benefit of the doubt, suggesting that maybe the
lockout's end had caught them flatfooted.
</P>
<P>
   But then you ask Fisher how it was !ital!he!off! managed to get
to the gym on time and he talks about telephoning Lakers executive
vice president Jerry West the day after the deal was struck because
he figured that where there was an end to the lockout, the
beginning of practices couldn't be far behind. Imagine that, a
player taking the initiative instead of waiting for an invitation
and a chauffeured limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Lue, who went to great lengths to show he was a
gamer. He attended the practice at considerable personal risk,
having not yet been signed to a contract by the team. He explained
that he wouldn't have missed Monday's workout for anything. Not
after waiting practically his whole life for this day to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy to have been drafted by the Lakers, I just wanted
to show the guys I'm willing to do whatever it takes to win,'' said
Lue, who looked down, wide-eyed, from his perch halfway up a
staircase as Fisher emerged from the L.A. Southwest gymnasium into
a spacious hallway and was promptly swallowed by a wave of
reporters. With apologies to Jones, who guarded him during a game
of 2-on-2, it was the most suffocating spot from which Fisher had
to escape all morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who were here, we do feel a little letdown,'' Fisher
said. ``There were a couple of older guys who knew about the
practice and should have been here. Once the guys learned the deal
had been done, you feel like maybe they should have gotten back as
fast as they could. It'll be talked about and discussed when we all
get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that air-clearing conversation comes as soon as today,
the damage already has been done. After all, you never get a second
chance to make a first impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day is always the important day,'' Fisher conceded.
``You want to be ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   After cooling their heels for 193 days, you wouldn't have
thought that would have been a problem.

JORDAN WILL RETIRE, 3 OFFICIALS WITH NBA SAY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Jordan, basketball's pre-eminent player and
the world's best-known athlete, will retire from the National
Basketball Association for the second time in five years, according
to three officials in the NBA with knowledge of Jordan's plans.
They said Monday night they expected the Chicago Bulls star to make
an announcement Wednesday at a news conference in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's future has been the biggest issue in basketball in the
wake of the bitter labor dispute that ended last week after an
impasse that lasted six months and wiped out the early part of the
season. Aside from his athletic and entertainment value to the
league, he was viewed as a cultural icon and ambassador for the
sport who would help bridge the gap to disenchanted fans.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has not made a public statement regarding his plans since
the lockout ended, and his agent, David Falk, declined to comment
Monday night on the possibility of Jordan's retirement. The Bulls
also declined comment. But the three officials said the decision
had been made and that the news conference would be at the United
Center in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, more signs had pointed to the game's most prominent
star retiring again at the age of 35. Falk had not held any
contract discussions with the Bulls, and Jordan had not been
working out regularly. In addition, an editor of a new book by
Jordan, ``For the Love of the Game: My Own Story,'' acknowledged
that the publisher was counting on Jordan's retirement when it
decided to publish the book last fall, and had received positive
signals to that effect from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   His failure to make a decision had delayed personnel decisions
for the Bulls, who won six league titles with Jordan as their
leader and top performer. The Bulls have only four players under
contract, and most of the components from Chicago's championship
team were in limbo because Jordan was obviously the team's
priority.
</P>
<P>
   He would have secured a contract worth about $37 million for the
shortened season that is scheduled to begin Feb. 5, pro-rated over
50 games instead of the usual 82. Without Jordan's salary, Bulls
officials will have more money to sign two of their own prominent
free agents, Scottie Pippin and Dennis Rodman. But, conversely,
Jordan's absence may be a factor in whether they want to return to
the Bulls. Jordan and Pippen have been an All-Star tandem
throughout the Bulls' championship run _ Jordan calls Pippen his
``little brother'' _ and Pippen may opt to play elsewhere if he
concludes the Bulls' glory days will end when Jordan's career does.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's history of changing direction in his professional life
leaves open the possibility that he may return _ if not this
season, then possibly the following year. He retired for the
1993-94 season and embarked on a professional baseball career,
saying he was finished with basketball. But he ended a floundering
career in baseball's minor leagues in the spring of 1995 to return
to basketball for the latter part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan led the league in scoring 10 times, the most ever. His
31.5 points per game over his career is the highest regular-season
average in NBA history, higher than Wilt Chamberlain's 30.1
average. He was the league's most valuable player five times, and
the All-Star Game MVP three times. In 179 playoff games, he has
averaged 33.4 points, 6.4 rebounds and 5.7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying the league into the post-Magic Johnson and Larry Bird
era with aplomb, his incredible accomplishments on the floor are
only paralleled by his commercial success off of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bulls selected him with the third pick in the 1984
draft out of the University of North Carolina, he has graduated
from amazing athlete to corporate pitch man to world champion and,
finally, to cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune Magazine last June estimated Jordan's financial
contributions to the NBA as $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Except for participating in one or two early negotiating
sessions, Jordan was not a presence in the labor talks that
culminated with last week's agreement. He instead has been seen
indulging his passion _ golf _ in places like the Bahamas, and
Jordan's Bulls teammates acknowledge that he had not been
consistently working out and getting in prime physical shape _ a
prerequisite for Jordan every year during the off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been preparing, that's the biggest reason I think
he's not coming back,'' said Steve Kerr, a Bulls guard. ``Michael
hasn't told me anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan last week was on vacation in the Bahamas, and it was
unclear whether he had returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would be leaving the game on the highest note possible.
He led the Bulls to their third championship in three seasons last
June 16, carrying Chicago to its sixth title in eight seasons with
a dramatic 40-second sequence in the clinching Game 6 victory over
the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the game-winning shot with 5.3 seconds left, an 18-foot
jump shot that left a stunned gathering at the Delta Center in Salt
Lake City. It was the final blow as the Bulls beat the Jazz for the
second season in a row in six games to the win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   But his retirement would be the linchpin decision in the
disassembling of the Bulls. ``The No. 1 objective we have here as a
franchise is to bring Michael Jordan back, to bring the
championship team back,'' Bulls General Manager Jerry Krause had
said. ``When Michael lets us know what he's going to do, certainly,
if he comes back, we intend to make a very concerted and very
serious effort to bring the rest of the championship team back.''
</P>
<P>
   The first departure was the coach, Phil Jackson, who left the
franchise after the Bulls won the title in June, saying he would
take an extended sabbatical from the game before returning.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had said all last season he would not play for another
coach, but seemed to be backing off that stance in the off season.
But with the league recovering from the most damaging period in its
52-year history, the thinking is that perhaps Jordan did not want
to be associated with a tainted image of the NBA. &QL;

MANHUNT LEADS TO OVERLAND PARK, THEN WICHITA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR and RASHEEDA CRAYTON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Two suspects in a multistate series of
crimes took brief respite at an Overland Park hotel Saturday before
catching a cab ride that ended in Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, whose identities are unknown, remained at large
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents and police on Sunday searched the Overland Park
Marriott hotel and the neighborhoods near Interstate 435 and
Metcalf Avenue before learning the men had left the area. They also
impounded and searched a stolen truck that had been abandoned in
the hotel parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The two are wanted in the killing of a Louisiana car salesman on
Thursday and a bank robbery and the wounding of an Iowa police
chief on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The men were last seen in Wichita, where an Overland Park
cabdriver dropped them off after a sometimes nerve-racking ride.
Although the driver did not know the men were wanted in a killing,
he became concerned for his safety during the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat the cell phone in his lap and dialed 911, so all he'd
have to do is press `send' in a jam,'' said John Harsh, the
driver's supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The ride ended safely for the driver, however, and he did not
have to call for help before dropping the men off at the Mark 8
motel in eastern Wichita, Harsh said.
</P>
<P>
   The men are thought to have a large-caliber handgun and a rifle
or shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Police first learned the men had been in Overland Park when
hotel security officers noticed a pickup truck in the hotel parking
lot about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. The truck matched a description the
officers had heard on news reports about the Louisiana and Iowa
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The security officers called police, who in turn contacted the
FBI's fugitive unit. Agents soon determined the men were no longer
in the hotel. Police found bank money wrappers when they searched
the men's hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   A review of hotel records found the two men checked into a room
about 4 a.m. Saturday, just hours after the Iowa bank robbery, a
shootout and a massive manhunt in northern Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   FBI special agent Jeff Lanza said the men used the name Tim
Taylor in registering for the room. Lanza said the name is an
alias. Hotel employees told police they last saw the men about 7:15
a.m. Saturday in the hotel lobby.
</P>
<P>
   A Marriott official declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The men paid cash, checked out of the room Saturday afternoon
and called for a cab.
</P>
<P>
   A driver for Southland Cab Co. picked the men up and took them
to Oak Park Mall in Overland Park, said Harsh, the driver's
supervisor. The driver declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   As the driver dropped off the men at the mall about 4:30 p.m.,
they changed their mind and asked to go to Topeka, Harsh said. The
driver offered to take them there after handling another fare
first. The men agreed, declining an offer to leave their suitcases
in the trunk of the cab.
</P>
<P>
   When the driver returned, the men had traded their suitcases for
newly purchased, large duffel bags and said they were still willing
to pay $98 to go to Topeka, Harsh said.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway to Topeka, the driver radioed Harsh, saying his
riders wanted to go to Wichita instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabdrivers, if their wheels aren't turning, they're not making
money,'' said Harsh. ``So I told him it was up to him. He's from
Wichita and figured he could hook up with his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The men paid the extra $162 in fare to Wichita up-front. Shortly
after, the men began to whisper back and forth in the back seat,
and the driver became concerned, Harsh said.
</P>
<P>
   When the driver sped up, the men seemed agitated, constantly
asking him to slow down, as if they were worried he would get
pulled over by police, Harsh said. The driver stopped at a
fast-food restaurant at the men's request, but they refused to get
out and would only use the drive-through window.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the driver grabbed his cell phone. He kept it on his
lap until dropping the men off around 8:30 p.m. at an east Wichita
motel, where they spent Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Southland Cab said it was not unusual for older
businessmen to take taxi rides to Wichita or Topeka, but it was
quite unusual for men who were in their late teens or 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Police and federal agents arrived at the Wichita motel about
11:30 a.m. Sunday. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed them by a little more than an hour,'' Lanza said.
``They're on the move.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men were described as white and in their late teens or
early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   One was described as 5 feet 10 or 11 inches tall and weighing
165 pounds. He has a blond goatee and an acne-scarred face. He was
last seen wearing a black cap, a white long-underwear T-shirt
beneath a black T-shirt, blue jean overalls and black boots.
</P>
<P>
   The second suspect was described as 5 feet 11 inches tall and
weighing 135 pounds. He has black hair and a mustache. His eyebrow
is pierced with two silver loops, and he has a silver tongue stud.
He was wearing a white T-shirt, blue jeans and sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   The series of crimes began Thursday afternoon in Shreveport,
La., where the men are suspected of killing a car salesman while
test-driving a 1989 Pontiac Firebird. Police discovered the body of
Chester Howell, 56, on Thursday afternoon at a bridge on a gravel
road about 30 miles south of Shreveport. He had been shot twice in
the chest and once in the back, said Judson Rives, chief
investigator of the De Soto Parish Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Howell had worked less than two months at Morgan
Pontiac-GMC-Buick. He accompanied two men on a test drive about an
hour before his body was found.
</P>
<P>
   Howell did not make a copy of either man's driver's license
before the test drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is for the salespeople to use extreme caution and,
if they feel uncomfortable with the customer, to copy the
license,'' general manager Keith Marcotte said.
</P>
<P>
   Rives said the two men closely resembled two persons who visited
at least two other dealerships in southeast Shreveport. At Elkins
Nissan, salesman Rocky Yates did not give them a test drive because
they appeared too young.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appeared nervous and were driving what looked like a $100
set of wheels,'' Yates said. ``They said they were headed to
Daytona Beach, Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, two men carrying a pump shotgun and a
large-caliber revolver held up the Lamoni Commercial Federal Bank
in southwest Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoni Police Chief Dale Killpack chased the men into Missouri.
A fragment from a bullet fired from the Firebird hit Killpack in
the eye, and he was in fair condition Sunday at University
Hospitals in Iowa City, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   As the robbers fled south on Interstate 35 with Killpack in
pursuit, a Missouri Highway Patrol trooper overheard radio traffic
about the chase. Troopers positioned themselves on the highway in
Harrison County, but the two robbers turned onto a county road
about a mile north of the roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   The Firebird was found abandoned in a snowbank about one mile
east of the interstate near Bethany, Mo., in Harrison County.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Highway Patrol troopers searched for the men in
Harrison County. Footprints led investigators Saturday to a
roadside service business in north-central Harrison County, said
Linda Cottrell, a Highway Patrol telecommunicator in St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   There, the two men were thought to have stolen the 1981 white
Chevrolet service truck that was later recovered at the Marriott.

 PODESTA &AMP; RICCHETTI  
 KING FIGHTS BACK ONLINE  
 BIG RECYCLING JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where there is a Podesta in Washington, it seems, there is also
a Ricchetti.
</P>
<P>
   When John Podesta became the White House chief of staff on Nov.
1, he named Steve Ricchetti to be his deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Before he went to the White House, Podesta, 50, was a partner
with his older brother, Anthony Podesta, 53, in a lobbying firm
called Podesta Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it changed its name to podesta.com and bought
Ricchetti &AMP; Associates, the lobbying firm that Ricchetti, 41,
opened in 1996 after his last tour of duty at the White House. (He
had been deputy assistant to the president for legislative
affairs.)
</P>
<P>
   Ricchetti's younger brother, Jeff Ricchetti, a 38-year-old
lawyer who has specialized in health-care law, worked for Ricchetti
&AMP; Associates and now works for podesta.com.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently by coincidence, the Podesta and Ricchetti firms had
some of the same clients: MCI paid the Podesta firm $100,000 and
the Ricchetti firm $83,000 in the first half of 1998, for example.
But that was before MCI merged with Worldcom. Officials of
podesta.com said they did not know whether Worldcom would continue
with podesta.com.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of podesta.com also say they do not depend on White
House connections to draw clients. ``We are an extremely bipartisan
firm,'' said Missi Tessier, a principal at podesta.com. ``Several
of us, myself included, have at least 20 years apiece in Republican
politics. I don't want to leave the impression that this is purely
a Democrat firm.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Fear on Line &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If this had been a Stephen King page turner, a chronicle of
murderous modems and haunted floppy disks, the title might well
have been ``Nightmare on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is about real life. Specifically, King's life. He was
fed up with the misinformation being spread about him online. No,
he is not planning to retire, and no, he does not give tours of his
house on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   So he set up an official site, www.stephenking.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more than 30-odd sites,'' said Marsha De Filippo,
an assistant to King. ``You can imagine with that many, there could
be a lot of rumors going around. I have not gone to every single
site, and some of them, it's hard to tell whether they are serious
or not.''
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Season's End &UR;  &LR;   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Guy Torsilieri is ready to perform the final ritual of the
holiday season: the disposing of the Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any tree, but the 74-foot Norway spruce that stood in
Rockefeller Center from late November until last week. The one that
was topped by a 12-foot star unveiled by John Glenn after his trip
on the space shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The trunk is now in three pieces at Torsilieri's landscaping
company in Gladstone, N.J., 38 miles from Manhattan. The branches
are on another trailer on his lot. Torsilieri is preparing to strip
off the wires and bulbs and chop what is left into smaller pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it for 15 years now,'' he said, ``so I'm kind of
used to that negative feeling, that Christmas is over and it's time
to start getting ready for the next holiday. I don't get any pangs
of pain anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Rockefeller Center trees were recycled into sailboat
masts or family room floors. But since 1983, the trees have gone
through Torsilieri and have ended up at the headquarters of the
U.S. Equestrian Team, also in Gladstone. Pieces of the trunk will
be used to make the wooden jumps for training sessions for the Pan
American and Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always people up there talking about how whatever
they use it for used to be the tree at Rockefeller Center, so the
tree lives on,'' Torsilieri said. ``They're still talking about the
one we took from the nuns in the Bernardsville mountains. The nuns
came over as the horses jumped over it, and they blessed it.''

FINANCIER KEATING AND SON WILL BE RETRIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles H Keating Jr., the central figure of the 1980s savings
and loan scandal, will be retried on charges that he looted Lincoln
Savings.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors made the announcement at a hearing Monday in Los
Angeles before U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer. The case was
returned to Pfaelzer after an appellate court overturned the 1993
convictions of Keating and his son, Charles H Keating III, who also
faces retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles,
said the decision to retry Keating reflects his high-profile in a
scandal that provoked widespread outrage against Keating and
politicians who supported him. Lincoln's failure cost taxpayers a
record $3.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at the heart of that whole mess,'' said Levenson, dean
of Loy ola University law school in Los Angeles. ``So from the law
enforcement point of view, this is about a man they believe
perpetrated one of the largest frauds in American history and
continues to walk away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Neal, Keating's attorney, said it is an abuse of federal
power to retry a 75-year-old man who has already served 4{ years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would think that at some point, given the age of the
issues here and Charlie's age, they would see that fundamental
fairness would lead reasonable people to say enough is enough,''
Neal said. ``The government should give this case up.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal said Keating, who recently underwent two hip operations, is
trying to re-establish himself as a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would love to get all these issues fully behind him so he
could fully reintroduce himself to the business world,'' Neal said.
He said Keating, who last year was selling telecommunications
equipment, ``is still exploring a variety of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano, a former U.S.
attorney, said the decision to retry Keating indicates that
prosecutors are confident they can still present a strong case
against the Keatings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witnesses can disappear or die, documents can become
disorganized and assistant U.S. attorneys leave the office,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two prosecutors who took the Keatings to trial have left
federal employment. One is a law professor at UCLA and the other is
a municipal judge in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is on Keating's side,'' said Levenson. She said Keating
may benefit from a dissipation of public outrage of the early 1990s
in the wake of the savings and loan debacle.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Rep. Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, condemned
Keating as ``a financiopath of obscene proportions.'' Leach was a
member of the House Banking Committee that held televised hearings
into Lincoln's failure.
</P>
<P>
   When Pfaelzer sentenced Keating to 12 years and 7 months, she
called his crime ``staggering in its proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   But the conviction was reversed after it was discovered that
jurors knew of his conviction in a California state court and had
discussed it during his federal trial.
</P>
<P>
   The state conviction, on charges that Keating had swindled bond
investors in American Continental, Lincoln's Phoenix-based parent
company, was thrown out because of a flawed instruction to the jury
by the judge, Lance Ito.
</P>
<P>
   Ito later achieved his own national notoriety in the O.J.
Simpson murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Keating's new federal trial could be short-circuited by a plea
agreement with prosecutors. Such an agreement could take into
account the time he has already served in prison. But it would also
require Keating to do something he has always scorned: acknowledge
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and prickly as a saguaro, Keating has staunchly asserted
his innocence. He contended he was tagged as scapegoat for the
national thrift disaster by a ``vicious and vindictive group of
bureaucrats and sinister politicians hoping to cover their perfidy
and ignorance by pillorying Charlie Keating.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating, who gained national notoriety in the 1970s as a
crusader against pornography, scorned regulators as ``scum.'' He
mocked their rules to protect Lincoln's federally insured deposits
as bureaucratic meddling by the small-minded and meek.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's hearing, Pfaelzer asked prosecutors to consider
paring down the 77-count indictment that spawned a nine-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll certainly review it and see if that's possible,'' said
Jim Whalen of the Phoenix office of the FBI. Whalen led the
investigation into Keating's empire, one of the largest
white-collar probes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged that the Keatings fabricated an illusion of
prosperity by rigging phony land deals, many of them on the
outskirts of Lincoln's master-planned Estrella community west of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Keating said he made legitimate, arm's-length sales of
undeveloped land to a group of ``prime customers'' who saw the raw
land as a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors said the customers were really ``straw buyers''
who bought the land at inflated prices in return for huge loans
from Lincoln that were never repaid.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the bogus sales, the indictment charged, Lincoln
recorded $82 million in bogus profits. Then its directors used a
tax-allocation plan to ``upstream'' much of the money to American
Continental and to insiders in the form of lavish salaries and
bonuses. Many of the insiders were Keating relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1987, when federal regulators were uncovering what they
said were massive abuses at Lincoln, Mr. Keating asked five U.S.
senators to take up his cause.
</P>
<P>
   He had collected $1.3 million for the campaigns of the senators
_ Dennis DeConcini and John McCain, both of Arizona, Alan Cranston
of California, John Glenn of Ohio and Don Riegle of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The senators, who became known as the Keating Five, suffered
varying consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Cranston, who said he and Keating had formed ``a mutual aide
society,'' was censured in the Senate. DeConcini and Riegle were
criticized sharply, while McCain and Glenn received mild rebukes. &QL;

LONELY DAY FOR FISHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Informal workouts began Monday around the NBA, but
if the Los Angeles Lakers wanted to run fullcourt, they would have
had to challenge reporters to a game of five-on-five.
</P>
<P>
   Only five of 12 Lakers showed at L.A. Southwest College and the
poor attendance was cause for consternation among the dedicated
few.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the guys that are here, we do feel a letdown,'' said guard
Derek Fisher, joined by Lakers veterans Shaquille O'Neal, Eddie
Jones and Sean Rooks, rookie Tyronn Lue and free agent Rick
Brunson.
</P>
<P>
   The no-shows were Kobe Bryant and Elden Campbell, who both live
in L.A., Corie Blount, Tony Battie, Robert Horry and rookies Sam
Jacobson and Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   No one begrudged Horry's absence _ he's home in Houston
attending to his ill daughter and his wife, Keva, who is eight
months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple other guys that knew about it and should be
here,'' Fisher said. ``Shaq feels that way and we all feel that
way. Nobody's making us be here, but we're here because we're
committed to this team and we're committed to winning. That's the
way everybody should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson and Blount are arriving today from Cincinnati, where
they were working out at their alma mater. Same goes for Jacobson,
arriving today from Minnesota. Battie, acquired from Denver in
June, couldn't be reached by team officials. Both he and Bryant are
expected at practice today.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive Jerry West downplayed the absences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see most of them there (today),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who said he called most of his teammates personally,
sounded perturbed but declined to criticize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today wasn't really mandatory. . . . As long as guys are ready
on the 18th (for training camp), I don't have a problem,'' O'Neal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps another round of calls?
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke once. I don't need to speak twice,'' he said. ``From
now on, I'm speaking once and the second time I'm swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Shape of things: Fisher, Lue and Jones, all regulars at UCLA
pickup games during the lockout, all figured to be in good shape.
But O'Neal was a concern for the team.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up Monday weighing, according to O'Neal, about 335
pounds. That's 17 pounds over his lowest playing weight last season
but only five to 10 pounds above his typical playing weight.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``I'm good enough to get 26-27 (points) and
10-11 (rebounds). But nothing is going to get me in shape like
playing and running and bumping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille obviously is someone we're always concerned about,
and he looks a lot better than I thought he would,'' said trainer
Gary Vitti, who along with strength coach Jim Cotta was the only
team official allowed at the workout. ``It's hard for a big guy to
stay in shape . . . because he doesn't have anybody big enough to
play against.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Dribbles: Training camps might not open until Jan. 19, a day
later than projected, while NBA and union attorneys complete the
new labor agreement. The Lakers are considering sites in Santa
Barbara, Irvine and San Diego. . . . The Lakers will play both of
their exhibition games against the Clippers, one at the Forum and
the other at the Sports Arena. Dates have not been set. . . .
Disgruntled Charles Oakley, traded from New York to Toronto in
June, opened practice saying, ``Tell the Lakers I'm ready.'' The
Lakers are in the market for a power forward, but sources say a
deal for Oakley is highly unlikely.
