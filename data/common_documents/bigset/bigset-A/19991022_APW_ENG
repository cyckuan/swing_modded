<HEADLINE> NY Rejects World Series Statue Bet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The World Series statue bet envisioned by  
Georgia's governor and Atlanta's mayor fell apart Friday when New 
York's governor refused to go along. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Roy Barnes and Mayor Bill Campbell offered to put a New  
York Yankees cap and jersey on the statue of former President Jimmy 
Carter at the Georgia Capitol the day after any World Series game 
won by the Yankees. In return, they wanted New York to put an 
Atlanta Braves cap and jersey on Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's 
statue outside New York City's Plaza Hotel for every game won by 
the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McKeon, a spokesman for New York Gov. George Pataki,  
called the idea ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a little surprised that Georgia didn't care about  
disrespecting a former president,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon left open the way for a more lighthearted bet along the  
lines of the ribs and Italian ices Pataki wagered against Barnes' 
peanuts and grits during the National League Championship Series, 
when the Braves defeated the New York Mets 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love to work out a bet because we clearly believe the  
Yankees are going to crush the Braves,'' McKeon said.

<HEADLINE> Time May Be Running Out for Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The signs of age are starting to show.  
</P>
<P>
	John Smoltz is taking a daily pill to treat his hair loss. Greg  
Maddux sports a bit more of a paunch. And there are crow's feet 
crinkling at the corners of Tom Glavine's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	These Atlanta Braves know they might be running out of time.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to wonder how many more chances you're going to  
get,'' Glavine said Friday. ``The law of averages are starting to 
go against you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves get one more opportunity to make up for lost time,  
starting Saturday night in the World Series against the defending 
champion New York Yankees. Glavine will oppose Orlando ``El Duque'' 
Hernandez in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be our fifth trip,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said.  
``We'd like to have a couple out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta and the Dodgers of the 1950s are the only NL teams to  
make five Series appearances in a decade. But to many, the 
perception of the Braves is more defined by their October failures 
-- some call them the Buffalo Bills of baseball -- than by their 
eight straight playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	There's the image of Lonnie Smith getting lost on the bases and  
Atlanta losing 1-0 in 10 innings to Jack Morris in Game 7 in 1991. 
Or old Dave Winfield driving home the winning run against them in 
1992. Or Mark Wohlers serving up Jim Leyritz's home run in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	To Yankees manager Joe Torre, that's not fair.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby, obviously, so much is made -- and you look at (John)  
Elway and Jim Kelly -- he keeps getting criticized every year just 
because he only won one World Series,'' he said. ``That's not the 
easiest thing in the world to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Torre and the Yankees can talk with confidence.  
They're trying to win their third Series title in four year and 
become baseball's first repeat champion since Toronto in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's admit it -- you work for George Steinbrenner, just  
getting to postseason play is not enough,'' Torre said. ``He's 
promised the people of New York a lot more than that. And 
fortunately, we've been able to deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, however, was upset with commissioner Bud Selig on  
the eve of Game 1. At issue was backup infielder Luis Sojo, whose 
father died Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had sought permission to remove Sojo, projected as a  
late defensive replacement for second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, from 
the roster for the first two games and then add him for the rest of 
the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball rules do not permit any roster changes once a  
postseason round has started. Steinbrenner said Selig rejected the 
request made by Yankees general manager Brian Cashman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This seems like a rather harsh ruling as Luis will be  
accompanying the body of his father, Ambrosio, back home to 
Venezuela,'' Steinbrenner said in a statement. ``We feel very 
strongly this young man's place at this time is with his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Sojo will remain on the roster, though it's unlikely he  
will be available until Game 3 Tuesday night in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine and Maddux, both 33, will start the first two games for  
Atlanta. The 32-year-old Smoltz will pitch Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	They're hoping to duplicate the Yankees' recent success. Not so  
that they can capture the title of Team of the Decade, but in order 
to earn that elusive second ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much that we have to win to validate anything for  
anybody. I'm sitting here as a player and I'm realistic about the 
fact that we had an awful lot of chances,'' Glavine said. ``I mean, 
we're disappointed that we've had opportunities to win more Series 
and we've won only one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that my career is not going to last forever. I know  
this team's not going to stay together forever,'' he said. ``You 
want to start taking advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves were in great position to do it in 1996 after winning  
the first two games at Yankee Stadium. But New York came back to 
sweep the next three at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium on the way to 
a six-game victory. 
</P>
<P>
	A sellout crowd is expected at Turner Field for the opener. In  
fact, the team with the home-field advantage has won every World 
Series after 1984 except one -- in 1992, Toronto beat the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine takes a 10-11 career postseason record into Game 1. In  
July, he pitched the Braves' first game after the All-Star break 
and beat Roger Clemens at Yankee Stadium 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, MVP of the AL Championship Series against Boston, is  
4-0 with an 0.97 ERA in five postseason starts. The high-kicking 
Cuban with the unusual deliveries has not confused Atlanta, though, 
allowing nine earned runs in 8 1-3 innings in two interleague 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Glavine's win at Yankee Stadium in July, Hernandez  
served up a career-high four home runs in 4 2-3 innings, including 
two by Ryan Klesko and shots by Andruw Jones and Chipper Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make our best effort to make sure they don't  
hit us this time,'' Hernandez said through an interpreter. ``What 
I'm going to do, I'm not going to tell you guys right now.''

<HEADLINE> Racism Alleged at Ford in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. chief executive Jac Nasser plans to  
meet Saturday with British union leaders to try to resolve 
complaints of racist treatment and bullying of minority workers at 
Ford's biggest car plant in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser agreed to meet in London with Bill Morris, head of the  
Transport and General Workers Union, and other union officials, 
Ford spokeswoman Anne-Marie Chatterton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides hope to defuse tensions at the company's factory  
in Dagenham in east London, where at least 800 employees walked off 
their jobs earlier this month to protest alleged abuses by some 
plant foremen. 
</P>
<P>
	The spontaneous, one-day walkout halted production of Ford  
Fiesta models bound for sale in Europe, Latin America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser's personal involvement underscores the gravity of the  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're taking this seriously,'' Chatterton said,  
adding that Ford has a policy of ``zero tolerance'' toward racist 
behavior at the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said the walkout was sparked by a series of  
incidents. An Asian worker claimed last month that he had been 
subjected to racist abuse and Ku Klux Klan graffiti. Later, a white 
foreman allegedly pushed an Asian shop steward. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials asked the government's Commission for Racial  
Equality to launch a formal investigation into what the TGW 
official called a culture of racism at the plant. The TGW 
represents more than half of the plant's 4,500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford takes matters of equal opportunities extremely seriously,  
and it is our aim to ensure a workplace that is fair and free from 
discrimination and harassment of any kind,'' said Nick Scheele, 
president of Ford's European operations, soon after the strike 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasser's meetings are not expected to extend past Saturday,  
Chatterton said.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Bigamist Convicted of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Ala. (AP) -- A jury recommended the death penalty Friday  
for a 30-year-old bigamist convicted of talking one of her three 
husbands into shooting another. 
</P>
<P>
	Shonda Nichole Johnson of Jasper was convicted of capital murder  
Thursday in the 1997 death of Randy McCullar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson was married to McCullar at the time -- and to Timothy  
Richards, who police say pulled the trigger, and to Bill McIntyre, 
who police say wasn't involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Richards testified during the trial that he shot McCullar in the  
back of the head as he changed a tire in a church parking lot, but 
he said his wife made him do it so she could be cleared of a bigamy 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge was initiated by McCullar after Ms. Johnson married  
McIntyre while she was still married to him. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors and trial testimony, Richards slashed  
the tires of McCullar's car, and Richards and Ms. Johnson followed 
him when he drove away. When McCullar pulled over to check the 
tire, Ms. Johnson told him to shoot, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She yelled, 'Do it! Do it! Do it!,''' he testified.  
</P>
<P>
	Richards pleaded guilty to murder to avoid a possible death  
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Steve Jones argued that Richards acted alone  
and killed McCullar because Ms. Johnson told him McCullar had raped 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have is somebody who wanted Randy McCullar dead and  
she finally found somebody weak-minded enough to do it,'' said 
prosecutor Bill Adair. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge James C. Brotherton could follow the jury's  
recommendation or sentence Ms. Johnson to life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Lawyers Appeal Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet launched an  
appeal today of a magistrate's ruling that the former Chilean 
dictator should be extradited to Spain to face charges of torture. 
</P>
<P>
	The formal notice that Pinochet would challenge the decision was  
submitted to the High Court on the final day of the 15-day window 
for filing. The court now must set a date to hear the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Caplan, Pinochet's lead lawyer, would not say on what  
grounds the 83-year-old general was seeking to overturn the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pinochet's attorneys are expected to argue that it would be  
``unjust or oppressive'' to send Pinochet to Spain. They also might 
claim that the Spanish case was brought in bad faith and is 
politically motivated, or that too much time elapsed between the 
acts alleged and Pinochet's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon has accused Pinochet of  
masterminding a campaign of terror against political opponents 
during his 17-year regime in Chile. He has been detained in Britain 
since Oct. 16, 1998, when he was arrested while recovering from 
spinal surgery at a London hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean government report has acknowledged that  
3,197 people died or disappeared after Pinochet toppled Chile's 
elected Marxist president Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet relinquished power in 1990 and became a senator for  
life. He is protected from prosecution at home by an amnesty law he 
helped pass. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long round of legal battles, the case finally proceeded  
to a formal extradition hearing last month in which Deputy Chief 
Magistrate Ronald Bartle ruled that Spain's 34 charges of torture 
and a single allegation of conspiracy to torture constituted 
extraditable crimes and that, even though none of the alleged 
victims were Spanish, Spain had authority to try the general. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to appeal Bartle's ruling could mean Pinochet will  
spend many more months, if not years, fighting extradition in the 
British courts. 
</P>
<P>
	If he loses this appeal, he could be allowed to lodge a  
challenge in Britain's highest court of appeals, the House of 
Lords. If that fails and all his legal options are exhausted, the 
case would return for a final ruling to Home Secretary Jack Straw, 
who in addition to legal issues could consider political and 
humanitarian concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's doctor has disclosed that the general suffered two  
small strokes this fall and continues to be plagued by dizziness 
and short-term memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain said this week that if Straw ruled that Pinochet could  
return to Chile, the Spanish courts would not appeal because they 
would recognize it as a political, not a judicial, ruling. If Straw 
rules against Pinochet, he again could appeal.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bonds Edge Higher / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term Treasury bonds edged higher but  
shorter-term government securities ended largely unchanged Friday 
after the Federal Reserve announced a measure to soothe concerns 
over the Year 2000 computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/8 point,  
or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, slipped to 6.34 percent from 6.35 percent late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve said it would expand the types of collateral  
it exchanges for loans to commercial banks, in an effort to 
mitigate any possible disruptions in supply from Y2K computer 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was mostly symbolic, since healthy banks usually don't  
resort to directly borrowing money from the 12 regional Fed 
branches. The Fed has already taken more important steps to head 
off cash shortages that some fear might be seen nearer the 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market optimism created by the move helped insulate  
fixed-income securities against a flight of capital into a rallying 
stock market Friday. Stocks rose sharply, led by financial shares, 
capping a comeback this week that wiped out much of last week's 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged to down 1/32 point, and intermediate maturities were 
unchanged, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.05 percent as the  
discount fell 0.05 percentage point to 4.92 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.26 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 percentage 
point to 5.05 percent. One-year yields were 5.47 percent as the 
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 5.18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.06 from 5.25 percent on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 point to 108 17/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 6.14 percent from 6.13 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rudd Wants Pop Secret Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The emotions of closing down his own  
team haven't hit Ricky Rudd, yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, Rudd's focus remains on trying to continue the  
much-publicized string of 16 consecutive years with at least one 
Winston Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into Sunday's Pop Secret Popcorn 400 at North Carolina  
Speedway, Rudd, who is shutting down the 6-year-old Rudd 
Performance Racing team to take a ride next season with Robert 
Yates, has four more chances to get to victory lane as a 
driver-owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just know to me it is another race that we are going to try  
to win,'' Rudd said. ``Even though our team and ownership days are 
winding down, my biggest thoughts are on the need to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, as an owner, I'd like to go out with the win streak from  
Day One until the last day. There's not many owners that can say 
they won a race every season. I don't think the emotions of the 
thing will hit until I'm sitting in the starting lineup for the 
last race in Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The closest the 43-year-old Rudd has come to a win this season  
is a third-place finish on Aug. 28 in Bristol, Tenn. In fact, that 
has been his only top-five so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been a dominating car, but we've been a top-five,  
top-10 car on occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the problems Rudd has faced as an owner is constant  
personnel changes, including crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McSwain came on as his crew chief midway through the  
season and has done well enough that Yates decided to bring him 
with Rudd next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael came in and basically inherited a lot of baggage with  
cars that we had,'' Rudd said. ``We were not up-to-date with the 
way the cars were built, so he had to be in a rebuilding mode right 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since we first started getting his cars in the system,  
we've run a lot better. We still don't seem to have the finishing 
results that we should be getting. Some races have slipped away 
from us. But I think there's been real improvement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talking about next season, when he will become a teammate of  
current Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett, gets Rudd excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm kind of looking forward to it winding down,''  
he said. ``Ever since July, when it was announced that Tid wouldn't 
be back (as his team sponsor), it has been a pretty hectic pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're in the shutting-down phase and it's not that simple  
to shut a business down. There's a lot of extra hours that we've 
been putting in. It's as detail-oriented and time-consuming as it 
is to start a business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current plans call for Rudd to auction off his race property  
during Thanksgiving week, although he said there are still three 
people interested in buying the entire operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they can come up with the money before the auction, then we  
can work something out. But I'm looking forward to closing this 
chapter and starting a new one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Rudd, who picked up one of his 20 career wins here in  
the fall of 1996, likes the 1.017-mile Rockingham oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those good percentage tracks you look forward to  
going to because you usually know you are going to do something 
good here,'' Rudd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Practice and qualifying were scheduled to begin today.

<HEADLINE> Bush-Bashing Biographer Had Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The biographer who accused GOP presidential  
front-runner George W. Bush of burying a cocaine arrest apparently 
had a secret of his own: a 1988 conviction for plotting to murder a 
co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure about James Howard Hatfield prompted his  
publisher on Thursday to suspend sales, shipment and promotion of 
the new book, ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of an 
American President.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield was still on parole from a 15-year prison term while  
writing his book on the Texas governor, and also did time for 
embezzlement, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Hatfield through his publisher, St. Martin's  
Press, were unsuccessful. The publisher did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign has its legal staff reviewing the matter for  
possible libel implications, spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield alleged that Bush was arrested in 1972 for cocaine  
possession but did only community service after his father, former 
President Bush, intervened. The arrest record was later expunged at 
the request of the elder Bush, the book alleged. Hatfield cited 
three anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious (the book) was not checked,'' Ms. Hughes said  
Friday. The Texas governor previously ripped the book as ``science 
fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book was due out in January 2000 but was released early  
after the manuscript arrived with the cocaine story. The publisher 
said 70,000 copies are already in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com said they will keep selling  
the book. It was already in Amazon's top 50 best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News first reported Hatfield's criminal  
background on Thursday. Hatfield, 41, told the newspaper it was a 
case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, a Dallas lawyer, Norman L. ``Happy'' Nelson Jr.,  
said that the author and the convict are one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who knew Hatfield for about nine years before the 1988  
conviction, said he was stunned to see Hatfield's picture in the 
newspaper as the Bush biographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture in the paper was the picture of the bomber,''  
Nelson said. ``That was him. I quite frankly didn't like him 
denying that he had a record, when I knew he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Castlebury, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal  
Justice, confirmed that a James Howard Hatfield was arrested in 
1987 for solicitation of murder -- hiring a hit man to plant a bomb 
under a co-worker's car. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was found guilty, Hatfield went to prison in 1988 and  
spent the next five years there. Upon his release, Hatfield was 
turned over to federal authorities; he wound up doing a short 
stretch in El Reno, Okla., for embezzling nearly $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While prison authorities would not provide details, Nelson said  
that Hatfield had tried to kill a co-worker when she suspected him 
of embezzling federal Housing and Urban Development funds. The 
woman later testified against Hatfield in the embezzlement case, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb planted beneath the co-worker's car only partially  
detonated, and she escaped serious injury, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield, who moved to Arkansas with the approval of Texas  
authorities, remains on parole through April 15, 2003, Castlebury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his official biography, Hatfield was ``a syndicated  
columnist, free-lance Texas journalist and frequent contributor to 
several Lone Star State newspapers and magazines.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Glavine Pitching Game 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Tom Glavine was hardly overwhelmed by the honor  
of pitching Game 1 in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time Cy Young winner struggled much of the season for  
the Atlanta Braves and finished with his highest ERA (4.12) since 
1990. But he will be on the mound Saturday night against the New 
York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like I'm the ace or anything,'' Glavine said. ``It  
just happens to be my turn to pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox did not want Glavine to have an 11-day layoff  
between starts, so he picked the left-hander to go against New 
York's Orlando Hernandez in the opener at Turner Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine (14-11) is followed in the Braves' rotation by Greg  
Maddux (19-9), who worked Game 1 for the Braves in the division 
series and the NL Championship Series. Kevin Millwood (18-7) and 
John Smoltz (11-8) will take the mound after the series shifts to 
Yankee Stadium next week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first two rounds of the playoffs, Atlanta used a rotation  
that began with Maddux, followed by Millwood, Glavine and Smoltz. 
</P>
<P>
	If Cox stuck with that alignment for the World Series, Glavine  
would have gone 11 days between starts. He last worked a week ago, 
pitching seven scoreless innings to beat the New York Mets in Game 
3 of the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine might have pitched Game 2 Sunday night, but the  
left-hander wouldn't have been available for Game 5 in New York -- 
assuming, of course, the best-of-7 series lasts that long. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefties tend to have an advantage at Yankee Stadium because the  
power of right-handed hitters is negated by cavernous left field, 
where it takes a 399-foot shot to clear the wall in the power 
alley. Left-handed hitters, on the other hand, can take advantage 
of the short, 314-foot porch in right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's his turn to pitch, No. 1,'' Cox said, explaining his  
decision to use Glavine. ``And this ensures he will pitch in New 
York, where left-handers are supposed to have a slight edge. I 
didn't do it for any other reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other ramifications of Atlanta's rotation: Smoltz will be  
available for relief duty in the opener, while Millwood, the team's 
most consistent starter, pitches Game 7 if the series goes the 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me feel good that our management and our team has  
that amount of confidence in me,'' Millwood said. ``Even if it does 
go that far, we'll have a lot of people ready for that game. I'll 
just go first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine takes the same sort of mentality into the opener,  
knowing his previous postseason starts were just as crucial even 
though he didn't pitch until Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In the division series, Glavine allowed only two runs in six  
innings against Houston, and the Braves went on to a decisive 5-3 
victory in 12 innings. He followed with a strong performance 
against the Mets, a 1-0 victory that gave the Braves a commanding 
3-0 advantage in the NLCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine has pitched 12 straight scoreless innings this  
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, I fully expected to pitch Game 3,'' Glavine  
said. ``I thought Bobby would just roll it over and I would pitch 
the first game on the road like I did against the Mets and 
Astros.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees don't have a 30-homer man in their lineup, but they  
do have two players -- Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams -- who hit 
above .340, as well as four 100-RBI producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their lineup is full of patient hitters with some power,''  
Glavine said. ``If you have a bunch of 50-homer guys, that means 
they're free swingers and probably easier to strike out. These guys 
don't strike out. They put the ball in play and make you work 
harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta's four previous Series appearances this decade,  
Glavine pitched the opener once. He threw a complete-game 
four-hitter in 1992 for a 3-1 victory over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The most memorable Series performance came three years later,  
when he allowed only one hit in eight shutout innings against 
Cleveland in Game 6. The 1-0 victory gave the Braves their only 
championship of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine is 4-3 with a 1.75 ERA in seven Series starts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be pitching Game 1,'' he said. ``Other than  
that, it's just one game.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Keeps 'NYPD Blue' on Tuesdays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``NYPD Blue'' producer Steven Bochco won his war  
of wills with ABC on Friday. The network announced it was keeping 
the Emmy-winning police drama in the Tuesday time slot it has 
occupied since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's going to have to wait: ``NYPD Blue'' doesn't return for  
its new season until Jan. 11, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said it would move ``Once and Again,'' the new drama  
that has been airing Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET, to Mondays at 10 p.m. 
in January, once the pro football season is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ... believe this scheduling decision allows us the  
opportunity to maximize the potential of both series,'' said Stu 
Bloomberg, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Television Group. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's deliberations over its schedule had turned into a public  
relations disaster when a furious Bochco denounced the network for 
thinking of moving his show. He had suggested that ABC wanted to 
give ``Once and Again'' the Tuesday time slot for financial reasons 
because it was produced by a company within the Walt Disney Co., 
which owns ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can certainly live with this compromise,'' Bochco said on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC had set up the conflict by premiering ``Once and Again,'' a  
drama about two divorced parents, in the ``NYPD Blue'' time slot in 
September and not saying where it would go when ``NYPD Blue'' was 
ready to return in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once and Again,'' starring Sela Ward, started strong in the  
ratings but has faded in its time slot behind ``Judging Amy,'' 
CBS's new hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco said he's concerned about ABC losing more viewers to CBS  
Tuesday nights before ``NYPD Blue'' can return in January. But he 
said it will be an advantage for his show to air 22 new episodes in 
a row early next year without having to pause for reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once and Again'' will premiere in its new time slot on Jan.  
24. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise isn't a long-term solution. ABC will have to  
decide again next fall what to do with ``Once and Again,'' if it is 
renewed for a second season, when ``Monday Night Football'' 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a problem if we get picked up for an eighth  
season,'' Bochco said. ``If we do well from January through May in 
our time slot, there's no downside for us. If they don't pick us 
up, someone else will.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Rejects Primary Date Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iowa and New Hampshire will lead off the  
Democratic presidential selection process with little competition 
after a panel refused to allow four other states to move their 
contests into February behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But the special status of Iowa and New Hampshire is likely to  
come under increasing fire when the Democratic Party starts 
wrestling with rules for the 2004 elections because of building 
resentment from other states. 
</P>
<P>
	A rules panel of the Democratic National Committee on Friday  
denied requests from Arizona, Michigan, South Carolina and 
Washington state to move their presidential primaries or caucuses 
into February. They sought the change to save money and stay 
competitive with state Republican parties that have moved events 
into February. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Democratic Party allows only Iowa and New Hampshire to  
hold caucuses or primaries before March 7 without penalty. The 
Republican National Committee does not set such limits, and state 
Republicans have taken advantage of the freedom by moving several 
other state events into February. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the panel decided to allow Iowa to move its leadoff  
caucuses to Jan. 24 and New Hampshire to move its 
first-in-the-nation primary to Feb. 1. But it decided Friday to 
hold the line there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're continuing the fight that the Democratic Party has been  
carrying out for the last decade to keep this primary process from 
expanding into a permanent election,'' said Jim Roosevelt, 
co-chairman of the rules panel. 
</P>
<P>
	States have been jockeying for earlier positions on the calendar  
-- and increased influence -- ever since California decided earlier 
this year to move up to March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, South Carolina's Democratic primary will be March  
9, and Arizona and Michigan will hold their primaries March 11. 
Washington state had requested a Feb. 29 primary and a March 7 
caucus, but state party officials say their plans are ``up in the 
air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC plans to begin examining the 2004 primary process at a  
Nov. 20 hearing. The RNC also is looking into the process, and the 
nation's secretaries of state are lobbying for a system of rotating 
regional primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., complained at the meeting that Iowa  
and New Hampshire are ``in a monopoly position.'' He said many 
states' Democrats are at a disadvantage ``all because of this 
cockamamie privilege for two states.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Orders Vail To Restore Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday  
ordered Vail Resorts to immediately begin efforts to restore a 
half-acre of wetlands illegally filled during construction of a 
dirt logging road. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just the latest episode in Vail Resorts' decades-long  
effort to complete a $14 million expansion project. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental activists have set fires at the resort and  
recently lost a legal challenge over the expansion project's affect 
on wildlife, specifically the habitat of the lynx. 
</P>
<P>
	The logging road, built last fall to move heavy equipment and  
remove trees from the ski resort's new 885-acre area, was 
discovered earlier this year by U.S. Forest Service employees. 
Forest Service officials said it was causing excess sediment to 
flow into a water source below, and they ordered it closed in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army Corps of Engineers determined the road had violated the  
federal Clean Water Act. If the EPA agrees, it could fine Vail up 
to $27,500 a day. In 1996, Telluride ski area was fined $1.1 
million for destroying 17 acres of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA on Friday ordered Vail Resorts to ``take action now'' to  
stabilize and winterize the road to protect the wetlands from 
further damage. The order requires the road remained closed and 
sets an August 31 deadline to complete restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail Resorts spokesman Porter Wharton III said recently that  
construction of the road over the wetlands was an honest mistake. 
The road was realigned to miss one wetlands parcel and 
inadvertently affected another, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sentenced Woman Never Served Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A 74-year-old woman sentenced to prison in  
1991 hasn't served her sentence because no one told her what to do 
or where to report after her appeal was denied seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A bureaucratic oversight came to light last month. Doris Preston  
was scheduled to begin serving her sentence today, though her 
attorneys have appealed and may ask the governor to commute her 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got word from anybody at all about where to go, but I  
was waiting and willing to serve my time,'' Mrs. Preston said. ``It 
never occurred to me that I was supposed to go turn myself in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, Carol Wright, said: ``She is looking at basically  
a death sentence if she is sent to prison at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Preston was convicted of aggravated arson in 1991 and  
sentenced to a five- to 25-year prison term. She was found guilty 
of starting a fire in her home that killed her 70-year-old husband, 
Andrew Preston. 
</P>
<P>
	She was released on bail while her appeal was pending. An  
appeals court upheld her conviction and sentence in December 1991, 
and the Ohio Supreme Court refused to hear the case in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Corrections Department last month discovered that  
there was no record of Mrs. Preston since her appeal and notified 
the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors then discovered Mrs. Preston had not served her  
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The statutes, the case law, nobody really says whose job it is  
to follow up on this once the appeals are denied,'' said Joyce 
Anderson, assistant county prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher court generally notifies the prosecutor's office,  
which files a motion to enforce the prison sentence, Anderson said. 
She couldn't say if they received notification that Mrs. Preston's 
appeals had been denied. 
</P>
<P>
	In the future, when decisions are handed back from the Supreme  
Court, the prosecutor's office will check to make sure that those 
who should be locked up are in custody, Anderson said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Frees Convicted Child Abuser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- One emotional chapter of the 15-year  
Fells Acres child abuse case has ended with a judge ruling that 
Cheryl Amirault LeFave does not have to return to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Her conviction stands on child-abuse charges from one of the  
most lurid mass child-molestation cases of the 1980s, but 
Thursday's decision by Judge Paul Chernoff means she finally is 
free of the specter of court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as if it's the beginning of my life all over again,''  
Ms. LeFave, 41, said in an interview at her lawyer's office. ``But 
I'm still an innocent woman convicted of a crime. There are still 
some corrections to be made. I'm not the person they claimed me to 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave already had served eight years of an eight- to  
20-year sentence. Chernoff allowed the time served to stand after 
prosecutors did not oppose a motion to reduce her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave had been freed in 1995 when a judge overturned the  
convictions of her and her late mother, Violet Amirault. In August, 
Ms. LeFave's conviction was reinstated by the state's highest 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women along with Ms. LeFave's brother, Gerald Amirault,  
were convicted of sexually assaulting young children at their day 
care center in Malden, the Fells Acres Day School. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amiraults have insisted they are innocent. They say they are  
the victims of a sex abuse hysteria that swept the country in the 
1980s, and that prosecutors relied on the questionable testimony of 
child witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In agreeing to the sentence reduction, prosecutor Lynn Rooney  
said Ms. LeFave cannot contact the victims or their families, can 
have no unsupervised contact with children, and that she must agree 
not to profit as a result of her crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave also agreed to two other, unenforceable provisions  
termed a ``gentlemen's agreement'' by District Attorney Martha 
Coakley -- she cannot pursue any further legal appeals of her case, 
and she cannot speak before television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Violet Amirault died two years ago and Gerald Amirault is still  
in prison, having lost his appeal requests. He is serving a 30- to 
40-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there were about 40 victims between the ages of  
2 and 4. Coakley has long maintained that the children told the 
truth when they described being tied to trees, sexually penetrated 
with knives and tortured by a ``bad clown'' in a ``secret room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No corroborating physical evidence and no testimony from a  
teacher or visitor at the school supported the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Other high-profile abuse cases that surfaced in the 1980s and  
'90s have fallen apart, including the McMartin Preschool case in 
California, the Little Rascals case in North Carolina and the 
Margaret Kelly Michaels case in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Warrick Gets OK To Play vs. Clemson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick avoided jail time on a  
theft charge and will be on the field Saturday when Florida State 
tries to give Bobby Bowden his 300th coaching victory against his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden called the return of his star receiver ``a miracle from  
above.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick pleaded guilty Friday to misdemeanor petty theft in  
connection with a department store scam last month. The school's 
president would not have allowed him to play if jail time were part 
of the plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, a Heisman Trophy contender who missed the last two  
games, flew to South Carolina with his teammates Friday and did not 
attend the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	His top-ranked Seminoles play a Clemson team coached by Bowden's  
son, Tommy Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate the support shown me through this,'' Warrick said  
in an apologetic statement released by the school. ``I am glad to 
get the chance to play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Crusoe approved a deal agreed on by Warrick's lawyer  
and the state attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, a former teammate and a store clerk were charged with  
felony grand theft when the two players bought more than $400 worth 
of designer clothes Sept. 29 at a Dillard's department store for 
$21.40. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mean to diminish what he did, but folks it was a  
discount,'' Warrick's lawyer, John Kenny, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Warrick will serve one year probation,  
donate the clothes to the Children's Home Society, pay $579 
restitution, $295 in court costs, have no contact with Dillard's 
and spend 30 days on a work program where he will probably clean 
trash from city streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State president Sandy D'Alemberte had been at odds with  
Bowden and athletic director Dave Hart Jr. on their interpretation 
of the school's policy for disciplining athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the jail or prison time behind someone before they  
play,'' D'Alemberte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's agreement cleared the way for Warrick to play.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has paid the consequences for his mistake and then some,''  
Hart said. ``It's time to move past it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny called the settlement fair for his client, the state, the  
school and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not wearing stripes, he's not in jail, and that's a  
significant determining factor for the university,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Dillard's clerk, Rachel Myrtil, pleaded no contest  
Thursday to grand theft and was sentenced to two years' probation, 
10 days on a county work program, ordered to pay $308 in court 
costs and stay out of Dillard's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Laveranues Coles, who paid for the clothes, was kicked off the  
Florida State team. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Kenny reached an agreement to reduce the  
charge to a misdemeanor with the state attorney, but that would 
have required the player to spend 30 days in jail at the end of the 
semester. D'Alemberte would not accept that deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick has caught 36 passes for 508 yards and four touchdowns  
in five games. He has also run for two touchdowns, scored on a punt 
return and passed for a TD. 
</P>
<P>
	The game against Clemson marks the first father-son coaching  
matchup in Division I-A history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would just like to apologize again to my family, the coaches  
and my teammates for making the mistake I did. ... I am going to 
try and focus on the game,'' Warrick said.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Falls Slightly / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen today after the  
release of a Japanese report showing the economy is improving. The 
key Tokyo stock index edged downward. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 105.44 yen late today in Tokyo, down  
0.68 yen from 106.12 yen Thursday in Tokyo and also below its level 
of 105.86 yen in New York late Thursday. During the day, it ranged 
from 105.25 yen to 106.28 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 9.47 points,  
or 0.05 percent, to finish at 17438.80. On Thursday, the average 
closed down 86.44 points, or 0.49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher early in the  
session but later moved lower after the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry released its latest report on business activity 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that Japan's all industry activity index rose a  
healthy 1.2 percent in August from July. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighing on the dollar were continuing worries over the  
direction of the U.S. economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell  
94.67 points to 10,297.69, hurt by a pessimistic profit outlook 
from International Business Machines Corp. late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 114.00 yen, down  
from 114.36 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that France's Renault SA was selling euros for yen in a  
bid to increase its stake in Japan's Nissan Motor Co., in which it 
already owns a controlling 37 percent stake, helped pushed down 
both the euro as well as the dollar against the yen, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices in Tokyo initially rebounded  
moderately in light trading but later lost those gains. Some 
analysts were pessimistic about the market putting on any more 
gains this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has done its work for the year, it's marking  
time,'' said Chuck Lambert, market analyst at Jardine Fleming 
Securities. He said there could be profit-taking over the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent falls in U.S. share prices have had a negative  
psychological impact in Japan, although Tokyo officials deny any 
impact on the country's economic fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 9.99 points, or 0.66 percent, to 1,513.93. The 
TOPIX closed down 3.37 points, or 0.22 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section totaled about 564 million shares,  
down from 596 million shares Thursday. Retreating issues 
outnumbered advancers 717 to 488, while 138 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8950 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8700 percent. Its 
price fell 0.21 point to 99.19.

<HEADLINE> BC Hasn't Beaten Miami Since Flutie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The tapes of Doug Flutie's 48-yard desperation  
touchdown pass are getting grainy with age now. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been 15 years since the ``Hail Flutie'' gave Boston College  
its last win over Miami, and Saturday is as good a time as any for 
the Eagles to reverse their nine-game losing streak against the 
Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College (5-1, 2-1 Big East) won its first four games,  
then took a 14-0 lead against Temple two weeks ago before giving up 
24 consecutive points. The Eagles bounced back with a win over 
Pittsburgh last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (2-3, 0-0) is riding a three-game losing streak, but is  
still ranked No. 23. The Eagles hope to continue the Hurricanes' 
losing streak on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the hard part of the schedule is over now,'' BC coach  
Tom O'Brien said, even though his upcoming schedule includes 
Syracuse, West Virginia, Notre Dame and Virginia Tech. ``To take 
this young football team and go through the expectations that were 
put upon them -- everybody was talking 6-0, 5-1 -- to put that upon 
them was tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we enter a phase where nobody gives them a chance to do  
anything,'' O'Brien said. ``We've got everything to gain and 
nothing to lose. We can relax and play football. Mentally, it will 
be a much better situation for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami beat Ohio State and Florida A&AMP;M before losing to three  
consecutive ranked teams, including No. 1 Florida State. Last 
week's game was supposed to be a streak-stopper, against Temple, 
but it was postponed until Dec. 4 because of Hurricane Irene. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The players) are getting edgy to play,'' coach Butch Davis  
said. ``It seems like all we've done is practice the last 12 weeks. 
We just need to go play a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes have not won since Labor Day weekend, a span of  
more than six weeks -- their longest midseason winless stretch since 
1970. But they've beaten BC nine consecutive times, and 17 out of 
20 in all. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time they met in Chestnut Hill, in 1997, the Hurricanes  
needed two overtimes to take a 45-44 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``In due time, we're going to get our win,'' wide receiver  
Santana Moss said. ``And I think it will be this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although they've yet to play their first Big East game, Miami  
could catapult itself into the Big East race with a victory. Only 
No. 4 Virginia Tech is left unbeaten in the conference, and the 
teams will play Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like two seasons,'' Davis said. ``We had five  
non-conference games, and those are over with. Now we've got to 
turn our attention to seven consecutive conference games and look 
at this as a fresh start. We're 0-0, and we'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 187.43 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, extending Thursday's  
late rebound from a steep selloff sparked by a profit warning from 
IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	With an hour remaining in Wall Street trading, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 187.43 at 10,485.13, erasing Thursday's 
94-point decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also had sizable gains. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 23.44 at 1,307.05, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 39.83 at 2,841.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks led the advance amid news that Republicans and  
Democrats had settled a dispute on bank lending rules that 
threatened to derail major legislation overhauling the financial 
services laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the legislation would make it easier for banks,  
brokerage firms and insurance companies to merge and sell each 
other's products. Among the Dow 30, American Express rose 4 1/8 to 
149, J.P. Morgan rose 7 3/8 to 124 9/16 and Citigroup rose 1 7/8 to 48

</P>
<P>
	With no major economic reports to steer the market, investors  
were focusing on the continuing flood of company reports on the 
just-ended third-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market has had two major worries: short-term interest  
rates and earnings,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at 
Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``This week, we put interest rates behind us a bit 
so that would could focus on earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Gillette slid 2 1/4 to 35 5/8 following a report late  
Thursday that met most profit forecasts but warned of weak 
fourth-quarter sales and earnings due to inventory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow closed with a loss of 94.67 after  
recovering from a 213-point slide. The broad market also rallied 
late in the day, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite 
turning higher despite the discouraging news from IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, IBM warned that customers are postponing  
purchases of network and database machines, fearful that complex 
system upgrades will make them more vulnerable to the Year 2000

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Unabomber Plea Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed Friday to  
hear Theodore Kaczynski's request to withdraw his guilty plea for 
the Unabomber killings, go to trial and face a possible death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski, a Harvard-trained mathematician who became a forest  
recluse, pleaded guilty in 1998 to mail bombings that killed three 
people and injured 23. Kaczynski's statements have connected the 
attacks to his campaign against technological tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed Friday to consider  
whether Kaczynski's guilty plea was voluntary; whether he was 
properly denied the right to represent himself; and whether a 
defendant, in a death penalty trial, has a right to prevent his 
court-appointed lawyer from presenting evidence of mental 
impairment as a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department had agreed to the guilty plea and life  
sentence after a psychiatric examination concluded Kaczynski was a 
paranoid schizophrenic but competent to stand trial. The exam had 
been arranged by Kaczynski's lawyers over his objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski had wanted to present a defense based on his views  
about technology and the environment. But his attempts to represent 
himself or bring in a lawyer who would argue his chosen defense 
were rejected by U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell of Sacramento, 
who said the requests were made too late and would delay the case 
unduly. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell later refused to let Kaczynski set his guilty plea aside  
and found that his arguments, filed from his prison cell in 
Colorado, were not serious enough to justify an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Lapham declined to discuss the  
order or the government position in the case. Before the guilty 
plea, prosecutors argued that Kaczynski should be allowed to 
control his defense, even at the risk of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mello, a Vermont Law School professor who helped  
Kaczynski with his legal filing, said the appeals court order 
``took an enormous amount of courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of power: Who has the legitimate power to make  
the most important, fundamental decisions about the defense? Is it 
the guy whose life is on the line or is it the guy's 
well-intentioned, paternalistic lawyer?'' Mello said.

<HEADLINE> Dominator Demoted By Sabres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek has been just about  
everywhere in hockey including the 1998 Olympics and last season's 
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now add one dubious destination for the Dominator: the bench.  
</P>
<P>
	The winless Sabres sat their struggling goaltender after one  
period in a loss to Nashville and have decided to let him stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started Dom the other night and he struggled,'' said Sabres  
coach Lindy Ruff, whose team fell to 0-5-2 with a loss to the 
Predators in which Hasek and backup Dwayne Roloson each gave up two 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Promising third-string goalie Martin Biron will start against  
Carolina tonight as the desperate Sabres try to avoid the worst 
start ever for the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always competition,'' said Hasek, who plans to retire  
at the end of the season and return home to the Czech Republic with 
his family. ``You have to prove every night and in every practice 
and every game that you can be the starting goalie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has played inconsistently. How long he remains idle  
depends on 22-year-old Biron, the team's first-round draft pick in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll start Marty and see if he can get the job done,'' Sabres  
coach Lindy Ruff said Thursday. ``If Marty wins, he's going to 
play. That turns up the competition level, too. The team needs that 
fire right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek admitted he was lacking some spark after he allowed two  
goals on eight shots in the first period including one at 46 
seconds in a 4-3 loss to the Predators on Wednesday night. One 
thing that bothered Ruff was Hasek's apparent lack of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't seem that our goaltenders are on top of their  
game,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek vowed to work hard to win his job back. ``I have to solve  
it,'' he said. ``I have to play better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres called up Biron from the team's AHL affiliate in  
Rochester, N.Y. ``I was surprised and happy at the same time,'' 
Biron said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wiry and acrobatic Biron, a Hasek clone in appearance and  
style of play, had a 1-2-1 record and a 2.14 goals-against average 
in six appearances with the Sabres last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are winless in seven games, the longest a Buffalo  
team has gone without a victory at the start of a season since the 
1990-91 Sabres began with four losses and three ties. ``This is 
getting out of hand,'' defenseman Jason Woolley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another loss would set a franchise record for games played  
without a first victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a distinction that we really don't want to be  
associated with,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, a notoriously slow starter, has allowed more soft goals  
than usual. He struggled with a groin injury last season that 
plagued him through the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff is running low on patience with his goaltender, a two-time  
league MVP who won the Olympic gold medal in 1998 and has been 
voted the NHL's top goaltender five of the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he's focused, he gets himself in a zone,'' Ruff said.  
``We haven't seen that zone yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In six appearances, Hasek is 0-3-1 with a 3.04 goals-against  
average and 15 goals allowed. His .911 save percentage pales next 
to last year's .937, the best of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been times in and out of games where you've seen those  
incredible saves and it seems like he's not going to get beat, but 
he hasn't really put it together for a full 60 minutes,'' Ruff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing the goalie is the biggest move you can make on a  
team,'' Woolley said. ``We'll see if it works.''

<HEADLINE> Longhorns Like Nebraska's Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Enough of this gushing over which team has  
the nicest fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers just want to beat No. 18  
Texas on Saturday, not play nice. 
</P>
<P>
	With victories in 1996 and 1998, Texas joins Florida State as  
the only two teams to beat Nebraska twice this decade. It's a badge 
of honor earned against one of the dominant teams of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	While Texas has fond memories of its 20-16 victory last year --  
which snapped Nebraska's 47-game home winning streak -- Cornhuskers 
center Dominic Raiola said the loss turned his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate Texas,'' Raiola said. ``They're this high-and-mighty  
deal. I don't like that song either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas players and coaches sing ``The Eyes of Texas'' after every  
game. After the victory, Texas players hoisted coach Mack Brown on 
their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my helmet on, my head down,'' Raiola said. ``It was  
cloudy and kind of dark. It made me disgusted to hear that song. It 
made me sick to see them celebrating on our field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas coaches and players have more pleasant memories.  
</P>
<P>
	First came the stunned silence when the clock ran out. Then came  
the standing ovation from several hundred Nebraska fans that Brown 
said he'll remember forever. 
</P>
<P>
	In an age when boos, taunts and even worse sometimes rain down  
on players from the stands, Nebraska fans are among the best in 
sports, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just unbelievable,'' he said. ``We can all learn  
from those people about sportsmanship and how to make an opposing 
team feel comfortable while still trying to win on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All week, calls to sports-radio talk shows have told stories of  
slaps on the back and free dinners from Nebraska fans after Texas' 
victory last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has implored Texas fans to return the good will -- win or  
lose -- during Nebraska's first trip to Austin since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's make the Nebraska people, when they leave Austin, say  
the same things that we've said for a year about Lincoln,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be easy to do if Texas (5-2, 2-1 Big 12) can beat  
Nebraska (6-0, 3-0) for the third straight time. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas beat the Cornhuskers 37-27 in the 1996 Big 12 title game --  
a loss that ended Nebraska's bid for a third consecutive national 
title -- before last year's upset in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it helps us, knowing we're the only team that's been  
able to beat them two in a row in a long time,'' Texas wide 
receiver Ryan Nunez said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Texas players say last year's game means  
little to them anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the Big 12 and ascending the AP Top 25 to join the elite  
teams like Nebraska means everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done some things against them the past two years, but  
it doesn't mean anything this season,'' cornerback Ahmad Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want to be Big 12 contenders, we have to beat  
Nebraska.''

<HEADLINE> Crew 2, Mutiny 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Dougherty recorded his second  
consecutive shutout and Brian West scored his first playoff goal as 
the Columbus Crew advanced to the Eastern Conference finals with a 
2-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew captured the best-of-3 series two games to none.  
Columbus will face either D.C. United or Miami in the conference 
finals. Game 2 in that series, which United leads 1-0, is Sunday in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	West put the Crew up 1-0 in the 23rd minute when his shot from  
15 yards out wound up just inside the left post. Jeff Cunningham 
added a goal for Columbus in the 88th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty helped extended his former team's playoff scoring  
drought to 325 minutes. The goalkeeper made several strong saves, 
including a diving effort on Manny Lagos' 15-yard shot late in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mutiny have dropped six straight playoff games dating back  
to the 1996 season. Tampa Bay's last postseason goal, scored by 
Gilmar, came on Oct. 5, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The announced crowd of 14,392 set a home playoff record for the  
Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus midfielder Ansil Elcock missed the game with left knee  
tendinitis.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom Expands in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom AG is buying a  
majority stake in U.S.-based MediaOne Group Inc.'s cellular-phone 
assets in central Europe and Russia for $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchases announced Friday from MediaOne, a Colo.-based  
cable television concern being acquired by AT&AMP;T Corp., 
significantly expand Telekom's portfolio in the emerging markets of 
central and eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The move caps a week of merger and acquisition news in Europe's  
rapidly consolidating telecommunications market. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Telekom's main rival in the German market,  
Mannesmann AG, announced its intention to buy British mobile 
operator Orange PLC, just two months after Telekom established its 
own foothold in Britain's mobile phone market by buying One2One. 
</P>
<P>
	German firms are also targets: France Telecom said Monday it was  
buying a majority stake in E-Plus, Germany's third-largest mobile 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the latest deal, Telekom will double its stake in Polska  
Telefonia Cyfrowa SP ZOO to 45 percent. The Polish firm, under its 
brand name Era GSM, is the largest and fastest-growing GSM digital 
wireless operator in Central Europe, according to Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom also will acquire a 49 percent holding in Westel  
Radiotelefon (Westel 450), the Hungarian analog wireless operator; 
a 49 percent share in Westel 900, the Hungarian GSM digital 
wireless operator; and a controlling stake in Russian 
Telecommunications Development Corp., or RTDC, which has 
investments in nine regional Russian telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom Chairman Ron Sommer termed the move ``a logical  
expansion of Deutsche Telekom's presence in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition ``complements our European internationalization  
strategy with our joint ventures in Austria, Hungary, the Czech 
Republic, Poland, Russia and Croatia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is subject to approval by Deutsche Telekom's  
supervisory board and regulators.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Train Derails, 3 Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CATHEDRAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Nine cars of Amtrak's Sunset  
Limited derailed early Friday, shutting down a major rail line in 
the desert east of Los Angeles but causing no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	There were three minor injuries, said Ray Dampier of the  
Riverside County Fire Department. Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said 
the injuries were minor bumps. The westbound train from Orlando, 
Fla., to Los Angeles was carrying 216 passengers and 18 crew 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the Sunset Limited's passenger cars, a private  
passenger car and five freight cars jumped the track near 
Interstate 10 in the northeast area of the city, said Mark Davis of 
Union Pacific, which operates the track. 
</P>
<P>
	The cars remained upright. Passengers were taken by bus to Los  
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is just east of Palm Springs and about 110 miles east  
of Los Angeles. The rail line was expected to reopen late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Matching Up Spartans and Badgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin cornerback Jamar Fletcher thrives  
on big challenges, and 6-foot-6 Michigan State receiver Plaxico 
Burress is the biggest challenge in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	When the No. 11 Spartans visit the No. 17 Badgers at Camp  
Randall Stadium, the 5-10 Fletcher's matchup with Burress could be 
one of the most exciting duels of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's only one part of an important game with serious Rose  
Bowl implications for two teams near the top of the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game also features the nation's fifth-best rushing  
offense against the best run defense. Watching Ron Dayne and his 
powerful offensive line pound away at the Spartans' massive front 
seven will be intriguing, but it just isn't as exciting as the duel 
between Burress and Fletcher, two probable future pros who play 
with flair and skill -- and truckloads of trash talk. 
</P>
<P>
	If Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez makes the coverage decision  
everyone expects him to, Burress and Fletcher will face each other 
head-on. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is go out and play my game,'' Fletcher said. ``I  
know he likes to talk. He's a pretty good receiver, but I don't 
know if he's faced anybody of my caliber. He's going to be in for a 
challenge also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burress has become known almost as much for his yapping and  
chest-pounding as his considerable skill at catching quarterback 
Bill Burke's passes. 
</P>
<P>
	He tries to intimidate defensive backs from the opening play  
with a constant stream of chatter. He's so relentlessly exuberant 
that coach Nick Saban barred him from talking to the media this 
week after the Spartans' 52-28 loss to Purdue, which knocked 
Michigan State from the ranks of the unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Burress had just three catches for 50 yards in the game, and  
Purdue cornerback Michael Hawthorne issued a stinging verbal 
rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just big and is a lot of talk,'' Hawthorne said. ``I  
don't think he's the best receiver in the Big Ten. I hate how he 
pounds his chest after making a play, like saying, `I have heart 
and you don't.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Burress will be itching to redeem himself against Fletcher,  
who's eight inches shorter than Burress but every bit an equal 
competitor and talker. He's also short-listed for the Jim Thorpe 
Award, given to the nation's top defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is big time,'' Fletcher said. ``Any time you go up  
against a prime-time receiver like Plaxico, you want to show your 
game and let everybody else around the country know that you're 
pretty good, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher, a sophomore who led the nation with seven  
interceptions last season, has become the kind of defensive back so 
feared that he essentially removes one receiver from the Badgers' 
opponents playbook. He has just two interceptions this season, 
mostly because quarterbacks refuse to throw toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a tremendous amount of respect for Fletcher,'' Saban  
said. ``You have to know where he is on every play, or he'll get 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fletcher loves to hit receivers at the line of scrimmage and  
knock them out of their routes, something the Boilermakers did to 
great effect last week. Burress has 35 catches for 629 yards and 
five touchdowns this season, but it's thought that he can be 
defended if an opponents doesn't allow him a physical advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez had no qualms about comparing the towering wideout to  
the prototypical big, athletic receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a Randy Moss-type receiver,'' Alvarez said. ``I'm talking  
about athleticism. I'm talking about height. I'm talking about 
big-play capabilities. Everybody that plays him pays special 
attention to him, yet he still gets the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burress set a school record with 10 catches for 255 yards  
against Michigan two weeks ago, and he could be even more important 
to the Spartans if Gari Scott, the team's No. 2 receiver, can't 
play because of a strained knee.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Hit Man Comes Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For 12 years, Carolyn Wood was married to the mob,  
though she claims she never knew it. 
</P>
<P>
	But with her ex-husband's emergence from the underworld after 16  
years as a fugitive and his confession to killing 20 people for New 
England's top organized crime bosses, Wood sees this as his chance 
to do right by his real family, not his crime family. 
</P>
<P>
	While John Martorano, 59, wears $800 suits in court and employs  
several high-powered attorneys to defend him, Wood, 60, is living 
off disability checks and fighting for more than $200,000 she's 
owed from their 1975 divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	When Martorano was arrested in 1995, defense attorney Martin  
Weinberg told a federal judge that his client was not a flight risk 
because he didn't want to abandon his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who supported her family by working as a caterer and  
hairdresser, scoffs at the notion of Martorano as a family man, 
saying he was neither father nor husband. She said he was 
controlling and abusive, occasionally knocking her unconscious if 
she questioned his authority or insulted his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I understand (Martorano) was (a partier),'' Wood  
said in recent telephone interviews from her home north of Boston. 
``But I stayed home and that was that. I was told who I could talk 
to. I wasn't allowed to do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martorano has ``categorically denied the allegations of abuse,''  
Weinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the couple divorced in Las Vegas, Martorano insisted it was  
for tax purposes, Wood said. Then in 1979, he disappeared to 
Florida to avoid prosecution for fixing horse races. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said she neither saw nor heard from him during the next 16  
years, but remembers her young son ``cried many days.'' Wood, who 
has an older daughter from a previous marriage, told the boy his 
dad was away on business. 
</P>
<P>
	Martorano was captured and indicted in 1995 for racketeering and  
extortion along with his brother James and friends Francis 
``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme; Steven ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, who is 
godfather to the couple's only son; and South Boston neighborhood 
crime boss James ``Whitey'' Bulger. James Martorano has since 
pleaded guilty, Flemmi and Salemme are in custody and Bulger has 
been a fugitive since his indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	When Martorano found out his friends had betrayed the mob by  
serving as longtime FBI informants, he agreed last month to testify 
against them and plead guilty to 12 murders in exchange for a 
sentence of as few as 12 1/2 years. The former hit man confessed to 20 
killings, but prosecutors decided to focus on the 12 that most 
directly relate to their federal racketeering case. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea bargain must be approved by U.S. District Judge Mark  
Wolf, who has said he is uncertain about accepting the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Wood's 29-year-old son refuses to read accounts  
of his father's transgressions and Wood is fighting for the value 
of the house she won in the divorce. While Martorano was 
underground, Wood learned that the house was not his to give her -- 
it belonged to his friend, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a probate judge awarded Wood more than $200,000 -- the  
value of the house plus interest -- but she still hasn't seen the 
money. She said Martorano is skillful at hiding his assets, and 
though Wood is not part of the criminal case against her 
ex-husband, her lawyer, Donna Turley, recently sent a letter to 
Wolf notifying him of Martorano's financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping to create enough pressure on Mr. Martorano to  
make him want to have this (debt) disappear,'' Turley said. The 
attorney representing Martorano in the divorce-related proceedings, 
Paul Haley, did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who never remarried, said she suffers from post-traumatic  
stress syndrome resulting from her marriage and learning about her 
ex-husband's exploits, like the fatal 1968 shootings of a Boston 
nightclub manager and two teen-agers who happened to be sitting in 
the car with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me feel guilty,'' she said between sobs.

<HEADLINE> Mom of Columbine Victim Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The mother of a student wounded in the  
Columbine High School massacre walked into a suburban pawn shop 
Friday, asked to see a handgun, loaded it and killed herself with a 
shot to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla June Hochhalter's suicide occurred about six months after  
her 17-year-old daughter, Anne Marie, was critically wounded in the 
April 20 tragedy and left partially paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	She left a note, but authorities did not reveal the contents.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought she was better, especially when Anne Marie moved her  
legs for the first time last week. There was something finally 
something to look forward to. There were finally happier times,'' 
said Connie Michalik, who became friends with Mrs. Hochhalter while 
her wounded son, Richard Castaldo, and Anne Marie went through 
painful rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Harriet Hall, a psychologist in charge of a counseling program  
for Columbine victims, said, ``We've heard that the six-month 
anniversary is hard. Now we know it's true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Ms. Hochhalter, 48, entered the Alpha Pawn Shop  
in nearby Englewood alone about 10 a.m. Friday and asked to see a 
.38-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	When a clerk turned around to fill out paperwork, Ms. Hochhalter  
loaded the weapon with her own ammunition, then fired one round 
that hit the wall and a second round into her head, Englewood 
police spokeswoman Leticia Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suicide was the latest shock for students and families in  
the Littleton area. Jefferson County School District officials 
planned to have grief counselors available this weekend to help 
deal with any trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	A student was arrested this week for allegedly threatening ``to  
finish the job'' begun by two student gunmen at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, CBS-TV was criticized by some in the community for  
broadcasting a snippet of the security camera videotape that was 
taken in the school cafeteria as the massacre unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely horrified,'' said Steve Cohn, parent of a  
15-year-old Columbine student who survived the assault. ``We've 
been under a lot of stress recently but what do you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying several weapons and setting off homemade bombs, Eric  
Harris, 18, and 17-year-old Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a 
teacher and wounded about 26 others before they took their own 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Marie suffered injuries to her spinal cord, back and chest  
when the gunmen fired at her in the parking lot. She moved her legs 
for the first time last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Now a senior, she is taking a physics class at Columbine while a  
tutor teaches the rest of her courses at home.

<HEADLINE> Gun Maker Has Dealers Sign Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) --The nation's largest handgun  
manufacturer is requiring dealers in its collective advertising 
program to sign a code of ethics designed to prevent the illegal 
sale of guns. 
</P>
<P>
	More than three-quarters of Smith &AMP; Wesson's 3,500 registered  
dealers in the program have signed the agreement since the company 
began mailing them in mid-July, said Paul Pluff, manager of retail 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the code requires dealers to obey all  
firearms laws, sell only Smith &AMP; Wesson guns with safety locks and 
to closely monitor buyers to avoid illegal purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Springfield-based company warned that dealers will be  
dropped from collective advertisements and won't receive other 
marketing help if they run afoul of the law or fail to sign the 
agreement by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, because the company doesn't sell directly to retailers,  
stores need not belong to the advertising program to sell Smith &AMP; 
Wessons, spokesman Ken Jorgensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of negligent sales has been raised in several lawsuits  
that have been filed by various cities against the gun industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smith &AMP; Wesson has not been found negligent. We want to make  
sure that the people we are doing business with are in step with us 
and the law in that way,'' Jorgensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Sugarmann, director of the nonprofit Violence Policy  
Center, said the ethics code is only meant to let the company 
``point their fingers at the dealers'' in lawsuits claiming 
negligent sales practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Carr, co-owner of Carr's Sporting Goods, in Taunton, said  
he expected to sign the letter as one of the Smith &AMP; Wesson's 
stocking dealers. ``I can understand them doing that. One of the 
reasons is legal liability.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Incest Trial Parents Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The parents of an 11-year-old  
Swiss-American boy whose arrest on incest charges has created a 
furor in Switzerland ran a business out of their home called 
``Ultimate Fantasies,'' The Denver Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas and Beverly Wuthrich, who fled to Switzerland after  
their son was arrested, registered the business in July, according 
to records cited by the newspaper. It quoted a source close to the 
investigation as saying it is an adult video production company. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County authorities confirmed Thursday they are looking  
into the business, but said they don't know what it did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investigators are aware of the business and are currently  
trying to establish exactly what type of business it is,'' said 
Steve Davis, spokesman for the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview this morning on NBC's ``Today, Mrs. Wuthrich  
denied any involvement in an adult-video company. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said records also show that she pleaded guilty  
last year to a misdemeanor child-neglect charge and a second, 
similar charge is pending. The mother was ordered to undergo 
parenting classes and fined $78, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of those were for a neglect type of situation where the  
kids were left home alone for a period of time without being 
supervised,'' Davis said. ``It wasn't an abuse case like they were 
being beaten or anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple fled with their three other children after the boy,  
Raoul, was arrested on aggravated incest charges. Authorities began 
the investigation after a neighbor reported that she saw him fondle 
his sister. He is accused of inappropriate sexual contact with his 
5-year-old sister. Mrs. Wuthrich said this morning that her son and 
daughter told her he was trying to help her go to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, who have dual U.S.-Swiss citizenship, said they  
left after authorities told them their other children might be 
taken from them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very threatened by the authorities,'' Mrs. Wuthrich  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul was in a juvenile detention center from Aug. 30 until a  
court hearing on Tuesday, where a magistrate ruled that the case 
can proceed and had the boy placed in a foster home. The boy will 
move to a residential treatment center when a spot opens up. He is 
due in Juvenile Court on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has created a furor in Switzerland, where people can't  
understand why an 11-year-old boy would be taken away in handcuffs 
and detained. The Swiss foreign ministry has been swamped with 
calls.

<HEADLINE> Former Australian Open Winner Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- John Bromwich, a two-time Australian  
Open champion, died after suffering a heart attack this week, his 
family said today. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his tennis career was interrupted by World War II,  
Bromwich won the Australian Open in 1939 and 1946. He played 51 
Davis Cup matches from 1937 to 1950, winning 19 of his 30 singles 
matches and 20 of 21 doubles matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich was ambidextrous, using both hands on his forehand.  
</P>
<P>
	The major disappointment of his career came at Wimbledon in 1948  
when he reached the final against Bob Falkenburg and wasted three 
match points, losing the championship after leading 5-2 in the 
final set. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich's greatest successes came in doubles. In 1948, he won  
the Wimbledon doubles title with Frank Sedgman. He won at Wimbledon 
again in 1950 with Adrian Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich was a three-time U.S. Open doubles champion and also  
was a Wimbledon mixed doubles winner with Louise Brough in 1947-48. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife Zenda. His funeral will be held  
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Travel Agents Boycott United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Through postings on Internet travel sites, faxes  
and customer bookings, travel agents across the country are venting 
their wrath at United Airlines for slashing the fee it pays them 
for selling tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``United Airlines has been expelled from this travel agency,''  
declares a sign posted on the marquee outside John Shands' agency 
in Brownsville, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure my $50,000 in business isn't going to make a whit of  
difference to United Airlines. But I'm just not going to support 
them any more on this,'' Shands, who owns three travel agencies in 
south Texas, said in a telephone interview. ``I will not suffer my 
financial death at the hands of corporate executioners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United announced plans Oct. 7 to cut agents' commissions from 8  
percent to 5 percent, a move that would save the airline $150 
million a year. Since then, 16 other carriers have followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents say the airlines are trying to encroach on their  
business and force consumers to deal directly with the carriers, 
which could result in higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust law bars agents from acting together in an organized  
effort targeting United or any other carrier. But numerous agents 
boycotted after the previous three rounds of cuts -- two initiated 
by United -- and conversations in Internet chat rooms make it clear 
such informal actions are under way again. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents face stiff competition from Internet sites that  
allow consumers to shop for deals and buy directly from the 
airlines. They were first jolted by industrywide commission cuts in 
1995, after Delta Air Lines reduced fees for domestic tickets to 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, United chopped that to 8 percent and then  
followed in 1998 by capping commissions on international tickets at 
8 percent. In the latest move, it lopped off another 3 percent 
while retaining the $50 cap as the maximum it would pay agents per 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 80 percent of airline tickets are still sold  
through retail travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kathleen Tagariello, whose Buckhead Travel Partners in  
Atlanta has stopped doing United bookings, claimed the latest 
decrease could put as many as half of travel agents nationwide out 
of business within months. Such dire predictions haven't come true 
in previous cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately at this point every carrier has followed suit  
and we cannot boycott everybody or we can't have anybody traveling 
anywhere,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stirred to act by the latest cuts, Linda Rawlings, head of  
Travel Advocate in Denver, is organizing a rally of travel agents 
on the steps of the Colorado state capital next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now absolutely unprofitable to issue an airline  
ticket,'' she said. ``We had exactly nine hours' notice of a 37 1/2 
percent cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	United chairman James Goodwin, explaining the reasoning behind  
the cuts, said in Tokyo this week that ``electronic capabilities'' 
are forcing the airline to find smarter ways to do business. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the airline indicated it isn't feeling any pinch. A  
spokeswoman for the Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based carrier who 
declined to be named said United was aware only of ``discussion 
about planned boycotts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Society of Travel Agents, which represents 11,000  
U.S. travel agencies and 12,000 suppliers, downplayed the boycott 
and said it had nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever's going on is probably a lot of talk,'' said Paul  
Ruden, senior vice president. ``The agent really isn't in a 
position to direct business this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the travel agents' group, while tiptoeing around legally  
dangerous boycott talk, revoked United's membership in the 
association -- a mostly symbolic move -- and has been proposing 
federal legislation to reverse the cuts. It also has asked the 
Transportation Department to rescind the cuts as unfair under the 
Federal Aviation Act. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, large airlines who were sued by the trade group for  
allegedly conspiring to cut commissions and cap payouts settled out 
of court for more than $90 million. The lawsuit obviously did not 
deter them from further cuts, and some agents predict their cut 
will eventually drop to zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Airlines is one of the few major U.S. carriers to keep  
its travel agents' fees intact despite this round of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a commitment to travel agents back in 1995 that we  
would uphold the 10 percent commission through the year 2000,'' 
explained Beth Harbin, a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based airline.

<HEADLINE> Pistons' Bison Dele Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons are thinking about placing  
center Bison Dele on the suspended list rather than the retirement 
list, a spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 Dele has filed retirement papers with the NBA  
office in New York, fulfilling a promise he made last month. 
</P>
<P>
	If he is placed on the suspended list, the Pistons could  
reinstate him if he changes his mind -- or trade him. If Dele goes 
on the retirement list, he will have to sit out the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman J.J. Carter said Friday that the team hadn't made  
a decision yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the start of the season, he would probably be on the  
suspended list,'' Carter said, although he added, ``he's pretty 
much said he's not coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pistons general manager Rick Sund said Thursday that the team  
was not surprised by Dele's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said from the beginning that his talent helps our club,''  
Sund said. ``If he wanted to come back, we would look at that 
situation very strongly. Or, if he wanted to be traded we could 
look at that if it was something that made sense for our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers and at least one other team have inquired  
about Dele, The Detroit News reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, who averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds in 49  
regular-season games and 10.6 points and 6.4 rebounds in five 
playoff games last season, will forfeit the $5.67 million he stood 
to earn this season. He has five years and $36.45 million left on 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, formerly known as Brian Williams, was the team's  
highest-paid player. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, 30, told the Pistons last month about his possible desire  
to retire. He missed training camp and preseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent two seasons in Detroit after signing as a free agent,  
and his relationship with his teammates was said to be strained.

<HEADLINE> Burger King Can Keep Big Kids Meals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Burger King can continue to sell its ``Big Kids  
Meal'' as it battles for preteen appetites with McDonald's, a judge 
ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge John Corbett O'Meara denied a  
preliminary injunction that McDonald's had sought against Burger 
King to keep it from using the name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oak Brook, Ill.-based company sued its hamburger rival this  
summer, saying the Big Kids Meal offered by Burger King in June 
essentially copied a program it launched last year to lure more 
preteens into McDonald's restaurants near Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-based Burger King has said the name ``Big Kids Meal,''  
which McDonald's unsuccessfully tried to trademark, was a 
description, not a trademark infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one owns the English language,'' Burger King spokeswoman  
Kim Miller said. ``We're extremely pleased with the ruling. We feel 
vindicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa Howard said the company would review  
the ruling before deciding what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did what we thought was right, and we still think it was  
right,'' she said. ``We will continue to aggressively protect our 
trademarks.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Sues Barnes &AMP; Noble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com, the world's leading online  
bookseller, is suing Barnes &AMP; Noble over alleged copycat use of its 
popular ``1-Click'' feature, which greatly simplifies the process 
of making online purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against New  
York-based Barnes &AMP; Noble in U.S. District Court in Seattle 
Thursday. The complaint seeks to halt use of the technology by 
Barnes &AMP; Noble's online subsidiary, barnesandnoble.com, and seeks 
unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Gus Carlson, a spokesman for barnesandnoble.com, said: ``We have  
not yet examined the suit in detail, but from what we do know, we 
believe the suit is completely without merit and we will vigorously 
defend our position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's 1-Click feature securely stores billing and  
shipping information so return customers don't have to re-enter the 
data each time they buy -- a turn-off for shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most online retailers have similar technology.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody' got one,'' said analyst Tom Huskerson with Zona  
Research in Redwood City, Calif. Clearly Amazon.com ``feels Barnes 
&AMP; Noble has done something that copies what they're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second such lawsuit in a matter of days. Last week,  
priceline.com sued Microsoft, contending that Expedia.com's new 
online hotel-pricing service violates Priceline's patent. Both 
services invite customers to state the price they're willing to pay 
for a room. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the equivalent of a global war in the sphere of  
e-commerce and this is only the beginning,'' said patent attorney 
Rob Gorman with the New York firm of Fulnright and Jaworski.

<HEADLINE> President Signs $8.7B Farm Bailout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today signed into a law a  
record $8.7 billion package of emergency assistance to compensate 
farmers for depressed commodity prices and weather-related crop 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is contained in a $69 billion bill that will fund  
operations of the Agriculture Department and related agencies for 
the 2000 budget year. 
</P>
<P>
	The first assistance checks will be going to farmers in two to  
three weeks, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton agreed to sign the legislation despite his  
administration's reservations that some of the aid will be going to 
large farms and landowners who don't need the money, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of moderate-size farmers who need these  
payments to survive, there's no question about that,'' Glickman 
said, speaking to reporters after a brief signing ceremony at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to develop an alternative way to distribute future  
aid that would target the money to ``family-size'' operations, 
Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money in the measure, about $6 billion, is intended  
to help grain, cotton and soybean farmers cope with a second year 
of low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also provides $1.4 billion for weather-related crop  
and livestock losses, including $200 million earmarked for Eastern 
livestock producers who were hurt by this summer's drought; $400 
million in crop-insurance discounts; $328 million to compensate 
tobacco producers for falling cigarette sales; and $125 million in 
subsidies for dairy producers.

<HEADLINE> Knight Shoots Friend While Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOONER, Wis. (AP) -- Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight  
accidentally shot a friend while hunting and was cited by state 
authorities for violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said his trigger finger slipped before he was ready to  
shoot at a bird, and his friend was hit with pellets in the back 
and shoulder. The man was not seriously injured but required 
medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Natural Resources said Thursday that Knight  
will be cited for failing to report a hunting accident. He also 
will receive citations for hunting without a license in 1999 and 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, Knight was required to report the accident. The  
fine for each citation is $165. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, Thomas Mikunda and two other men were hunting Oct. 12  
when they spotted a grouse, said Dave Zeug, law enforcement 
director for the DNR's northern region. 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old coach told investigators that as he turned to  
aim at the bird, his finger slipped off the shotgun's safety. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the investigation, it was determined Knight did  
not have a $43 nonresident small game license and that he also 
hunted without one last year in Wisconsin, as did two of his 
hunting companions. The two companions will receive similar 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight told investigators he didn't think he needed the license  
to hunt on private property. 
</P>
<P>
	An unsigned statement by Indiana University said: ``This is a  
matter that is outside the scope of coach Knight's university 
duties. The university, however, recognizes that matters relating 
to coach Knight receive significant attention. ... The university 
is confident that coach Knight will respond appropriately to 
resolve this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight did not immediately return a message from The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	DNR warden Gerald Carow, who is investigating the shooting, said  
he talked to Knight on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's feeling bad that it happened and feels deeply concerned  
over the victim and is willing to pay any penalty,'' Carow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikunda, an insurance agent, was not carrying a gun at the time.  
He was treated and released at Marshfield Clinic-Ladysmith Center 
in Ladysmith.

<HEADLINE> Lott Bill Would Extend Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott introduced a  
tax bill Friday that would make the business research and 
development credit permanent and extend several other expiring tax 
breaks through 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, with an estimated cost of $33 billion over 10  
years, blends parts of similar bills approved by the Senate Finance 
Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. It also drops 
several provisions in those bills. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Lott would not extend any energy tax credits,  
including those for wind-produced electricity or those for power 
produced with chicken manure. The first is a priority for 
Midwestern lawmakers, while the second is sought by Finance 
Committee Chairman William Roth, whose home state of Delaware is 
prime poultry country. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Lott, R-Miss., said the bill is more  
straightforward than the other versions and achieves the majority 
leader's goal of removing expiring tax credits from the 
congressional agenda during the 2000 election year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to not have to come back and do all of this again  
next year,'' said spokesman John Czwartacki. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the bill would spend some of the projected non-Social  
Security budget surplus in all but its first year. President 
Clinton has threatened to veto the five-year, $23.2 billion House 
version for the same reason; the $8.5 billion Senate Finance 
Committee measure is fully paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth said an earlier version of his bill would have made the R&AMP;D  
credit permanent and would have spent non-Social Security surplus 
money, but he discovered ``there was significant opposition'' among 
Republicans and Democrats alike to that approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final days of the session, when time is short, we will  
need a consensus package,'' Roth said. ``I believe the Finance 
Committee bill has the best chance of obtaining that consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the R&AMP;D credit would be made permanent in Lott's bill,  
companies could not claim it until Sept. 30, 2000, to remove it 
from the tight fiscal 2000 budget. The credit, which expired on 
June 30, is prized by the high-tech industry and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would ensure that millions of individual taxpayers  
do not run afoul of the complex alternative minimum tax by claiming 
numerous personal credits. Those credits would be exempted from AMT 
consideration through Dec. 31, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would make the AMT fix permanent, while the  
Finance Committee version applies to the 1999 and 2000 tax years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the differences between the bills, congressional leaders  
of both parties and Clinton say a compromise on extension of the 
expiring credits will be reached by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have an agreement ... so we don't have to go to  
conference forever to get it done,'' said House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Targeted for Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon wants Alaska to be the location  
for missile interceptors if President Clinton chooses to deploy a 
national defense against ballistic missile attack, a defense 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Bacon, speaking for Defense Secretary William Cohen,  
said Thursday the question of location is one of several elements 
of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty that would have to be 
revised if the United States went ahead with construction. Clinton 
may make such a decision as early as June. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is strongly opposed to the United States building a  
national missile defense -- even the limited version the Clinton 
administration envisions -- and has so far refused to renegotiate 
the ABM treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Russian officials opened a new round of discussions on  
the ABM treaty Thursday in Moscow, but there was little sign that 
the Russians would change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the United States could build an anti-missile base at  
Grand Forks, N.D., where it briefly operated one in the 1970s. That 
would be permissible under the ABM treaty, but the pact does not 
allow for more than one site or a change from one site to another. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a variety of reasons -- mainly to achieve complete  
(defensive) coverage of the United States -- we've decided that we 
have to move that site to Alaska,'' Bacon said. ``So the first 
thing we're proposing is to be able to move that site.'' He said 
there were other elements of the treaty that need to be 
renegotiated, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, spokesman for the Pentagon  
office in charge of developing missile defenses, said anti-missile 
interceptors based in North Dakota could not protect the entire 
United States. He said his office had not been informed that the 
Pentagon had decided on Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Jose Floods Caribbean Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) -- Tropical Storm Jose inundated  
St. Maarten and other Caribbean islands with heavy rain Friday, 
causing mudslides, flooding city streets and isolating thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	The tropical storm was stalled about 120 miles north of Puerto  
Rico Friday, and its 65-mph winds were expected to strengthen. 
Tropical storm-force winds extended 145 miles from the center of 
the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose was moving at 8 mph, and its speed was expected to increase  
during a projected turn north into the open Atlantic. On that 
course, forecasters say the storm should be far east of Bermuda by 
Saturday, but the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned changes 
were possible. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jose's weak western side spared Puerto Rico, its stronger  
northeastern face dumped rain for 1 1/2 days on French St. Martin, 
Dutch St. Maarten, St. Eustatius and Saba as well as the nearby 
British island of Anguilla, some 200 miles east of San Juan, Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dutch St. Maarten, the plant of the newspaper The Daily  
Herald was flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	``The roof blew off. It's all one big mess because of the water.  
It's still pouring down and it gets worse and worse as long as the 
rain continues!'' said editor Roger Snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Islanders on St. Maarten, Saba and St. Eustatius were ordered to  
stay home. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Maarten Lt. Gov. Dennis Richardson went on the radio to warn  
islanders to stay off roads made impassable by fallen rocks, 
uprooted trees and swiftly flowing floodwaters. Richardson also 
ordered police to close a flooded main road that kept 5,000 people 
isolated in the village of St. Peter's, cut off from Philipsburg, 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Flights that had been rescheduled to arrive Friday were  
canceled, stranding dozens of tourists on the waterlogged island 
that is divided between Dutch St. Maarten and French St. Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Meteorologists said the islands in the area had received some 18  
inches of rain and warned that more was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Maarten appeared worst hit. Streams in the hills that  
surround Philipsburg burst their banks Friday, flooding some main 
roads with up to two feet of water. Yards flooded and people called 
radio stations to say floodwaters were seeping into their homes. 
Local radio reported rock slides and landslides, but said that 
there were no reports of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby Anguilla fared little better, though it had power after  
work crews braved heavy overnight rain to restore electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of my bedrooms had about half an inch of water in them,''  
said Dave Bicker, staff secretary to the island's British governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Local government official Orris Proctor said Anguilla's famed  
beaches suffered severe erosion in the south and east.

<HEADLINE> Military Aviation Deaths Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Deaths in U.S. military aviation accidents  
fell this year to 43 from 77 the year before, and the Pentagon's 
overall air safety record improved slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual report on military safety, the Pentagon said  
Thursday that in a year in which hundreds of U.S. aircraft 
participated in the 78-day air campaign over Kosovo, it recorded 
1.58 major aviation accidents for every 100,000 hours of flying 
time. That compares with a rate of 1.64 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident count covered the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.  
</P>
<P>
	The military overall recorded 108 on-duty accidental deaths and  
319 off-duty deaths. The accidental death rate was 30 per 100,000 
military members, the same as the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	In other safety categories for the period:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The military lost 55 airplanes in accidents, down from 60 the  
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Privately owned motor vehicle accidents were the leading  
killer for the military, accounting for 280 deaths. The year before 
there were 249 such deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The military recorded $3.3 billion in property losses, about  
$1.9 billion of which was from damage to three satellites. Aviation 
accidents accounted for $1.23 billion of the total property losses.

<HEADLINE> Panel Eyes Ky. Gov.'s Derby Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- A state ethics panel reviewing the  
governor's control of hundreds of reserved seats for the Kentucky 
Derby voted Friday to do nothing -- at least not in public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Executive Branch Ethics Commission said it would send a  
private letter to Gov. Paul Patton. But the commission's five 
members, all appointed by the governor, wouldn't elaborate on what 
that letter might say. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's governors have been given first crack at hundreds of  
reserved seats for the perennially sold-out Triple Crown jewel for 
the past four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice was largely ignored by the public until May when a  
Laurel, Md., horse trainer was arrested outside Churchill Downs and 
charged with scalping a $42 Derby ticket for $100. His attorneys 
traced the ticket, one of three James Casey had bought from a 
scalper, back to the office of the Kentucky governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, whose trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Louisville,  
has conceded that he violated Kentucky law by selling the ticket at 
an inflated price, but he said he didn't deserve being locked in a 
holding cell for 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey said he paid a scalper $100 each for three Derby tickets  
because it was the only way to get a reserved seat, which ``are 
sold out forever,'' he said. Since he only needed two, he sold the 
third -- to an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out the ticket had been among 550 reserved for the  
governor. The state bought about 60 for use by the Tourism 
Development and Economic Development cabinets, and the rest were 
offered to friends and political supporters at face value -- 
$42-$500. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly can't imagine how there could be anything improper  
or how the public could possibly be hurt,'' Patton said Friday. ``I 
don't reckon the policy of this state is that governors can't have 
any friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both he and Churchill Downs spokesman Karl Schmitt said the  
track uses the governor's office as a way to draw more celebrities 
to the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton was not implicated in the alleged ticket scalping  
involving Casey, and he said he felt no personal responsibility for 
it.

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaigns to Undecided Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore was chirping along,  
deftly fielding questions from undecided voters he hoped to woo 
when Laurrie Malizia stood up and stopped him dead in his tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving a human face to the purported ``Clinton fatigue'' that  
some say has hurt Gore's quest for the 2000 Democratic presidential 
nomination, the 42-year-old administrative assistant told the vice 
president Thursday that she was disappointed in President Clinton 
for his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Malizia declared she was looking for a leader who was ``an  
honest man but a moral man,'' and with her 14-year-old daughter, 
Kendra, seated by her side, she stated: ``I want your viewpoint on 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, his voice dropping noticeably, replied: ``I want to take  
my own values of faith and family to the presidency. I understand 
the disappointment that you feel, and I felt it myself. I think 
most people want to look to the future, turn that page and move on. 
So, all I can do is tell you about myself and about my commitment 
to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Gore recounted his personal history, his 29-year  
marriage and spoke proudly of his four children and first grandson, 
born on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Malizia said that she liked Gore's answer but would  
still think about Gary Bauer, the Republican conservative activist, 
before making a primary choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what impressed her, Malizia replied: ``The fact that he  
looked at me straight in eyes. The fact that he seemed disappointed 
in the actions of the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a new poll showing Gore and Bill Bradley in a statistical  
dead heat for the Democratic nomination, the vice president's 
campaign pulled together a group of roughly 200 undecided voters so 
Gore could make his pitch for their vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The setting was pure Americana -- a dusty middle school gymnasium  
with 200 people sitting on bleachers and folding chairs. Gore's 
appeal was an equal serving of apple pie: ``I'm in this because I 
want to make a positive difference and I'm in this because I think 
I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly two hours, the audience quizzed him on a wide range  
of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What can you do to make prescription drugs more affordable for  
me and other senior citizens? Include them in Medicare, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- How can we reduce smog and help my asthma? Get serious with  
the global environment, he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Do you support work on 18 extra submarines at the Portsmouth  
Naval Shipyard, where I work? I'll have to study that, was the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum at the older of Dover's two middle schools came as the  
latest New Hampshire poll showed that Bradley, the former New 
Jersey senator and Gore's only challenger, was in a statistical tie 
with the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five percent of 600 likely Democratic voters supported  
Bradley, compared with 41 percent for Gore. Other recent polls have 
shown similar dead heats. An August poll showed Gore leading 
Bradley 46 percent to 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dover is a homey Seacoast City basking in the glory of New  
England's foliage season, its voters have been far from 
enthusiastic about Gore in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	As a presidential candidate in 1988, he finished fourth in Dover  
with 7.7 percent of the vote in the state's primary. Neighboring 
son Michael Dukakis was first with 37 percent, followed by Rep. 
Dick Gephardt of Missouri and former Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign said it picked the group of uncommitted voters  
after door-to-door canvassing and telephone banks. About 200 were 
invited -- some brought children -- and the campaign placed no 
restrictions on the content of their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	John Byrne, 45, of Dover, said afterwards he had been leaning  
towards Bradley but would have to re-evaluate Gore. ``The whole 
woodenness issue has been laid to rest for me. He's very 
personable,'' Byrne said.

<HEADLINE> Crude Down on Lower Output Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures jumped by 4 percent Friday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange on expectations that OPEC's continued 
solidarity on production cutbacks will push prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Other energy prices also gained.  
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, soybeans slid as rain in Brazil continued to  
ease concerns about dry planting conditions there, and sagging 
coffee prices rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices, which had lagged since topping $25 a barrel earlier  
this fall, climbed well above $23 a barrel as the market continued 
to respond to signs within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries that production won't be raised any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rally is basically an extension of the buying pressure in  
the wake of recent comments by the Saudis underscoring their 
hesitancy about raising production,'' said Michael Rothman, senior 
energy analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Key producers Saudi Arabia and Venezuela both indicated this  
week that OPEC may keep its oil output cuts in place after they 
expire next March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling the rally, a senior Kuwaiti oil official said his nation  
would back an extension if necessary to stabilize the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting prices was the news that Phillips Petroleum  
Co.'s 300,000-barrel-a-day Ekofisk field in the North Sea was shut 
down temporarily due to a small gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothman said oil prices are trading within a broader range now,  
with the next key benchmark a Nov. 17 meeting of the tripartite 
group -- the Saudis, Mexico and Venezuela, in the Saudi capital 
Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower production level could stick, according to analyst  
Chris Stavros of Paine Webber, if the Northern Hemisphere winter is 
mild, leaving world oil stocks high. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (OPEC members) are saying 'Don't necessarily assume that  
we're goiung to automatically raise prices in March,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude for December delivery rose 84 cents to $23.45  
a barrel; November heating oil rose 1.90 cent to 60.89 cents a 
gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose 1.60 cent to 65.58 cents a 
gallon; November natural gas rose .8 cent to $3.072 per million 
British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude rose 82 cents to $22.93 a  
barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts of more rain in northern areas of Brazil and a  
technical followthrough to Thursday's slump sent soybeans to their 
lowest level in seven weeks on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of selling occurred as the November contract was

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Broadly With Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose broadly Friday against most  
major currencies, following the lead of a resurgent U.S. stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.97 yen,  
up from 105.86 yen late Thursday. It had been trading lower against 
the yen in Europe but regained lost ground after stocks opened 
higher on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar scored bigger gains against the euro and the British  
pound. The euro sank to $1.0675 from $1.0820 on Thursday, while the 
British pound dropped to $1.6573 from $1.6767. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillermo Estebanez, a senior currency strategist at Bank of  
America in San Francisco, said the dollar ``tends to be very much 
at the mercy of the equity markets'' in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stock prices rallied Friday, with the New York market's  
best-known indicator, the Dow Jones industrial average, rising more 
than 172 points after dropping nearly 95 points in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Other stock market indicators also posted gains.  
</P>
<P>
	Estebanez said the dollar's rally against the European  
currencies was assisted by a new report that wholesale prices in 
Germany rose a slight 0.1 percent in September from August. 
Economists expected a 0.2 percent rise. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that quieted some fears in Europe that inflation in its  
biggest market was accelerating and that the European Central Bank 
would boost interest rates to contain it. Estebanez said the new 
data suggests a rate hike isn't imminent in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4987 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4720, and 1.4767 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4822. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8321 German 
marks, up from 1.8078; 6.1445 French francs, up from 6.0727; and 
1,813.75 Italian lire, up from 1,789.69.

<HEADLINE> NYC Detective Punished Over Louima </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An Internal Affairs detective accused of  
mishandling the first tip about the torture of a Haitian immigrant 
by police officers has been suspended for 30 days without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir handed down the punishment for  
detective Gary Alfred, which took effect Wednesday, The Daily News 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred had been staffing the Internal Affairs Bureau hotline on  
Aug. 9, 1997, when a nurse at Coney Island Hospital called to 
report an attack on Abner Louima, who had been arrested outside a 
nightclub and brought to the hospital with injuries suffered at the 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred failed to log the call. The investigation didn't begin  
until 36 hours later, after a second tip. Police officials said the 
delay may have allowed evidence to be lost or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two officers are awaiting sentencing, one who sodomized Louima  
with a broken broom handle and another who restrained him during 
the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred's lawyers asked a court to stay his suspension, saying  
the caller ``had a very heavy accent, was speaking laboriously and 
reluctantly'' and didn't give enough information.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed As Church Van Overturns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATASCADERO, Calif. (AP) -- A rental van packed with church  
members heading to a religious conference overturned on a coastal 
highway, killing seven women and scattering Bibles and hymnals 
across the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen members of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ Church in Los  
Angeles were in the van when it apparently skidded and tumbled 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the accident was under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if she swerved or overcorrected or what,''  
Sheriff's Detective Sean Donahue said. He said deer and other 
wildlife frequently cross that stretch of highway and the driver 
may have tried avoid hitting an animal. 
</P>
<P>
	Five women thrown from the van were killed. The driver, Julieta  
Razon, 49, and another woman inside also died. Two adults were 
listed in critical condition. A 4-year-old girl was in serious 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The crumpled van landed on its side in a 10-foot-deep ditch.  
Rescue workers had to prop it up with boards to reach the people 
trapped in the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Bibles and religious books, purses, backpacks and  
scores of plastic utensils littered the ground around the van. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said only a few of the passengers were wearing  
seatbelts. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was heading to San Francisco, where the founder of  
their church, Apollo C. Quiboloy, was scheduled to speak Friday 
evening. The church, based in the Philippines, was started 1985 and 
has about 3 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	Quiboloy drove to Atascadero, about halfway between San  
Francisco and Los Angeles, after he learned of the crash.

<HEADLINE> Bush-Bashing Biographer Had Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The biographer who accused GOP presidential  
front-runner George W. Bush of burying a cocaine arrest apparently 
had a secret of his own: a 1988 conviction for plotting to murder a 
co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure about James Howard Hatfield prompted his  
publisher on Thursday to suspend sales, shipment and promotion of 
the new book, ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of an 
American President.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield was still on parole from a 15-year prison term while  
writing his book on the Texas governor, and also did time for 
embezzlement, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Hatfield through his publisher, St. Martin's  
Press, were unsuccessful. The publisher did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign has its legal staff reviewing the matter for  
possible libel implications, spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield alleged that Bush was arrested in 1972 for cocaine  
possession but did only community service after his father, former 
President Bush, intervened. The arrest record was later expunged at 
the request of the elder Bush, the book alleged. Hatfield cited 
three anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious (the book) was not checked,'' Ms. Hughes said  
Friday. The Texas governor previously ripped the book as ``science 
fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book was due out in January 2000 but was released early  
after the manuscript arrived with the cocaine story. The publisher 
said 70,000 copies are already in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com said they will keep selling  
the book. It was already in Amazon's top 50 best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News first reported Hatfield's criminal  
background on Thursday. Hatfield, 41, told the newspaper it was a 
case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, a Dallas lawyer, Norman L. ``Happy'' Nelson Jr.,  
said that the author and the convict are one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who knew Howard for about nine years before the 1988  
conviction, said he was stunned to see Howard's picture in the 
newspaper as the Bush biographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture in the paper was the picture of the bomber,''  
Nelson said. ``That was him. I quite frankly didn't like him 
denying that he had a record, when I knew he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Castlebury, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal  
Justice, confirmed that a James Howard Hatfield was arrested in 
1987 for solicitation of murder -- hiring a hit man to plant a bomb 
under a co-worker's car. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was found guilty, Hatfield went to prison in 1988 and  
spent the next five years there. Upon his release, Hatfield was 
turned over to federal authorities; he wound up doing a short 
stretch in El Reno, Okla., for embezzling nearly $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While prison authorities would not provide details, Nelson said  
that Hatfield had tried to kill a co-worker when she suspected him 
of embezzling federal Housing and Urban Development funds. The 
woman later testified against Hatfield in the embezzlement case, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb planted beneath the co-worker's car only partially  
detonated, and she escaped serious injury, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield, who moved to Arkansas with the approval of Texas  
authorities, remains on parole through April 15, 2003, Castlebury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his official biography, Hatfield was ``a syndicated  
columnist, free-lance Texas journalist and frequent contributor to 
several Lone Star State newspapers and magazines.''

<HEADLINE> Gillette Earnings Likely To Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette Co.'s stock tumbled today after the  
consumer products manufacturer warned that fourth-quarter sales and 
earnings are likely to decline because of inventory problems. But 
later they regained some of the lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast had cast a pall on a third-quarter earnings report  
late yesterday that met analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette shares fell as much as 10.6 percent this morning before  
recovering some of the lost ground. The stock was down 5.9 percent, 
or by $2.25, at $35.62 1/2 a share in early afternoon trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive officer Michael C. Hawley said  
Thursday that industry consolidations were a primary reason why 
Gillette needed to reduced inventories -- especially blade 
inventories in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that this corrective action will result in a  
fourth-quarter sales decline in the mid-single digits and a 
quarterly earnings decrease in the middle to high teens,'' said 
Hawley. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been expecting earnings of 42 cents a share in the  
three months ending Dec. 31. In the year-ago fourth-quarter, 
Gillette earned $435 million, or 39 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawley said that despite the lowered fourth-quarter  
expectations, the strength of the Gillette's core businesses, 
coupled with the changes ``bode well for a return to (Gillette's) 
historic high growth rates in the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	yesterday, Gillette reported third-quarter earnings of $352  
million, or 32 cents a share. Earnings, which were helped by 
increased blade and razor sales, were held back in part due to 
higher interest costs associated with a share repurchase program. 
</P>
<P>
	That result, which met the expectations of analysts surveyed by  
First Call/Thomson Financial is slightly below last year's 
operating income of $353 million, or 30 cents per share. Last 
year's results do not include a one-time reorganization charge of 
$347 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette's sales for the three-month period ending Sept. 30 were  
$2.51 billion, down from $2.53 billion in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston company's blade and razor sales increased by 9  
percent, and sales of Duracell batteries rose 6 percent, with 
Duracell profits up 25 percent compared with the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	But sales of Braun appliance products dropped 15 percent, and  
profits in that division fell by 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said unfavorable exchange rates and poor economic  
conditions in some markets were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, sales dropped from  
$6.88 billion to $6.86 billion. Net income rose from $646 million 
to $921 million.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Showcasing Olympic Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Olympic organizers want Utah residents to  
catch the Olympic spirit before 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has said that 16 professional  
winter sports competitions -- including six national championships 
and seven international competitions -- are coming to the 2002 
Winter Olympic venues during the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 events are planned at the venues before the Olympics.  
</P>
<P>
	The competitions give the organizing committee a way to test the  
venues before the games. The committee also hopes residents will 
flock to the competitions for a chance to see some of the world's 
best athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to see the same athletes in the Olympics,''  
Cathy Priestner Allinger, SLOC managing director of sports, said. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC spokesman Frank Zang said tickets to the pre-Olympic events  
will cost from $1 to $15. Tickets for Olympic events will range 
from $20 to $425. 
</P>
<P>
	The next competitions is the short track speed skating World Cup  
Oct. 29-31 at the Peaks Ice Arena in Provo. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the cheapest tickets will be for events this winter at  
Soldier Hollow, the Olympic cross country and biathlon track. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyle Nelson, SLOC director of Soldier Hollow, wants about  
100,000 spectators for the U.S. Cross Country Championships Jan. 
8-15 and the U.S. Biathlon Championships Feb. 1-6. He thinks if 
there's any charge for the events, it will be $1 for a raffle 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said spectators won't be disappointed. ``You can get up  
close, you can have lunch with (the athletes), you can ask them how 
they wax their skis ... If you wanted you could reach out and touch 
someone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other events planned this winter are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- GS-Slalom World Cup, Nov. 18-21, Park City Mountain Resort.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Women's Downhill-Super G Super Series, Jan. 27-Feb. 1,  
Snowbasin Ski Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Women's Slalom World Cup, Feb. 6, Deer Valley Ski Resort.  
</P>

	Serbia To Let Montenegro Go Free  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a major policy shift, President  
Slobodan Milosevic will allow pro-Western Montenegro to leave the 
Yugoslav federation without bloodshed if the republic decides to do 
so, Serbian officials said today. The government of Montenegrin 
President Milo Djukanovic has demanded radical restructuring of the 
Yugoslav federation, a process which would virtually abolish 
Milosevic's control over the small republic. Montenegro plans to 
hold an independence referendum in case Milosevic rejects its 
proposal. Talks between the two republics' delegations are 
scheduled for next week.

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council today approved a  
6,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force for Sierra Leone. A U.N. 
Mission in Sierra Leone will be established for six months at first 
to help safeguard the peace deal signed July 7 by the government 
and rebel leaders after an eight-year civil war. The resolution 
authorizes the U.N. force to take ``necessary action'' to ensure 
the security and movement of U.N. personnel, and to protect 
civilians. During the war, tens of thousands of people were killed 
by members of the Revolutionary United Front and their allies.

	Papon Headed to Prison in France  
</P>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Maurice Papon, the former Vichy  
official who fled France rather than face jail for his role in 
sending Jews to Nazi death camps, was handed over to French 
authorities today. His final destination is a prison in a southern 
Paris suburb, where he was to be incarcerated. The Swiss government 
expelled Papon earlier today. He was convicted in April 1998 and 
sentenced to 10 years in jail for complicity in crimes against 
humanity for his role in deporting 1,590 Jews from Bordeaux. Most 
deportees later died at the Auschwitz death camp.

not have to allow Ku Klux Klan members to wear their masks at a 
planned rally tomorrow. The decision was a victory for the city. A 
lower court yesterday had ordered the city to allow KKK members to 
hold the rally while wearing their hooded white masks. City 
attorney Michael Hess said the KKK leaders had not applied for a 
permit yet, but he said if they did they would get one, as long as 
they agreed to abide by the ruling and stick to hoods and robes but 
no masks.

Orrin Hatch, Alan Keyes and John McCain will participate in

ATM machines in Moscow. The full extent of the fraud is not yet 
known, but authorities believe hundreds of thousands of dollars 
have been stolen by a well-organized criminal group that may have 
insider connections at Russian banks. Some foreigners who had money 
stolen from their bank accounts are having problems getting

eaters,'' says Chicago analyst Bill Plummer, who contends that the 
phenomenon is boosting prices. The high-protein weight-loss diet 
has been promoted in such best sellers as ``Protein Power'' and 
``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution.'' Demand for beef is expected to

<HEADLINE> GOP, Clinton Reach Lending Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lengthy political struggle may be coming to  
an end over legislation that would make it easier for banks, stock 
brokerages and insurance companies to combine and sell each other's 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Key Republican lawmakers reached agreement early Friday with  
Democrats and administration officials on provisions in the bill 
dealing with community lending rules for banks. The accord lifted 
the specter of a presidential veto of the bill, which is designed 
to overhaul Depression-era financial services laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street, which has been pushing for the legislation for  
years, was exultant at the prospect of a blossoming of financial 
``supermarkets'' selling checking accounts, mutual funds, life 
insurance and more. Buoyed by news of the bipartisan accord, 
financial stocks led a sharp market advance. Among the winners were 
securities firm Lehman Brothers, which rose $6.75 to $67.93 3/4, 
insurer American General which gained $5.37 1/2 to $74.75, and Chase 
Manhattan Bank, which rose $3.56 1/4 to $81.18 3/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial overhaul legislation ``will allow and encourage  
greater competition, which will greatly benefit consumers, the 
industry and the economy,'' said Marc Lackritz, president of the 
Securities Industry Association. ``The bill will also strengthen 
the ability of U.S. firms to compete in the global marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the bill would bring  
``lower costs for consumers because more people can compete to sell 
them insurance, to sell them mortgages, to sell them other 
financial products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, consumer advocates denounced the legislation, warning  
it would further concentrate financial power in a few big 
corporations, raising prices for consumers and jeopardizing their 
privacy as affiliated companies shared their customers' financial 
data with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Nader called on President Clinton to veto the package,  
terming it ``a threat to the safety and soundness of the nation's 
financial system and a reckless assault on basic protections for 
consumers and communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And some community groups, believing the administration had  
abandoned them by agreeing to a compromise on the community lending 
rules for banks, were furious. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rules now require banks to make loans in low-income and  
minority areas in which they operate, but they have been often 
criticized by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, the administration's chief 
opponent on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the compromise, banks wishing to expand into other areas  
of financial activity must have a satisfactory rating from federal 
examiners on their community lending and also to maintain the 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also includes a demand Gramm that community groups  
receiving money from the banks be compelled to disclose how they 
spend it. In another compromise, such disclosure would be required 
only for loans of more than $50,000 and most grants of more than 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Community Reinvestment Coalition said it was  
``appalled at the back room negotiating which considered the 
interests of the financial industry first and communities last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The securities, banking and insurance industries have spent  
millions of lobbying dollars in recent years on the overhaul 
legislation, saying it would help consumers by providing one-stop 
financial shopping and saving them money. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant based in  
Alexandria, Va., suggested there might not be a huge spate of 
financial industry mergers if the legislation is signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll see some deals but I think there's going to be some  
hesitation out there,'' he said in a telephone interview. Ely said 
such deals are ``tougher to integrate and digest'' than 
combinations within the same industry, such as banks buying other 
banks and insurance companies acquiring other insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidations of that sort likely will continue apace, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Even with the law, federal banking regulators have already  
allowed a number of banks and securities businesses to merge in 
recent years under special rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The best known of these is last year's $72 billion merger  
between the giant bank Citicorp and brokerage-insurer Travelers 
Group.

<HEADLINE> School Bus Driver Ticketed in Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CENTRAL BRIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- The driver of a school bus that  
collided with a dump truck, injuring 51 children and adults on 
their way to a pumpkin patch, was ticketed Friday for missing a 
stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
	A 7-year-old girl remained in critical condition Friday five  
other students and one chaperone also remained hospitalized 
following Thursday morning's crash in a rural part of eastern New 
York. Others on the bus had broken bones, cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus driver, William Treacy, 79, was accused of passing the  
stop sign and could be fined $100 and jailed for 45 days if 
convicted, Schoharie County Sheriff John Bates said. The bus was 
operated and owned by a private firm under contract with the Albany 
City School District. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board is also investigating  
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The dump truck driver faces no charges.

<HEADLINE> Schools Look to Software for Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- New software that helps highlight school  
trouble spots may help educators trying to avert violent episodes 
such as the Columbine High School shootings earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	GBA Systems' School Safety Software, formally called SSP2000, is  
designed to give school administrators an accurate way to track 
incidents of school violence and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools need to know what is occurring on the campus,''  
president Sylvia Stone said in an interview last month at the 
company's Greensboro headquarters. ``And they need to have 
information available to them quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the appropriate data is entered, the program helps users  
identify potential problems and repeat offenders. It tracks 
incidents by category, including offender, victim, weapons and 
location. The analysis capability is similar to that in several 
existing business and financial programs -- not surprising since GBA 
Systems' main focus is selling accounting and other business 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Bateman, school safety administrator for the Guilford County  
school district, used the software when a Greensboro middle school 
principal asked him to help identify places in the school where 
crime was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal thought the biggest problems were in the gym and  
cafeteria. But after using the GBA software, Bateman found the hot 
spots were in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	``The principal used the information to justify shifting more  
resources to those areas, knowing that his decision was based on 
valid statistics instead of a hunch, or a quick reaction to one or 
two incidents,'' Bateman said. 
</P>
<P>
	While school safety measures such as metal detectors or  
additional security officers can be expensive, Stone estimated the 
cost of the software to be less than $2 per student. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, nearly 300 schools from North Carolina to California are  
using the software as part of their security programs, according to 
GBA Systems. And others, including the New York City school 
district, are considering it as a means to get a handle on the 
problem of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	School violence experts say more accurate and timely reporting  
of campus crime would help administrators get a better 
understanding of the problems they face and allow for early 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we have encouraged for several years,'' said  
June Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety 
Center in Westlake Village, Calif. ``You cannot deploy resource 
officers to a particular school until you can see the problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Blauvelt, president of the National Alliance for Safe  
Schools in Berkley Springs, W. Va., also saw merit in the 
software's ability to spot potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A report issued by the National Association of School  
Psychologists before Columbine concluded there was a common warning 
sign in five separate school shooting incidents. Students who were 
isolated or withdrawn were prone to being picked on by other 
students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bullying was a common factor in all five cases and also  
at Columbine,'' he said. ``It should not be used as the basis for 
expulsion, but it can be used in determining if someone needs 
additional help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blauvelt said schools need to be careful however about possibly  
violating a student's rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a fine line,'' he said. ``Just because someone is  
withdrawn does not mean they are violent, but the student needs 
help to become reattached with the school community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GBA Systems' Ms. Stone is quick to point out the software is not  
a panacea. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can provide a tool -- and quite a simple tool -- to help  
schools make better informed decisions, then our goal is 
accomplished,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Faces Undecided N.H. Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore was chirping along,  
deftly fielding questions from undecided voters he hoped to woo 
when Laurrie Malizia stood up and stopped him dead in his tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving a human face to the purported ``Clinton fatigue'' that  
some say has hurt Gore's quest for the 2000 Democratic presidential 
nomination, the 42-year-old administrative assistant told the vice 
president Thursday that she was disappointed in President Clinton 
for his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Malizia declared she was looking for a leader who was ``an  
honest man but a moral man,'' and with her 14-year-old daughter, 
Kendra, seated by her side, she stated: ``I want your viewpoint on 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, his voice dropping noticeably, replied: ``I want to take  
my own values of faith and family to the presidency. I understand 
the disappointment that you feel, and I felt it myself. I think 
most people want to look to the future, turn that page and move on. 
So, all I can do is tell you about myself and about my commitment 
to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Gore recounted his personal history, his 29-year  
marriage and spoke proudly of his four children and first grandson, 
born on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Malizia said that she liked Gore's answer but would  
still think about Gary Bauer, the Republican conservative activist, 
before making a primary choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what impressed her, Malizia replied: ``The fact that he  
looked at me straight in eyes. The fact that he seemed disappointed 
in the actions of the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting today with New Hampshire members of AARP, the vice  
president highlighted his plan to make it easier for families to 
care for elderly relatives and pay for prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanne Farley, of Manchester, described the difficulties she and  
her husband have in caring for her 82-year-old mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	She said their biggest problem is affording respite care that  
would give the couple a break. ``If my husband and I decide to go 
somewhere together it would cost us more than $1,600 a week to 
bring someone in,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore repeated his goal of giving families tax credits to help  
pay for long-term care, and starting a national support network for 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a crushing burden that is often invisible to the rest  
of the community because the people who shoulder the burden don't 
get out much,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With a new poll showing Gore and Bill Bradley in a statistical  
dead heat for the Democratic nomination, the vice president's 
campaign pulled together a group of roughly 200 undecided voters 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The setting was pure Americana -- a dusty middle school gymnasium  
with 200 people sitting on bleachers and folding chairs. Gore's 
appeal was an equal serving of apple pie: ``I'm in this because I 
want to make a positive difference and I'm in this because I think 
I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly two hours, the audience quizzed him on a wide range  
of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	-- What can you do to make prescription drugs more affordable for  
me and other senior citizens? Include them in Medicare, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- How can we reduce smog and help my asthma? Get serious with  
the global environment, he replied. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Do you support work on 18 extra submarines at the Portsmouth  
Naval Shipyard, where I work? I'll have to study that, was the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum at the older of Dover's two middle schools came as the  
latest New Hampshire poll showed that Bradley, the former New 
Jersey senator and Gore's only challenger, was in a statistical tie 
with the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five percent of 600 likely Democratic voters supported  
Bradley, compared with 41 percent for Gore. Other recent polls have 
shown similar dead heats. An August poll showed Gore leading 
Bradley 46 percent to 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dover is a homey Seacoast City basking in the glory of New  
England's foliage season, its voters have been far from 
enthusiastic about Gore in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	As a presidential candidate in 1988, he finished fourth in Dover  
with 7.7 percent of the vote in the state's primary. Neighboring 
son Michael Dukakis was first with 37 percent, followed by Rep. 
Dick Gephardt of Missouri and former Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign said it picked the group of uncommitted voters  
after door-to-door canvassing and telephone banks. About 200 were 
invited -- some brought children -- and the campaign placed no 
restrictions on the content of their questions. 
</P>
<P>
	John Byrne, 45, of Dover, said afterwards he had been leaning  
towards Bradley but would have to re-evaluate Gore. ``The whole 
woodenness issue has been laid to rest for me. He's very 
personable,'' Byrne said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Buchanan's Bolt Bad for GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) -- Four out of 10 Republican voters think  
the GOP would suffer if Pat Buchanan bolts to seek the Reform Party 
presidential nomination, a nationwide poll said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion,  
said 16 percent of Republican voters surveyed felt a Buchanan 
defection would be a good thing for the party while 44 percent said 
it would make no difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is expected to bolt the GOP next week to seek the  
Reform Party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Among registered voters nationwide, Buchanan ranks fairly highly  
among the potential Reform Party candidates. Fifteen percent of all 
voters surveyed by the Poughkeepsie-based pollsters said they would 
likely vote for the conservative pundit if he were the Reform Party 
candidate. Nineteen percent said they would likely vote for Texas 
billionaire Ross Perot if he ran again as the party's standard 
bearer. 
</P>
<P>
	Also garnering likely support from voters as Reform Party  
candidates were Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, 14 percent; developer 
Donald Trump, 10 percent; and former Connecticut Gov. Lowell 
Weicker, 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll said 38 percent of voters nationwide had an unfavorable  
opinion of the Reform Party while 27 percent looked on it 
favorably. Thirty-five percent had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 761 registered voters was conducted Monday  
through Wednesday and has an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 
percentage points. The portion based on a sampling of 290 
Republicans has an error margin of plus or minus 6 percentage 
points.

<HEADLINE> Possible Alzheimer's Enzyme Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An enzyme that is thought to be part of the  
Alzheimer's disease process may have been isolated by California 
researchers, a discovery that could lead to new drugs for the 
brain-destroying disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers report Friday in the journal Science that they have  
found an enzyme called beta-secretase that has been linked to the 
formation of beta-amyloid, a protein that kills neurons in the 
brains of Alzheimer's patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The enzyme works by cutting beta-amyloid from another compound  
called amyloid precursor protein, or APP. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe that identifying the correct enzyme could  
lead to drugs that would block beta-amyloid formation. But even if 
drugs are found to inhibit the buildup of beta-amyloid, experts 
said they are still uncertain if this alone will slow or halt 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case is not airtight,'' Science said in a commentary.  
</P>
<P>
	Alzheimer's disease is a lethal disorder that gradually destroys  
the brain. Its most prominent feature is the slow loss of memory 
and the ability to reason. Eventually even the brain functions 
vital to life are destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the beta-secretase enzyme was identified as part of  
the disease process, many laboratories have attempted to isolate 
it. At least a dozen research teams have claimed to have made the 
discovery, but the findings have been disputed by others. 
</P>
<P>
	Another California firm, Elan Pharmaceuticals of South San  
Francisco, holds a patent on what the company claims is 
beta-secretase. It is different from the protein identified by 
Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
	Still another enzyme has been isolated by SmithKline Beecham,  
and researchers from that drug firm plan to describe their finding 
at a meeting in Miami this week of the Society for Neuroscience. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Science magazine reports that a number of independent  
experts say they find the claim by Amgen researchers to be 
credible. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have both cell biological evidence and evidence that the  
purified enzyme acts with the (right) specificity,'' Bart De 
Strooper, a Belgian neuroscientist, said in Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Sangram Sisodia, a University of Chicago beta-amyloid specialist  
who also commented in the journal, called the Amgen claim 
``incontrovertible.''

<HEADLINE> Congress May Revive Cleanup Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation overhauling the Superfund  
environmental cleanup program could resurrect taxes on oil and 
chemicals that ended in 1995 -- but not if a key House committee 
chairman can stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is attempting to blend  
together two bills that would cut down on lawsuit costs, remove 
barriers to redevelopment of old industrial sites and protect 
innocent businesses from getting tangled in litigation or 
unwarranted cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Many business organizations support the reforms, which have  
backing from both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. But 
other influential corporate groups and the House Ways and Means 
Committee chairman, Rep. Bill Archer, oppose resurrecting the 
excise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics say the opposition by Archer, a Republican from  
Houston, is aimed at protecting Texas oil and gas interests. But 
Archer said in an interview Thursday that he does not believe any 
industry should be singled out with a tax to resolve a waste 
problem unless it was directly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of what's right and what's wrong,'' Archer  
said. ``I would oppose this if it were levied against the steel 
industry or the electronics industry, if they were not involved in 
the creation of the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many corporate groups side with Archer on the taxes but favor  
the proposed Superfund reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax was levied against the oil and chemical industry when  
Superfund was created in 1980 because those industries were a 
primary source of toxic pollution covered by the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to see a bill get through, but that does not  
include the tax,'' said Mark Whitenton, a vice president at the 
National Association of Manufacturers. ``It has never made much 
sense, except that it was a convenient source of revenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others say the costs should not be borne by all taxpayers.  
President Clinton proposed reviving the $1.5 billion excise tax in 
his fiscal 2000 budget and repeatedly has called on Congress to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't reinstate the taxes, what you're doing is  
shifting billions of dollars from polluters to the public,'' said 
Karen Florini, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund. 
``These industries have a closer connection to the dump sites than 
the general public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The excise taxes were allowed to expire in 1995, saving the  
affected industries some $6 billion over the last four years. 
Enough money has accumulated in the fund that along with general 
revenue money the cleanup program can continue to operate through 
2002, including $700 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading Republican congressman on environmental issues, Rep.  
Sherwood Boehlert of New York, said the tax should be reinstated to 
ensure Superfund can finish the hazardous site cleanup job -- and 
then slowly phased out over eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to complete the program,'' said Boehlert, sponsor of  
one reform bill. ``I'm not excited about any taxes. But it's the 
responsible thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A main sponsor of the other Superfund bill, GOP Rep. Michael  
Oxley of Ohio, said many business groups are willing to accept the 
tax to get the reforms, particularly small businesses that are 
often roped into huge Superfund cleanups simply because they shared 
a landfill where hazardous wastes were dumped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like a reasonable tradeoff,'' Oxley said.  
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting this week, Hastert urged Oxley, Boehlert and others  
involved in the issue to put the two bills together and then 
present them to Archer's committee for a decision on reinstating 
the tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to reconcile some of the differences ... so that is  
the first step,'' Hastert said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Ski Safety Programs Broadened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Skiers and snowboarders have been told to rein in  
the recklessness this winter as the nation's ski resorts step up 
safety programs following a particularly deadly season. 
</P>
<P>
	With just days before the opening of some ski areas, resort  
managers say they're ready to strip season passes and daily lift 
tickets from hotdogging skiers who jet through congested areas, 
risking serious injury to themselves and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``More people will be more closely watching the slopes this  
year,'' said Paul Witt of Colorado's Vail Resorts. ``If people 
don't feel the resort is doing something about safety, they are not 
going to come to the slopes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increased monitoring comes as part of the ``Heads Up''  
safety awareness campaign by the National Ski Areas Association 
launched Thursday at Colorado's Loveland ski area west of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, 39 people died on U.S. ski slopes, compared with 26  
the year before and an average of 34. The worst season for ski 
deaths came in 1994-95, when 49 people died on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of overall injuries fell 50 percent last season,  
though serious injuries such as paralysis or other spinal cord 
injuries increased slightly. That was despite a 2.5 percent decline 
in national skier and snowboarder visits, the equivalent of one 
person skiing or snowboarding one day. 
</P>
<P>
	While insisting the slopes remain safe overall, industry  
officials point out that many deaths and serious injuries involve 
young men who ski too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve of last year's victims died on Colorado slopes -- nearly  
twice the yearly average. In one, a teen-age skier slammed into a 
60-year-old snowboarder, killing both. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an anomaly,'' said John Frew of Colorado Ski Country USA.  
``No one in the industry can remember the last time two people died 
in a collision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa O'Brien of the Park City resort in Utah said officials  
there decided to implement a patrol program after skiers suggested 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were complaining about people speeding through slow  
skiing zones,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Mom Admits Starving Two Sons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Eight-year-old brothers -- two of a set  
of triplets -- died after their mother starved them for days and 
scalded their feet in hot water, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bass, who had been hospitalized with severe burns, died  
early Friday, police spokesman Sgt. Floyd Mitchell said. His 
brother Larry, who weighed less than 30 pounds, died Wednesday at 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the worst case of child neglect I've seen,'' homicide  
Capt. Darryl Forte said of Larry. ``He was just a skeleton covered 
with skin. He looked mummified. It was like famine you would see in 
a Third World country. He basically died a slow death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third triplet was not abused and was placed in foster care,  
along with two other children who were not abused -- a 12-year-girl 
and a 10-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Mary Bass, called authorities after finding Larry  
unconscious Wednesday evening. She pleaded innocent Wednesday to 
assault, abuse and neglect. Other charges could be filed when a 
coroner's report is received, Jackson County Prosecutor Robert 
Beaird said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old mother admitted punishing Larry and Gary by  
putting their feet in scalding water, locking them in a room and 
depriving them of food except bread and water for up to two weeks, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor had no theory as to why only two of the children  
were apparently abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass told police it was hard to work full-time and go back to  
school while trying to raise the five children, and began 
withholding food from the two boys this summer when she had trouble 
controlling them. 
</P>
<P>
	The other children were checked at a hospital, found to be in  
good shape and immediately placed in foster care, Forte said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't shocked. They weren't screaming or anything when  
we told them we were going to take them,'' he said. ``In the girl's 
room, she had some books spread out with a notebook and a pencil 
like she had been studying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Bass, her children and her boyfriend moved into  
their neighborhood about a year ago, but were rarely seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never laid eyes on her,'' said Maxine Thomas, who lived two  
houses away. ``The man, he was introduced to me when they first 
moved in. He looked like a real nice man. But I never saw him 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baird said there were no plans to charge the boyfriend.  
</P>
<P>
	School teachers began seeing signs of neglect as long as two  
years ago, and alerted state social workers. It wasn't immediately 
clear whether all the children had been enrolled in school this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri Division of Family Services declined to discuss the  
family's case or say if it had investigated.

<HEADLINE> Possible Alzheimer's Enzyme Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An enzyme that is thought to be part of the  
Alzheimer's disease process may have been isolated by California 
researchers, a discovery that could lead to new drugs for the 
brain-destroying disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers report Friday in the journal Science that they have  
found an enzyme called beta-secretase that has been linked to the 
formation of beta-amyloid, a protein that kills neurons in the 
brains of Alzheimer's patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The enzyme works by cutting beta-amyloid from another compound  
called amyloid precursor protein, or APP. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe that identifying the correct enzyme could  
lead to drugs that would block beta-amyloid formation. But even if 
drugs are found to inhibit the buildup of beta-amyloid, experts 
said they are still uncertain if this alone will slow or halt 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case is not airtight,'' Science said in a commentary.  
</P>
<P>
	Alzheimer's disease is a lethal disorder that gradually destroys  
the brain. Its most prominent feature is the slow loss of memory 
and the ability to reason. Eventually even the brain functions 
vital to life are destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the beta-secretase enzyme was identified as part of  
the disease process, many laboratories have attempted to isolate 
it. At least a dozen research teams have claimed to have made the 
discovery, but the findings have been disputed by others. 
</P>
<P>
	Another California firm, Elan Pharmaceuticals of South San  
Francisco, holds a patent on what the company claims is 
beta-secretase. It is different from the protein identified by 
Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
	Still another enzyme has been isolated by SmithKline Beecham,  
and researchers from that drug firm plan to describe their finding 
at a meeting in Miami this week of the Society for Neuroscience. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Science magazine reports that a number of independent  
experts say they find the claim by Amgen researchers to be 
credible. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have both cell biological evidence and evidence that the  
purified enzyme acts with the (right) specificity,'' Bart De 
Strooper, a Belgian neuroscientist, said in Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Sangram Sisodia, a University of Chicago beta-amyloid specialist  
who also commented in the journal, called the Amgen claim 
``incontrovertible.''

<HEADLINE> Soybean slide continues / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices fell sharply today in  
early trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, extending a steep 
decline into a third day. Grains were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts of more rain in dry growing areas of Brazil and a  
technical followthrough to Thursday's slump sent soybeans to their 
lowest level in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of selling occurred just before the expiration of the  
November contract later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn dipped, pressured by the slide in soybeans.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also retreated amid weak U.S. export potential and a  
generally bearish outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 1 1/4 cent to $2.55 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $1.99 1/2 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.09 a bushel; November soybeans fell 4 1/2 centS to 
$4.75 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures were lower in early trading today on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle fell .27 cent to 70.90 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle fell .25 cent to 80.95 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs rose .45 cent to 49.20 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies fell .65 cent to 65.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Miss America Helps Homeless Vets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Miss America Heather French drew a  
congressional crowd to a Capitol Hill news conference Thursday 
where she opened her campaign to help homeless veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	With her crown perched on a nearby stool, Miss French said her  
father, a disabled Vietnam veteran, was the reason why ``a 
24-year-old fashion designer cares about veterans' issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss French, who was crowned on Sept. 18, said there were  
250,000 homeless veterans sleeping on the nation's streets and she 
had come to Washington because it was ``the one place that I 
thought I could make the biggest impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first Miss America from Kentucky was flanked by her state's  
Republican senators, Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning, and several 
Kentucky representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he came from a  
state of many Miss Americas. But, pointing to recent decisions to 
boost spending for veterans' programs, Lott said, ``I've never seen 
a Miss America have an impact so quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Higher; Dow Up 172.56 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, led by financial  
shares that soared on the possibility that legislation will soon 
allow banks, stock brokerages and insurance companies to combine. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 172.56 at 10,470.25, erasing Thursday's 94-point 
decline. The Dow ended a volatile week with a gain of 450.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also closed higher.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 18.04 to 1,301.65, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 14.88 to 2,816.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,945-1,076 down and 527 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 951.92 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
984.67 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.42 to 418.69.  
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks drove the market higher after Republicans and  
Democrats settled a dispute on bank lending rules that threatened 
to derail legislation that would overhaul the financial services 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the legislation would dismantle Depression-era laws  
that restrict banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies from 
merging. The prospect of new business combinations and a fresh wave 
of mergers lifted the sector, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Dow 30, American Express, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup  
rose solidly. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts suggested financial-services stocks were also ready  
for a rebound after being deflated by worries about higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these stocks had been beaten down and left for dead,''  
said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter 
Ltd. ``The market has known about this legislation for a long time, 
so I don't think it's entirely responsible for the strength of the 
group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no major economic reports to steer the market, investors  
were able to focus on the continuing flood of company reports on 
the just-ended third-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market has had two major worries: short-term interest  
rates and earnings,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at 
Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``This week, we put interest rates behind us a bit 
so that we could focus on earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Gillette slid following a report late Thursday that  
met most profit forecasts but warned of weak fourth-quarter sales 
and earnings due to inventory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow closed with a loss of 94.67 after  
recovering from a 213-point slide. The broad market also rallied 
late in the day, with the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite 
turning higher despite the discouraging news from IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, IBM warned that customers are postponing  
purchases of network and database machines, fearful that complex 
system upgrades will make them more vulnerable to the Year 2000 
computer bug. Today, IBM rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The stream of corporate earnings reports peaked this week,  
leading many market watchers to believe investors will once again 
focus on interest rates next week. Government reports on the gross 
domestic product and employment costs are expected to provide the 
latest sense of whether inflation is escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve will raise  
short-term interest rates at its next meeting Nov. 16.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Volcano Could Erupt Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- An Ecuadorean volcano that's been emitting  
smoke and ash for several weeks could erupt within days, a 
scientist with Ecuador's Geophysical Institute warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All indications are it could happen within a week or 10  
days,'' Geophysical scientist Patricia Mothes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16,456-foot Tungurahua Volcano, which looms over the  
now-deserted town of Banos, awoke from a 79-year slumber on Sept. 
15, threatening to engulf the popular tourist destination in a 
major eruption. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, authorities have evacuated 25,000 people living  
nearby and closed all roads and trails within 15 miles of the area, 
famed for its hot springs and trekking. 
</P>
<P>
	Mothes, who is monitoring Tungurahua's activity from a post near  
the volcano, told The Associated Press eruption could be days away. 
</P>
<P>
	The volcano has been spewing a steady column of smoke, ash, and  
steam into the sky, releasing enormous seismic pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the smoke and ash emissions stop, that indicates the  
conduit has finally closed and then the energy will release 
violently in eruption,'' Mothes said.

<HEADLINE> USOC To Vote on Drug Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Seeking to quell criticism of its  
drug-testing program, the U.S. Olympic Committee is expected to 
approve an independent agency to control everything from test 
samples to sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency would take domestic drug testing entirely out of  
the USOC's hands and remove the USOC and its governing bodies from 
the hearing process. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC board of directors, meeting Saturday and Sunday, will  
vote on whether to approve funding of up to $24 million for four 
years for the new agency, double the amount the USOC now spends on 
drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, one of the byproducts of this would be to take us  
out of the glare of the kind of criticism that we get, particularly 
from European countries, that we do our own drug testing, therefore 
we're the fox guarding the hen house,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``This group would have a board of directors and employees 
that would be chosen by itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, which would still use IOC-accredited labs in  
Indianapolis and Los Angeles, would be responsible for the 
collection of test samples, handling, processing, transportation, 
lab results, notification, sanctions and the appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can have scandals around the games like those we've  
experienced (in Salt Lake City), but those involve 
administrators,'' USOC executive director Dick Schultz said after 
Friday's executive committee meeting. ``But if we ever got to the 
point where the world thought every athlete that participated in 
the games was doping, the games would go away in a hurry. This will 
provide more credibility overall and a higher comfort level to all 
athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the new agency is approved, a bid process will be held to  
select the company that would run the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood producer Frank Marshall, a public sector member of the  
USOC who heads the task force proposing the agency, said the ``USOC 
will have a voice but not control'' of the group despite the plan 
to have it approve of some members of the agency's board. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, the agency is totally independent,''  
Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall called the agency and drug-testing guidelines ``a work  
in progress,'' particularly in regard to the testing of pro 
athletes who participate in the Olympics. Baseball, the NBA, and 
the NHL have different drug-testing rules and don't ban the same 
drugs as the Olympics. Androstenedione, for example, is banned in 
the Olympics but not in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the players unions will have issues with all of  
this,'' Marshall said. ``My opinion is if you want to go to the 
Olympics, you have to go along with the testing program. We can't 
have exceptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of independence is similar to one faced by the  
International Olympic Committee, which wants to have its World 
Anti-Doping Agency operating by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. drug adviser Barry McCaffrey, who has criticized the IOC's  
drug-testing efforts, met Wednesday in Washington with IOC vice 
president Dick Pound at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on 
drugs in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the IOC's third appearance of the year on Capitol Hill.  
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is to appear before a House 
committee in December to discuss IOC reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharpest criticism of the IOC at the hearing came from  
Doriane Coleman, a Duke law professor who helped set up 
out-of-competition testing in the United States in the 1980s. She 
called WADA ``a false start'' because it lacks independence and 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	WADA initially plans to conduct 5,000 out-of-competition tests a  
year and defer testing in some sports to existing federations. 
</P>
<P>
	``So long as testing continues to be conducted by the IOC or  
member entities ... then nothing's being done,'' Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound countered that since the IOC has only one-eighth  
representation on WADA's board, the IOC cannot control the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman praised the USOC's plan to remove drug testing from its  
control, but said it still wouldn't be completely independent since 
the board of the agency will be composed of USOC members or those 
selected by the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran defended the agency's independence. He said non-USOC  
members would be picked by ``public-sector members of the USOC who 
have no affiliation with USOC organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other items on the USOC board's agenda this weekend are the  
selection of the U.S. bid city for the 2007 Pan American Games -- 
either the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina or San Antonio -- 
and a report on restructuring the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by McKinsey and Co., which has been making a  
management review of the USOC for nearly six months, will recommend 
structural changes. Among those will be a redefinition of the 
duties of the president and executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations will require a change in the USOC  
constitution, which could not take place before the next board 
meeting in February.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Crash Kills 2 British Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVENPORT, Fla. (AP) -- A dump truck ran a red light and collided  
with a rental van carrying six English tourists to the airport for 
their flight home. Two of the tourists were killed, including a 
pregnant woman, and two were critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened Thursday at a highway intersection in  
Davenport, 30 miles southwest of Orlando. Witnesses said the 
tourists had been on vacation at Disney World and were en route to 
the airport to return to England. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was rented to Martin Griffith of Petersham, England.  
With him were his pregnant wife, Carolyn Griffith; their children, 
9-year-old Jordan and 7-year-old Megan; and Ronald and Linda New of 
Bedfont, England. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, Daniel Adams II, apparently ran a red light,  
the Florida Highway Patrol said. Charges were pending. He was 
unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
	New and Ms. Griffith died instantly. Ms. New, 53, was in  
critical but stable condition, and Griffith was in stable condition 
today, said Bill West, a supervisor at Lakeland Regional Medical 
Center. Megan was in critical condition and Jordan was in stable 
condition at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and Women. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the occupants in the van were wearing seat belts, Trooper  
D.W. Taylor said.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Fall on Brazil Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures took another tumble Friday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain in Brazil continued to ease concerns 
about dry planting conditions there. Grain prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
        Forecasts of more rain in northern areas of Brazil and a technical  
followthrough to Thursday's slump sent soybeans to their lowest level 
in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
        The wave of selling occurred as the November contract was expiring.  
</P>
<P>
        Corn edged lower, pushed downward by soybean selling, but losses  
were limited on a quiet trading day. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat prices were supported by continuing dry conditions in  
both northern Argentina and the southwestern U.S. winter wheat belt. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $2.58 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $1.99 1/2 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.09 a bushel; November soybeans fell 7 cents to $4.72 
3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
        December cattle rose .43 cent to 69.20 cents a pound; November  
feeder cattle fell .10 cent to 81.10 cents a pound; December lean hogs 
rose .50 cent to 49.25 cents a pound; February frozen pork bellies 
fell 1.28 cent to 64.82 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Clarifies Rate Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's financial secretary is committed to  
the existing fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, despite his 
comments in a newspaper suggesting the peg could be dropped, a 
government statement said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's Straits Times reported Friday that Financial  
Secretary Donald Tsang suggested Singapore and Hong Kong consider 
moving toward a common currency that could include other Asian 
currencies as part of a new global financial architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel brave and courageous in even uttering these words. It's  
the unthinkable. But we must think the unthinkable now,'' the 
newspaper quoted Tsang as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Hong Kong government statement late Friday said Tsang's  
comments on giving up Hong Kong's peg to the U.S. dollar were taken 
out of context. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government has no intention whatsoever to change the  
system. The Hong Kong dollar parity with the U.S. dollar has 
remained rock solid and unchanged since it was put it place,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fixed rate gave ``the essential anchor and stability for  
trade to flourish,'' it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's currency is fixed at 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to the  
U.S. dollar, and Tsang was reported by the newspaper as suggesting 
a common regional currency patterned after the European monetary 
union could fend off financial instability.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sign Hansen As Punter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the mystery surrounding Matt Turk's broken  
finger deepened Friday, the Washington Redskins signed 39-year-old 
Brian Hansen to punt in Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen has played with New Orleans, New England, Cleveland and  
the New York Jets over a 14-year NFL career. He averaged 39.8 yards 
over seven games last season before the Jets released him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best guy we worked out,'' said coach Norv Turner, who  
auditioned six punters and wanted someone with good directional 
ability to minimize the threat from Cowboys return man Deion 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, no one wanted to say much about a report in The  
Washington Post that cast suspicion on Turk's injury. The report, 
which appeared beside a lengthy interview with owner Dan Snyder, 
cited unidentified sources who claimed the Redskins suspect that 
Turk broke his finger playing basketball Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That would appear to contradict the account of Turk's brother,  
long snapper Dan Turk, who said he saw Matt's injured left middle 
finger on the plane as the team returned from Sunday's game at 
Arizona. Both brothers thought it was only sprained, and Matt Turk 
did not report the injury until Tuesday. He had surgery Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post report said that Turk could be fined for not  
playing against the Cowboys if it is confirmed that the injury 
resulted from basketball and not football. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Turk has not commented on his injury. Dan Turk stood by his  
story Friday when asked by a reporter. Neither Turner nor general 
manager Vinny Cerrato would discuss the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment on all that,'' Cerrato said.  
</P>
<P>
	Turner left open the possibility that Hansen could remain with  
the team for more than one game. Meanwhile, quarterback Brad 
Johnson will assume Matt Turk's holding duties on field goals and 
extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Hansen on the roster, the Redskins released  
guard Rod Milstead.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Prada Beats AmericaOne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Italy's Prada defeated San  
Francisco's AmericaOne in the challenger series for the America's 
Cup in a race marked by spinnaker problems for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	After racing was postponed Thursday because of gale-force wind,  
conditions were nearly perfect today for fast match racing among 
the syndicates fighting for the chance to take on New Zealand for 
sailing's most prized trophy next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most anticipated and exciting race of the regatta so far,  
with a breeze blowing a steady 15 knots, skipper Francesco de 
Angelis' beat the Americans at the start and built a lead of 24 
seconds by the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians hit trouble after rounding the mark, twice losing  
their spinnaker -- and their lead -- in the first downwind leg of the 
12.5 nautical mile course on Hauraki Gulf when a shackle snapped 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians made up two boat lengths on the next leg and were  
within striking distance of Paul Cayard's AmericaOne as they headed 
downwind towards the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Cayard looked to have held off Prada when, with just a few  
hundred yards to go, the giant green spinnaker burst and collapsed 
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada powered past and won the race by 17 seconds. AmericaOne  
raised another spinnaker but crossed the line with shreds of the 
torn old sail flapping from the top of the mast. 
</P>
<P>
	Cayard said tactical mistakes had been made on board AmericaOne  
and that Prada would have led all the way if it wasn't for their 
equipment problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserved to win,'' Cayard said. ``They had some bad luck  
on the first run and I think it was appropriate that we had some 
bad luck on the last run. I'm happy for the accounting to be that 
way. For the time being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was still confident AmericaOne would be one the boats  
in the challenger final series. 
</P>
<P>
	It was AmericaOne's first loss of the regatta, and ended what  
had been a three-way leadership deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada went ahead on points but has yet to have their bye. New  
York challenger Young America is also undefeated, but must beat 
Prada in their next race, expected Saturday, to draw even, and go 
ahead of AmericaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	In other races, the Spanish Challenge defeated Young Australia  
by 37 seconds; America True defeated Stars and Stripes by 41 
seconds; Nippon defeated Le Defi Francais by 1 minute, 53 seconds; 
and Young America defeated Abradabra by 1 minute, 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of races on today was half that of previous days  
because of a local racing regatta on waters near the two challenger 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
from seven countries score one point for each victory in the first 
of three round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Warrick Cleared To Play vs. Clemson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick will rejoin Florida State  
in time for Saturday's game at Clemson after agreeing to deal in 
which he will serve no jail time on a theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The star receiver pleaded guilty today to misdemeanor petty  
theft in connection with a department store scam. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement met the university's standard for allowing him to  
play. The school had insisted that the Heisman Trophy contender 
would not play until he had served any jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	School spokesman Mark Riordan said Warrick will play against  
Clemson when coach Bobby Bowden goes for his 300th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to (President) Sandy D'Alemberte there are not  
further barriers, legal or institutional, that would keep Peter 
Warrick from representing this institution on the football field,'' 
Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick has missed Florida State's last two games after being  
charged with felony grand theft Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a fair resolution for the state, a fair resolution for  
Peter Warrick a fair resolution for the university,'' Warrick's 
lawyer, John Kenny, said. ``And we know it's a fair resolution for 
our fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, a former teammate and a store clerk were charged with  
felony grand theft when the two players bought more than $400 worth 
of designer clothes Sept. 29 at a Dillard's department store for 
$21.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Crusoe agreed to terms in which Warrick will serve  
one year probation, donate the clothes to the Children's Home 
Society, pay $579 restitution, $295 in court costs, have no contact 
with Dillard's and spend 30 days on a work program where he will 
probably clean trash from city streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not wearing stripes, he's not in jail, and that's a  
significant determining factor for the university,'' Kenny said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mean to diminish what he did, but folks it was a  
discount,'' Kenny said Friday. ``I know the state attorney looked 
at it that they could find a way to make it a felony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old receiver was in South Carolina with his  
teammates for the Clemson game when the deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden goes for the milestone victory against son Tommy Bowden,  
the Clemson coach, in the first father-son matchup in Division I-A 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny and Warrick met Thursday night with Florida State  
president Sandy D'Alemberte, who had a problem with a player 
competing if he faced jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the jail or prison time behind someone before they  
play,'' D'Alemberte said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Kenny reached an agreement to reduce the  
charge to a misdemeanor with the state attorney, but that would 
have required the player to spend 30 days in jail at the end of the 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Dillard's clerk, Rachel Myrtil, pleaded no contest  
Thursday to grand theft and was sentenced to two years' probation, 
10 days on a county work program, ordered to pay $308 in court 
costs and stay out of Dillard's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Laveranues Coles, who paid for the clothes, was kicked off the  
Florida State team.

<HEADLINE> After 10 Years, Eurythmics Reunite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart weren't so  
polite, we'd never have the first Eurythmics album in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennox had her solo career, Stewart was making a documentary  
about the blues, and neither had considered working together again. 
Yet people kept asking them to perform at special occasions -- a 
cancer benefit, an executive's going-away party and a British 
awards show. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time, they agreed. ``It would have been ungracious to  
refuse,'' Lennox explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps predictably, the reunions reminded Lennox and Stewart of  
the strength of a partnership that produced a string of hits 
throughout the 1980s, like ``Here Comes the Rain Again,'' ``Would I 
Lie to You?'' and ``Thorn in My Side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So they began writing together again, not telling their record  
company until an album's worth of music was done. The first single, 
``17 Again,'' brings the duo full circle: The strong ballad about a 
rejuvenating love affair ends with Lennox slipping in a few lines 
from ``Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),'' the 1983 chart-topper 
that introduced Eurythmics to the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both knew our paths would cross at some point,'' Stewart  
said, ``even if it was the record company calling us up and saying, 
`it's the 50th anniversary of Eurythmics, can you come out of your 
wheelchairs and wave from the window?' 
</P>
<P>
	``But to tell you the truth, it was the last thing I was  
thinking of,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There had never been a formal split; they had just stopped  
working together. Five albums, countless performances and a 
professional relationship that survived a romantic breakup -- that's 
a lot to cram into seven years. They needed to spend some time 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a certain point, it's natural,'' Lennox said. ``You kind of  
eclipse each other's boundaries and that gets quite untenable. 
We're clearly very different people, with different likes and 
different tastes. We don't come as a sort of unit. What's good now 
is the fact that we get that, and it's absolutely fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their attitudes toward their jobs were bound to clash at some  
point, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennox is the sort of person who needs to be nudged toward work.  
She spent a few years after her last solo album trying to live a 
normal life away from ``all this,'' she said, gesturing toward the 
trappings of a luxury hotel suite in Manhattan, where she and 
Stewart were granting interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	To Stewart, the idea of living a normal life is a little nuts.  
He's a workaholic, loves to be surrounded by creative people, and 
juggles projects like his documentary and songwriting with Sinead 
O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
	When they convened again at the London church they had converted  
into a studio during their peak of fame, they worked for several 
weeks without talking about what their ultimate goal was. Practical 
Dave, realizing the bills were piling up, finally broached the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what it's like, though, with people who have a history of  
working together. There's no need to explain things. Each person's 
strength, each foible is known to the other. They have their own 
style -- writing side-by-side, sticking with a song until it's done, 
and not tolerating idle chatter from anyone else in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just easier,'' Stewart said. ``It's easier to capture an  
atmosphere that we both agree with. ... We never really lose the 
thrust of what the other is trying to do. I can see what she is 
getting at straight away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reunion coincides with something of a 1980s revival. Lennox  
noticed one day, somewhat to her horror, Boy George working 
downstairs from them. 
</P>
<P>
	So Lennox and Stewart try to distance themselves from bands that  
capitalize on nostalgia. All the proceeds from their current 
concert tour are being donated to organizations like Greenpeace 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt, career-wise, that I needed a revival,'' Lennox  
said. ``My career was hot to trot anyway. ... I just decided to 
walk away from it. That feels like freedom to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both of Lennox's solo albums were international successes.  
Stewart's career has been less publicly visible, but he says he 
doesn't need the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never have sounded like some movement, Dave and I,'' Lennox  
said. ``Probably the reason why the music has lasted is because 
it's not one particular style. In a way, we're not really connected 
to any particular decade. We just have our own sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new Eurythmics album was an unexpected bonanza for Clive  
Davis, president of Arista Records. He said he's been impressed by 
the enthusiasm fans have for the band in their public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had both sides covered -- he owns the rights to Lennox's  
solo music and Eurythmics music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love both for separate reasons,'' he said. ``I was happy to  
get this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The perspective granted by time apart has reminded Lennox and  
Stewart that their most important job is writing songs. That's 
something that can get lost in the seemingly endless cycle of 
touring and recording of an active, ambitious band. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can play the songs on just acoustic guitar or piano and  
sing,'' Stewart said. ``There are so many records at the moment 
where you just can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both are being deliberately vague about the future after this  
reunion. It's already a lot of unexpected activity to come along 
just because they couldn't say no when they were asked to get 
together and sing a few of their old hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't get any ideas, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not doing parties or bar mitzvahs yet,'' Lennox said.

<HEADLINE> Strange To Captain Ryder Cup Team  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Two-time U.S. Open champion Curtis  
Strange has been selected as the next captain of the U.S. Ryder Cup 
team that will try to retain the cup in 2001 at The Belfry in 
England, a source familiar with the appointment said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange, 44, has been considered the leading candidate to  
succeed Ben Crenshaw the day after the Americans staged the 
greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history last month to defeat Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA of America spokesman Julius Mason would not comment on next  
captain, but said an announcement would be made at 10 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange declined comment Friday at the National Car Rental  
Classic at Disney World, where he shot a 3-under 69 in the morning 
and covered the afternoon rounds for ESPN Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is what I've said before, and that is it would  
be a tremendous honor,'' he said. ``I haven't heard anything yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a source, speaking on condition that he not be identified,  
told the AP that Strange's selection would be announced Monday 
morning at the PGA's headquarters in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotional, tenacity,'' Tiger Woods said Friday evening when  
asked what Strange would bring as a Ryder Cup captain. ``It'll be 
neat to have him over there in that environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange has won 17 times on the PGA Tour and became the first  
player since Ben Hogan to win the U.S. Open in consecutive years at 
Oak Hill in 1989. He won the Open the previous year at The Country 
Club, and was among the candidates to be captain for this year's 
Ryder Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA instead picked Crenshaw, whose team overcame a 10-6  
deficit on the final day with a dramatic singles charge that 
included such raw emotion and celebration that Europe complained 
bitterly about the Americans' lack of sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	What began with just about every American pumping his fist  
culminated with a wild charge across the 17th green when Justin 
Leonard holed a 45-foot putt that ultimately clinched the cup, 
although Jose Maria Olazabal still had a 25-foot birdie putt to 
keep the match alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery was especially notorious, hurling vicious insults at  
Colin Montgomerie and reportedly spitting on the wife of European 
captain Mark James. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange will be faced with leading a U.S. team to victory in  
Europe for the first time since 1993 at The Belfry -- and with 
handling a potentially volatile atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next two captains, whoever they are, with the PGA on both  
sides of the Atlantic, need to go out of their way to diffuse this 
situation,'' Strange said three weeks ago during the Buick 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit, the way they were treated by our galleries at  
Boston was uncalled for,'' he said. ``Nobody deserves that. There's 
an etiquette not only with the players, but with galleries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He played on five Ryder Cup teams, though only one of them was a  
winner, in 1983 at the PGA National Golf Club in Palm Beach 
Gardens. His overall record in the matches was 6-12-2. 
</P>
<P>
	While Crenshaw was known as ``Gentle Ben,'' Strange was one of  
the most fiery players in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how he's perceived over there, but I know he's  
tough enough to handle whatever happens,'' Davis Love III said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strange won every year but twice in the 1980s, culminating with  
his back-to-back Open titles to close out the decade. He hasn't won 
since, and began working for ABC Sports in 1997. He continues to 
play at least 15 events on the PGA Tour each year along with his 
television work and remains close to the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would be a great captain,'' Love said earlier this  
month. ``He was great at Oak Hill (as a captain's pick). He was 
like a leader. He knew things to do pump you up, and what to do to 
keep you lose.''

<HEADLINE> WWII Memorial Finds Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction is beginning on a national  
memorial to Japanese-Americans even as officials debate whether to 
allow the monument to bear two controversial inscriptions -- a 
Japanese-American creed and a short poem. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Carter Brown, chairman of the U.S. Fine Arts Commission,  
suggested the poetry -- in the Japanese form called a haiku -- might 
be omitted. But he avoided giving an opinion on the text of the 
inscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the basis that 'fewer is better,' we would in any case  
leave out the haiku, which just on visual grounds is not really in 
a place that is viable from the point of view of other 
inscriptions,'' Brown said in formulating a resolution. ``It's 
linear on a curved surface. It has a lot of strikes against it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Groundbreaking on the memorial was to begin today near the  
Capitol. A 15-foot statue of two winged cranes struggling through 
barbed wire will dominate the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, some arts commission members complained that the  
memorial's board of directors had proposed too many inscriptions 
for the monument. The commission considered nine on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Atherton, secretary of the commission, said the chief  
objection voiced at this meeting was that the planned haiku would 
be hard for most visitors to understand. It reads: 
</P>
<P>
	``O, America  
</P>
<P>
	``Imperfect, stumbling, striving  
</P>
<P>
	``Lessons from the past''  
</P>
<P>
	The other disputed inscription is a ``Japanese American Creed''  
written in 1940 by Mike M. Masaoka, former Washington 
representative of the Japanese American Citizens League, more than 
a year before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud that I am an American of Japanese ancestry,'' it  
says. ``I believe in her institutions, ideals and traditions. I 
glory in her heritage; I boast of her history; I trust in her 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the commission could accept that inscription, again  
from the visual point of view. However, Atherton said commission 
members objected, noting there was no Polish-American creed or 
German-American creed so a Japanese-American creed also was 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry Tsutsumida, the executive director of the memorial, said  
its board of directors would review both inscriptions on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the memorial chose the texts from a long list.  
Many refer to the internment of 115,000 Japanese-Americans after 
Pearl Harbor. Presidents since the war have apologized for the 
measure and Congress has authorized compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	One quotation on the list, but not chosen by the board for  
inclusion on the memorial, is from Ralph L. Carr. In World War II 
he was governor of Colorado, the site of one camp where 
Japanese-Americans were confined. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a man may be deprived of his liberty,'' Carr said, ``simply  
because men now living in the country where his grandfather was 
born have become enemies of the United States, then we are 
disregarding the very principles for which the war is being 
waged.''

<HEADLINE> WNBA Expansion Teams To Join League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- WNBA expansion teams in Indianapolis, Miami,  
Portland and Seattle have met the requirements for season-ticket 
sales and will join the league as planned in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana and Miami will be added to the Eastern Conference,  
joining Charlotte, Cleveland, Detroit, New York, Orlando and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland and Seattle will play in the Western Conference with  
Houston, Los Angeles, Minnesota, Phoenix, Sacramento and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The league chose the new teams in early June and gave them until  
Oct. 15 to secure pledges for at least 5,500 season tickets. Each 
team topped the requirement and met other conditions set by the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by the league Friday was considered a  
formality, as the new teams have already made several personnel and 
organizational moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fan support demonstrated in each of these cities has been  
truly outstanding,'' WNBA president Val Ackerman said.

<HEADLINE> Schools Look to Software for Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- New software that helps highlight school  
trouble spots may help educators trying to avert violent episodes 
such as the Columbine High School shootings earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	GBA Systems' School Safety Software, formally called SSP2000, is  
designed to give school administrators an accurate way to track 
incidents of school violence and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools need to know what is occurring on the campus,''  
president Sylvia Stone said in an interview last month at the 
company's Greensboro headquarters. ``And they need to have 
information available to them quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the appropriate data is entered, the program helps users  
identify potential problems and repeat offenders. It tracks 
incidents by category, including offender, victim, weapons and 
location. The analysis capability is similar to that in several 
existing business and financial programs -- not surprising since GBA 
Systems' main focus is selling accounting and other business 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Bateman, school safety administrator for the Guilford County  
school district, used the software when a Greensboro middle school 
principal asked him to help identify places in the school where 
crime was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal thought the biggest problems were in the gym and  
cafeteria. But after using the GBA software, Bateman found the hot 
spots were in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
	``The principal used the information to justify shifting more  
resources to those areas, knowing that his decision was based on 
valid statistics instead of a hunch, or a quick reaction to one or 
two incidents,'' Bateman said. 
</P>
<P>
	While school safety measures such as metal detectors or  
additional security officers can be expensive, Stone estimated the 
cost of the software to be less than $2 per student. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, nearly 300 schools from North Carolina to California are  
using the software as part of their security programs, according to 
GBA Systems. And others, including the New York City school 
district, are considering it as a means to get a handle on the 
problem of school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	School violence experts say more accurate and timely reporting  
of campus crime would help administrators get a better 
understanding of the problems they face and allow for early 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we have encouraged for several years,'' said  
June Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety 
Center in Westlake Village, Calif. ``You cannot deploy resource 
officers to a particular school until you can see the problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Blauvelt, president of the National Alliance for Safe  
Schools in Berkley Springs, W. Va., also saw merit in the 
software's ability to spot potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A report issued by the National Association of School  
Psychologists before Columbine concluded there was a common warning 
sign in five separate school shooting incidents. Students who were 
isolated or withdrawn were prone to being picked on by other 
students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bullying was a common factor in all five cases and also  
at Columbine,'' he said. ``It should not be used as the basis for 
expulsion, but it can be used in determining if someone needs 
additional help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blauvelt said schools need to be careful however about possibly  
violating a student's rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a fine line,'' he said. ``Just because someone is  
withdrawn does not mean they are violent, but the student needs 
help to become reattached with the school community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GBA Systems' Ms. Stone is quick to point out the software is not  
a panacea. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can provide a tool -- and quite a simple tool -- to help  
schools make better informed decisions, then our goal is 
accomplished,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 5 GOP Presidential Hopefuls Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Five Republican presidential candidates  
staged their first debate of the season Friday night, agreeing on 
more than they found to argue about, after needling the 
front-runner who stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharpest line was drawn by conservative Gary Bauer in  
repeated slaps at Steve Forbes, his self-financed rival for backing 
on the GOP right. 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, trade and health care, Bauer made a point of disputing  
Forbes' proposals. ``Steve, that sounded real good, but we've got 
to go beyond generalities,'' he said after Forbes complained that 
Americans are losing control of their decisions on medical care to 
government and to health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington is gridlocked by special interests,'' said Sen.  
John McCain of Arizona, a champion of campaign finance reform. He 
said Democrats are beholden to trial lawyers, and Republicans to 
the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans trying to overtake the absent front-runner,  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, did differ on trade policy toward China, 
with Bauer and the even more conservative Alan Keyes saying the 
most favored nation treatment Beijing now gets -- which is standard 
for U.S. trading partners -- should be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, Forbes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah criticized  
administration policy toward China, but didn't advocate ending most 
favored nation rules. 
</P>
<P>
	More typically, after McCain rebuked Clinton administration  
policy on national defense, Hatch said he agreed with everything 
his fellow senator had said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes was the most talkative and confrontational of the lot,  
denouncing socialism, urging outright abolition of the income tax, 
telling the others to ``stop talking out of both sides of our 
mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hourlong forum was sponsored by New Hampshire Public  
Television, The Union Leader of Manchester, and New Hampshire Cable 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	C-Span broadcast the debate nationally.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush opted weeks ago to skip the forum, and one next week, too,  
since his lead in campaign funds and in the public opinion polls 
left no incentive for face-to-face encounters with his challengers 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the opener would be an appetizer for people who will  
want to hear from Bush. ``They're going to want more real debates, 
not just an hour session. They're going to want all the candidates 
involved and so I think it's going to put pressure on Gov. Bush to 
be more participatory in the future,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said afterwards that he and Forbes are battling to be the  
conservative alternative to Bush. ``I believe that Steve Forbes has 
peaked just as the foliage in New Hampshire has,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who had campaign stops in New Hampshire on Friday, said he  
had committed to a fund-raiser for Vermont Republicans at the same 
time of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	He also declined to participate in a debate next Wednesday  
because it conflicts with a ceremony honoring his wife, Laura, at 
her alma mater, Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign said it told the debate organizers before  
invitations were mailed to the candidates that the governor would 
not be able to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's debate came one day after the latest New Hampshire poll  
found Bush with a commanding lead but McCain strengthening his 
position in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone survey of 600 likely Republican voters, Bush had  
the support of 42 percent, about what he had in August. McCain had 
26 percent -- 10 points better than in August -- with most of his 
gains coming at the expense of other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting also came two days after Elizabeth Dole, the lone  
woman seeking the GOP nomination, quit the race citing difficulty 
raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Bush, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan also skipped  
the debate. He is expected to announce Monday that he is leaving 
the Republican Party to seek the nomination of the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, who has scored zero percent in some recent polls, said he  
brought more to the campaign than some of the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I like Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes and Steve Forbes --  
and I think they're good people, I think any one of them would make 
a better president than what we have right now -- I do think it's 
very important to be able to start working Day One, to know what 
you're doing,'' the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think it's important to have run for office before and  
have had the experience of having to face the electorate.''

<HEADLINE> Meat Diet Fattens Prices at Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The high-protein diet craze that has people  
pigging out on steak, chops and even bacon may be plumping up meat 
prices on the wholesale market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confirmed pasta eaters are now red meat eaters,'' says Chicago  
analyst Bill Plummer, who is among the industry watchers contending 
that the phenomenon is boosting prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-protein weight-loss diet has been promoted in such best  
sellers as ``Protein Power'' and ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet 
Revolution.'' It's a meat lover's dream because it recommends lots 
of protein instead of carbohydrates. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, prices are rising for meat and livestock  
futures, which are speculative contracts for cattle, hogs and pork 
bellies. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for beef is expected to increase 1.6 percent over last  
year, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said Friday. Demand 
for pork is up 2.3 percent this year, according to the National 
Pork Producers Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are in  
the healthy 70-cent-a-pound range. And fresh pork bellies -- bacon 
to you and me -- have flirted with the 80-cent-a-pound mark, 
surpassing even the traditionally pricier untrimmed pork loins, 
though at least some of the rise is attributed to the flooding in 
North Carolina that wiped out about 30,000 hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Vaught, a livestock analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St.  
Louis, say the high-protein fad is playing a role in bolstering hog 
prices, which traditionally drop when people put their grills away 
as summer and BLT season end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly don't think it's hurting,'' says Alisa Harrison, a  
spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. But she 
also points to healthy disposable incomes and an improving economy 
in Southeast Asia, especially in meat-hungry South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Hockman of the National Pork Producers Council says he is  
more inclined to attribute the increased pork demand to ``chicken 
fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Greenberg, a 28-year-old administrative assistant from  
Highland Park, Ill., says she has lost 18 pounds since mid-June on 
the high-protein diet. She buys big, juicy slabs of meat and fish 
and figures she easily spends an extra $20 a week on groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the good stuff, the filet mignon and the Angus beef,''  
she says. ``If I'm going to do this, I'm going to have the good 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Michael Swinford of Rosenthal-Collins Inc. in Chicago  
thinks the fad will be short-lived, especially since the American 
Dietetic Association recently called high-protein diets ``a 
nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the diet seems to be spreading, even to Wyoming,  
where third-generation cattleman Tom Herbst lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``My neighbor's doing it,'' says Herbst, who lives near  
Torrington, Wyo. ``I think it's a good deal for us.''

<HEADLINE> FIA Holds Hearing on Ferrari Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Ferrari made its case today before the FIA's  
International Court of Appeal in a bid to overturn its 
disqualification from last Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, to be announced Saturday by the FIA, was in the  
hands of a five-member panel of international lawyers, who heard 
testimony from Ferrari and two other F1 teams: McLaren Mercedes and 
Stewart Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing at the Hotel Crillon -- Paris' most exclusive hotel --  
took about four hours with Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine, sporting 
director Jean Todt and technical director Ross Brawn leading the 
Italian delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine was pushed and shoved entering the hotel and struck on  
the head by a camera as a photographer lunged to get a better view 
in a scrum of hundreds of reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari team officials declined to talk with the media and left  
without comment, carrying a black bag containing the parts in 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart Ford's Paul Stewart departed and called it ``a fair and  
thorough hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferraris driven by Irvine and Michael Schumacher finished first  
and second in Malaysia but were disqualified because their 
aerodynamic deflectors didn't comply with FIA regulations. The 
deflectors missed the FIA specifications by three-eighths of an 
inch. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision gave victory -- and the 1999 Formula One  
championship -- to Mika Hakkinen, the McLaren driver who finished 
third in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	A win for Irvine would have given him a four-point lead going  
into the final race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix on Oct. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari reportedly mounted a three-point defense: the deflectors  
didn't offer an advantage; the measurement might have been 
incorrect or should have allowed for a minimum tolerance; the error 
was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari, which has not won a drivers' title since Jody Schecter  
in 1979, also was expected to say the punishment was too severe. 
</P>
<P>
	It needed to convince the panel to invoke FIA's clause on  
``exceptional circumstances'' to overturn a stewards' decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel has a range of options. It could uphold the decision,  
change it to a fine against Ferrari and reinstate the points, 
reinstate the drivers' points but remove the points from the 
Constructors' championship, overturn the entire decision, or 
stiffen the penalty and disqualify Ferrari from the Japanese Grand 
Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaren's No. 2 driver David Coulthard attended the hearing.  
Hakkinen was on vacation in Asia, a McLaren official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, trying to protect the upgraded second and third places  
for Johnny Herbert and Rubens Barrichello, supported McLaren's 
argument that rules are rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams have to know where they stand on the regulations,'' he  
said. ``It's up to the court of appeal to decide if Ferrari is in 
the right or the wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Judges Allow KKK Hoods at Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal judges ruled Thursday that the Ku Klux  
Klan can stage a Manhattan rally wearing their white hoods, 
focusing on the group's First Amendment right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges sidestepped a discussion of the city's attempt to  
force Klan members to unmask by invoking a rarely used 1845 state 
law that bars groups from congregating in public places in masks or 
disguises, except for authorized parties or entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said it was true that the hood itself  
over the years had reflected hatred and fear but that it also had 
protected those who wore it from the wrath of those who hate their 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the message of hate that the mask evokes often has  
reflected ``everything America doesn't stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a Constitutional right was upheld,'' the Rev. Jeffrey  
L. Berry, 46, of Butler, Ind., national imperial wizard for the 
KKK's Church of the American Knights, said after Thursday's verbal 
ruling from the bench by federal judges Hellerstein and Harold Baer 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani criticized the ruling, calling it  
``another example of the ideology extended from the '60s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This ruling says people don't have to take responsibility for  
what they say or what they do even as they support organizations 
that encourage anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, racism and 
hatred,'' Giuliani said in a written statement. The city planned to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Civil Liberties Union sued Tuesday on behalf of the  
KKK after the city refused to grant it a permit for a rally 
Saturday unless the 50 to 80 participants expected agreed not to 
wear their traditional white hoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those supporting the KKK's right to march were activist Al  
Sharpton's National Action Network and the Amsterdam News, a 
newspaper that calls itself a ``significant voice of Black 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James W. Sheley, of Walden, N.Y., a KKK grand dragon,  
said the group chose New York for the rally to try to overturn the 
mask law. It has won similar court orders in Indiana and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry told the judges that KKK members wear hoods to protect  
themselves. He said that he and his daughter had been shot at, his 
house had been burned and he had been beaten because of his 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to allowing the hoods, the judges on Thursday said  
the Partisan Defense Committee would be permitted to stage a 
counterdemonstration as long as it did not drown out the KKK group 
with sound equipment during the two-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The snuffing out of sound is not a permissible exercise under  
the First Amendment,'' Hellerstein said.

<HEADLINE> Howard U. Hospital Nurses Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 400 nurses, dietitians, pharmacists and  
social workers walked off their job Friday and began picketing 
Howard University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the hospital remained open Friday, District of Columbia  
emergency crews were told not to bring patients to Howard's 
emergency room. ``We're rerouting ambulances to other hospitals,'' 
said Capt. Craig Dwyer of D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nurses have too many patients to take care of,'' said  
Evelyn Sommers, executive director of the D.C. Nurses Association. 
The union contends that forced overtime and inadequate staffing 
levels erode the quality of care and threaten patient safety at one 
of the largest and best known historically-black teaching hospitals 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipated absences for sick leave and family leave are also  
frequently covered by forcing other employees to remain on duty, 
Sommers said, noting, ``It is not an emergency if you've known for 
three weeks that someone is going to go on vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At times you're giving just the bare needs, but you can't stop  
to listen and talk to patients when they need it,'' said Joyce 
Purnell, a striking nurse normally assigned to the hospital's 
Intensive Care Unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 137-year-old teaching hospital has invested heavily in new  
technology in recent years, but staffers at the 340-bed complex 
have not had raises in three years, union members said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are among the highest paid nurses in the District of  
Columbia,'' said Howard University spokeswoman Donna Brock. 
According to hospital personnel records 57 percent of the nursing 
staff earns between $60,000 and $90,000 base pay. They also receive 
time and a half for overtime, and double time for holidays, said 
Brock. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials insisted Friday that they had negotiated with  
the union in good faith since April. They also expressed regret 
that a federal mediator had failed to resolve differences with the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials proposed a revised agreement Friday afternoon  
as officials from both sides said they would negotiate late into 
the evening as long they continued to make some progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working through some final points,'' said Brock.  
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of the strike, Howard recruited 50 contract  
nurses from California. They also hired additional nonunion local 
nurses.

<HEADLINE> Giants RB Brown Is Lost for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New York Giants running back Gary  
Brown is out for the season after arthroscopic surgery Friday found 
``extensive cartilage damage'' in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	After Friday's practice, coach Jim Fassel said that the injury  
and repair should not preclude Brown from returning next season. 
Brown cannot begin rehabilitation until he is off crutches, which 
could take six weeks, team spokesman Pat Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage to Brown's knee is a ``long-term wear-and-tear  
injury'' not related to a sprain that the back sustained in the 
final preseason game, Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown did not play after that until Oct. 3, when he gained 87  
yards on 27 carries against Philadelphia. He had 67 yards on 18 
carries Oct. 10 against Arizona, and carried 10 times for 23 yards 
Monday against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was performed by Dr. Russell Warren, Giants team  
physician, at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown led the Giants in rushing last year with 1,063 yards. He  
missed much of training camp this year with a buttocks injury after 
a motorcycle injury in June. 
</P>
<P>
	LeShon Johnson will replace Brown in the starting lineup Sunday  
against the New Orleans Saints, with rookie Joe Montgomery expected 
to make his first pro appearance, as backup. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> FIA Hears Ferrari F1 Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Any chance Ferrari has of winning its first Formula  
One drivers' title in 20 years rests with five international 
lawyers and their interpretation of ``exceptional circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari, with drivers Eddie Irvine and Michael Schumacher  
finishing 1-2, was disqualified at last Sunday's Malaysian Grand 
Prix because the cars' aerodynamic deflectors didn't comply with 
FIA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member FIA International Court of Appeal listened to  
more than four hours of closed-door testimony Friday. A decision 
was expected Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari, the biggest spending and longest suffering team in  
Formula One, is believed to have offered a three-point defense: 
</P>
<P>
	--The deflectors, missing FIA requirements by three-eighths of an  
inch, did not offer an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	--The measurement might have been incorrect or should have  
allowed for a minimum tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	--Any error was unintentional.  
</P>
<P>
	If the panel rules for Ferrari, Irvine will get his victory back  
and hold a four-point lead over Mika Hakkinen of McLaren Mercedes 
entering the season-ending Japanese Grand Prix Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari pushed to invoke a FIA clause on ``exceptional  
circumstances'' to overturn the decision. The odds are against 
Ferrari -- 12 of 15 appeals to FIA's appeals court over the past 25 
years have been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	If the panel rejects Ferrari's appeal, Hakkinen will keep the  
victory despite finishing third -- and keep his second straight 
season championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Any decision is bound to be controversial and open the world  
governing body of motor sports to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals panel has several options.  
</P>
<P>
	It could uphold the decision; change it to a fine against  
Ferrari and reinstate the points; reinstate the drivers' points but 
remove the points from the constructors' championship; overturn the 
entire decision; or stiffen the penalty and disqualify Ferrari from 
the Japanese Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine was pushed and shoved entering the hotel Friday and  
struck on the head by a camera as a photographer lunged to get a 
better view in a scrum of hundreds of reporters and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari team officials left the hotel without comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Stewart Ford team, trying to protect the upgraded second and  
third place for Johnny Herbert and Rubens Barrichello, supported 
McLaren's argument that rules must be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Stewart, representing Stewart Ford, attended Friday's  
hearing and called it ``fair and thorough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams have to know where they stand on the regulations,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Conviction Upheld of Ex-Miss. Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A federal appeals court panel unanimously  
upheld the convictions of former Biloxi, Miss., Mayor Pete Halat 
and three others on charges related to the 1987 slayings of a 
circuit judge and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Halat, Kirksey McCord Nix, Sheri LaRa Sharpe and  
Thomas Leslie Holcomb argued unsuccessfully before a three-judge 
panel from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the statute 
of limitations had run out in the case. The appellate ruling was 
made public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The four were tried in 1997 on racketeering charges that wove  
scams, drug dealing and coverups with a murder-for-hire plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Nix, already in prison in an unrelated case,  
bilked gay men of hundreds of thousands of dollars when they 
responded to fake personal ads that offered love and companionship. 
From inside prison, Nix persuaded men answering the ads to send in 
money, and Sharpe, his onetime girlfriend, and others would pick up 
the cash. 
</P>
<P>
	But when some of the cash disappeared, Halat blamed the theft on  
Vincent Sherry -- Halat's former law partner -- setting in motion the 
murder-for-hire plot, prosecutors said. Sherry and his wife, 
Margaret, a former Biloxi City Council member, were found shot to 
death in their home. Prosecutors said Holcomb was the trigger-man. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment did not indicate whether Sherry had actually done  
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, defense lawyers claimed prosecutors were too late  
in charging the defendants because the statute of limitations for 
conspiracy is five years. Federal prosecutors said the conspiracy 
to bilk gays continued after the couple was slain, avoiding 
problems with the statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Halat's attorney, Tommy Spina, said the case would likely be  
appealed to the full 5th circuit.

<HEADLINE> College FB Hall Faces Money Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Consultants made rosy predictions that  
more than 140,000 people would visit the College Football Hall of 
Fame in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate sponsors were expected to pay for the $14.5 million  
brick-and-glass building that was supposed to revitalize South 
Bend's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sponsors didn't develop, delaying construction by 10  
months, and tourists didn't exactly flock to the hall. Now the city 
is budgeting more than $1.32 million a year to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You make decisions that you hope are right by going through a  
process that you believe will lead you to make a good decision,'' 
said Lt. Gov. Joe Kernan, mayor when the hall opened. ``I believed 
we were doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never imagined that the hall would face the kind of  
challenge that it has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city was so optimistic officials even told the National  
Football Foundation, which owns the hall's exhibits, it wouldn't 
need to pitch in a single cent. But saddled with a financial burden 
it never expected, some city officials are looking to the NFF for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the City Council even removed the hall's budget from  
its own in an effort to gain leverage with the foundation, which 
has chipped in $1.3 million over the last three years despite the 
original agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also has started over in its efforts to market the  
hall, which opened in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes time no matter how much money we're spending to let  
people know we're in South Bend,'' said Bernie Kish, the hall's 
executive director. ``Once people come here, they become our 
ambassadors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city and NFF once thought word of mouth and a shoestring  
marketing budget would be enough to promote the hall. They didn't 
even hire a full-time marketing director until 16 months after it 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
	But their mistake showed as attendance came up 18,000 short of  
the first year's projected 140,000. Just less than 72,000 visited 
last year, and officials expect the same turnout for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The puzzling thing is no one seems to know why the hall hasn't  
lived up to predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	With its interactive displays that include agility drills,  
kicking and throwing contests, and coaching strategy tests, the 
hall is not just a collection of dusty sports memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors can even pay $5 for a video of themselves in a  
broadcast booth doing play-by-play to Doug Flutie's famous pass in 
the 1983 Boston College-Miami game or Cal's amazing kickoff return 
through Stanford's defense -- and its band -- in 1982, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hall of fame is the best one that I've ever seen,'' said  
Jim Host, whose Lexington, Ky.-based marketing firm was hired last 
year by the NFF to raise the hall's profile. ``It was built right. 
The people who run it do a great job. I think we just have to 
market it better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hall has made some progress in that area, persuading more  
than 100 colleges to give it free publicity by running a public 
service announcement during football broadcasts and publishing ads 
in game programs. 
</P>
<P>
	They've also redone their traveling exhibit this year with a  
brand-new recreational vehicle, and the hall is trying to raise 
money at campuses. A golf outing during Kentucky's celebration last 
month for former coach Jerry Claiborne, elected to the hall this 
year, raised about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a renewed push for corporate sponsors, with an  
emphasis on giving them advertising opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're looking for are mutually beneficial opportunities  
for the sponsors,'' Kish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall officials are hoping their efforts will pay off for them as  
much as they did for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The hall in Canton, Ohio, had 63,000 visitors its first year  
before jumping to about 80,000 in 1969 and topping out at more than 
330,000 in 1973. Hall spokesman Joe Horrigan said that since then, 
the hall has averaged between 200,000 and 220,000 visitors a year 
while it constantly tries to find new ways to publicize itself. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if attendance skyrockets in South Bend, the revenue  
won't come close to covering the $1.32 million the city is 
budgeting annually to cover the bonds issued to finance 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's financial burden could increase in 2006, when it  
expects to budget $3.2 annually for the bonds. The payments would 
escalate further in the last three years of the 25-year bond unless 
the city refinances. 
</P>
<P>
	That's led to gripes on the City Council that it's been had by  
the NFF. The accusations irk its president Bob Casciola, who's 
quick to point out no one forced the city to bring the Hall of Fame 
to town and that the foundation has done its best to help out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like the foundation has run away and hid and not  
accepted any responsibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mayor Stephen J. Luecke said he expects the city to  
renegotiate its agreement with the foundation to include a formal 
commitment of financial support. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what happens, the city still has millions to pay off  
on the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have that debt whether the hall stays in operation or  
not,'' said Luecke, who added it was highly unlikely the city would 
close down the hall. ``Which is all the more reason to work to make 
it a success.''

<HEADLINE> Gillette Earnings Likely To Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette Co.'s stock tumbled almost 10 percent  
this morning after the consumer products manufacturer warned that 
fourth-quarter sales and earnings are likely to decline because of 
inventory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast cast a pall on a third-quarter earnings report late  
Thursday that met analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette shares fell $3.68 3/4 to $34.18 3/4 a share in early trading  
today on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive officer Michael C. Hawley said  
Thursday that industry consolidations were a primary reason why 
Gillette needed to reduced inventories -- especially blade 
inventories in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that this corrective action will result in a  
fourth-quarter sales decline in the mid-single digits and a 
quarterly earnings decrease in the middle to high teens,'' said 
Hawley. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been expecting earnings of 42 cents a share in the  
three months ending Dec. 31. In the year-ago fourth-quarter, 
Gillette earned $435 million, or 39 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawley said that despite the lowered fourth-quarter  
expectations, the strength of the Gillette's core businesses, 
coupled with the changes ``bode well for a return to (Gillette's) 
historic high growth rates in the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Gillette reported third-quarter earnings of $352  
million, or 32 cents a share. Earnings, which were helped by 
increased blade and razor sales, were held back in part due to 
higher interest costs associated with a share repurchase program. 
</P>
<P>
	That result, which met the expectations of analysts surveyed by  
First Call/Thomson Financial is slightly below last year's 
operating income of $353 million, or 30 cents per share. Last 
year's results do not include a one-time reorganization charge of 
$347 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette's sales for the three-month period ending Sept. 30 were  
$2.51 billion, down from $2.53 billion in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston company's blade and razor sales increased by 9  
percent, and sales of Duracell batteries rose 6 percent, with 
Duracell profits up 25 percent compared with the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	But sales of Braun appliance products dropped 15 percent, and  
profits in that division fell by 39 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said unfavorable exchange rates and poor economic  
conditions in some markets were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, sales dropped from  
$6.88 billion to $6.86 billion. Net income rose from $646 million 
to $921 million.

<HEADLINE> MediaOne Shareowners OK AT&AMP;T Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- MediaOne Group shareowners have approved  
the proposed merger with AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a key milestone in the process,'' said Chuck Lillis,  
chairman of MediaOne Group. He said the company hopes to close the 
merger early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T chairman, said the merger is a vote  
of confidence in the company's strategy to provide millions of 
families with a choice in local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	He said after the company gets regulatory approval, the merged  
company can move forward in broadband video, voice and data 
services to more communities. 
</P>
<P>
	MediaOne Group is one of the world's largest broadband  
communications companies. The company also has investments in 
foreign wireless communications. 
</P>
<P>
	About 99 percent of the shareholders who voted on Thursday  
approved the merger.

<HEADLINE> Committees OK Medicare Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would restore more than $15  
billion previously cut from Medicare fees paid to health care 
providers is a step closer to congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration and Democratic lawmakers have  
raised objections that much of the money would come out of 
Medicare's trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We oppose it in its current form because it's not paid for,''  
said Richard Tarplin, the Health and Human Services Department's 
assistant secretary for legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees approved  
separate versions of the relief package Thursday, but without 
earmarking any offsetting savings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means panel also rejected, in a party-line vote, a  
Democratic amendment that would have required drug companies to 
offer the same discounts on prescriptions to individual Medicare 
beneficiaries as they do to bulk purchasers such as private health 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the $15  
billion in additional Medicare fee payments need not be offset by 
new savings because the legislation would only give back money that 
has been saved in excess of what lawmakers intended when they 
approved Medicare cuts in their 1997 deal to balance the federal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill has already been paid for ... by the overzealous  
cuts of the balanced budget act,'' said Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would give cash to hospitals, nursing homes, and  
others who complain they now get too little to care for the elderly 
and disabled. Health care providers have spent millions of dollars 
this year on advertising and lobbying campaigns aimed at winning 
back some Medicare money. 
</P>
<P>
	The desire to provide the relief is widely shared by Democrats  
and Republicans. It is expected to be the only action Congress 
takes on Medicare this year, after political divisions scuttled 
plans for a major overhaul of the program. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton administration officials said that the proposals  
approved Thursday could push forward by as much as a year -- from 
2015 to 2014 -- the date when Medicare's trust fund is expected to 
be depleted. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has suggested that some of the money needed  
could come from innovations in the way Medicare does business. 
Examples include competitive bidding by medical suppliers and 
giving retirees the chance to save money if they see doctors and 
other health care providers who agree to special discount contracts 
with Medicare -- much like the many private health plans' 
``preferred provider'' networks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Ways and Means and Finance committees on Thursday  
rejected amendments offered by Democratic lawmakers that would have 
offset the caregiver relief package with ideas like Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., pledged to  
consider such changes next year when Congress has more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my intent to move right ahead with major hearings on  
Medicare reform. I intend to do everything I can to build 
consensus,'' said Roth.

<HEADLINE> Gove, Heintz Tied in Nike Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOTHAN, Ala. (AP) -- Jeff Gove and Bob Heintz remained tied for  
the lead at 8-under 136 on Friday after two rounds of the Nike Tour 
Championship at Highland Oaks Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Fryatt was third after a 69, three strokes back, while  
Marco Dawson had a 68 and was at 140. Brian Tennyson (68), Jim M. 
Johnson (70) and Marco Gortana (72) were another stroke back. 
</P>
<P>
	The identical 68s by Gove and Heintz in the first two rounds  
marked the first time in the championship's history that the same 
co-leaders have led more than one round together. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Martin, fighting for his PGA Tour card, had a 71 Friday  
and was eight strokes off the pace at 144, tied for 16th with five 
others. Martin entered the $400,000 event, the last on the Nike 
Tour this season, 12th on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 15 finishers on the money list earn their exempt status  
to play on the PGA Tour next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading money-winner Carl Paulson had a 75 Friday and was at  
147. The low round Friday was by Curt Byrum, who shot a 67 and made 
the biggest move of the round, from 41st to 10th at 143. 
</P>
<P>
	Heintz is No. 16 on the money list, just $141 behind No. 15 Dick  
Mast, who shot 75s in the first two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gove, who ranks 20th on the money list at $99,692, failed to  
record a birdie on his first 27 holes at last year's Nike Tour 
Championship, but in the first two rounds this year has 12 to lead 
the field. Heintz was next with 11, and Fryatt had 10.

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Elizabeth ``Betty'' Stauffer Collinson,  
a past director of the media group Stauffer Communications Inc., 
and wife of former Independence Examiner publisher T. Hall 
Collinson, died Tuesday in Venice, Fla. She was 84. 
</P>

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Christopher Drogoul, an Atlanta banker who was  
caught up in a scandal involving $5.5 billion in loans to Iraq, 
died of cancer Monday. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Drogoul, the former manager of the Atlanta branch of Italy's  
government-owned Banca Nazional del Lavoro, was sentenced in 1993 
to three years in prison as a result of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Drogoul was branch manager of the Italian bank from 1984 to  
1989. Federal authorities said the branch borrowed money from other 
banks then committed the funds to exporters to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal came to light after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in  
August 1990, and Iraq defaulted on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democratic lawmakers alleged that Iraqi leader Saddam  
Hussein used at least some of the money to develop Iraq's military. 
Some also say Drogoul was a scapegoat in a larger conspiracy to aid 
Saddam before the invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Drogoul ultimately pleaded guilty to wire fraud and submitting  
false reports to bank regulators and was sentenced in November 1993 
to prison. Several co-defendants also received prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal investigation later determined that BNL's top  
officials in Rome were not responsible for the fraud in Atlanta.

flag of the People's Republic of China, died Tuesday. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeng submitted his design of five gold stars on a red background  
in 1949 in response to a newspaper ad calling for recommendations 
for a flag for the newly communist nation. The stars represent the 
Communist Party, industry and commerce, farmers, students and the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag first was raised on Oct. 1, 1949, over Beijing's  
Tiananmen Square by revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung when he 
declared the founding of the People's Republic.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ross Parmenter, author and a former music news  
editor at The New York Times, died Monday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Parmenter was on the music staff from 1940 until his retirement  
in 1964. He wrote news, features, criticism, and a column called 
``The World of Music.'' He joined the newspaper in 1934, covering 
shipping news. 
</P>
<P>
	Parmenter also wrote 12 books, several dealing with Mexico,  
where he frequently traveled.

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Raymond L. Sullivan, a former California  
Supreme Court justice and author of landmark rulings on school 
finance and injury lawsuits, died Wednesday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan was appointed to the court in 1966 after 31 years of  
private law practice in San Francisco and five years as a state 
appellate judge. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the court in 1977, then spent 16 years as a  
professor at Hastings College of the Law. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Sullivan's majority decisions found California's entire  
school finance system unconstitutional because each district's 
ability to raise money depended on local property values. The state 
was forced to equalize district funding and eventually moved away 
from local property taxes as a school revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of his majority decisions abolished a long-standing rule  
that denied all damages to injury victims if they were at fault to 
any degree in an accident. The ruling, which reduced a victim's 
damages only by the proportion of their own fault, became a 
standard nationwide.

<HEADLINE> U S West Earns $421 Million in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- U S West Inc., the Baby Bell telephone company  
being acquired by Qwest Communications, posted an 11.1 percent gain 
in third-quarter income to beat Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The provider of local phone service through most of the Rocky  
Mountains and Pacific Northwest reported Friday an operating profit 
of $421 million or 83 cents a share for the period. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't reflect one-time factors such as $282 million in  
costs from breaking an agreement to merge with Global Crossing, a 
deal trumped by a higher bid from Qwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Including those expenses, Denver-based U S West had a net profit  
of $139 million, or 27 cents per share, for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, when there were no one-time  
factors, U S West earned $379 million, or 75 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts had expected U S West to show an operating  
profit of just 80 cents a share, according to a survey by First 
Call/Thomson Financial. However, in Friday's trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange, U S West's shares slipped 43 3/4 cents to $59. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues totaled $3.32 billion, up about 6.5  
percent from $3.11 billion in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement was driven by growth in Internet and other  
data-related services, custom calling features and private line 
services, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Dock Strike Spurs Buying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEARL CITY, Hawaii (AP) -- Gina Agpaoa already had a 50-pound bag  
of rice at home to feed her family of seven, but she was nervous: 
There were reports that Hawaii's dockworkers might go on strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Like thousands of other island residents, she set out for the  
store to stock up. She was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing a strike that could cripple a state that gets 90 percent  
of its goods and supplies via ship, islanders have stripped store 
shelves of everything from Spam to disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Agpaoa found bare shelves at a Sam's Club warehouse Thursday.  
Rice and toilet paper were long gone, and gallons of milk were 
going fast. She grabbed Spam and Vienna sausages. 
</P>
<P>
	``People panic,'' she said. ``That's why we're running out.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 507 members of the International Longshore and Warehouse  
Union Local 142 are demanding a new contract with the state's four 
major shipping companies. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, dockworkers on the islands of Kauai, Maui and Hawaii  
have authorized a strike. The Oahu members, by far the local's 
largest contingent, were scheduled to vote today. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders could call a strike any time after that.  
</P>
<P>
	Since the voting started, residents have swamped Hawaii  
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got us by the throat,'' said Shirley Oshiro, 61, a  
retired schoolteacher who found rice but no toilet paper in a 
Waipahu supermarket. ``It's like we're getting rey for a 
hurricane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of her fellow shoppers made extra trips through checkout  
lines to circumvent rationing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wal-Mart in Hilo limited customers to 24 rolls of toilet  
paper, one bag of rice, two bags of disposable diapers and six cans 
of infant formula. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to make sure as many people as possible get the  
supplies they need,'' assistant manager Seni Kaseli said. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike threat comes just as the islands are recovering from  
a nine-year economic slump. Tourism is up, as are real estate sales 
and construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``A whole lot of things are finally moving in the right  
direction,'' said economist Michael Sklarz, chairman of the state 
Council on Revenues. ``You can't say anything positive about a 
strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The islands' hotels worry that tourists will hear something  
negative and change their vacation plans. Tourism generates a third 
of the gross state product and a third of Hawaii's jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``With any interruption, you ultimately get to that kind of  
concern,'' said Murray Towill, president of the Hawaii Hotel 
Association, which represents hotels with three-fourths of the 
state's 70,000 hotel rooms. ``As soon as it happens, then it feeds 
on itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii's docks were shut down for five months in 1949, and for  
100 days in 1971 because of a West Coast strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The dockworkers union wants a contract similar to the  
three-year, 8 percent wage increase West Coast dockworkers received 
this summer. Contract talks are to resume Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not expecting a strike,'' said Paul Stevens, senior  
vice president for Matson Navigation Co., whose subsidiary, Matson 
Terminals Inc., is one of the shipping companies involved. ``We 
want to keep the commerce to Hawaii flowing. We're not digging in 
here at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union local President Eusebio Lapenia also sounded optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't panic,'' he said. ``We're going to give it our honest  
effort to try to come to some kind of agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a work slowdown at the docks last week, there already  
is a backlog, with some ships still unloaded. If there is a 
prolonged strike, vessels would stay on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, people like Althea Kahai are preparing for life  
without rice. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always potatoes or poi,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Upgrades D.C. Counterterrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mobilizing for possible chemical or biological  
terrorism, the FBI has formed a special squad to respond to any 
attack in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-member National Capital Domestic Response Unit would work  
with about a dozen other federal, state and local public safety 
agencies in the District of Columbia, northern Virginia and 
suburban Maryland in the event of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take every threat that comes up every day seriously,'' said  
Gregg Horner, a spokesman for the FBI's Washington field office. 
The unit was spun off about a month ago from a larger FBI operation 
to deal exclusively with threats and suspicious packages in 
Washington and its suburbs, Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are chemical and biological experts, bomb disposal  
squads, and evidence specialists involved in the effort,'' said 
Horner, who added that tactical weapons specialists are available 
when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an FBI official, trained specialists are called to  
deal with three to six suspicious packages a day in downtown 
Washington. If necessary, specialists from the Secret Service, the 
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, the district's fire and 
rescue and police departments can mobilize hundreds of additional 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the area law enforcement agencies are working together,''  
said Sgt. Joe Gentile, spokesman for the Metropolitan Police 
Department. An investigator-liaison from the district's police 
force is assigned full-time to the FBI field office for 
counterterrorism purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, various agencies helped cordon off a 20-block area of  
downtown Washington when a homeless man found a suspicious package 
in an alley behind a hotel. The leather valise contained welding 
tools that had been taken from a nearby construction site. The 
agencies also cooperated in the investigation of a pair of 
``anthrax,'' hoaxes at the Old Executive Office Building next to 
the White House and The Washington Post building in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO summit in April was the type of event that the  
counterterrorism task force addresses. Another will be the New 
Year's Eve American Millennium Celebration on the National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all be working 12-hour shifts, '' said Gentile. The  
district's 3,520 police officers have been told that all leaves 
have been canceled between Dec. 27 and Jan. 15 to ensure public 
safety during the first weeks of the new year.

<HEADLINE> Glavine Ready to Duque it Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Orlando Hernandez's postseason stats make him  
look like Sandy Koufax. Against Atlanta, he's resembled Kenny 
Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Will it be Senor Smoke showing up for Game 1 of the World Series  
on Saturday night? Or will it be the ``El Duque'' who didn't make 
it past the fifth inning in his two regular-season starts against 
the Braves? 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy's really good,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said  
Friday. ``He's not starting tomorrow because he's average. He's a 
really tough guy out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, Bobby, not when he faces the Braves.  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Glavine, the Braves' starter for the opener, beat Hernandez  
7-2 when they met in New York on June 23, 1998, sending ``El 
Duque'' to his first major league loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez allowed six runs -- three earned -- and six hits in 3  
2-3 innings in that one, but that was a great outing compared with 
his 1999 start against Atlanta, when he gave up eight hits, four of 
them homers, and six runs in 4 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	So while he's 29-11 against the rest of the major leagues, he's  
0-2 against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, keeping up his season-long habit of saying almost  
nothing about himself, wouldn't address the question of what 
adjustments he needed to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be able to say, as far as my technique and  
approach, what I'm going to do,'' he said through a translator. '' 
Obviously, it's something I should do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine, 4-3 in the World Series and 10-11 in postseason play,  
lost to David Cone in Game 3 of the 1996 Series, but is 2-0 with 
one no-decision against the Yankees in the regular season. He beat 
Roger Clemens on July 15, allowing two runs and six hits in 6 2-3 
innings, and has never allowed more than two runs in any of his 
starts against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	He struggled this season, losing his first three decisions, and  
was just 3-7 before beating the Yankees. He finished 14-11, 
matching his fewest wins since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried so many adjustments, tried to figure out so many  
things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in late August, he finally got his mechanics straightened  
out, 
</P>
<P>
	``From that point on, the only thing I tried to do was get the  
ball and be as natural as I could,'' he said. ``A lot of it is 
mental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez seems to make those type of adjustments pitch by  
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can come at it at all angles,'' Cox said. ``He can get you  
off- balance, straighten you up and still make you lunge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees think it all goes back to last October and Game 4 of  
the AL Championship Series against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a 114-48 regular season and 3-0 sweep of Texas in the  
first round, New York won its opener against the Indians, but lost 
Games 2 and 3. It was the first time all year the Yankees felt 
pressure, especially because they felt they had to win the World 
Series to validate their record-setting regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez pitched seven shutout innings, allowing three hits,  
starting the Yankees on a 12-game postseason winning streak that 
only ended with Roger Clemens' loss at Boston in Game 3 of the ALCS 
last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Hernandez is 4-0 with a 0.97 ERA in the postseason.  
Koufax's World Series ERA -- there were no playoffs then, was 0.95 
but his record was just 4-3, meaning ``El Duque'' can top him in 
wins Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you do it, now you realize it's in your memory bank,''  
Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``Then you do it again, and now, we 
expect it every time we send him out there. It's not saying he's 
going to win tomorrow night, but I know one thing: He's going to 
empty the tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine says the key is not trying to change things just because  
it's the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many times,'' he said, ``people talk about somebody who  
steps it up, and it's like, OK, I'm going to step it up now, I'm 
going to throw harder, my slider's going to be better, my 
curveball's going to bite more and I'm going to throw everything in 
the black. I don't think you can do that.''

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Up by 29 / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States jumped this week by 29 to 750. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide, 139 were exploring for oil, 609  
for gas, and two were listed as miscellaneous, Houston-based Baker 
Hughes Inc. reported Friday. During the same week last year, 716 
rigs were operating in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil boom 
but set several record lows this earlier year, bottoming out at 498 
on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Texas posted the  
largest gain with 12, Oklahoma gained 10, New Mexico gained four 
and Louisiana gained one. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyoming lost two rigs. Rig counts in Alaska and California did  
not change.

<HEADLINE> Waste Management Has Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Waste Management Inc. acknowledged Friday that a  
massive audit of its dumps and garbage-collection operations found 
more accounting problems that will hurt its third-quarter and 
annual earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation's largest trash hauler said the findings also  
will pave the way for a recovery from its multibillion-dollar 
troubles, and its shares rose modestly on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were not surprised by the preliminary audit results or  
by reports that the intensive examination will lead Waste 
Management to take a $1 billion charge against earnings when it 
releases third-quarter results and audit findings on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully this will be the last shoe to drop for Waste  
Management. There have been several in the last few months,'' said 
Melville Cody, an analyst with Sanders Morris Mundy. 
</P>
<P>
	In early 1998, Illinois-based Waste Management took a $3.54  
billion pretax charge to correct years of shoddy accounting. The 
company was acquired later that year by Houston-based USA Waste 
Services Inc., which retained the Waste Management name in the 
$13.5 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Houston-based company announced a $250 million  
revenue shortfall. A shakeup of top management followed in August, 
along with the acknowledgment of a federal insider-trading 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing today is an indictment of accounting at USA  
Waste,'' said Doug Augenthaler, an analyst with CIBC World Markets 
Corp. ``Basically, they're just overpaying for assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates in Waste Management's search for a chief executive  
have been briefed on its troubled past, company spokesman Bill 
Plunkett said. Outside board members have been running the company 
since the departure of John E. Drury, former chairman and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	The board ordered the recent review -- involving 1,160 auditors  
at a cost of $3 million per day -- at its 1,200 facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're going to take a bath, you've got to get all the  
way in,'' board member and acting chairman Ralph V. Whitworth told 
the Wall Street Journal, which reported on the new problems Friday. 
``We want to deliver an absolutely pristine set of books to our new 
CEO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe many of the company's troubles stem from a  
failed acquisition strategy and cite the 1998 merger as the most 
obvious example. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really a function of a troubled company -- Waste  
Management -- getting involved with a flawed company -- USA -- and 
creating a giant problem,'' said Augenthaler. ``Hopefully they'll 
hire a good CEO and get their stock back on the road to recovery. 
But I think it's going to be a long, hard road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management shares rose 43 3/4 cents to close at $17.25 a  
share Friday as one of the most active issues on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Higher; Dow Up 172.56 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply Friday, led by financial  
shares that soared on hopes that legislation will soon allow banks, 
stock brokerages and insurance companies to merge. The rally capped 
a volatile week in which the Dow industrials rose 450 points, 
wiping out much of last week's stunning loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last Friday, we ended the week in a state of despair. This  
Friday, the market is in a state of euphoria,'' said Scott Bleier, 
chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 172.56 to close at  
10,470.25, gaining 450.54 on the week after a 630.05-point loss 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 18.04 to 1,301.65, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 14.57 to 2,816.52. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks drove the market higher after Republicans and  
Democrats in Congress settled a dispute that had threatened to 
derail efforts to overhaul the nation's financial services laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations involved legislation that would dismantle  
Depression-era laws that restrict banks, brokerage firms and 
insurance companies from merging. The prospect of new business 
combinations and a fresh wave of mergers rejuvenated financial 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow components J.P. Morgan rose 8 7/16 to 125 5/8 and American  
Express rose 3 3/4 to 148 5/8. Investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette gained 7 1/8 to 46 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts suggested financial services stocks were also ready  
for a rebound after being deflated in recent weeks by worries about 
higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these stocks had been beaten down and left for dead,''  
said Bleier. ``The market has known about this legislation for a 
long time, so I don't think it's entirely responsible for the 
strength of the group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no major economic reports to steer the market, investors  
were able to focus on the continuing flood of company reports on 
the just-ended third-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This market has had two major worries: short-term interest  
rates and earnings,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at 
Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``This week, we put interest rates behind us a bit 
so that we could focus on earnings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate earnings have, for the most part, met analysts' lofty  
estimates this quarter. But as expectations have soared, investors 
have proven willing to punish any companies that disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM set off a steep selloff by warning late Wednesday that  
customers are postponing purchases of network and database machines 
because of the Year 2000 computer bug. The Dow fell as much as 213 
points Thursday before most stocks began a gradual recovery that 
left the Dow with a loss of 94.67. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, IBM rose 2 15/16 to 93 15/16.  
</P>
<P>
	Gillette received a more gentle punishment Friday, sliding 1 7/8 to  
36 following a report late Thursday that met most profit forecasts 
but warned of weak fourth-quarter sales and earnings due to 
inventory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The stream of corporate earnings reports peaked this week,  
leading many market watchers to believe investors will once again 
focus on interest rates next week. Government reports on the gross 
domestic product and employment costs are expected to provide the 
latest sense of whether inflation is escalating. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are concerned that the Federal Reserve will raise  
short-term interest rates at its next meeting Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 2-to-1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 1.14 
billion shares, compared with 1.22 billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.42 to 418.69.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average slipped 0.05 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 2.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 2.0 
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.6 percent higher.

AT&AMP;T provide ``open access'' to high-speed Internet connections as 
a condition of a planned cable television franchise transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would require AT&AMP;T to provide access to MediaOne's  
Roadrunner service to rival Internet service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has authority to insist on the access requirement  
because it is being asked to approve the proposed transfer of the 
local cable franchise from MediaOne to AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T has a deal to buy 
MediaOne for $58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Without access to RoadRunner's fast connections, America Online,  
Mindspring GTE and other competitors contend that they cannot 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies and some consumer groups want MediaOne to be  
required to make deals allowing its competitors to resell 
RoadRunner access to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T must respond to the demand by Wednesday, City Manager  
Robert Healy told The Boston Globe on Thursday. He said he expects 
AT&AMP;T and state regulators to oppose the city's open-access demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say whether we are going to sue or take other  
action,'' Rick Jenkinson, spokesman for AT&AMP;T, told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In federal court, the company is challenging similar demands  
made by officials in Portland, Ore., and Broward County, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Judges Allow KKK Hoods at NYC Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge has rebuffed the city's attempt  
to keep the Ku Klux Klan from rallying in downtown Manhattan this 
weekend, ruling the group's wearing of hoods enjoys First Amendment 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour rally scheduled for Saturday in front of the  
Manhattan Courthouse will likely be held with Klansmen in trademark 
white regalia unless the decision is reversed. City lawyers say an 
appeal of Thursday's ruling was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of the  
KKK this week after the city denied the Klan's application for a 
permit. Officials cited a rarely used state law preventing groups 
congregating in public places in masks or with disguises, except 
for authorized masquerade parties or other entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	But while acknowledging the ``tortured history'' of masks in  
America, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ruled the 
disguises also protect those who espouse controversial viewpoints 
from their detractors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Harold Baer, joining with Hellerstein,  
quoted Oliver Wendell Holmes' statement that ``we should be 
eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of 
opinions that we loathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, their ruling did not declare New York's law  
unconstitutional, which Klan leaders say is part of their 
objective. Similar statutes have been struck down in Indiana and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani criticized the court's decision, calling  
it ``another example of the ideology extended from the '60s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This ruling says people don't have to take responsibility for  
what they say or what they do even as they support organizations 
that encourage anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, racism and 
hatred,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James W. Sheley, a Klan grand dragon from Walden, N.Y.,  
said he was ``extremely pleased'' with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 50 and 80 people are expected to attend the rally,  
according to the Klan's suit. A counter demonstration is also 
planned by the Partisan Defense Committee, whose right to protest 
Saturday was also affirmed by the court.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Mom Admits Starving Two Sons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Eight-year-old brothers -- two of a set  
of triplets -- died after their mother starved them for days and 
scalded their feet in hot water, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bass, who had been hospitalized with severe burns, died  
early Friday, police spokesman Sgt. Floyd Mitchell said. His 
brother Larry, who weighed less than 30 pounds, died Wednesday at 
their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the worst case of child neglect I've seen,'' homicide  
Capt. Darryl Forte said of Larry. ``He was just a skeleton covered 
with skin. He looked mummified. It was like famine you would see in 
a Third World country. He basically died a slow death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third triplet was not abused and was placed in foster care,  
along with two other children who were not abused -- a 12-year-girl 
and a 10-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Mary Bass, called authorities after finding Larry  
unconscious Wednesday evening. She pleaded innocent Wednesday to 
assault, abuse and neglect. Other charges could be filed when a 
coroner's report is received, Jackson County Prosecutor Robert 
Baird said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old mother admitted punishing Larry and Gary by  
putting their feet in scalding water, locking them in a room and 
depriving them of food except bread and water for up to two weeks, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor had no theory as to why only two of the children  
were apparently abused. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass told police it was hard to work full-time and go back to  
school while trying to raise the five children, and began 
withholding food from the two boys this summer when she had trouble 
controlling them. 
</P>
<P>
	The other children were checked at a hospital, found to be in  
good shape and immediately placed in foster care, Forte said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They weren't shocked. They weren't screaming or anything when  
we told them we were going to take them,'' he said. ``In the girl's 
room, she had some books spread out with a notebook and a pencil 
like she had been studying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Bass, her children and her boyfriend moved into  
their neighborhood about a year ago, but were rarely seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never laid eyes on her,'' said Maxine Thomas, who lived two  
houses away. ``The man, he was introduced to me when they first 
moved in. He looked like a real nice man. But I never saw him 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baird said there were no plans to charge the boyfriend.  
</P>
<P>
	School teachers began seeing signs of neglect as long as two  
years ago, and alerted state social workers. It wasn't immediately 
clear whether all the children had been enrolled in school this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri Division of Family Services declined to discuss the  
family's case or say if it had investigated.

<HEADLINE> LSU Has Mississippi State's Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi State is motivated more by  
a losing streak than its nine straight regular-season victories. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because no matter how much success the 12th-ranked  
Bulldogs (6-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) have had in recent 
years, they haven't been able to beat LSU, regardless of how bad 
the Tigers have been. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have beat us seven straight times. That's our No. 1  
motivation. We owe them,'' senior linebacker Barrin Simpson said. 
``It doesn't matter what their record is, they have talent and play 
their best football against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State, one of just seven undefeated I-A teams, is  
home for the first time in a month when it plays host to LSU (2-4, 
0-4) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the defending SEC West champion Bulldogs are off to their  
best start in 55 years, things have gotten so bad at LSU that 
athletics director Joe Dean was forced this week to publicly refute 
rumors that coach Gerry DiNardo was being fired midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	DiNardo knows the rumors and distractions have affected his  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``How positively and how negatively, that's the uncertain thing.  
I just know it's human nature,'' said DiNardo, the fifth-year coach 
who has refused to discuss his future status. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers have lost seven straight SEC games and 10 of 11.  
Their lone league victory in that span was 41-6 last October 
against the Mississippi State team that went on to win the SEC 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs haven't beaten LSU since 1991, coach Jackie  
Sherrill's first in Starkville. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the Bulldogs have won their first SEC football title  
of any kind since 1941, played in four postseason bowl games and 
won 50 games -- none of them against LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I've seen is that there are a lot of teams that have made  
some plays against them and that has hurt,'' Sherrill said of LSU. 
``But they've got an awful lot of talent. And LSU has always played 
us tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LSU is the next hurdle as the Bulldogs try to strengthen their  
position to defend the SEC West title. Three of their last five 
games are at home, but one of their road games is Nov. 13 at 
10th-ranked Alabama (5-1, 4-0). 
</P>
<P>
	With a victory over LSU, the Bulldogs would become the last of  
the current 12 SEC teams to start a season with seven straight 
victories. They would also have a 4-0 SEC record for the first time 
in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to think down the road, or we many never get  
there. There are so many potholes and so many curves,'' Sherrill 
said. ``Things could flip-flop in a hurry since we have five tough 
games in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State knows about those late season reversals of  
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Mississippi State was 7-2 before losing its last  
two games. The Bulldogs missed a chance to win the SEC West title 
and were left out of the postseason altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Bulldogs won the West and made it to the SEC  
Championship Game last year, they lost in the title game to 
eventual national champ Tennessee and then were beaten by Texas in 
the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our motto is to finish. We don't think last year that we  
finished,'' senior defensive back Ashley Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the last two years have taught the Bulldogs ``how  
to finish and to play the whole season strong. It helped us learn 
how to win and play in big games and finish out the season.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Weigh Panama Canal Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The general who commands U.S. forces in Latin  
America is disputing a contention by Republican lawmakers that 
China has designs on controlling the Panama Canal once the United 
States stops operating the waterway at year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, said Marine Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm, head of the  
Southern Command, environmental damage and terrorism may pose 
bigger threats to the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
	While minimizing any potential threat posed by Hutchison Whampoa  
Ltd., a Hong Kong-based shipping company, Wilhelm told the Senate 
Armed Services Committee on Friday that ``the canal must always be 
regarded as a potential target'' given its strategic location and 
importance for world commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	That vulnerability will increase when the United States leaves  
for good Dec. 31, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Panama Canal is not endangered,'' Alberto Aleman Zubieta,  
the canal's Panamanian administrator, testified. ``Its operation 
shall not be interrupted for any reason whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is looking into worries by conservatives that  
China is becoming an increasingly menacing presence at the canal. 
They point to Panama's 1997 award to Hutchison Whampoa of a 
long-term contract to operate terminals for container ships on the 
canal's Atlantic and Pacific entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is a publicly traded multinational corporation with  
major offices in Hong Kong and Featherstone, England. Its major 
shareholder, billionaire Li Ka-shing, has ties with the Chinese 
government, say critics of the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These Chinese companies do what the government tells them,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, a conservative independent from New Hampshire,  
likened the presence of Hutchison Whampoa at either end of the 
canal to ``having the Chinese army in Williamsburg'' and saying it 
would have no effect on ship movements in nearby Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lino Gutierrez, deputy assistant secretary of state for  
Western Hemispheric affairs, said ``we have found no information to 
substantiate'' allegations that Hutchison Whampoa has ties to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the company will have no control or authority over  
passage of ships through the canal, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhelm said the threat of terrorism remains a major problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to figure out when they might strike, or who they  
might be,'' the Marine general testified. He said Panama needs to 
strengthen its ability to defend the canal and suggested U.S. help 
in that effort. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited ``environmental degradation'' as potentially the  
biggest threat to the canal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deforestation of the canal through clear-cutting, grazing or  
development could threaten the watershed or lead to increased 
silting, ultimately jeopardizing canal operations,'' Wilhelm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caspar Weinberger, secretary of defense in the Reagan  
administration, said the United States needs to negotiate with 
Panama precise terms under which the U.S. military might intervene 
to open the canal if it were blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panama Canal treaties, ratified by the Senate in 1978, give  
the United States the right to intervene militarily should the 
canal be closed or traffic through it hindered.

<HEADLINE> Water Fluoridation a Health Boon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Adding fluoride to the water supply led to a  
sharp decline in children's cavities during the second half of the 
20th century, federal researchers reported this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report issued Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention called the drop one of the century's most significant 
advances in public health. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning of the century, nearly everyone in every age  
group in the United States had some sort of tooth decay. The most 
common treatment was to simply remove the teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, tooth decay was so rampant that the leading cause for  
rejection from the military during both world wars was a shortage 
of teeth, the CDC said in its latest report on the century's health 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1931, the National Institute of Health hired dental surgeon  
H. Trendley Dean to study discolored tooth enamel. In trying to 
find out whether fluoride -- a mineral found in food and water -- was 
the culprit, he learned it decreased the number of cavities. 
</P>
<P>
	Many cities quickly added fluoride to their public water  
supplies. The result was a 40 percent to 70 percent decline in 
cavities among children during the second half of the century. 
Fluoride also added to toothpaste, mouth rinses, tablets and drops. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the report said, ``tooth loss is no longer  
considered inevitable, and increasingly adults in the United States 
are retaining most of their teeth for a lifetime.''

<HEADLINE> Father-Son Matchup On the Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Saturday night will probably find Ann  
Bowden sitting way up in the stands of Memorial Stadium, where she 
can let her emotions out without anyone noticing. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side of the field will be her husband, Bobby, the coach  
of top-ranked Florida State. On the other will be her son Tommy, 
the coach of Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time in history a father has coached  
against his son in a major college football game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden, 69, will be trying to become the fifth big-time  
coach to win 300 games and join such legends as Bear Bryant and Joe 
Paterno. His 45-year-old son will be trying to stop him. The stakes 
are especially high for the elder Bowden, whose No. 1-ranked 
Florida State team, with a 7-0 record, is vying for the national 
championship. Clemson is 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm going to retreat up to the end zone in a high seat  
and sit there so I can kind of let my emotions hang out,'' said 
Mrs. Bowden, Bobby's wife of 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 20 years, the Bowdens have been college football's  
first family of coaching. Three of Bobby's four sons went into 
coaching, and two daughters are married to former football players, 
one of whom is now a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, with most of the Bowden family on hand, father will  
try to outfox son, and son will counter with every trick he has 
picked up from his father, all on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told my players not to think about that Tommy boy stuff,''  
Bobby said Thursday, ``because it ain't going to be no friendly 
affair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was inevitable Bobby would end up coaching against one of his  
sons. It was supposed to be Terry, until he resigned last year as 
the coach of Auburn. But it may be fitting that Tommy is about to 
become the first to match wits against his father. They are similar 
in so many ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I've observed all my children coming up, Tommy's reactions  
and responses were more like I felt I used to be,'' Bobby said. 
``He's a scaredy cat. I was usually afraid to try things. Cautious, 
I guess you would say. It's like going into a cold swimming pool. 
Terry would just run and jump in, never even look to see if they 
had water in there. And Jeffrey and my older son Steve, they were 
both very much the same way, they'd jump right in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As early as sixth grade, Tommy wrote a class paper about  
becoming a football coach like Dad. Later, Tommy was a wide 
receiver at West Virginia for his father in the early 1970s. When 
fans hung his father in effigy from a tree after a tough loss, it 
was Tommy who took down the figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he took the job last year at Clemson, which is in the  
same conference as Florida State, Tommy talked to his father on the 
phone several times a week. In addition to religion and life in 
general, they talked football, exchanging game films, discussing 
strategy and trading stories. 
</P>
<P>
	This year is different. The calls are down to two a week, and  
there's no exchange of films. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way can we share the things we usually do,'' Bobby told  
Tommy. ``Now that we're playing, I have to be very careful. I don't 
reveal any secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked this week if he would feel any guilt if Clemson upset  
Florida State and spoiled his father's chance of winning a national 
title, Tommy said: ``No. None whatsoever. There would be none for 
him, either.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Upgrades D.C. Counterterrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mobilizing for possible chemical or biological  
terrorism, the FBI has formed a special squad to respond to any 
attack in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-member National Capital Domestic Response Unit would work  
with about a dozen other federal, state and local public safety 
agencies in the District of Columbia, northern Virginia and 
suburban Maryland in the event of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take every threat that comes up every day seriously,'' said  
Gregg Horner, a spokesman for the FBI's Washington field office. 
The unit was spun off about a month ago from a larger FBI operation 
to deal exclusively with threats and suspicious packages in 
Washington and its suburbs, Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are chemical and biological experts, bomb disposal  
squads, and evidence specialists involved in the effort,'' said 
Horner, who added that tactical weapons specialists are available 
when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an FBI official, trained specialists are called to  
deal with three to six suspicious packages a day in downtown 
Washington. If necessary, specialists from the Secret Service, the 
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, the district's fire and 
rescue and police departments can mobilize hundreds of additional 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the area law enforcement agencies are working together,''  
said Sgt. Joe Gentile, spokesman for the Metropolitan Police 
Department. An investigator-liaison from the district's police 
force is assigned full-time to the FBI field office for 
counterterrorism purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, various agencies helped cordon off a 20-block area of  
downtown Washington when a homeless man found a suspicious package 
in an alley behind a hotel. The leather valise contained welding 
tools that had been taken from a nearby construction site. The 
agencies also cooperated in the investigation of a pair of 
``anthrax,'' hoaxes at the Old Executive Office Building next to 
the White House and The Washington Post building in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO summit in April was the type of event that the  
counterterrorism task force addresses. Another will be the New 
Year's Eve American Millennium Celebration on the National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll all be working 12-hour shifts, '' said Gentile. The  
district's 3,520 police officers have been told that all leaves 
have been canceled between Dec. 27 and Jan. 15 to ensure public 
safety during the first weeks of the new year.

<HEADLINE> FIA Holds Hearing on Ferrari Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Ferrari officials met with FIA's International  
Court of Appeal today in their bid to overturn the team's 
disqualification from last Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine and sporting director Jean Todt were  
among the team's delegation arriving at the Hotel Crillon -- Paris' 
most exclusive hotel -- where the five-member court was meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari team officials declined to talk with dozens of reporters  
congregated outside the hotel. It was unclear if the FIA would make 
a statement today, although it scheduled a news conference Saturday 
morning to announce the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari cars, driven by Irvine and Michael Schumacher, finished  
first and second in Malaysia, but were disqualified because their 
aerodynamic deflectors didn't comply with FIA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision gave victory -- and the 1999 Formula One  
championship -- to Mika Hakkinen, the McLaren driver who finished 
third in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	A win for Irvine would have given the British driver a  
four-point lead heading into the final race of the season, the 
Japanese Grand Prix on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari says that the wind deflectors, while unauthorized,  
didn't give its drivers any advantage, and that the punishment is 
far too severe since it effectively hands the title to McLaren. 
</P>
<P>
	It needs to convince the panel to invoke FIA's murky clause on  
``exceptional circumstances'' to overturn a stewards' decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel is being chaired by Jose Macedo e Cunha of Portugal.  
Other members are: Gerhard Nurscher of Austria, Philipp Roberti de 
Winghe of Belgium, Vassilis Koussis of Greece and Jan van Rosmalen 
of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The FIA described the five people as knowledgeable of auto  
racing, but no longer involved in the sport.

	Russia Contradicts Itself on Chechnya  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian officials contradicted themselves  
Friday on whether their forces were responsible for the attack that 
killed at least 143 people in Chechnya's capital, with political 
leaders denying any Russian role even after a military spokesman 
said it was a special operation. At least 10 Russian missiles 
slammed into the central market in Grozny and other parts of the 
city center on Thursday. Chechnya's Health Ministry put the death 
toll at 143. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin confirmed that 
there had been a blast at the market, but he stressed it was a 
weapons base.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt recalled ``a  
sad chapter'' in U.S. history today as he joined in breaking ground 
near the Capitol for a memorial to Japanese-Americans who were 
interned or fought during World War II. More than 115,000 
Japanese-Americans were interned during World War II. The Japanese 
American Memorial Commission surpassed its goal of $8.6 million to 
build the monument, due to be completed in a year. It collected 
$10.1 million and now hopes to reach $11 million by the end of the 
year. The surplus is to be used for an educational campaign.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed today to  
hear Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski's request for a new trial, where 
he would face a possible death sentence. Kaczynski, a 
Harvard-trained mathematician who became a recluse, pleaded guilty 
in 1998 to mail bombings that killed three people and injured 23. 
The Justice Department had agreed to the guilty plea and life 
sentence after a psychiatric examination concluded Kaczynski was a 
paranoid schizophrenic but competent to stand trial. The exam had 
been arranged by Kaczynski's lawyers over his objections.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iowa and New Hampshire will have the kickoff  
of the Democratic presidential selection process all to themselves 
after a panel refused today to allow four other states to move 
their contests into February behind the leaders. A rules panel of 
the Democratic National Committee denied requests from Arizona, 
Michigan, South Carolina and Washington state to move their 
presidential primaries or caucuses into February. They sought the 
change to save money and stay competitive with state Republican 
parties that have moved events into February.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House liberals said Democratic presidential

``bloodletting'' negative campaign against Vice President Al Gore. 
Bradley also picked up an endorsement from Rep. Diana DeGette, 
D-Colo., only the third House member to publicly back the former 
New Jersey senator. Three Senate Democrats have also endorsed 
Bradley. Bradley told a closed-door meeting of about 20 members of 
the House Progressive Caucus that he thought personal attacks were 
ineffective and would hurt the Democratic Party, participants said 
afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes FCC on Digital TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is urging federal  
regulators to examine how broadcasters can pay back the public for 
getting valuable digital television channels from the government 
for free. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill  
Kennard, Gore recommended that the FCC hold a public proceeding to 
consider the obligations of broadcasters in the new world of 
digital television. 
</P>
<P>
	A presidential commission last year offered a number of  
recommendations on how broadcasters could fulfill their public 
interest obligations. Namely, the panel suggested that 
broadcasters, along with cable networks and satellite companies, 
provide five minutes of free air time per day in the 30 days 
leading up to an election. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter dated Oct. 20, Gore urged the FCC to address this  
issue and another suggestion that blanket bans on the sale of air 
time to all state and local political candidates should be 
prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge you to evaluate to what extent the broadcasters are  
meeting voluntary commitments to improving the public discourse on 
the airwaves, including free air time,'' the vice president wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard said Friday he would take into consideration the vice  
president's letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm committed to a productive dialogue with consumers and  
broadcasters about the public interest as we transition to the 
digital age,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also asked the FCC to consider in public  
proceedings these other issues: 
</P>
<P>
	--Having broadcasters, emergency communication specialists and  
manufacturers work with federal agencies to determine how they can 
use digital technology to give Americans more precise disaster 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	--Expanding broadcasters' obligations to provide closed  
captioning and video description services to ensure that those with 
hearing and vision disabilities have access to digital programming 
and services. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establishing rules to help ensure non-discrimination in  
employment in the broadcast industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In return for using existing analog channels, broadcasters now  
have obligations, among them the airing of public-affairs and 
educational children's programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital technology offers improved picture and sound over  
existing analog channels and gives stations the ability to offer 
more channels and services in existing airwave space.

<HEADLINE> Bauer, Keyes Meet in GOP Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DERRY, N.H. (AP) -- Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes were the only  
participants in New Hampshire's first forum for Republican 
presidential candidates and both took advantage of the opportunity 
to blast their rivals for failing to show up. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah planned to attend, but was detained in  
Washington. He offered greetings and an apology by satellite before 
Thursday night's half-hour event. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer and Keyes criticized their opponents -- and Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush in particular -- for their unwillingness to attend 
the WNDS-TV forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's sad Gov. Bush has not shown up tonight,'' Bauer  
said. ``I think the front-runners in the party are relying on their 
bank accounts, not their ideas. I think that's going to backfire on 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes agreed, calling the absence of other candidates a  
``reflection of their contempt for the democratic process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a bunch of people who think this race is already  
determined by their name or their money,'' the former U.N. 
ambassador said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the event's host took a not-so-subtle jab at the absentees.  
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you wonder whether other candidates with more dollars  
and higher poll numbers really want to debate,'' said news director 
Jack Heath. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most recent poll by the American Research Group Inc. of  
Manchester, Keyes and Bauer were in low single digits while Hatch 
registered 0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer and Keyes are both courting Christian conservatives. When  
asked how they would persuade other voters to support them, Keyes 
said his goals stem from the fundamental principles the country was 
founded upon, ideals that transcend religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter what someone's race or background is because  
we can stand as Americans together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said he doesn't hide his faith, but is running as a  
``Reagan Republican'' whose views on the economy and other key 
issues will appeal to a wide segment of voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last time I checked, Buddhists were as concerned about lower  
taxes as anyone,'' said Bauer, who was vice president of a group 
called Focus on the Family from 1989 until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair diverged most widely on the campaign finance issue,  
with Bauer supporting a ban on soft money contributions to 
political parties and an increase in the limit on donations that 
individuals can make to campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't have government financing of campaigns, but I do  
think we should have reform,'' he said. ``If someone can write a $5 
million check and give it to the Democratic National Committee or 
the Republican National Committee, that's going to buy some 
access.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes said campaign financing should be completely unregulated.  
</P>
<P>
	``We ought to abolish this whole phony system of regulation,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes said only individual voters should be able to contribute  
to campaigns, but should be allowed to do so without limits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be total publicity,'' he said. ``The minute they  
give that donation, everyone in American ought to know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates said the growing incidence of school violence  
stems from a breakdown in families and the nation's moral decline. 
They also agreed that the federal government has too much control 
over education.

<HEADLINE> Tide To Host Vols in Tuscaloosa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) -- The last time Tennessee played Alabama  
at Tuscaloosa, Bear Bryant still was in high school, the stadium 
held only 12,000 fans and the Crimson Tide won its fourth straight 
Southern Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third Saturday in October in 1930.  
</P>
<P>
	The two schools have played every year since, traditionally on  
the third Saturday of October. But Alabama hosted its games in 
Birmingham after that, keeping the Volunteers off its campus for 
nearly seven decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium is now called Bryant-Denny, and will hold a sellout  
crowd of 83,818 for the Vols' return Saturday, as No. 10 Alabama 
(5-1, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) faces No. 5 Tennessee (4-1, 
2-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about the importance of playing in Bryant-Denny,  
and not just this game, but all the conference games,'' Alabama 
coach Mike DuBose said. ``There is no question there is a different 
atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer doesn't know what to expect  
Saturday. He last visited Tuscaloosa as an Alabama recruit in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	He can probably get some advice from quarterback Tee Martin, a  
Mobile native who was recruited by Alabama. Martin saw the Tide 
play Tennessee in Legion Field, and made a second visit to a game 
at Bryant-Denny. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different atmosphere,'' Martin said of the Bryant-Denny  
games. ``You're playing on campus. There will be more students 
there and more fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin dismisses the idea that it will affect the Vols.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a big deal,'' he said. ``We're trying to worry more  
about their defense and offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That should be the attitude for both teams because the loser  
will be out of the Bowl Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so deeply rooted, the tradition of this game,'' Fulmer  
said. ``It's very important. It's a classic kind of game, always 
clean and hard fought. There is always a lot of emotion and 
excitement, especially now that we're both in the Top 10. The 
stakes are higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols have beaten the Tide four straight times, their longest  
winning streak in series history. The fact is not lost on DuBose, 
who gathered his team last week and asked any player to raise his 
hand if he had ever beaten Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody raised their hand,'' receiver Jason McAddley said. ``So  
he was like, `Stay focused.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	All eyes will be on Alabama tailback Shaun Alexander, who has  
shredded every defense he has faced this year. He has rushed for at 
least 100 yards in all six games, and has done it against some of 
the top run-stoppers in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week against Mississippi -- which was No. 2 in the nation at  
stopping the run -- Alexander had 214 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, he gets the Vols, who are ranked third against the  
run. Tennessee has allowed only 64.4 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaun Alexander is an exceptional player, which is an  
understatement,'' Fulmer said. ``He's done everything you could ask 
a running back to do.''

<HEADLINE>  Stoudamire Has Reasons To Smile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In Toronto, Damon Stoudamire was the  
scorer. In two partial seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers he 
was the distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with two new teammates who can assume some of the  
point-guard duties, he's hoping to be something in between. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire averaged nearly 20 points a game in 2 1/2 seasons with  
the Raptors before being traded to Portland, his hometown, in 
February 1998. His role immediately changed from that of scorer to 
strictly playmaker, and his point production dropped to 12.6 per 
game during the lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	With the offseason acquisitions of Scottie Pippen and Steve  
Smith, both veterans who can handle the ball, Stoudamire is looking 
forward to showing that his offensive flash hasn't dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happier,'' he said. ``As long as I don't have to bring the  
ball up the court every time, I'm going to find a way to get to the 
basket or make something happen. When I'm in my attack mode, it's 
either going to be a bucket or a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can always make plays for somebody else, but nobody  
can make them for you in return, that gets very frustrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trading for Pippen and Smith and signing free agent Detlef  
Schrempf also has shifted the spotlight from Stoudamire, who did 
not react well to pressure during the Blazers' four-game sweep by 
San Antonio in the Western Conference finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing a key free throw late in Game 2 that allowed the  
Spurs' Sean Elliott to win it with a 3-pointer, Stoudamire blasted 
Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy for playing Greg Anthony more than him 
in crunch time. Stoudamire even said signing a seven-year, $81 
million contract extension before the season might have been a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire's comments perplexed his coach, raised the eyebrows  
of the seasoned Spurs and caused the player to be vilified on 
sports talk shows and in newspapers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	His low point came in Game 3, when the Rose Garden crowd booed  
him. It only got worse when he shot just 1-for-12 and the Blazers 
lost by 22 points. Two nights later, Portland lost again and 
Stoudamire wept after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	As trade rumors sprang up, Stoudamire traveled to the Bahamas  
and all over the United States, returning to Portland only to 
conduct free basketball camps and other community service events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I traveled around the country and around the world for a  
couple months, just to get away from the game and do some other 
things,'' Stoudamire said. ``That was fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers are 4-0 this preseason and are looking more  
comfortable with each other every time out. In their first home 
exhibition against Golden State last week, Stoudamire was 
sensational, getting 10 points and six assists in a 37-point first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll get better shots on our team because we move the  
ball better, and we pass the ball better,'' Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three nights later against Phoenix, however, Anthony showed why  
Dunleavy went to him so often with the game on the line. 
Stoudamire, returning to the McKale Center in Tucson for the first 
time since leaving Arizona in 1995, watched from the bench as 
Anthony scored 10 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Blazers 
back from an 85-78 deficit to a 117-110 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire would like to boost his scoring average back up to  
the 15-point range, but said he won't mind if he isn't the center 
of attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that people don't understand is that I never really  
wanted to score 20 here,'' he said. ``That never really was my goal 
when I got traded here to Portland. I've always wanted to lead the 
league in assists, because I was always right up there with the 
high numbers in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even too concerned about how my scoring opportunities  
are going to come. I know I'll have more, just because I've got 
guys that know how to create for other people, just the same way I 
can create for them.''

<HEADLINE> Lott Bill Would Extend Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is pushing a  
bill to extend expiring tax breaks. The bill puts the Mississippi 
Republican at odds with the Senate's chief tax writer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's legislation, at an estimated cost of $33 billion over 10  
years, blends parts of similar bills approved by the Senate Finance 
Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. It would extend 
several expiring credits through 2001 and make the business 
research and development credit permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	In all but its first year, however, the bill would spend some of  
the projected non-Social Security budget surplus. President Clinton 
has threatened to veto the five-year, $23.2 billion House version 
for the same reason; the $8.5 billion Finance Committee measure is 
fully paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said ``there  
was significant opposition'' from Republicans and Democrats to an 
earlier version of his bill that would have made the R&AMP;D credit 
permanent and would have spent non-Social Security surplus money. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final days of the session, when time is short, we will  
need a consensus package,'' Roth said Friday. ``I believe the 
Finance Committee bill has the best chance of obtaining that 
consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott, said the majority  
leader's bill is more straightforward than other versions and 
achieves the goal of removing expiring tax credits from the 
congressional agenda during the 2000 election year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to not have to come back and do all of this again  
next year,'' Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott also would drop several provisions in the other bills.  
</P>
<P>
	For example, he would not extend energy-tax credits, including  
those for wind-produced electricity or those for power produced 
with chicken manure. The first is a priority for Midwestern 
lawmakers, while the second is sought by Roth, whose home state of 
Delaware is prime poultry country. 
</P>
<P>
	While the R&AMP;D credit would be made permanent in Lott's bill,  
companies could not claim it until Sept. 30, 2000, to remove it 
from the tight fiscal 2000 budget. The credit, which expired on 
June 30, is prized by the high-tech industry and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would ensure that millions of individual taxpayers  
do not run afoul of the complex alternative minimum tax, or AMT, by 
claiming numerous personal credits. Those credits would be exempted 
from AMT consideration through Dec. 31, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would make the AMT fix permanent, while the  
Finance Committee version applies to the 1999 and 2000 tax years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the differences between the bills, congressional leaders  
of both parties and Clinton say a compromise on extension of the 
expiring credits will be reached by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have an agreement ... so we don't have to go to  
conference forever to get it done,'' said House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. A conference committee works out differences 
between House and Senate bills on the same subject.

<HEADLINE> Bowden Faces Bowden in FSU Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- As if the Bowden vs. Bowden showdown needed  
more twists. 
</P>
<P>
	A big one came Friday on the eve of the Florida State-Clemson  
game -- star receiver Peter Warrick struck a deal that allows him to 
avoid jail and resume playing for the top-ranked Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a lot of distraction for all of us, a lot of sadness  
for my part and the other guys' part,'' said Bowden, who faces his 
son Tommy Bowden, the Clemson coach, as he goes for the milestone 
victory. ``I think the players probably handle it better than I 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heisman Trophy contender pleaded guilty to misdemeanor petty  
theft for his role in a department store scam. University president 
Sandy D'Alemberte had said Warrick would have had to serve any jail 
time before he could return. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick already has missed two games and his status created all  
sorts of uncertainty leading to Saturday when the Seminoles (7-0, 
5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) face Clemson (3-3, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with Warrick back, quarterback Chris Weinke regains his  
favorite target. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's obviously a lot of excitement, a lot of media hype  
following this game,'' Weinke said. ``But my job from a player's 
perspective is to get the X's and O's ready to go and get the other 
players ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Bowden can become the sport's fifth Division I-A coach to  
reach 300 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke, a 27-year-old junior, says the players haven't worried  
about any of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, when players are talking about this  
game, we're talking about a stepping stone to get to where we want 
to get to, and that's, of course, to the national championship,'' 
he said. ``Everyone else takes care of the outside distraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden is glad to have his quarterback's calm approach for a  
game such as this. No one in major college football has ever 
coached against his son, let alone before more than 87,000 fans and 
a milestone on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing he brings to the field is his maturity level,''  
Bowden said. ``If he makes a mistake, he doesn't get rattled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Bowden has said all week the pressure was on his dad, and  
he and Clemson could enjoy the historic moment. 
</P>
<P>
	He bounced through town Friday morning, waving to passing cars  
that honked at him. He ran about 45 minutes and got a haircut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I'm going to take my wife to lunch,'' he said, looking as  
calm and happy as he sounded. 
</P>
<P>
	There could be an additional 10,000 to 15,000 people on campus  
Saturday who don't have tickets but want to listen outside the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Students painted College Avenue windows with scenes and slogans  
commemorating the game. 
</P>
<P>
	One said, ``This won't be Father's Day.'' Another had a chunky  
looking Warrick in his Florida State uniform behind bars with a 
department store shopping bag at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had to play in that type of environment yet this  
year,'' Weinke said. ``That's something that we're going to have to 
deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke passed up a Florida State scholarship out of high school  
to sign with the Toronto Blue Jays, but returned as a 25-year-old 
freshman two years ago. As a sophomore, he led the Seminoles to the 
national title game, but a broken back late in the season forced 
him to miss Florida State's national championship loss to 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke has come back strong this season. He set a career high  
with 354 yards passing in last week's 33-10 victory over Wake 
Forest. Without Warrick and dismissed receiver Laveranues Coles, 
Weinke still completed passes to 10 different receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson linebacker Chad Carson is amazed that Florida State can  
lose a Heisman Trophy candidate like Warrick and not miss a throw. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can pull in second- and third-string guys and still  
perform at that level,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Corruption Probe Extensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An investigation into police conduct is  
larger than authorities have publicly acknowledged and now includes 
at least seven questionable shootings by officers, the Los Angeles 
Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The corruption probe has focused on allegations that officers in  
the Rampart neighborhood near downtown shot unarmed suspects, 
planted evidence and covered up their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	A police spokesman declined comment on specifics of the  
newspaper's report, but acknowledged that the probe is looking at 
all areas of the department, not just Rampart officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those officers and detectives are doing a thorough  
investigation,'' said Officer Jason Lee. ``Until they come out with 
their findings, we won't be able to say anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internal affairs investigators say a sergeant in an anti-gang  
unit told officers to plant guns on unarmed suspects and even 
helped stage fictitious crime scenes, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sergeant has been relieved of duty after allegedly  
``quarterbacking the whole thing,'' according to Lt. Dan Hoffman, a 
robbery-homicide supervisor in charge of investigations of 
officer-involved shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman made the remarks Thursday at a briefing attended by LAPD  
officers, the Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman also said the department believes some officers from the  
anti-gang unit stole drugs from dealers and recruited prostitutes 
to sell them for the officers' own profit, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the allegations involving the Rampart station come from  
Rafael Perez, an LAPD officer who is cooperating with investigators 
in exchange for a reduced sentence on a cocaine theft conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez has implicated himself and his former partner, Nino  
Durden, in one shooting of an unarmed man and has said there were 
at least two illegal shootings. Hoffman said internal investigators 
have identified at least five or six other police shootings that 
are questionable, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez's revelations have led to the removal of 13 officers from  
active duty. Two others have been fired.

<HEADLINE> 49ers' Young Is Still Undecided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young, sidelined indefinitely  
by his latest concussion, still is gathering medical advice on 
whether he should play again and no decision on his football future 
is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been like a death watch in the press,'' Leigh  
Steinberg, the agent for the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, said 
Friday. ``Steve just wants to step back and get a chance to 
breathe. He's just a person trying to make a decision but we don't 
have to make one right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, who sustained his fourth concussion in three years  
Sept. 27 against Arizona, has missed three games. It's uncertain 
whether he'll get medical clearance to rejoin the 49ers and return 
to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh had said the club planned to address  
Young's future next week but that now has been delayed 
indefinitely. The possibility remains that Young could be placed on 
injured reserve if doctors recommend a prolonged period away from 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, a two-time NFL MVP who led San Francisco to its last  
Super Bowl win in 1994, would be finished for the season if he were 
to go on IR. Even under that scenario, Steinberg said Young 
probably wouldn't make a decision about his playing future until 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Young already has received a long-term recommendation from his  
neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg, who is not related to the agent. 
</P>
<P>
	That recommendation hasn't been revealed, but indications are it  
was negative. Leigh Steinberg would say only that Young's 
neurologist has expressed serious concern about the potential for 
long-term health risks, especially since Young has continued to 
have post-concussion symptoms nearly a month after the head blow. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Young still wants to play and doesn't want to walk away  
from football based on the opinion of one doctor. He flew to Provo, 
Utah, on Tuesday to consult with another neurologist and might seek 
a third opinion from another doctor in the next week or so. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unlikely he'll be cleared to play football any time  
soon,'' Leigh Steinberg said. ``We're continuing to gather more 
opinions and information in what is a murky medical area. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do know is this: Steve still wants to play but he's  
said if he's risking his future health he will not play. But we're 
still in a fact-finding mode. We're going through this process in a 
measured and prudent way and that could take weeks, or months. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm not even speaking to the issue of whether Steve plays  
again. That's totally a function of what the doctors say and how 
Steve and the 49ers assess any risks. But we'll make that decision 
when the time comes, and we're not there yet.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Rose Should Be Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Even though many believe Pete Rose gambled on his  
sport, by a 2-1 margin most people think he should be reinstated to 
baseball, according to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said Rose should be  
reinstated, while 29 percent said he should not, according to the 
poll, conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of 10 said baseball's career hits leader belongs in  
baseball's Hall of Fame, while almost two of 10 said he doesn't. 
Rose is not eligible for the Hall of Fame as long as his lifetime 
ban remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 78 percent to 15 percent margin, people said commissioner  
Bud Selig made the correct decision to invite Rose to the World 
Series ceremony Sunday honoring the sport's All-Century team. Rose 
was among the 25 players elected in fan balloting in the second 
half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the AP poll showed slightly higher support for  
Rose's admission to the Hall of Fame than four polls conducted from 
1989 to 1991 for the Roper Center at the University of Connecticut. 
Those polls showed support ranging from 47 percent to 58 percent 
for Rose's admission to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other polls -- one done for Roper in 1990 and another by  
Gallup in 1989 -- found nearly identical support for Rose as the AP 
poll, which was conducted earlier this month. The 1990 Roper poll 
found 68 percent supported Rose's admission to the Hall of Fame, 
and the 1989 Gallup poll found 66 percent of respondents favored 
his election to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who think Rose should be allowed to appear at the  
Series was Levona Walker, a communications specialist in her 40s 
from Bainbridge, Ga. The decision to let Rose appear with the 
All-Century team at the World Series is a good one, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great player,'' said Walker, who considers herself a  
big baseball fan. ``Everybody has faults, so why blame him for his 
faults?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, more people who were asked in the AP poll don't believe  
Rose's gambling denial than believe him. Forty percent don't 
believe Rose is telling the truth about betting on baseball, while 
30 percent believe him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Murray, a 55-year-old retiree from Tonawanda, N.Y., says he  
thinks the example Rose set on the field far outweighs the charge 
of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest baseball players,'' Murray said. ``He  
was a great example through his hustle -- he showed a lot of hard 
work and hustle. He was a good example of youth of that day and 
this day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said he doesn't know whether Rose bet on baseball or not,  
``But I like him, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,012 adults was taken Oct. 1-5 and has  
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, agreed to a lifetime  
ban from baseball in August 1989 following an investigation of his 
gambling. He applied for reinstatement in September 1997, and Selig 
has not ruled on the request, saying he sees no reason to change 
the ban originally imposed by commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who describe themselves as following baseball  
closely, Rose got even higher backing, with 67 percent saying he 
should be reinstated and 29 percent saying he shouldn't. 
Seventy-two percent said he belongs in the Hall of Fame and 79 
percent said he should be invited to the All-Century team ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	But 49 percent think he's lying when he says he didn't bet on  
baseball, with 36 percent believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Among casual fans, those who say they follow baseball but not  
closely, 64 percent say he should be reinstated, 79 percent say he 
belongs in the Hall of Fame and 84 percent agree he should be 
invited to the All-Century team festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	This group was about evenly split, with 40 percent saying they  
think he's lying about gambling on baseball and 36 percent 
believing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Carbonneau, a 66-year-old retiree from Champaign, Ill.,  
is a lifetime baseball fan who thinks some officials in the sport 
might not have a good historical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless they could prove he was throwing Reds games, they  
should let him back in,'' Carbonneau said. ``The Babe wasn't 
exactly a saint.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Avoids Derby Ticket Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- A state ethics panel reviewing the  
governor's control of hundreds of reserved seats for the Kentucky 
Derby voted Friday to do nothing -- at least not in public. 
</P>
<P>
	The Executive Branch Ethics Commission said it would send a  
private letter to Gov. Paul Patton. But the commission's five 
members, all appointed by the governor, wouldn't elaborate on what 
that letter might say. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's governors have been given first crack at hundreds of  
reserved seats for the perennially sold-out first jewel of 
thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown for the past four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice was largely ignored by the public until May when a  
Laurel, Md., horse trainer was arrested outside Churchill Downs and 
charged with scalping a $42 Derby ticket for $100. His attorneys 
traced the ticket, one of three James Casey had bought from a 
scalper, back to the office of the Kentucky governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, whose trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Louisville,  
has conceded that he violated Kentucky law by selling the ticket at 
an inflated price, but he said he didn't deserve being locked in a 
holding cell for 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey said he paid a scalper $100 each for three Derby tickets  
because it was the only way to get a reserved seat, which ``are 
sold out forever,'' he said. Since he only needed two, he sold the 
third -- to an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out the ticket had been among 550 reserved for the  
governor. The state bought about 60 for use by the Tourism 
Development and Economic Development cabinets, and the rest were 
offered to friends and political supporters at face value -- 
$42-$500. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly can't imagine how there could be anything improper  
or how the public could possibly be hurt,'' Patton said Friday. ``I 
don't reckon the policy of this state is that governors can't have 
any friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both he and Churchill Downs spokesman Karl Schmitt said the  
track uses the governor's office as a way to draw more celebrities 
to the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton was not implicated in the alleged ticket scalping  
involving Casey, and he said he felt no personal responsibility for 
it.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Eye Laser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration has approved  
an eye laser for use in a procedure to correct nearsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said Thursday it had approved a laser made by Summit  
Technology of Waltham, Mass., for use in the surgery in which a 
doctor cuts a flap in the outer layer of the cornea and then uses 
the laser to remove a small amount of the tissue beneath. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure is known as lasik, for laser in-situ  
keratomileusis. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies have shown that the surgery can improve nearsightedness  
in patients with or without astigmatism, although a small number of 
patients have side effects ranging from severe halo to loss of 
corrected vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 1,013 patients treated with the laser in tests at 13 medical  
centers, 92 percent were corrected to 20-40 or better and 47 
percent to 20-20 or better without glasses or contact lenses, the 
FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Summit Technology laser is the second approved for this  
procedure.

<HEADLINE> S.C. NAACP Pres. Holds on Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The South Carolina NAACP chapter is not  
stepping up the boycott of its home state, but its president 
promised it would not meet again at home until the Confederate 
battle flag atop the Statehouse comes down. 
</P>
<P>
	The boycott over the flag, called by the National Association  
for the Advancement of Colored People this summer, has so far 
persuaded more than 40 groups nationwide to cancel plans to come to 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	State leaders of the civil rights group have raised the  
possibility of extending the boycott to South Carolina products 
such as such as BMW cars and Michelin tires. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the start of the three-day conference of the state  
chapter, held across the border in North Carolina, state president 
James Gallman would only say that step might be discussed. He did 
not mention the boycott in his opening remarks, and said the 
meeting wouldn't focus on the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the state chapter hopes to return to the Palmetto State  
for future meetings. ``But as long as South Carolina continues to 
disrespect our people by waving the flag on the state Capitol, 
we'll be forced to meet away from our home,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP considers the flag a symbol of slavery and racism;  
supporters say it represents South Carolina's heritage and honors 
its war veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina, the only state to fly the Confederate battle  
flag over its Statehouse, first raised the flag in 1962 to 
commemorate the Civil War's centennial. Critics say it was actually 
a swipe at the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wall is up until South Carolina stops flying the flag of  
slavery,'' said Nelson Rivers III, NAACP national field operations 
director and former state chairman. ``If it takes a year, we'll be 
pleased. If it takes 10 years, we'll still be doing it.''

</P>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- John Bromwich, a two-time Australian  
Open champion whose ambidextrous play allowed him to hit forehands 
with both hands, died Friday of a heart attack. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his tennis career was interrupted by World War II,  
Bromwich won the Australian Open in 1939 and 1946. He played 51 
Davis Cup matches from 1937-50, winning 19 of 30 singles matches 
and 20 of 21 doubles matches. 
</P>
<P>
	His greatest successes came in doubles. In 1948, he won the  
Wimbledon doubles title with Frank Sedgman. He won at Wimbledon 
again in 1950 with Adrian Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromwich was a three-time U.S. Open doubles champion and won  
Wimbledon mixed doubles titles with Louise Brough in 1947-48.

</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Christopher Drogoul, an Atlanta banker who was  
caught up in a scandal involving $5.5 billion in loans to Iraq, 
died Monday of cancer. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Drogoul, the former manager of the Atlanta branch of Italy's  
government-owned Banca Nazional del Lavoro, was sentenced in 1993 
to three years in prison as a result of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities said the branch borrowed money from other  
banks then committed the funds to exporters to Iraq. The scandal 
came to light after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and 
Iraq defaulted on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Drogoul pleaded guilty to wire fraud and submitting false  
reports to bank regulators. A federal investigation determined that 
BNL's top officials in Rome were not responsible for the fraud in 
Atlanta.

longtime supporter of the Hearst Foundation's United States Senate 
Youth Program, died Friday at home of circulatory failure. She was 
84. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the widow of George R. Hearst, the oldest of the five  
sons of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
	Her stepson, George Randolph Hearst Jr., is chairman of the  
board of The Hearst Corp., owner of the San Francisco Examiner and 
other newspaper, magazine and broadcast holdings.

	She is also survived by a stepdaughter, Phoebe Hearst Cooke of  
Woodside, Calif.

                          *H. Stuart Hughes    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- H. Stuart Hughes, an author and scholar of  
European history best known for his trilogy of works on the 
intellectual scene in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, died 
Thursday of pneumonia. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime professor at the University of California, San Diego,  
Hughes wrote a dozen books, including the autobiography ``Gentleman 
Rebel'' in 1990 and the trilogy ``Consciousness and Society'' in 
1958, ``The Obstructed Path'' in 1968, and ``The Sea Change'' in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in New York City, Hughes earned a doctorate in history from  
Harvard University, then taught at Brown University until 1941 when 
he enlisted in the Army. He later served as chief of the State 
Department's division of research for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes, a grandson of former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice  
Charles Evans Hughes, ran for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts 
in 1962 and headed an organization in favor of a nuclear 
disarmament alliance from 1967 to 1970. 
</P>

scholarly distinction from the American Historical Association.

Corporation president, died Thursday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was affiliated with Mellon and its predecessors for more  
than 43 years until his retirement in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones worked to attract new investors to the Pittsburgh area as  
the steel industry began to decline, Mellon chairman and chief 
executive officer Martin McGuinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones joined the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh in 1936. He  
was named president of Mellon National Corporation and to the 
Mellon board of directors in May 1974.

General Assembly, died Wednesday. Kidd was believed to be in her 
mid-90s. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Penelope Mortimer, whose semi-autobiographical  
stories explored the emotional impact of failing marriages among 
the British upper classes, died Tuesday. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Ms. Mortimer's dozen novels were well-received, and  
``The Pumpkin Eater,'' published in 1962, was made into a film 
starring James Mason and Anne Bancroft. She also wrote two 
acclaimed volumes of memoirs and several television screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mortimer published her first novel, ``Johanna,'' in 1947  
under the name Penelope Dimont. At the time she had been married 
for 10 years to the journalist Charles Dimont. Divorced by 1949, 
she married John Mortimer. 
</P>
<P>
	The first volume of her memoirs, ``About Time,'' won the  
Whitbread Prize in 1979. The second part, published in 1993, 
included a frank account of her troubled marriage to Mortimer, 
which ended in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, she published ``Queen Elizabeth: A Life of the Queen  
Mother,'' which provoked controversy because of its allegations 
about the beloved royal's romantic life before her marriage to the 
future King George VI.

<HEADLINE> Judges Allow KKK Hoods at NYC Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge has rebuffed the city's attempt  
to keep the Ku Klux Klan from rallying in downtown Manhattan this 
weekend, ruling the group's wearing of hoods enjoys First Amendment 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour rally scheduled for Saturday in front of the  
Manhattan Courthouse will likely be held with Klansmen in trademark 
white regalia unless the decision is reversed. City lawyers say an 
appeal of Thursday's ruling was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of the  
KKK this week after the city denied the Klan's application for a 
permit. Officials cited a rarely used state law preventing groups 
congregating in public places in masks or with disguises, except 
for authorized masquerade parties or other entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	But while acknowledging the ``tortured history'' of masks in  
America, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ruled the 
disguises also protect those who espouse controversial viewpoints 
from their detractors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Harold Baer, joining with Hellerstein,  
quoted Oliver Wendell Holmes' statement that ``we should be 
eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of 
opinions that we loathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, their ruling did not declare New York's law  
unconstitutional, which Klan leaders say is part of their 
objective. Similar statutes have been struck down in Indiana and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani criticized the court's decision, calling  
it ``another example of the ideology extended from the '60s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This ruling says people don't have to take responsibility for  
what they say or what they do even as they support organizations 
that encourage anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, racism and 
hatred,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James W. Sheley, a Klan grand dragon from Walden, N.Y.,  
said he was ``extremely pleased'' with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 50 and 80 people are expected to attend the rally,  
according to the Klan's suit. A counter demonstration is also 
planned by the Partisan Defense Committee, whose right to protest 
Saturday was also affirmed by the court.

<HEADLINE> Bush-Bashing Biographer Had Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A publisher pulled its controversial biography  
of GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush from bookstore 
shelves Friday amid reports that the author had concealed a 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	Biographer James Howard Hatfield, whose book, ``Fortunate Son,''  
claims Bush was arrested for cocaine possession in 1972, was 
allegedly convicted in 1988 of plotting to kill a co-worker, 
according to a report in the Dallas Morning News on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Hatfield through the  
publisher were unsuccessful Friday. He had claimed in earlier 
interviews that authorities were confusing him with another man 
named Hatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eddie Cobb, the Arkansas parole officer overseeing the  
parole of a James Howard Hatfield for a federal embezzlement 
conviction, confirmed that the writer and the convict are one and 
the same, according to the Morning News and The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, St. Martin's Press, the publisher, said it had  
stopped all sales, promotion and other publishing activities for 
the book and was notifying booksellers while it looked into the 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the publisher went further and recalled 70,000 copies  
of the book already in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have enough information from our own investigation to make  
the decision that the book must be pulled,'' said Sally Richardson, 
president and publisher of St. Martin's Press trades division. ``We 
strongly believe it would be irresponsible to continue to keep the 
book in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign had its legal staff reviewing the matter for  
possible libel implications, a spokeswoman said. Hatfield had 
alleged that Bush was arrested in 1972 for cocaine possession, but 
only did community service after his father intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	The book alleged that the arrest record was later expunged at  
the request of the elder Bush. Hatfield attributed the story to 
three anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious (the book) was not checked,'' Bush spokeswoman  
Karen Hughes said Friday. Bush had previously called the book 
``science fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the parole officer's confirmation, Dallas  
attorney Norman L. ``Happy'' Nelson Jr., said he knew Hatfield for 
about nine years before the 1988 conviction and recognized him as 
the Bush biographer when Hatfield's picture appeared in a local 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture in the paper was the picture of the bomber,'' said  
Nelson. ``That was him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Castlebury, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal  
Justice, confirmed that a James Howard Hatfield was arrested in 
February 1987 for solicitation of capital murder -- hiring a hit man 
to plant a bomb beneath a co-worker's car. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was found guilty, Hatfield went to prison in April 1988  
and spent the next five years there. Upon his release, Hatfield was 
turned over to federal authorities; he wound up doing a short 
stretch in El Reno, Okla., for embezzling nearly $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield was released in December 1994 after doing time in a  
halfway house, said El Reno spokesman Leon Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield, who moved to Arkansas with the approval of Texas  
authorities, remains on parole through April 15, 2003, said 
Castlebury.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Retirees Win Curbside Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The U.S. Postal Service has agreed to  
start curbside delivery to 225 homes in a Florida retirement 
community, ending a two-year battle that stretched from Delray 
Beach to the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in the first series of homes built in the Floral Lakes  
community have had to hike up to a half-mile to retrieve their mail 
from a central kiosk, while their neighbors in newer homes have had 
their mail delivered to their driveways. 
</P>
<P>
	But this week, Postmaster General William Henderson said the  
mail service would offer curbside delivery, said Josh Rogin, a 
spokesman for Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ultimately treated the residents very fairly,'' Rogin  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the developer, Ben Martz, first started building homes  
three years ago in the community 50 miles north of Miami, he signed 
an agreement with the Postal Service for central delivery, a common 
method used to save government money and provide more secure mail 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	However, as the residents -- many of them veterans and retirees  
on Social Security -- began moving in, complaints mounted about the 
long, hot trek. One man, 64-year-old Donald Gross, claimed he 
needed four doses of heart medicine just to make the daily trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Martz first wrote to the postmaster requesting curbside delivery  
in June 1998. After months of discussion, the Postal Service said 
he could have curbside delivery to the more than 300 new homes in 
the development. But as for the original homes, the agency refused. 
Until the fight went to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	At the behest of Palm Beach County Commissioner Burt Aaronson,  
Wexler met with postal officials and urged them to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	Martz, chairman of Regency Homes, said Thursday it would cost  
him about $15,000 to install new mailboxes and reimburse the postal 
service for the kiosk. 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked those who challenged the Postal Service, an agency  
Martz says he now knows ``answers to no one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're totally unyielding,'' Martz said. ``They're going to  
try to deliver the mail rain or shine, but the cheapest way they 
can.''

<HEADLINE> Florida St. Rules on Warrick Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick can play for Florida  
State only after serving any jail time that is part of his plea 
agreement, the university president said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The star receiver and his lawyer met with Florida State  
president Sandy D'Alemberte on Thursday night. Warrick, a leading 
Heisman Trophy contender, is not expected to play Saturday against 
Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the jail or prison time behind someone before they  
play,'' D'Alemberte said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating for everybody,'' said Warrick lawyer John  
Kenny, who must work out another deal with the state attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, a former teammate and a store clerk were charged with  
felony grand theft when the two players purchased more than $400 
worth of designer clothes Sept. 29 at a mall for $21.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's lawyer this week reached an agreement to reduce the  
charge to a misdemeanor with the state attorney, but would have 
required the player to spend 30 days in jail at the end of the 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a fan, do I want him back? Absolutely yes,'' D'Alemberte  
said. ``But as a university president, I want him back after he's 
finished any problems with the criminal justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick has missed two games for the top-ranked Seminoles. On  
Saturday, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden goes for his 300th 
career victory. He will be facing son Tommy Bowden, the Clemson 
coach, in the first father-son matchup in Division I-A history. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick practiced Tuesday and Wednesday all week and can  
continue to do so. But when he rejoins the team for games is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I enter a plea that is acceptable to the court and is  
acceptable to the state attorney's office, but won't help him get 
back on the field, it's not going to make Peter Warrick very 
happy,'' Kenny said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Dillard's clerk, Rachel Myrtil, pleaded no contest  
Thursday to grand theft and was sentenced to two years' probation, 
10 days on a county work program, ordered to pay $308 in court 
costs and stay out of Dillard's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Laveranues Coles, who paid for the clothes, was kicked off the  
Florida State team.

<HEADLINE> Judges Allow KKK Hoods at Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal judges ruled Thursday that the Ku Klux  
Klan can stage a Manhattan rally wearing their white hoods, 
focusing on the group's First Amendment right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges sidestepped a discussion of the city's attempt to  
force Klan members to unmask by invoking a rarely used 1845 state 
law that bars groups from congregating in public places in masks or 
disguises, except for authorized parties or entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said it was true that the hood itself  
over the years had reflected hatred and fear but that it also had 
protected those who wore it from the wrath of those who hate their 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the message of hate that the mask evokes often has  
reflected ``everything America doesn't stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a Constitutional right was upheld,'' the Rev. Jeffrey  
L. Berry, 46, of Butler, Ind., national imperial wizard for the 
KKK's Church of the American Knights, said after Thursday's verbal 
ruling from the bench by federal judges Hellerstein and Harold Baer 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani criticized the ruling, calling it  
``another example of the ideology extended from the '60s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This ruling says people don't have to take responsibility for  
what they say or what they do even as they support organizations 
that encourage anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, racism and 
hatred,'' Giuliani said in a written statement. The city planned to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Civil Liberties Union sued Tuesday on behalf of the  
KKK after the city refused to grant it a permit for a rally 
Saturday unless the 50 to 80 participants expected agreed not to 
wear their traditional white hoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those supporting the KKK's right to march were activist Al  
Sharpton's National Action Network and the Amsterdam News, a 
newspaper that calls itself a ``significant voice of Black 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James W. Sheley, of Walden, N.Y., a KKK grand dragon,  
said the group chose New York for the rally to try to overturn the 
mask law. It has won similar court orders in Indiana and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry told the judges that KKK members wear hoods to protect  
themselves. He said that he and his daughter had been shot at, his 
house had been burned and he had been beaten because of his 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to allowing the hoods, the judges on Thursday said  
the Partisan Defense Committee would be permitted to stage a 
counterdemonstration as long as it did not drown out the KKK group 
with sound equipment during the two-hour rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The snuffing out of sound is not a permissible exercise under  
the First Amendment,'' Hellerstein said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Developing Mad Cow Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists say they are close to developing a  
blood test for diagnosing mad cow disease and similar brain 
illnesses in animals and humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, developed by private and government researchers,  
detects the presence of abnormal proteins called prions that cause 
a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies, or TSE. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, from what we've seen it looks very promising,'' said  
Mary Jo Schmerr, a scientist at the Agriculture Department's 
National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing for TSE diseases is now done by taking a sample of brain  
or glandular tissue, usually after death. 
</P>
<P>
	The blood test has been successfully used on TSE illnesses in  
sheep, elk, mule deer and hamsters. Additional research, which will 
probably take at least a year, must be done to ensure the test is 
reliable enough to be used for diagnostic purposes in humans and 
other animals, said Schmerr. 
</P>
<P>
	The test likely would be used first in Britain. The best known  
TSE is mad cow disease, which has been linked with a variant of the 
fatal brain condition known as Cruetzfeldt-Jakob. At least 43 
people have died of that strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob in Britain 
since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans who traveled frequently to Britain during the mad cow  
crisis have been banned from donating blood in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known mad cow disease in U.S. cattle, but sheep are  
susceptible to a related condition called scrapie and other forms 
of TSE infect elk, mule deer and mink. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA filed this week for a patent on the blood test.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Clinton Reach Lending Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Negotiating well past midnight, key Republican  
lawmakers reached agreement early Friday with administration 
officials on community lending rules for banks, participants in the 
five-hour, close-door talks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise was to be presented to a group of House and  
Senate negotiators considering legislation that would reshape the 
financial services industries. That group had halted its work while 
the closed-door talks continued to try to craft a bill that would 
avert a veto by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Final approval of the legislative package could come in the next  
few days. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial overhaul legislation would lift Depression-era  
legal barriers and allow banks, brokerage firms and insurance 
companies to merge and sell each other's products. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Treasury Department officials, Republican and  
Democratic lawmakers emerged to say they had an agreement that the 
White House could accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am for the first time optimistic that we will pass, after a  
long time, financial services legislation,'' said Sen. Charles 
Schumer, D-N.Y. ``In 19 years, we are the closest we have ever been 
to actually achieving a bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the negotiators were pleased with the compromise on  
community lending. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., denounced what she 
called ``the backroom negotiations'' and said she could not endorse 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, head of the Senate Banking Committee,  
earlier had vowed to continue pushing the financial overhaul 
legislation despite disagreements with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The new proposal includes Gramm's requirement that community  
groups receiving money from banks under federal law be compelled to 
disclose how they spent the money. In a compromise, that disclosure 
would be required only for loans of more than $50,000 and most 
grants of more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm's earlier proposal on community lending rules for banks  
had been rejected along a mostly party-line vote Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration supports the legislative package in  
principle but has threatened a veto over provisions it says would 
weaken the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to 
make loans in low-income and minority areas in which they operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm, who drafted the provisions, is an outspoken conservative  
and longtime critic of the 1977 law and has blocked efforts to 
expand its reach in the new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm said Thursday he had shown willingness to compromise on  
the issue but would not abandon his core requirement that community 
groups receiving money from banks under the law be compelled to 
disclose how they spent the money. 
</P>
<P>
	For the administration and key Democratic constituencies, the  
community lending law is a cherished icon that they credit with 
having boosted the renewal of inner-city areas in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are communities that are moving forward now because (the  
Community Reinvestment Act) ... was the economic engine,'' Rep. 
Bobby Rush, D-Ill., said during debate on Gramm's proposal in the 
drafting session. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street and the banking and insurance industries have spent  
millions of dollars in recent years pushing for the financial 
overhaul legislation, insisting it would help consumers by 
providing one-stop financial shopping and saving them money. 
</P>
<P>
	This year Congress has come closer than ever to enacting  
legislation, but industry lobbyists have watched the prospects slip 
away in recent days as the administration officials, Gramm and 
other key Republican lawmakers struggled to reach an accord. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, consumer advocates and lawmakers pushing for  
stronger consumer privacy protections have criticized the financial 
overhaul legislation as inadequate in that area and put additional 
pressure on Clinton to veto the bill in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the issues of poor people and privacy left over  
because all the big boys have already gotten what they want,'' said 
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> Baptists Urge Prayers for Hindus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Millions of Hindus worship in the darkness of  
Satan, the nation's largest Protestant denomination contends in a 
new booklet urging its members to pray for millions of Hindu souls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southern Baptist Convention has previously published  
booklets soliciting prayers for Muslims and Jews, offending leaders 
of those faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, some 30,000 booklets to be issued Monday in time for  
Divali, the major Hindu festival of lights, calls for the 
conversion of those ``who worship gods which are not God.'' The 
booklet says that Hindus have no concept of sin or personal 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pray that the darkness and the power of Satan will be  
broken,'' the guide says. 
</P>
<P>
	The language in this publication is harsher than was used in the  
earlier booklets, said Louis Moore, the book's final editor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a clearer definition that Hindus are lost,'' he said.  
``We're all lost without Jesus Christ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Divali is a major festival, dedicated to the worship of Laksmi,  
goddess of prosperity and goodness. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the publication is profoundly insulting, said Umaa  
Mysorekar, the secretary-treasurer of the Council of Hindu Temples. 
She called the thinking ``not only absurd but also ignorant. I 
don't think Jesus himself would have said not to respect other 
religions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claims of Hindus in darkness and in Satan's grip also offend  
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lightness is within us ... There are no satanic  
activities,'' she said. ``All the fundamental mythologies in 
Hinduism represent righteousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hari Sharma, president of the Hindu Temple of Greater Chicago,  
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever publishes such a book does a disservice to the  
society,'' he said. ``People should understand one another's 
religions, not go back into history when we were attacking one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said that earlier books on prayers were misrepresented as  
aggressive evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not encouraging people to go out on the streets and  
buttonhole every Hindu they see,'' the editor said. ``But it would 
be wonderful if the opportunity arises.' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has no idea whether earlier books led to conversions. ``No  
records are being kept,'' he said. ``The records are in heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A guide offering prayers for Buddhists is planned.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backs GOP's Abortion Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, N.H. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush lined up with  
Senate Republicans on Friday in supporting a ban on certain 
late-term abortions, but he said there were other important issues 
for the country to address. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding a town meeting in a fire house near Lake Sunapee, the  
Republican presidential candidate told a female questioner he was 
opposed to a specific abortion procedure the Senate seeks to ban, 
but people should be allowed to disagree on abortion rights and the 
government should instead work to streamline adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Senate voted in favor of a resolution upholding  
Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. 
Senators then passed a bill to ban an abortion procedure that 
involves partial delivery of the fetus, although the 63-34 vote was 
four short of the margin needed to override a promised veto by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain, a rival of Bush for the GOP  
nomination, voted for the ban but did not vote on the question of 
Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said earlier in the campaign he would not nominate Supreme  
Court justices based on their abortion views. At the same time he 
has said he would support a constitutional amendment limiting 
abortion rights but would not push for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit to Newport and later to Keene was the fifth that Bush  
has made to New Hampshire this year. The state holds the nation's 
first presidential primary on Feb. 1, eight days after the Iowa 
caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit also came the same day five Republican hopefuls were  
gathering for a debate at the University of New Hampshire. Bush 
declined an invitation and was appearing instead at a party 
fund-raiser in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pundits have questioned Bush's commitment to New Hampshire,  
and polls indicate that while the governor retains about 42 percent 
of the support of likely voters in the Republican primary, McCain 
has moved into a solid second place with about 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the criticism, Bush said he was invited to the  
Vermont event in June, and ``I'm a man who keeps my word.'' He said 
he was skipping another debate next week because his wife was 
receiving an award from her college. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is my priority, and if it costs me votes for  
honoring my wife, so be it,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire house audience urged Bush to appoint quality people to  
government and asked him about making Elizabeth Dole his running 
mate. Dole ended her campaign Wednesday, citing Bush's overwhelming 
advantage in money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Dole brought grace and dignity to the campaign, but it  
was premature to talk about a running mate. ``I will speculate out 
loud after I win the party's nomination,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving his standard stump speech, Bush emphasized that America's  
prosperity must be used to improve the lot of all its citizens. He 
said that dream that can be realized through tax cuts, education 
improvements and by working with religious organizations to 
increase charity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand before you as a uniter, not a divider,'' he declared,  
drawing hearty applause from a crowd of more than 200. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance reaffirmed the beliefs of one couple in the  
audience, Luther and Margaret Williams of Hudson, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	``We voted for his father and we're going to vote for him,''  
said Williams, a 70-year-old retired security officer, referring to 
former President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has a fresh outlook on everything that's going  
on,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Conference Examines Aids in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Asia's largest AIDS conference has  
a heavy topic on its agenda: how to control the epidemic in Asia, 
where the experts say the virus is spreading at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
	When some 3,000 experts, activists and AIDS sufferers begin  
meeting Sunday for the 5th International Congress on AIDS in Asia 
and the Pacific, their task is to curb HIV's spread in nations that 
consider sex a taboo subject. 
</P>
<P>
	About 95 percent of people with the HIV virus live in the  
developing world, the vast majority in Africa. But experts see Asia 
as the next trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last year, at least half of the new cases worldwide  
came from South and Southeast Asia,'' said Marina Mahathir, 
president of the Malaysian AIDS Council and chairwoman of the 
four-day conference. 
</P>
<P>
	About 7 million people in the Asia-Pacific region are living  
with AIDS or HIV. The number might pale in comparison to the nearly 
21 million cases in Africa, but the ``trend is upwards and that is 
what's worrying,'' Mahathir said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. AIDS Program said in a statement that Asia -- where the  
virus is primarily transmitted between heterosexuals and by 
injected drugs -- has the fastest rate of growth in HIV infections. 
It offered some unpleasant specifics: 
</P>
<P>
	-- India has more HIV-infected people -- about 4 million -- than  
any country in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Five percent of all Cambodians, or nearly one of every 25  
adults, has HIV or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Thailand, the first Asian nation heavily affected by the  
disease, 2 percent of the population is infected. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Malaysia, the number of documented HIV cases has jumped to  
31,000, up from 6,000 cases in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the upcoming conference will focus on the region's  
religious and cultural taboos, which have stood in the way of AIDS 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denial is a very major problem,'' said Mahathir, the daughter  
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who is credited with putting 
AIDS on the public health agenda in this Southeast Asian nation. 
``A lot of our societies are very conservative and would rather not 
talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia was chosen to host the meeting in part because it is  
one of the region's most progressive Muslim countries. 
</P>
<P>
	While Islam has no clear guidelines on using condoms, only  
married couples are legally allowed to have sex. To encourage the 
use of condoms outside marriage is akin to promoting promiscuity, 
and some religious communities brush off AIDS as punishment for an 
immoral act. 
</P>
<P>
	But large numbers of women with HIV and AIDS live in cultures  
that practice arranged marriage and allow men to have multiple 
wives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately what we're trying to do is save lives, and that's  
not contradictory to any religion at all,'' Mahathir said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian scenario is almost the opposite of what's happening on  
the other side of the globe. In North America and Western Europe, 
the rate of infection has been brought under control after massive 
prevention campaigns, the United Nations says. Of those infected, 
fewer are dying with the availability of anti-retroviral drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the sophisticated new drugs are really a dream for most  
people,'' Mahathir said. But in Asia, she said, the two-year 
economic crisis has compounded problems faced by already poor 
nations unable to afford expensive medical treatments.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Unabomber Plea Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed Friday to  
hear Theodore Kaczynski's request to withdraw his guilty plea for 
the Unabomber killings, go to trial and face a possible death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski, a Harvard-trained mathematician who became a forest  
recluse, pleaded guilty in 1998 to mail bombings that killed three 
people and injured 23. Kaczynski's statements have connected the 
attacks to his campaign against technological tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed Friday to consider  
whether Kaczynski's guilty plea was voluntary; whether he was 
properly denied the right to represent himself; and whether a 
defendant, in a death penalty trial, has a right to prevent his 
court-appointed lawyer from presenting evidence of mental 
impairment as a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department had agreed to the guilty plea and life  
sentence after a psychiatric examination concluded Kaczynski was a 
paranoid schizophrenic but competent to stand trial. The exam had 
been arranged by Kaczynski's lawyers over his objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski had wanted to present a defense based on his views  
about technology and the environment. But his attempts to represent 
himself or bring in a lawyer who would argue his chosen defense 
were rejected by U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell of Sacramento, 
who said the requests were made too late and would delay the case 
unduly. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell later refused to let Kaczynski set his guilty plea aside  
and found that his arguments, filed from his prison cell in 
Colorado, were not serious enough to justify an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Lapham declined to discuss the  
order or the government position in the case. Before the guilty 
plea, prosecutors argued that Kaczynski should be allowed to 
control his defense, even at the risk of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mello, a Vermont Law School professor who helped  
Kaczynski with his legal filing, said the appeals court order 
``took an enormous amount of courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of power: Who has the legitimate power to make  
the most important, fundamental decisions about the defense? Is it 
the guy whose life is on the line or is it the guy's 
well-intentioned, paternalistic lawyer?'' Mello said.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die When Calif. Church Van Flips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATASCADERO, Calif. (AP) -- A church-rented van carrying 14 people  
overturned on a central California highway and rolled down an 
embankment in a late-night accident, authorities said. Seven people 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A Los Angeles-area congregation of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ  
church had rented the van, which was en route to San Francisco when 
it crashed on Highway 101 about 11 p.m. Thursday, California 
Highway Patrol spokesman Scott Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they were puzzled by the accident, which  
occurred on a relatively straight section of the highway. The 
driver was among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The van apparently slid broadside across the northbound side of  
the highway before overturning and tumbling across the southbound 
lanes. No other vehicles were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of bizarre. It doesn't make any sense,'' CHP Sgt.  
Christopher Day said. ``The road is straight. There is no unusual 
slope or grade. It's like the driver lost control.'' One 
possibility, officers said, is that the driver swerved to avoid a 
deer or other animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw this white van coming across the center divider of the  
freeway and the headlights bounced up all of a sudden,'' witness 
Brad Tauber told KSBY-TV in San Luis Obispo. He said the next thing 
he saw was ``a lot of things flying out, and I thought it was 
debris at first. Then, you know, I could tell it was bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said five of the seven who died had been thrown from the  
van. Only a few of the passengers, who ranged in age from 4 to 70, 
were wearing seat belts, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two adults were in critical condition and the 4-year-old, Aretha  
Fike, was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was near Atascadero, about 210 miles north of Los  
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The crumpled vehicle came to rest on its passenger side in a  
10-foot-deep roadside ditch. Rescue workers righted the vehicle by 
propping it with boards to get to those trapped in the wreckage. 
Purses, backpacks and plastic utensils littered the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3 million-member Kingdom of Jesus Christ, based in the  
Philippines, was founded in 1985. There are churches worldwide.

<HEADLINE> NYC Can Block KKK Masks at Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals panel ruled Friday that New  
York City can force the Ku Klux Klan to unmask at a weekend rally 
because the city is enforcing a law, not discriminating against the 
group's message. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials had agreed to allow the rally, but only if KKK  
members went without their traditional hooded white masks. They 
cited an 1845 law that bars people from congregating in masks or 
disguises except for authorized events, such as masquerades. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Civil Liberties Union sued on KKK's behalf,  
accusing the city of violating the group's First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, after hearing from KKK members who said they had  
been attacked and their homes had been burned, two federal judges 
agreed and said that the masks were not being used solely to strike 
fear into others but also to protect those speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the federal appeals court said that because the city  
didn't consider the content of the KKK's message when it decided to 
enforce the law, that meant the city didn't discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge appeals panel distinguished the case from other  
in which courts had blocked anti-mask laws because the city was not 
trying to bar the rally because of the Klan's anti-Semitic, 
anti-minority rhetoric. Instead, New York officials were simply 
enforcing an existing law. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's rulings define only the ground rules for Saturday's  
rally. The wider First Amendment issues in the lawsuit will be 
argued in court in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	KKK officials said the group chose New York for the rally to try  
to overturn the mask law. The group has won legal victories over 
mask statutes in towns in Indiana and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The KKK still plans to go ahead with the rally Saturday outside  
the state courthouse in lower Manhattan -- without masks, New York 
Civil Liberties Union lawyer Arthur Eisenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Siegel, executive director of the civil liberties group,  
said he was considering appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. He 
called Friday's ruling a ``momentary setback for the First 
Amendment,'' which he said should protect even anonymous, hateful 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	City attorney Michael Hess called Friday's decision by the 2nd  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a ``great victory.''

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Earns $84 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Air Canada, which is fighting a takeover bid by  
Onex Corp., said Friday it earned $84 million in the third quarter 
in contrast to a loss of $41 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 figures were affected by a two-week pilots' strike that  
severely hindered service. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 amounted to 44 cents a  
share, compared with a loss of 22 cents in the third quarter last 
year, Air Canada announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $1.22 billion in the latest quarter from $1.0  
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of this year, profit totaled $135  
million, up from $2.7 million the previous year, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $3.28 billion from $3.0 billion a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the first nine months of 1999, Air Canada has recorded its  
best ever operating income and highest operating margin since the 
airline was privatized in 1988,'' Air Canada president and chief 
executive officer Robert Milton said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings ``validate that Air Canada is well-positioned to  
take the lead role in the restructuring of Canada's aviation 
industry,'' Milton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada this week offered to buy back shares in order to  
block the Onex takeover bid, helped by major investments by global 
partners Lufthansa and United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock repurchase offered up to $540 million for 35 percent  
of the company's shares, which would give Air Canada a large enough 
voting bloc to defeat the Onex bid at a shareholder meeting Nov. 8 
in Montreal. To win approval, Onex needs a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada has also offered to buy Canadian Airlines and run it  
as a separate company, and start a discount regional airline based 
in eastern Ontario as part of a restructuring plan for Canada's air 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Air Canada rose 12 1/2 cents to $6.50 in trading on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Ahead in Argentine Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A dour opposition candidate who  
wants to ``end the party'' after the flashy decade of President 
Carlos Menem held onto a commanding lead Friday in the last opinion 
polls before this weekend's presidential elections in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Buenos Aires Mayor Fernando de la Rua has successfully harnessed  
Argentines' discontent with recession, crime and scandals. His main 
concern may now be avoiding a run-off with his nearest rival, 
Eduardo Duhalde of Argentina's ruling Peronist Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel the victory in the streets!'' de la Rua declared as he  
saluted tens of thousands of people during a campaign-closing 
motorcade across Buenos Aires on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's Gallup Argentina poll gave De la Rua 44.6 percent of  
the vote to 28.2 percent for Duhalde, governor of Buenos Aires 
province. Those results are similar to previous polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Running a distant third with 10.6 percent was Domingo Cavallo,  
the former finance minister who mended the tattered economy of this 
nation of 36 million in the early 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide poll, published by the newspaper La Nacion, had a  
margin of error of 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	To triumph in one round, the winner needs 45 percent outright  
Sunday -- or must garner between 40 percent and 45 percent of the 
ballot with a 10-percent lead over the runner-up. A run-off would 
be held Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing his campaign in the northeastern city of Rosario,  
Duhalde cast doubt on the polls and warned against voting for De la 
Rua's opposition Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``A vote for the Alliance changes nothing. We are the true  
change,'' Duhalde said. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Rua, a 62-year-old lawyer who slowly rose up the political  
ladder, was first elected to the Senate in 1973. In 1996 he became 
mayor of the capital, where he erased a $600-million budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	He offers himself as a staid but steady alternative to Menem,  
the ``Hollywood president'' who transformed Argentina with 
free-market reforms -- all while driving race cars, mingling with 
soccer stars and celebrities and jetting around the globe to hobnob 
with world leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem reordered an economy that was inflationary and in disarray  
when he took officein 1989. Now 69, he ends his second term having 
completed one of the most intensive privatization programs in the 
world. He also made Argentina the strongest U.S. ally in South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	But voters have grown weary, angered by a punishing recession,  
the second in four years, which has pushed unemployment to 14.5 
percent. Crime is also up, corruption scandals are swirling about 
some of Menem's most trusted aides and many on the streets say two 
presidential terms for the Peronists are enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem, who leaves office Dec. 10, threw late and tepid support  
behind Duhalde and did not even attend his last rally. Both 
candidates have campaigned as proponents of change and against 
Menem's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Where De La Rua offers clean government and continued  
free-market reforms, Duhalde has proposed cutting taxes and 
imposing a one-year moratorium on firings to surmount the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	An opposition president could find governing complicated. The  
Peronists hold many of the 23 provincial governorships, with six 
gubernatorial races Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of seats are also up for grabs Sunday in the bicameral  
Congress, which is divided between the Peronists, Argentina's 
largest political force, and other parties.

<HEADLINE> Behind the Scenes in Budget Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's chief negotiator in this  
week's budget tussle on Capitol Hill got his first lessons in 
politics from a master, former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Lew says he has never forgotten the Massachusetts  
Democrat's advice that ``while it's nice to be important, it's more 
important to be nice,'' even to adversaries in the annual minuet 
over how the government's money gets spent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew, who quoted his old boss' aphorism at a ceremony marking his  
nomination as budget director last spring, is leading 
budget-bargaining talks that began Wednesday at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a veteran Democratic aide who worked on Capitol Hill and  
in party politics before going to the White House at the start of 
the Clinton administration. In addition to partisan conviction, Lew 
has also demonstrated flexibility, said one of his Republican 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Clinton wants several billion dollars more than  
Congress has so far provided for hiring teachers and police 
officers, foreign aid and other programs. The president also wants 
to kill provisions the administration considers anti-environmental 
that would help the oil, mining and other industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from a brief tenure as a private lawyer, the 44-year-old  
New York City native has worked in politics, government or 
government-related think tanks for his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew is married, with two children, and known throughout the  
administration as an observant Jew who prefers not to work on 
Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. Even Clinton, who routinely calls 
staffers at odd hours, tries not to bother Lew on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew took over as head of the White House Office of Management  
and Budget last year, after serving as the green-eyeshade group's 
No. 2. As the deputy to then-budget chief Franklin Raines, Lew was 
a front-line negotiator in talks that produced the 1997 budget 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day he would come in and say exactly what he had to say,  
and I would say exactly what I had to say,'' said Wayne Struble, 
staff director of the House Budget Committee, describing the 1997 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got to where we could say each other's lines. But after we  
dispensed with that back and forth, then it was serious,'' Struble 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew was an adviser on the failed 1994 Clinton health care  
overhaul and was key in launching the AmeriCorps national service 
program, which annually has been a target if GOP lawmakers but each 
year has survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew worked 14 years for congressional Democrats, including a  
stint as a senior policy adviser to O'Neill. In that job, Lew was 
on the opposite side of divided government in Washington, working 
for a top Democrat in a Democrat-led Congress while Republican 
Ronald Reagan was in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew represented O'Neill in negotiations that overhauled Social  
Security in 1983 when the program was facing bankruptcy. Much of 
the rancor in this year's budget discussions has focused on whether 
either side will dip into the Social Security surplus to pay for 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack has been at the heart of budget policy-making and the  
budget wars, really, for the last 15 years, or more than that,'' 
said Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman who knows Lew well. ``No 
one has been more involved at the detail level, and now sort of 
from the broader level than Jack. ... He's seen it from the 
congressional side, and he's seen it from the White House side.''

	Lew is the fourth budget director to serve in the Clinton  
administration, after Leon Panetta, Alice Rivlin and Raines, who 
left to head the home mortgage company Fannie Mae. 
</P>
<P>
	A Harvard graduate who also holds a law degree from Georgetown

budget matters, said Robert Greenstein, head of the left-leaning 
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

together behind the scenes.''

<HEADLINE> White House Examining Philanthropy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The young and the rich of the high-tech realm  
may be better known for punching code late into the night and 
indulging in extreme sports on the weekend. But if participants at 
a White House conference on philanthropy have their way, Silicon 
Valley will become the home of the social entrepreneurs of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were hosts  
for the conference highlighting the tradition and possible future 
of philanthropy in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The face of this tradition is changing,'' President Clinton  
said. ``Philanthropy is like our country now -- more diverse as new 
groups seize and share opportunity in the new economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in the first such conference spoke of a need to  
appeal more directly to baby boomers and Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
	Money isn't the only thing Internet mavens can provide.  
</P>
<P>
	America Online Inc. founder Steve Case highlighted a new  
philanthropic Internet portal, developed by the AOL Foundation, 
American Red Cross, the National Urban League and other groups, to 
offer an easy way to donate to over 620,000 charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take all these tens of millions of people who are  
starting to change their lives because of the Internet and help 
them to change society because of the Internet as well,'' Case 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the talk turned again and again to the deep pockets of the  
cyberlords. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silicon Valley and the whole venture capital, high-tech  
community needs to be at the forefront of what we're doing because 
of the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks,'' Clinton quipped. 
``That's where the money is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Fong, a general partner in a venture capital fund in  
Ventura, Calif., helped establish a group, the Entrepreneurs' 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fong said he and his associates aim to engage young people in  
Silicon Valley in their own communities. ``Many of these people 
aren't married yet, and all they know about is work,'' Fong said. 
</P>
<P>
	One example of a new approach to philanthropy, Fong said, is for  
a startup company to donate private stock to a local philanthropic 
fund. When a company goes public, the stock can generate millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's program was broadcast via satellite and on public  
television, reaching a potential audience of 10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Other participants included Patty Stonesifer, president of the  
$18 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, actor Paul Newman, 
and 'NSync singer Justin Timberlake, who was announcing creation of 
a foundation to support musical education in public schools. 
Sponsors include the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the National 
Endowment for the Humanities, the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Iscol 
Family Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference also took stock of traditional philanthropic  
endeavors in the United States and assessed the importance of 
understanding how different ethnic communities approach the notion 
of supporting each other collectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmett Carson of the Minneapolis Fund urged mainstream  
philanthropic organizations to give up any ``noblesse oblige'' view 
of giving as ``narrow and one-dimensional.'' There are advantages 
to some other cultures' approaches such as giving anonymously or in 
communal enterprises, he said. ``Philanthropy should be a lifetime 
endeavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, noting that the baby boomers stand to inherit $12  
trillion as their parents' generation passes on, said just a slight 
increase in the 2 percent that Americans donate to charitable 
organizations each year could produce dramatic results for 
everything from homeless shelters to libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no better gift our generation can give to the future  
than a strengthened philanthropic tradition,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``New communities of donors must be encouraged to participate,''  
she said. ``New avenues of giving must be opened and explored.''

<HEADLINE> 5 GOP Presidential Hopefuls Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Gary Bauer attacked Steve Forbes, while Sen.  
John McCain blasted the power of special interests. Alan Keyes 
complained about the ``socialization'' of American government and 
Sen. Orrin Hatch said he was the most competent alternative to 
George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the persistent themes Friday night as five of the  
seven GOP hopefuls met for their first debate of the 2000 
nomination race. Bush, the Texas governor, stayed away, which put 
the spotlight on those trying to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, a conservative activist, drew the sharpest line with  
repeated slaps at Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher who is 
financing his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He disputed Forbes' proposals on taxes, trade and health care.  
``Steve, that sounded real good, but we've got to go beyond 
generalities,'' Bauer said after Forbes complained that Americans 
are losing control over their medical decisions to government and 
to health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington is gridlocked by special interests,'' said McCain,  
a champion of campaign finance reform whose legislation the Senate 
defeated this week. The Arizona senator said Democrats are beholden 
to trial lawyers, and Republicans to the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans did differ on trade policy toward China, with  
Bauer and conservative Alan Keyes, a radio talk show host and 
former U.N. ambassador, saying the most-favored-nation treatment 
that Beijing now enjoys -- which is standard for U.S. trading 
partners -- should be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, Forbes and Hatch, of Utah, criticized administration  
policy toward China, but didn't advocate ending most favored nation 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	More typically, after McCain rebuked Clinton administration  
policy on national defense, Hatch said he agreed with everything 
his fellow senator had said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes was the most talkative and confrontational of the lot,  
denouncing socialism, urging outright abolition of the income tax 
and telling the others to ``stop talking out of both sides of our 
mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hourlong forum was sponsored by New Hampshire Public  
Television, The Union Leader of Manchester and New Hampshire Cable 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	C-Span broadcast the debate nationally.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush opted weeks ago to skip the forum and one next week, as his  
lead in campaign funds and in the public opinion polls left no 
incentive for face-to-face encounters with his challengers now. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who campaigned in New Hampshire on Friday, said he had  
committed to a fund-raiser for Vermont Republicans at the same time 
of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	He also declined to participate in a debate next Wednesday  
because it conflicted with a ceremony honoring his wife, Laura, at 
her alma mater in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the opening debate would whet the public's appetite.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to want more real debates, not just an hour  
session. They're going to want all the candidates involved and so I 
think it's going to put pressure on Gov. Bush to be more 
participatory in the future,'' the publisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said afterward that he and Forbes are fighting to be the  
conservative alternative to Bush. ``I believe that Steve Forbes has 
peaked just as the foliage in New Hampshire has,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's debate came a day after the latest New Hampshire poll  
found Bush with a commanding lead and McCain solidifying his 
position in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone survey of 600 likely Republican voters, Bush had  
the support of 42 percent, about what he had in August. McCain had 
26 percent -- 10 points better than in August -- with most of his 
gains coming at the expense of other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate also came two days after Elizabeth Dole, the lone  
woman seeking the GOP nomination, quit the race citing difficulty 
raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Bush, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan also skipped  
the debate. He is expected to announce Monday that he is leaving 
the Republican Party to seek the presidency as a Reform Party 
candidate.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Urges Clinton To Boycott S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The chairman of the NAACP asked President  
Clinton on Friday to honor the group's boycott of South Carolina -- 
which flies the Confederate flag over its statehouse -- and not 
attend an annual New Year's Eve weekend event there. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House is planning a millennium celebration on New  
Year's Eve that will keep the Clintons in town at least that night, 
Toby Graff, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said this week that the  
Clintons' full schedule for that time is not yet set, leaving it 
unclear whether they might attend another part of the Renaissance 
Weekend on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, such as a New 
Year's Day appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's  
board of directors voted last Saturday for the tourism boycott of 
South Carolina until it removes the Confederate flag from the 
statehouse dome. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Clinton, NAACP chairman Julian Bond wrote:  
``Renaissance Weekend activities in the face of widespread, popular 
opposition to displaying this hateful symbol constitutes an 
endorsement of loathsome conduct and insensitivity to the awful 
message it conveys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons, who are friends with Renaissance Weekend  
co-founders and part-time Hilton Head residents Phil and Linda 
Lader, have attended the private New Year's Eve event for 14 
consecutive years. The event draws high-profile guests from around 
the world to its off-the-record discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond also wrote to Lader.  
</P>
<P>
	``Surely you do not want to associate the weekend with bigotry  
and intolerance,'' Bond said in the letters, an NAACP statement 
said.

<HEADLINE> Jealous Husband Gets Four Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A jury found a man guilty of murder for  
shooting his wife to death when he found her with another man, but 
then recommended that he get probation. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jimmy Watkins found his wife, Nancy, with a lover at the  
couple's home last December, he wounded both of them and later 
returned to the house and shot his wife five more times while she 
was calling 911. 
</P>
<P>
	This jury found he acted with ``sudden passion'' and recommended  
Thursday that he get a 10-year probated sentence with no prison 
time at all. Given the jury's action, District Judge Robert Gill 
sentenced Watkins to 120 days in prison as a condition of the 
probation. The most he could have given Watkins was 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins bowed his head and wept as the verdict was announced.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it was a very difficult decision for that jury to  
wrestle with, but we're pleased with their decision,'' said 
attorney Kyle Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, meanwhile, said they would take Watkins to trial  
again for shooting the other man, Keith Fontenot. Watkins is 
charged with attempted capital murder. If convicted, he could be 
sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not how we wanted the case to turn out,'' said  
prosecutor James Cook. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated 21 hours over three days before determining  
that Watkins, 34, had acted out of passion when he found his wife 
with Fontenot at the Watkins' home near Eagle Mountain Lake last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his confession, Watkins shot his wife once and  
Fontenot twice. Then he chased Fontenot from the house and put a 
gun to the man's head. When the gun failed to fire, Watkins drove 
away, but returned to kill his wife after realizing his gun had 
just jammed and was not empty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw my mom fall down and I saw my dad shoot my mom,'' the  
couple's 11-year-old son testified last week as his father sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors said Thursday they recommended a probated sentence  
because they didn't think Watkins could be rehabilitated in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel for the family, but Jimmy needs help. The prison  
system just won't give him help,'' juror Alex Davis told the Fort 
Worth Star-Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
	Another juror, James Laurie, e-mailed the newspaper Thursday  
night, saying he hoped Watkins would take advantage of his second 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pray Jimmy will use the break that we gave him to turn his  
life back in the right direction,'' Laurie said. ``He has a long 
way to go. I pray for all the family members that were affected.''

<HEADLINE> Incest Trial Parents Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The parents of an 11-year-old  
Swiss-American boy whose arrest on incest charges has created a 
furor in Switzerland were involved with a business called 
``Ultimate Fantasies,'' the father acknowledged today. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas and Beverly Wuthrich, who fled to Switzerland after  
their son was arrested, registered the home-based business in July, 
according to records cited by The Denver Post. It quoted a source 
close to the investigation as saying it is an adult video 
production company. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview this morning on NBC's ``Today,'' Mrs. Wuthrich  
denied any involvement in an adult-video company. 
</P>
<P>
	But her husband, who is the boy's stepfather, said in an  
interview with MSNBC that he and his wife were involved with 
something called ``Ultimate Fantasies.'' He did not specify what 
the business consisted of, but he did say no adult videos were 
produced at their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not have anything like that going on in our house,'' he  
said. He said it was ``absolutely impossible'' that the boy was 
influenced by anything he saw in the home. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who have dual U.S.-Swiss citizenship, fled to  
Switzerland with their three other children after the boy, Raoul, 
was arrested on aggravated incest charges. He is accused of 
inappropriate sexual contact with his 5-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities began the investigation after a neighbor reported  
that she saw him fondle the girl. Mrs. Wuthrich said this morning 
that her son and daughter told her he was trying to help her go to 
the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County authorities confirmed Thursday they are looking  
into the Ultimate Fantasies business, but said they don't know what 
it did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investigators are aware of the business and are currently  
trying to establish exactly what type of business it is,'' said 
Steve Davis, spokesman for the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post also said records also show that Mrs. Wuthrich  
pleaded guilty last year to a misdemeanor child-neglect charge and 
a second, similar charge is pending. The mother was ordered to 
undergo parenting classes and fined $78, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of those were for a neglect type of situation where the  
kids were left home alone for a period of time without being 
supervised,'' Davis said. ``It wasn't an abuse case like they were 
being beaten or anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His parents said they fled the country after authorities told  
them their other children might be taken from them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very threatened by the authorities,'' Mrs. Wuthrich  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has created an uproar in Switzerland, where people  
can't understand why an 11-year-old boy would be taken away in 
handcuffs and detained. The Swiss foreign ministry has been swamped 
with calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul was in a juvenile detention center from Aug. 30 until a  
court hearing on Tuesday, where a magistrate ruled that the case 
can proceed and had the boy placed in a foster home. The boy will 
move to a residential treatment center when a spot opens up. He is 
due in Juvenile Court on Nov. 8.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Billick Ponders QB Switch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- It's getting tougher for Brian Billick  
to make a case for Stoney Case. 
</P>
<P>
	As Case struggled in his first three weeks as the Baltimore  
Ravens' starting quarterback, Billick said inexperience and poor 
judgment would soon give way to poise and touchdowns. Billick, who 
has coached several outstanding quarterbacks, insisted that Case 
had the tools for stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, less than 24 hours after Case's poor performance in  
Baltimore's 35-8 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Billick offered no 
ringing vote of confidence. And he didn't discount the possibility 
that Tony Banks would be the starter when the Ravens (2-4) face 
Buffalo Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you now what our quarterback situation is going  
to be,'' Billick said. ``I have to think about what is in the best 
interest of (Case) both now and in the future because I believe he 
does have some potential. As does Tony Banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case had one NFL start in four seasons before this year. Despite  
pulling out two preseason games with last-minute throws, he started 
the regular season third on the depth chart. But he replaced an 
ineffective Scott Mitchell in Baltimore's second game, threw for 
the tying touchdown in the waning minutes and took over the top 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Case has yet to complete 50 percent of his passes in a game and  
has six interceptions against only three touchdowns. His 
inexperience was on full display for a national TV audience 
Thursday night, when he went 15-for-37 for 103 yards and three 
interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just played terribly,'' Case said. ``I want the opportunity  
to come back, but that's the coach's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case was a star in high school and still owns virtually every  
passing record at New Mexico. He went through four years of virtual 
inactivity waiting for his chance to be No. 1. Now, things haven't 
gone as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a confident young man,'' Billick said. ``I don't think  
he's been through this before. But I think Stoney can bounce back 
from this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will he get the chance in the Ravens' next game? Hard to say.  
Although Banks was a starter for the St. Louis Rams and was 
8-for-14 in relief against the Chiefs, Billick isn't thrilled about 
the prospect of using a third starter before the season's halfway 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot arbitrarily flip through quarterbacks,'' he said.  
``It's just not good for the organization, it's not good for the 
players, that lack of continuity. By the same token, if you think a 
guy can make a difference, then you make the change. But I'm not 
going to be rash about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In defense of Case, he was operating behind an injury riddled  
offensive line that provided him with little protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's part of football.'' Case said. ``I'm not going to use  
that as an excuse.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombing Critics Seek Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court heard arguments Friday  
that President Clinton exceeded his authority in participating in 
the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Congressional litigants called the 
case the best chance yet to define the authority to declare war. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31 lawmakers who brought the case argued that Clinton  
violated the 1973 War Powers Act because Congress refused to 
authorize the bombing. The Vietnam War-era legislation, which has 
been ignored by presidents of both parties, requires congressional 
approval for ``introduction into hostilities'' of U.S. forces 
lasting more than 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge threw out the case in June without deciding its merits.  
U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman said the lawmakers lacked 
the standing to sue because they failed to show a genuine impasse 
between the president and Congress in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers led by Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., asked a  
three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia to reverse Friedman's decision. The military example in 
Yugoslavia is considered the best chance to clarify congressional 
power, because the bombing lasted 2 1/2 months and followed two 
congressional votes that opposed the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, they flagrantly ignored it,'' Jules Lobel, a lawyer  
representing the lawmakers, said of the administration. ``The 
question here is since Congress stepped up to the plate and 
performed its duty, will the courts do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the judges appeared skeptical that courts could rule over  
whether military actions fit the definition of a war, citing 
military actions in Korea and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're putting a lot of pressure on the judiciary,'' Judge  
Laurence Silberman told the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers led by William Schultz argued that  
the courts have no business ruling in disputes between Congress and 
the president, except in procedural conflicts such as whether a 
bill was properly vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
	The case filed April 30 argues that a 213-213 vote two days  
earlier killed a request to authorize U.S. participation in NATO 
bombing of Yugoslavia. Another vote rejected a declaration of war. 
The bombing had begun March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman said Congress sent ``distinctly mixed messages'' by  
also defeating a bill that would have removed U.S. troops from 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers who attended the hearing said the case offers  
the clearest example of whether Congress can rein in a president 
over military actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say you will never have a clearer case,'' Campbell  
said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Others complained that options such as impeachment or  
withholding funds are impractical in opposing a military action, 
especially if troops are already deployed.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, British Telecom Venture OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators gave final clearance Friday  
to a global joint venture between AT&AMP;T and British 
Telecommunications PLC, a deal that would combine the two 
companies' international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The combine would deal mostly with voice and data service,  
mainly for large commercial users. The venture originally was 
valued at $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission found the application for  
the alliance to be in the public interest but imposed some limited 
conditions on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC approval is the final step in the regulatory process. The  
companies expect to launch the global venture, called Concert, in 
about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased the regulatory agencies both in Europe and the  
U.S. agree that our global joint venture will benefit customers as 
well as the competitive telecommunications marketplace,'' said 
David Dorman, the venture's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC conditioned its approval on the companies compliance  
with an agreement reached among them, the Defense Department, the 
Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The 
accord had to do with potential national security and law 
enforcement problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement requires that domestic telecommunications  
facilities owned by the companies will be controlled by their 
subsidies and located within the United States. This will ensure 
that U.S. law enforcement authorities have both the jurisdiction 
and the technical ability to conduct electronic surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies agreed to take reasonable measures to prevent  
improper use of domestic telecommunications facilities and to adopt 
and maintain policies to ensure electronic surveillance orders and 
other legal authorizations are kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the companies will require security clearances for people  
with access to sensitive network facilities and to keep access from 
unauthorized people. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the FCC's other conditions, AT&AMP;T and their subsidiaries  
would be prohibited from getting exclusive operating agreements 
with British Telecom because of the joint venture. The commission 
also required that BT comply with British regulations that the 
company must give its competitors access to local customers for 
long-distance and international calls at the same level of access 
that BT has. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will use their combined international networks to  
become a ``carrier's carrier'' for long-distance services offered 
by telephone companies operating in numerous markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, in announcing the deal in July 1998, said the  
venture would operate in three main areas: 
</P>
<P>
	--A worldwide voice and data business offering telephone networks  
to multinational corporations and other big institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	--A global sales and service business that initially will target  
corporate clients in the financial, oil and information technology 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--An international carrier services business that will develop  
low-cost communications links around the world for both individual 
and business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, AT&AMP;T and BT carry about half the calling traffic  
between the United States and Britain but own less than 20 percent 
of the network capacity.

<HEADLINE> NFL Fines Panthers' Barrow $7,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Mike Barrow's reputation as one of the  
NFL's tireless volunteers in the community didn't stop the league 
from fining him for breaking its rules on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrow, a Carolina Panthers linebacker, was assessed a $7,500  
fine Thursday for his helmet-to-helmet hit on San Francisco 
quarterback Jeff Garcia in Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrow, the team's spokesman for the United Way campaign and a  
player who devotes countless hours to helping disadvantaged 
children, declined to comment on the fine, saying it was a private 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine was a result of league rules that specifically bar  
helmet-to-helmet hits on quarterbacks when they are in the pocket 
and unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers were penalized 15 yards for unnecessary roughness  
on the fourth-quarter play that led to Barrow's fine. Barrow came 
charging up the middle of the pocket and, leading with the crown of 
his helmet, lunged into Garcia's face mask, knocking him on his 
back just after he released the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's pass to Jerry Rice fell incomplete, but the penalty  
moved the ball to the Carolina 35, and San Francisco scored seven 
plays later to cut its deficit to 31-29 with 1:32 left. The 
Panthers held on to win by the same score. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrow's teammates came to the defense Thursday of a player who  
frequently leads Bible study sessions and has been known to work 
until the wee hours of the morning at schools, churches and soup 
kitchens in both Charlotte and his hometown of Homestead, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those deals where you just have to be with him and  
be around him to see his heart,'' said defensive tackle Sean 
Gilbert, one of Barrow's close friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrow, in his third year with the Panthers after playing his  
first four pro seasons in Houston, frequently takes dozens of young 
students to NFL games as rewards for doing well in school. He also 
finances and coaches several basketball teams for at-risk 
teen-agers and is a member of Charlotte's Community Outreach 
Christian Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's done so much and his heart is so open to service,''  
Gilbert said. ``But we play an aggressive game. I don't think 
anyone's intentions, for the most part, are to go out and try to 
end anyone's career. But it's a game of wills, and you're always 
fighting to dominate the other team's will. That's what makes it so 
competitive.''

<HEADLINE> Burger King Can Keep Big Kids Meals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Burger King can continue to sell its ``Big Kids  
Meal'' as it battles for preteen appetites with McDonald's, a judge 
ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge John Corbett O'Meara denied a  
preliminary injunction that McDonald's had sought against Burger 
King to keep it from using the name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oak Brook, Ill.-based company sued its hamburger rival this  
summer, saying the Big Kids Meal offered by Burger King in June 
essentially copied a program it launched last year to lure more 
preteens into McDonald's restaurants near Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-based Burger King has said the name ``Big Kids Meal,''  
which McDonald's unsuccessfully tried to trademark, was a 
description, not a trademark infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one owns the English language,'' Burger King spokeswoman  
Kim Miller said. ``We're extremely pleased with the ruling. We feel 
vindicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa Howard said the company would review  
the ruling before deciding what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did what we thought was right, and we still think it was  
right,'' she said. ``We will continue to aggressively protect our 
trademarks.''

<HEADLINE> Bush-Bashing Biographer Had Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The biographer who accused GOP presidential  
front-runner George W. Bush of burying a cocaine arrest apparently 
had a secret of his own: a 1988 conviction for plotting to murder a 
co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure about James Howard Hatfield prompted his  
publisher on Thursday to suspend sales, shipment and promotion of 
the new book, ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of an 
American President.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield was still on parole from a 15-year prison term while  
writing his book on the Texas governor, and also did time for 
embezzlement, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Hatfield through his publisher, St. Martin's  
Press, were unsuccessful. The publisher did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign has its legal staff reviewing the matter for  
possible libel implications, spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield alleged that Bush was arrested in 1972 for cocaine  
possession but did only community service after his father, former 
President Bush, intervened. The arrest record was later expunged at 
the request of the elder Bush, the book alleged. Hatfield cited 
three anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious (the book) was not checked,'' Ms. Hughes said  
Friday. The Texas governor previously ripped the book as ``science 
fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book was due out in January 2000 but was released early  
after the manuscript arrived with the cocaine story. The publisher 
said 70,000 copies are already in stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com said they will keep selling  
the book. It was already in Amazon's top 50 best sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News first reported Hatfield's criminal  
background on Thursday. Hatfield, 41, told the newspaper it was a 
case of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, a Dallas lawyer, Norman L. ``Happy'' Nelson Jr.,  
said that the author and the convict are one and the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who knew Hatfield for about nine years before the 1988  
conviction, said he was stunned to see Hatfield's picture in the 
newspaper as the Bush biographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture in the paper was the picture of the bomber,''  
Nelson said. ``That was him. I quite frankly didn't like him 
denying that he had a record, when I knew he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Castlebury, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal  
Justice, confirmed that a James Howard Hatfield was arrested in 
1987 for solicitation of murder -- hiring a hit man to plant a bomb 
under a co-worker's car. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was found guilty, Hatfield went to prison in 1988 and  
spent the next five years there. Upon his release, Hatfield was 
turned over to federal authorities; he wound up doing a short 
stretch in El Reno, Okla., for embezzling nearly $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While prison authorities would not provide details, Nelson said  
that Hatfield had tried to kill a co-worker when she suspected him 
of embezzling federal Housing and Urban Development funds. The 
woman later testified against Hatfield in the embezzlement case, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb planted beneath the co-worker's car only partially  
detonated, and she escaped serious injury, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield, who moved to Arkansas with the approval of Texas  
authorities, remains on parole through April 15, 2003, Castlebury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his official biography, Hatfield was ``a syndicated  
columnist, free-lance Texas journalist and frequent contributor to 
several Lone Star State newspapers and magazines.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Gang Clearing Out ATMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A sophisticated Russian criminal ring has been  
clearing out bank accounts in several countries -- including the 
United States -- by tampering with ATM machines in Moscow in a scam 
that has mainly targeted foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	The full extent of the fraud is not yet known, but authorities  
believe hundreds of thousands of dollars have been stolen by a 
well-organized criminal group that may have insider connections at 
Russian banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The thieves manipulated ATMs in Moscow and other cities to get  
the PIN codes, and then made false cards which were used to 
withdraw money at automatic teller machines in Western Europe, 
Israel, Russia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	One victim, American George Sullivan, a production manager at  
the Troika Dialog investment bank in Moscow, said he lost $2,300 
through his MBNA Bank Visa card. 
</P>
<P>
	``Withdrawals took place in Tel Aviv in the beginning of May,''  
said Sullivan, noting that the criminals hit his limit on the card 
before it was frozen. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I told MBNA that there was apparently a rash of these  
cases going on in Russia, they said this was the first they'd heard 
of it,'' Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some foreigners who had money stolen from their bank accounts  
were having problems getting reimbursements from their banks, The 
Moscow Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ATM machines were out of service in central Moscow for much  
of Thursday, but bank officials declined to say if the problem was 
linked to the thefts. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's loosely regulated banking system has been subject to  
all sorts of fraud and there is an almost universal distrust of 
banks. Many depositors lost all or part of their money when banks 
collapsed during a financial crisis last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking system remains so primitive that checking accounts  
simply do not exist. Banks in remote parts of the country still use 
abacuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Russians, even middle-class professionals, don't have bank  
accounts because they don't feel their money would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, cash machines are widely available in Moscow and a few  
other big cities, and many people rely on ATMs as their sole means 
of getting cash. The ATMs are particularly popular among foreign 
residents, who also tend not to have bank accounts in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The thieves might have acquired the personal identification  
numbers with the help of accomplices in the Russian banks, said a 
Moscow police official in charge of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know yet how they were able to learn PIN codes,''  
said the official, who asked to be identified only by his first 
name, Oleg. ``They could have done that both by mechanical action 
and electronic means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said no suspects have been arrested in Russia, but four  
people were arrested in Munich, Germany, earlier this year, and the 
ring is believed to be much larger. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer didn't give the exact number of the fraud victims,  
but said it appeared to be in the hundreds. The amount of money 
stolen is still being determined, but an early estimate puts it in 
the hundreds of thousands dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The theft hit clients of Europay and Visa, the world's leading  
card payment companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Oleg said officials were alerted to the fraud by expatriates who  
withdrew cash from ATMs located in Russia's provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got the first signals from five regions in late 1998,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The thieves quickly moved to Moscow, targeting ATMs in the  
Russian capital in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Warner, head of the fraud and security department at  
Europay in Brussels, Belgium, confirmed the Munich arrests and said 
the company was working with Moscow police and other payment 
systems on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner said the thieves apparently learned the PIN numbers by  
tampering with the machines, rather than by breaking the encryption 
system used to protect clients on automated banking networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was an encryption problem, it would be a much larger  
problem than the one we currently have,'' Warner said in a 
telephone interview. ``We know that it was in Russia, and know 
which ATMs were involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europay has sent out a warning to cardholders around the world,  
Warner added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not talking about thousands of cards, and probably, not  
even hundreds of cards,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it will take time to assess the full damage, he added.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're only at the point of identifying where the problem is,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Play Final NBA Game At Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The marquee announcing coming  
attractions at the Great Western Forum had only one listing Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nov. 6 -- Kings of Comedy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Wrong Kings, but hockey's Los Angeles Kings, along with Los  
Angeles' two NBA teams, are going downtown, moving into the $400 
million Staples Center. 
</P>
<P>
	After 32 years, the Forum's heyday came to an understated end  
Friday night with an NBA exhibition doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 12,510 watched the Lakers bring down the curtain on  
Showtime with a 112-100 loss to the Phoenix Suns in the title game 
of the Great Western Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before, the Miami Heat and Golden State Warriors took the  
court for the third-place game in front of about 200 fans at the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat coach Pat Riley contributed to all six of the NBA  
championship banners hanging in the Forum's rafters, as a player 
(1972), assistant (1980) and head coach (1982, 1985, 1987, 1988). 
</P>
<P>
	``All the good things in my life happened here,'' Riley said of  
coaching the Forum's penultimate game. ``I can only hope to 
duplicate, or even come close to that, somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a special place,'' Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal  
said. ``We're going to miss it. A lot of legends dominated this 
floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The retired uniforms of seven of them are displayed across from  
the championship banners. Both sets of momentos will stay where 
they are, with replicas to be installed in the Staples Center. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical Lakers crowd displayed little sentimentality about  
bidding the Forum farewell. Some fans held up a banner between the 
third and fourth quarters which read, ``6 Titles, 11 Conference 
Championships, 3,000-plus games with Chick,'' a reference to 
longtime Lakers announcer Chick Hearn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's strange for the Forum to be closed with exhibitions,  
after as many championships as have been played here,'' said Phil 
Jackson, who won't get to coach the Lakers in the place where his 
Chicago Bulls won the first of their six NBA titles, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forum will continue as a venue for occasional concerts and  
other special events. 
</P>
<P>
	Its end as a prime-time venue was low-key. The first 10,000 fans  
at Friday night's game received commemorative videotapes and CDs, 
and a montage of highlights flashed on the video board after the 
final -- really final -- whistle.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska-Texas a Hot New Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- In many ways, Nebraska-Texas is the hot new  
rivalry in college football even if only for a little while. 
</P>
<P>
	It has everything: revenge, respect (and disrespect), two ranked  
teams and two victories by underdog Texas in the past three years 
that ended Nebraska streaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think either team thinks this is (just) another  
game,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said as the 18th-ranked Longhorns 
(5-2, 2-1 Big 12) prepared to meet No. 3 Nebraska (6-0, 3-0) 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge,'' Longhorns cornerback Ahmad Brooks said. ``It's a  
game for Texas to gain national attention and find itself. This 
game is about more than the Big 12. It's about traditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only problem is the series goes on hold after Saturday.  
Because of the split between the Big 12 North and South divisions, 
the teams aren't scheduled to meet again during the regular season 
until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	They could play each other in the conference title game during  
the off years and possibly even meet again at the end of this 
season. Both teams are tied for first in their respective 
conference divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems logical that these tradition-rich programs would have  
played each more than just six times. The rivalry didn't spark 
until the Big 8 and Southwest conferences merged. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Texas surprisingly beat Nebraska twice.  
</P>
<P>
	Texas' victory in the 1996 conference title game ended the  
Huskers' run for a third consecutive national title. The Longhorns 
won again at Lincoln last year, breaking Nebraska's 47-game home 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas and Florida State (1992-93) are the only teams to beat  
Nebraska twice during the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska coach Frank Solich said his team doesn't think about  
those games anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened last season is well behind us,'' Solich said.  
``We try not to hang on to things. That's not a factor as far as 
our players are concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Solich misjudged his players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hate Texas. We want to beat them in the worst way,''  
Nebraska center Dominic Raiola said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are talking some big trash,'' Texas wide receiver Kwame  
Cavil said. ``The pressure is on them. They have expectations of a 
national title and they still haven't beaten us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest pressure will likely come at Texas quarterback Major  
Applewhite, who passed for 269 yards and two touchdowns against 
Nebraska last year. He is averaging 298.7 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska has the stingiest defense in the Big 12, giving up  
230.8 total yards and allowing only 9.7 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longhorns expect Nebraska to mimic Kansas State's blitzing  
game plan that produced a 35-17 Wildcats victory three weeks ago. 
K-State converted six Applewhite turnovers into 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite seems ready to take a pounding Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wish that last year's victory gave me more confidence about  
this week's game,'' he said. ``But we are a different Texas team 
this year.''

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Ironman Attracts Large Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- Defending men's champion Peter Reid  
of Canada is among seven former winners entered in the largest 
field ever in Saturday's Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon World 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport's prestige event consists of a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a  
112-mile bike through the hot and often windy lava fields, and a 
marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,500 professionals and amateurs are registered,  
representing every state and 51 countries. The oldest entrant is 
76. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the entrants, who have a 17-hour time limit,  
will be first-time competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Several top entrants, including 1997 winner Thomas Hellriegel of  
Germany, 1996 winner Luc Van Lierde of Belgium and 1994 winner Greg 
Welch of Australia, also are training for the Olympic triathlon 
distance, a 1.5-kilometer swim, a 40K bike and 10K run. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to work on not sprinting because you can't `hammer'  
the whole day in the Ironman,'' said Hellriegel, the Hawaiian 
course record-holder. ``If you try to do that, the hammer will hit 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The triathlon will make its Olympic debut next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to train for both distances,'' said Lother  
Leder of Germany, who finished third the past two years. ``I have 
very good memories in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in shorter distances, it only lasts 1 hour, 45 minutes.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Ironman is Reid's specialty distance.  
</P>
<P>
	Last May, he won his third straight Australian Ironman title by  
11 minutes. Two months later, he won the inaugural Austrian Ironman 
and broke the 8-hour barrier (7:51:56) by finishing with a 2:35:21 
marathon, the fastest ever to conclude an Ironman event. 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia, Reid's wife, Lori Bowden, also of Canada, won the  
women's title, the first time a husband-wife team won the same 
Ironman event in the same year. Bowden won by 14 minutes and set a 
marathon course record of 3:08:52. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing in strong winds last year, Reid won in 8:24:20.  
</P>
<P>
	Reigning women's champion Natascha Badmann of Switzerland will  
not defend her title because she's focusing on shorter-distance 
triathlons to train for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Bowden will be favored to improve upon her  
second-place finishes the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Fuhr of Canada, who has eight career Ironman titles, won  
this year's Ironman Brazil and Ironman Lake Placid, N.Y., and is 
expected to challenge Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Smyers, of Lincoln, Mass., winner of the 1995 Hawaii race,  
is returning after a three-year absence from childbirth and 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The professional men and women compete for $250,000 in prize  
money, including $35,000 overall and split bonuses to winners. 
</P>
<P>
	The amateur field includes New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson;  
``General Hospital'' star Real Andrews; Lyn Brooks, of Baltimore, 
who will attempt to become the race's first 20-time finisher and 
then retire; and triathlon pioneer Scott Tinley of Del Mar, Calif.,

<HEADLINE> Novelist Penelope Mortimer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Penelope Mortimer, whose semi-autobiographical  
stories explored the emotional impact of failing marriages among 
the British upper classes, has died at 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mortimer, who was also well known in Britain for her  
controversial and unreverential 1986 biography of Queen Elizabeth 
the Queen Mother, died Tuesday of cancer, her family said. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Ms. Mortimer's dozen novels were well-received,  
and ``The Pumpkin Eater,'' published in 1962, was made into a 
successful film starring James Mason and Anne Bancroft. She also 
wrote two acclaimed volumes of memoirs and several television 
screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Oxfordshire, Ms. Mortimer published her first novel,  
``Johanna,'' in 1947 under the name Penelope Dimont. At the time 
she had been married for 10 years to the journalist Charles Dimont. 
Divorced by 1949, she married John Mortimer, whose debut novel 
appeared the same year as his future wife's. 
</P>
<P>
	She published ``A Villa in Summer'' in 1954, her first novel as  
Penelope Mortimer. Its subject matter -- the complex, turbulent 
currents of married life -- was one that she would explore 
throughout the remainder of her literary life. 
</P>
<P>
	During the '50s, she also published ``The Bright Prison'' and  
``Daddy's Gone A-Hunting,'' and with her husband an account of a 
family vacation in Italy, ``With Love and Lizards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her reputation was sealed with ``The Pumpkin Eater,'' and she  
followed with ``My Friend Says it's Bulletproof'' (1968), ``The 
Home'' (1971), and ``Long Distance'' (1974), before publishing the 
first volume of her memoirs, called ``About Time,'' which won the 
Whitbread Prize in 1979. The second part of her autobiography, 
published in 1993, included a frank account of her troubled 
marriage to Mortimer, which ended in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, she published ``Queen Elizabeth: A Life of the Queen  
Mother,'' which provoked controversy because of its allegations 
about the beloved royal's romantic life before her marriage to the 
future King George VI. ``The Queen Mother: An Alternative Portrait 
of Her Life and Times'' followed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mortimer also was a regular contributor to British  
newspapers as a reviewer of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by a son and five daughters.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Incest Trial Parents Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The parents of an 11-year-old  
Swiss-American boy whose arrest on incest charges has created a 
furor in Switzerland ran a business out of their home called 
``Ultimate Fantasies,'' The Denver Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas and Beverly Wuthrich, who fled to Switzerland after  
their son was arrested, registered the business in July, according 
to records cited by the newspaper. It quoted a source close to the 
investigation as saying it is an adult video production company. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County authorities confirmed Thursday they are looking  
into the business, but said they don't know what it did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investigators are aware of the business and are currently  
trying to establish exactly what type of business it is,'' said 
Steve Davis, spokesman for the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview this morning on NBC's ``Today, Mrs. Wuthrich  
denied any involvement in an adult-video company. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said records also show that she pleaded guilty  
last year to a misdemeanor child-neglect charge and a second, 
similar charge is pending. The mother was ordered to undergo 
parenting classes and fined $78, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of those were for a neglect type of situation where the  
kids were left home alone for a period of time without being 
supervised,'' Davis said. ``It wasn't an abuse case like they were 
being beaten or anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple fled with their three other children after the boy,  
Raoul, was arrested on aggravated incest charges. Authorities began 
the investigation after a neighbor reported that she saw him fondle 
his sister. He is accused of inappropriate sexual contact with his 
5-year-old sister. Mrs. Wuthrich said this morning that her son and 
daughter told her he was trying to help her go to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents, who have dual U.S.-Swiss citizenship, said they  
left after authorities told them their other children might be 
taken from them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very threatened by the authorities,'' Mrs. Wuthrich  
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Raoul was in a juvenile detention center from Aug. 30 until a  
court hearing on Tuesday, where a magistrate ruled that the case 
can proceed and had the boy placed in a foster home. The boy will 
move to a residential treatment center when a spot opens up. He is 
due in Juvenile Court on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has created a furor in Switzerland, where people can't  
understand why an 11-year-old boy would be taken away in handcuffs 
and detained. The Swiss foreign ministry has been swamped with 
calls.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Train Derails East of L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CATHEDRAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- An Amtrak train carrying 147  
passengers derailed today in the desert east of Los Angeles, 
slightly injuring at least two people. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven rear cars, two of them passenger cars, apparently jumped  
the track about 5:30 a.m. near Interstate 10, just east of Palm 
Springs and some 110 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	There were at least two injuries, but no details were available,  
said Ray Dampier of the Riverside County Fire Department. Amtrak 
spokesman Cliff Black said no passengers were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the cars on the westbound Sunset Limited from Orlando,  
Fla., to Los Angeles tipped over, Black said. The train's speed 
wasn't immediately known and the cause was not clear, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have ordered buses to take passengers to their  
destination,'' Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train consisted of three engines and 16 cars, which included  
five ``express cars'' at the rear carrying mail and packages. Two 
rear passenger cars and five express cars slipped off the track. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, another Amtrak train derailed some 125 miles  
northeast of Los Angeles after the region was shaken by an 
earthquake. Four of the 155 passengers on the Chicago-to-Los 
Angeles train suffered minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Push for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Selling President Clinton's ideas on education  
became a family enterprise Friday. While he was making his case in 
a speech at a Washington hotel, his wife was on Capitol Hill, 
making the same points in the company of Senate Democrats she hopes 
to join. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has something to celebrate: House passage Thursday by a  
358-67 vote of a $9.9 billion education bill and rejection of a 
Republican proposal to give federal aid directly to parents for 
private school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to agree generally on what I think is an adequate  
increase in funding,'' Clinton told the National Board for 
Professional Teaching Standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill aims at boosting the achievement of 10.5 million poor  
and otherwise disadvantaged schoolchildren -- all good news, Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is no commitment yet for more and better teachers,  
for smaller classes, for increased accountability, for higher 
standards, for giving the tools out there'' that teachers need, 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, at a news conference, Hillary Rodham Clinton and  
Senate Democrats stressed they would oppose, and Clinton would 
veto, any education spending bill that does not provide enough 
money to meet the administration's goal of hiring 100,000 new 
teachers to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House complains that the Republican version of the  
education spending bill also threatens the jobs of 30,000 federally 
funded teachers hired last year and provides no money to add 8,000 
teachers to their ranks, as Clinton proposed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican leadership and the Republicans in Congress have  
consistently voted against what Americans want in education,'' Mrs. 
Clinton said. ``They have denied thousands of children the chance 
to learn in smaller classes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Committee on  
Education and the Workforce, defended GOP priorities in the ongoing 
talks on the fiscal 2000 education spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``needs to go the next step and understand that the  
direction in which he wants to go on the hiring of additional 
teachers is not in the best interest of students across the 
country,'' Goodling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has pushed the idea of smaller class sizes and more  
teachers since he took office. A deadline is implicit in his pitch 
this year; the White House and Congress are now hashing out the 
budget to fund the government during Clinton's last year in office. 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton is pushing to complete his education to-do list, his  
wife is making the issue central to her all-but-declared Senate 
race. If she wins the 2000 race in New York, Mrs. Clinton will take 
office just as her husband leaves the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president and the administration have been listening to  
the American people, and they presented Congress with a plan to do 
just what the American people want in prioritizing the needs of 
education,'' Mrs. Clinton said at the news conference, called by 
Democrats already serving in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, referred to her as ``Senator Clinton.''  
</P>
<P>
	``She will be the education senator,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy,  
D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope you do decide to run for the Senate,'' said Sen. Patty  
Murray, D-Wash. ``We have been able to put education on the 
national agenda; with you here, it will become the national 
agenda.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Suicide Rate Worries Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Faced with rising claims because of Japan's surging  
suicide rate, the country's life insurers are making it tougher for 
customers to collect benefits when a policyholder kills himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Major Japanese insurers generally refuse to pay suicide benefits  
on policies under a year old. But some companies are doubling that 
period as a wave of suicides hits Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life insurers have been accused ... of making it easy for  
people to commit suicide for money,'' said Ken Natori, spokesman 
for Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. ``The change in our policy 
is in answer to that accusation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were 31,755 suicides in Japan in 1998, a 35 percent jump  
from the previous year's level. Experts blamed the trend on the 
country's economic downturn and other social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The suicide rate of men in their 50s posted the biggest  
increase, and insurance officials say that some men laid off from 
their jobs kill themselves so that their families can live in 
comfort off the insurance money. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has no law that mandates how insurance companies deal with  
suicides of policy holders, said Masaru Tanabe, spokesman for the 
Life Insurance Association of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In France and Italy, the law dictates that insurance payment for  
suicides can be paid out only after two years of belonging to a 
life insurance policy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, the law differs from state to state.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Fall on Brazil Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures took another tumble Friday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as rain in Brazil continued to ease concerns 
about dry planting conditions there. Grain prices were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
        Forecasts of more rain in northern areas of Brazil and a technical  
followthrough to Thursday's slump sent soybeans to their lowest level 
in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
        The wave of selling occurred as the November contract was expiring.  
</P>
<P>
        Corn edged lower, pushed downward by soybean selling, but losses  
were limited on a quiet trading day. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat prices were supported by continuing dry conditions in  
both northern Argentina and the southwestern U.S. winter wheat belt. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $2.58 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1/2 cent to $1.99 1/2 a bushel; December oats were 
unchanged at $1.09 a bushel; November soybeans fell 7 cents to $4.72 
3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
        December cattle rose .43 cent to 69.20 cents a pound; November  
feeder cattle fell .10 cent to 81.10 cents a pound; December lean hogs 
rose .50 cent to 49.25 cents a pound; February frozen pork bellies 
fell 1.28 cent to 64.82 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine Worries Growing in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lot of today's new parents weren't around  
when polio was so dreaded that children were kept from the movies 
or the beach during the summer because of fears the paralyzing 
virus would sweep through a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you can remember when measles killed more than 2,000  
American children in a single year -- 1941 -- you're probably too old 
to have kids who now need their measles shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaccinations have protected millions of Americans from diseases  
like polio and measles. But a backlash is starting -- from parents 
who don't remember the heartbreak of some of the world's most 
contagious killers, and question why their babies need the shots 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, doctors are growing more concerned that some parents  
fear possible side effects of vaccines more than the disease. While 
such fears on rare occasions may be real, more often they are 
unproved and alarmist, the doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a disease wanes, people's attention shifts,'' says Dr.  
Bruce Gellin of Vanderbilt University, who directs a new National 
Immunization Information Network that is researching how to help 
doctors give parents the most scientifically sound vaccine 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaccination is considered the century's biggest public health  
success. Vaccines eradicated smallpox. Polio, one of the most 
feared diseases until an effective vaccine was found in 1955, could 
disappear in a few years. Last year, the nation recorded just 100 
measles cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, let up on vaccination before a disease is eradicated and it  
rapidly bounces back. The United States lapsed with measles 
inoculations in 1989, and 55,000 people got sick and 120 died. When 
diphtheria immunization recently dipped in Russia, 2,000 cases 
occurred -- just waiting for an unvaccinated tourist to carry the 
disease home. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as doctors worry about complacency, reports abound about  
possible vaccine side effects -- from scary media stories to 
Internet sites. Vaccines are not perfect. They sometimes cause 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawmaker complained this summer that 11,000 children were  
reported to have had some reaction after inoculations last year, 
the majority minor but some serious. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Surgeon General David Satcher told Congress, study after  
study proves serious side effects are rare -- tens of millions of 
vaccine doses are given safely every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Public health experts do work to minimize side effects. That's  
why a vaccine against rotavirus, the leading cause of severe 
childhood diarrhea, was pulled off the market last week. Doctors 
monitored the possibility that the year-old vaccine might increase 
infants' risk of a rare but dangerous bowel obstruction, and 
stopped vaccinations when clues emerged that it did. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, tolerance for vaccine side effects wanes as the  
disease does. Take the oral polio vaccine, a potent live-virus 
vaccine but one that carried a small risk of actually causing 
polio. By the mid-1990s, about 10 of the 4 million American 
children who swallowed the vaccine each year caught polio from it. 
Parents vehemently objected, and now a polio shot that eliminates 
that threat is used instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But what really worries doctors is the spread of alarming and  
unproved allegations, such as claims linking the decades-old 
measles vaccine to autism. Parents in parts of Britain have held 
``measles parties,'' deliberately exposing children to measles so 
they would get the disease very young and consequently avoid 
vaccination. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientific studies find no evidence that the measles vaccine  
causes autism -- but measles itself can be worse than just a rashy 
rite of passage. Among the complications: One in every 1,000 
measles patients gets encephalitis, and one in four of those who do 
will die or suffer neurological damage, Gellin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What people don't understand is they're putting their children  
at a true risk of complications from measles against ... at best a 
hypothetical and totally unproven argument about autism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gellin's new network is researching how to help doctors address  
such skewed perceptions of risk. In the meantime, its Internet site 
points parents to science-based Web pages they can consult today. 
The information at http://www.idsociety.org/vaccine/resources.htm 
explains research that separates real side effects from debunked 
claims, lists ongoing studies to settle allegations, and explains 
each vaccine's value. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pointing them to the same sources that we as physicians  
look at,'' Gellin said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Wants U.S. Brokerage Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese securities regulators recommended  
punishment for Cresvale International Ltd., the subsidiary of a 
Princeton, N.J. company embroiled in charges of a $1 billion 
securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators said Friday that Cresvale executives gave  
kickbacks to Japanese companies and provided false information 
about investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The usual punishment in such cases is to shut down the offending  
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale marketed interest-bearing promissory notes to about 100  
Japanese companies, which the company now cannot repay. The 
promissory notes were issued by Princeton Economics International 
Ltd., and the money was invested by its chairman, Martin A. 
Armstrong Jr., a well-known market forecaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale's operations in Tokyo were suspended for six months in  
September, and Armstrong has been indicted in the United States. He 
pleaded innocent. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arts May Improve Students' Grade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If your teen-agers want to be in the high  
school band or drama club, let them. It may improve their grades. 
</P>
<P>
	High school students who take music lessons and join theater  
groups do better in math, reading, history, geography and 
citizenship, according to a study of Education Department data to 
be published today. 
</P>
<P>
	``If young Americans are to succeed and to contribute to what  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan describes as our 'economy 
of ideas,' they will need an education that develops imaginative, 
flexible and tough-minded thinking,'' Education Secretary Richard 
Riley said in a message accompanying the study. ``The arts 
powerfully nurture the ability to think in this manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which tracked more than 25,000 students for more than  
10 years, found that students who reported consistently high levels 
of involvement with instrumental music scored significantly higher 
on math tests by the 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
	This observation held true for students regardless of their  
parents' income, occupations and levels of education, said James S. 
Catterall, the lead author and an education professor at the 
University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	While 38.6 percent of higher-income students who were uninvolved  
in music scored high in math, 48 percent of those highly interested 
in music received the high marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids who are more advantaged tend to be more involved in the  
arts. Period. They have more opportunities and you'd expect them to 
do better,'' Catterall said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But the influence of music was far more pronounced among  
lower-income students. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the lower-income students without music involvement, only  
15.5 percent achieved high math scores. But of the musically 
oriented group, more than twice as many excelled in math. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a matter of economic advantage. It's a matter of  
something happening with the arts for the kids,'' Catterall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that as students progress through high  
school they are less likely to be involved in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a clear trend,'' Catterall said. ``Kids participation  
in the arts declines. It may be that high schools offer fewer 
programs than middle schools or that kids are more concerned with 
academics or admissions to college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 3 percent of seniors take out-of-school classes in  
music, art or dance, compared with more than 11 percent of 
sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the ``high-involvement'' seniors are found in  
top levels on standardized tests, compared with fewer than 43 
percent of the ``low-involvement'' seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also indicated arts study affected students' racial  
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students at grade 10 were asked if it was OK to make a racist  
remark,'' the authors wrote. ``About 40 percent 'no-drama' students 
felt that making such a remark would be OK, where only about 12 
percent of high theater students thought the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the 12th graders involved in plays were compared to their  
uninvolved counterparts, 20 percent more of those active in drama 
had excellent reading skills.

<HEADLINE> Win Puts Chiefs Near AFC West Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Their third road victory in two seasons  
has the Kansas City Chiefs poised for their biggest home game in at 
least that long. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego (4-1) will be in Arrowhead Stadium a week from Sunday  
to face the Chiefs (4-2) with first place in the AFC West possibly 
on the line. First, the Chargers have to play host to Green Bay 
this Sunday. And Seattle (3-2) could make it even more crowded at 
the top by beating Buffalo at home on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs will have the weekend off to savor a 35-8 victory  
over the quarterback-challenged Baltimore Ravens Thursday night, 
their first victory of the season away from Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won on the road,'' were the first words out of first-year  
coach Gunther Cunningham's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs did more than simply pull off a rare road victory. In  
addition, their aggressive defense returned two interceptions off 
Stoney Case for touchdowns and came within four minutes of their 
first road shutout in 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Case, who was replaced in the fourth quarter, was 15-for-37 for  
103 with three interceptions while being constantly harried. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs' Elvis Grbac, frequently booed in Arrowhead Stadium  
during his checkered three years as starter, was almost 
mistake-free in contrast. He threw only 16 passes, but two went for 
touchdowns to Tony Gonzalez, who may be emerging as one of the 
league's top tight ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense played extremely hard,'' Cunningham said. ``We  
took them out of the run game right now. I figured we would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was only 7-0 in the second quarter when 34-year-old  
cornerback James Hasty intercepted Case's pass and cruised 56 yards 
for a touchdown. Hasty also had another interception and totaled 11 
tackles in one of the best games in his 12-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have some serious tendencies on third down and second and  
short,'' said Hasty, who is known for studying every opponent. 
``They run the receiver 6 (yards) and have him break out. I watched 
that on film and anticipated the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interceptions gave Hasty an AFC-leading four for the season  
and 38 for his career, tying for eighth among active players with 
teammate Cris Dishman. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham was so pleased with the rousing road victory that he  
didn't even get mad at Donnie Edwards for lateralling the ball to 
Reggie Tongue after intercepting one of Case's poorly thrown 
passes. Of course, Tongue went for a touchdown that made it 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a big lateral guy,'' Cunningham said. ``But Donnie  
Edwards did the right thing. Reggie Tongue had a couple of tough 
games in the sense he has to make plays. In practice on Friday, he 
intercepted four passes. And I knew his time was going to come.''

<HEADLINE> Trial of Ex-Teamster Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Teamsters' former political director has  
gone on trial, accused by federal prosecutors of funneling union 
money to the re-election campaign of former President Ron Carey 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	William Hamilton has been charged with conspiracy, embezzlement,  
mail fraud, wire fraud, lying to an election officer and perjury. 
His trial began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Robert Gage, said the $885,000 in contributions to  
political organizations were legitimate as a part of a new effort 
by the once-powerful union to gain clout with an increasingly 
hostile White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gage said his client was an innocent victim of false charges  
brought by prosecutors relying on lies by convicted felons trying 
to reduce potential prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Hamilton's not guilty of anything he's been charged  
with,'' Gage said Thursday. He said all contributions were ``to 
accomplish important political goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Rice said Hamilton conspired with  
others to make the contributions solely as rewards for donations to 
Carey's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``They betrayed the union and its members and broke the law,''  
Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey narrowly defeated James P. Hoffa in the 1996 election,  
which was overturned after investigators found that Carey's 
campaign had improperly benefited from donations the union made to 
the organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa was elected president of the 1.4-million union in another  
election while Carey and Hamilton were barred for life from joining 
or working for the union by an Independent Review Board in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said money was paid out to four third-party political  
organizations with the understanding that money would then be 
contributed to the effort to re-elect Carey. The union is not 
permitted to use its money to fund elections for union members. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor said the contributions to organizations,  
including one for senior citizens and another which encouraged 
people to vote, were staggering in their size and unprecedented, 
especially since the union was nearly broke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money poured out of the Teamsters like water from an open  
faucet,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jere Nash, Carey's campaign manager, political consultant Martin  
Davis and telemarketer Michael Ansara all pleaded guilty to the 
scheme in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said Nash and Ansara will testify at the trial, and  
evidence will include many documents such as contribution requests, 
checks from wealthy contributors and other parts of a long paper 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
	He said witnesses would include members of the Clinton-Gore  
re-election committee who were approached by representatives of the 
union seeking donors to Carey's campaign.

<HEADLINE> JobBenet Case May Be Reexamined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The task force reexamining the JonBenet Ramsey  
case met again Friday and Gov. Bill Owens said he may decide next 
week whether to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the 
murder of the 6-year-old beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens and members of the task force he called met four times  
this week to consider the case after a grand jury failed to issue 
any indictments following a 13-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when a decision on a special prosecutor would be made,  
Owens said, ``Hopefully next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the grand jury's results were announced Oct. 13, police  
said that JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain under 
an ``umbrella of suspicion'' in the slaying of JonBenet at their 
Boulder home. Boulder County prosecutor Alex Hunter said they have 
not been eliminated from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys have insisted they are innocent.  
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Patsy Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father said he found his daughter's 
body in the basement.

<HEADLINE> Where Did Letterman's Audience Go? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It didn't make the headlines -- David Letterman  
seldom does these days -- but the Emmy that the ``Late Show'' won 
last month was welcome confirmation that some people whose opinions 
matter are still watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nice thing,'' joked ``Late Show'' executive producer Rob  
Burnett, ``is that CBS comes around with a big barrel of cash and 
everyone takes what they want. It's sweet. Very, very sweet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fresh comedy and awards, Letterman is still competitive with  
his late-night rival, NBC's Jay Leno. Among viewers, though, it's 
been no contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman beat Leno in the ratings for a while after NBC chose  
Leno in 1993 as Johnny Carson's successor on the ``Tonight Show.'' 
But Leno soon eclipsed him and his lead steadily widened. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman's average nightly audience of 3.6 million people this  
year is less than half what it was just five years ago -- an 
eye-popping decline even in an era where networks expect 
diminishing viewership. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, there are signs that Letterman's slide may have bottomed  
out. 
</P>
<P>
	These are not easy numbers to watch if you're Burnett, who  
started as an intern in 1985 and worked his way up to executive 
producer by 1996. (Presumably they're not easy for Letterman, 
either, but he's not talking). 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett will never see the ratings as proof that Leno puts on a  
better show, though maybe it's pleasing to more people. Jay's 
blander style of comedy may simply play better than Dave's sarcasm 
at a time many people would rather be touched by an angel than by 
someone mean. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave continues to do innovative and interesting television  
that for many people is their cup of tea,'' said Warren 
Littlefield, NBC's top entertainment executive when Carson retired. 
``I bet on Jay because I believed he ultimately would be embraced 
by a larger number of people and that he would be the partner who 
would never quit until he was on top. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very good about where I placed my bet.''  
</P>
<P>
	A close look at the numbers reveals that Letterman has lost most  
of his audience not to Leno, but to ``Seinfeld,'' ``Frasier'' and 
``Friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many independent stations that never used to compete  
aggressively late at night are now airing reruns of the popular 
sitcoms. In dozens of markets, Letterman is being whipped by these 
reruns, chief CBS researcher David Poltrack said. (Leno's ratings 
rose through 1997, but have fallen back to the level they were five 
years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
	Bashing CBS sounds like a combination of sour grapes and  
disloyalty, but Burnett believes the network handicaps Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past few years, CBS hasn't had a strong lineup of 10  
p.m. shows. That, combined with weak 11 p.m. local news in many 
markets, means fewer people are watching CBS leading up to 
Letterman's show, and more are watching NBC. The average CBS 
audience is also older, and less likely to appreciate Letterman's 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is like giving someone a 60-yard head start in a  
100-yard dash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnett chooses his words carefully when asked if Letterman's  
team regretted the move to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``We clearly don't fit in with CBS,'' he said. ``The audience  
that CBS is programming to is a completely different audience than 
we program to. I believe if Dave had gotten the `Tonight Show' on 
NBC, then we would have no competition in late night. I don't think 
Jay would have been able to survive at CBS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are positive signs, though. CBS is getting stronger at 10  
p.m. During the first three weeks of this fall's season, 
Letterman's ratings are up 7 percent over last year, and Leno's are 
down 6 percent. Appearances by Dan Quayle, Jesse Ventura and, in a 
memorable rerun, Farrah Fawcett, have proven Letterman can attract 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	For a man who often seemed bored early in his career when  
someone sat next to his desk, Letterman's interviewing skills have 
improved so markedly that it is now one of his strengths. 
</P>
<P>
	As he has aged, Letterman's interests have changed and the show  
has changed with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, Dave was this 35-year-old, wisecracking guy  
putting a Velcro suit on and jumping onto the wall,'' Burnett said. 
Now, at 52, ``he's this sort of elegant commentator on politics and 
all manners of silliness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman's Emmy-winning entry featured a frequent foil, Steve  
Martin, and their brilliant taped piece, ``Dave and Steve's Gay 
Vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also included a comedy sketch about Letterman's  
``retirement'' party as ``Late Show'' host, where Dave and fellow 
staff members share beers at a bar -- a premise made funny in itself 
by his distant, cranky persona. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman leaves the bar and walks away but his stagehand, Biff  
Henderson, catches up with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You realize if you quit you're giving up that enormous salary  
they pay you,'' Henderson explains. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, yeah. Letterman calls off the ``retirement.''  
</P>
<P>
	Burnett isn't quite sure when the real retirement party will  
take place. Letterman's ``Late Show'' contract stretches to August 
2002, but there are some points along the way where he has the 
option to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the way that Johnny (Carson) took it one year at a  
time, I can see Dave doing something similar,'' he said. ``I don't 
have a firm idea of how long Dave wants to do this. It wouldn't 
surprise me if he decided to keep going. It wouldn't surprise me if 
he thought he's had enough. I don't think he really knows.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Raise Money in Va. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton offered his political  
coattails Friday to Virginia's Democrats, who are hoping to defend 
themselves against outright Republican control of state government 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reminded about 700 people at the seventh annual Martin  
Luther King Jr.-Robert F. Kennedy dinner -- which raised $100,000 
for state Democratic candidates -- that both unemployment and crime 
have fallen to historic lows during his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The policies that the Democrats have followed have given us  
the longest peacetime (economic) expansion in history,'' Clinton 
said. ``All those little things they say about us are demolished by 
those statistics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also asked the party members to rally behind Sen.  
Charles Robb, D-Va., who Clinton said was trailing in early polls 
for his November 2000 re-election bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton blamed Robb's trouble, in part, on a vote to raise taxes  
in 1993 and approve of the administration's fiscal plan, and he 
noted, ``We Democrats have a difficult time in Virginia.'' Clinton, 
who easily won re-election in 1996, didn't carry the state. 
</P>
<P>
	This November's elections pose a tough test for Old Dominion's  
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they dominated state government for most of the  
century, Republicans now occupy the top jobs of governor, 
lieutenant governor and attorney general and lead the state Senate. 
The GOP needs to pick up only two seats to seize control of the 
state House. 
</P>
<P>
	Much is at stake: The dominant party after this election will  
decide how the state's legislative and congressional districts are 
drawn after the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire future of Virginia will be decided in these  
elections,'' Gov. Jim Gilmore said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Parachutist Dies in Protest Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A 60-year-old veteran  
parachutist plunged to her death when her chute failed to open 
while jumping off the top of 3,200-foot El Capitan on Friday to 
protest park rules banning the extreme sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Davis was one of five jumpers who planned to leap off the  
sheer granite cliff, a protest organized in response to the June 9 
death of a jumper who successfully parachuted off El Capitan only 
to drown in the river below while trying to flee park rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was the fourth jumper, the first three were beautiful. And  
then she jumped. Everybody thought it was OK, and then people said 
'Open up! Open up!' Then ... the whole place turned quiet,'' said 
Paul Sakuma, an Associated Press photographer. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was meant to demonstrate that the jumps can be made  
safely. 
</P>
<P>
	The first jumper took about four minutes to float down into  
Yosemite Valley in a brilliant blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis fell for more than 20 seconds before she hit amid a piles  
of rock at the base of El Capitan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers quickly cordoned off the area after the 2 p.m. accident,  
and the fifth parachutist hiked down, said Scott Gediman, a 
spokesman for the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a veteran with more than 70 jumps in the past 16 years,  
was using a borrowed parachute and gear that had a cord on the leg, 
unlike her usual gear where the cord was on her back, her husband, 
Tom Sanders, told friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``If only she had used her own gear; if she had only had her own  
gear,'' Sanders said repeatedly, according to friends. She used 
borrowed gear because she didn't want hers to be confiscated by 
rangers waiting to arrest her on the valley floor, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, of Santa Barbara, Calif., was the first woman to jump  
from Angel Falls in Venezuela, the highest waterfall in the world, 
and worked closely with her husband, who has done skydiving 
sequences for James Bond movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who was among the spectators, slumped onto his camera  
after she fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The extreme sport of jumping from fixed objects like cliffs or  
buildings is so dangerous that the National Park Service has banned 
such stunts. Nationwide, an estimated 21 people have died during 
so-called BASE jumps -- the acronym for buildings, antennae, spans 
and earth -- in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	BASE jumping was legal in the park for a trial period in 1980,  
but restrictions on when people could jump and the number of jumps 
per day were routinely violated, so the activity was banned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the sixth death since 1980 due to BASE jumping in the  
park, and we've had numerous injuries. It's a poor track record,'' 
Gediman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, rangers have arrested anyone they catch jumping off  
El Capitan and other cliffs, seized their equipment and put them in 
the local jail. The fine runs $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have tried to reach an accommodation after rangers  
who staked out a landing area tried to capture Frank Gambalie III 
in June. Gambalie, 28, tried to flee, and drowned in the 
runoff-swollen Merced River. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, Gambalie's mother joined about 150 people, including the  
five jumpers' families and friends, in what was supposed to be a 
carefully staged demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	The parachutists, accompanied by rangers at the top of the peak,  
agreed to land in a designated area, be arrested and forfeit their 
equipment, then pursue their opposition to the ban in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also did not bring a backup parachute because she would  
have had to turn it over to park rangers afterward, said Chris 
Conkright, an employee of Aerial Focus, the Santa-Barbara-based 
aerial cinematography company she and her husband ran.

<HEADLINE> White House Examining Philanthropy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The young and the rich of the high-tech realm  
may be better known for punching code late into the night and 
indulging in extreme sports on the weekend. But if participants at 
a White House conference on philanthropy have their way, Silicon 
Valley will become the home of the social entrepreneurs of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were hosts  
for the conference highlighting the tradition and possible future 
of philanthropy in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``The face of this tradition is changing,'' President Clinton  
said. ``Philanthropy is like our country now -- more diverse as new 
groups seize and share opportunity in the new economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in the first such conference spoke of a need to  
appeal more directly to baby boomers and Generation X. 
</P>
<P>
	Money isn't the only thing Internet mavens can provide.  
</P>
<P>
	America Online Inc. founder Steve Case highlighted a new  
philanthropic Internet portal, developed by the AOL Foundation, 
American Red Cross, the National Urban League and other groups, to 
offer an easy way to donate to over 620,000 charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can take all these tens of millions of people who are  
starting to change their lives because of the Internet and help 
them to change society because of the Internet as well,'' Case 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the talk turned again and again to the deep pockets of the  
cyberlords. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silicon Valley and the whole venture capital, high-tech  
community needs to be at the forefront of what we're doing because 
of the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks,'' Clinton quipped. 
``That's where the money is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Fong, a general partner in a venture capital fund in  
Ventura, Calif., helped establish a group, the Entrepreneurs' 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Fong said he and his associates aim to engage young people in  
Silicon Valley in their own communities. ``Many of these people 
aren't married yet, and all they know about is work,'' Fong said. 
</P>
<P>
	One example of a new approach to philanthropy, Fong said, is for  
a startup company to donate private stock to a local philanthropic 
fund. When a company goes public, the stock can generate millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's program was broadcast via satellite and on public  
television, reaching a potential audience of 10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Other participants included Patty Stonesifer, president of the  
$18 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, actor Paul Newman, 
and 'NSync singer Justin Timberlake, who was announcing creation of 
a foundation to support musical education in public schools. 
Sponsors include the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, the National 
Endowment for the Humanities, the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Iscol 
Family Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference also took stock of traditional philanthropic  
endeavors in the United States and assessed the importance of 
understanding how different ethnic communities approach the notion 
of supporting each other collectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmett Carson of the Minneapolis Fund urged mainstream  
philanthropic organizations to give up any ``noblesse oblige'' view 
of giving as ``narrow and one-dimensional.'' There are advantages 
to some other cultures' approaches such as giving anonymously or in 
communal enterprises, he said. ``Philanthropy should be a lifetime 
endeavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, noting that the baby boomers stand to inherit $12  
trillion as their parents' generation passes on, said just a slight 
increase in the 2 percent that Americans donate to charitable 
organizations each year could produce dramatic results for 
everything from homeless shelters to libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no better gift our generation can give to the future  
than a strengthened philanthropic tradition,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``New communities of donors must be encouraged to participate,''  
she said. ``New avenues of giving must be opened and explored.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Rocker Ready for Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In the winter of 1997, John Rocker was an obscure  
minor-leaguer sent away to harness his considerable skills in 
remote Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	He was still in the infant stage of his career as a reliever,  
but he finally felt comfortable with his place in life. No longer 
did he have to wait four days between starts. No longer did he have 
to conserve his energy for the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
	One night, Rocker was throwing in the bullpen when the call went  
out for a new pitcher in the eighth inning. His eyes quickly 
shifted to the man waiting at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Rodriguez.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was the first big-name hitter I had ever faced,'' Rocker  
recalled Friday, standing on the field after the Atlanta Braves 
worked out for Game 1 of the World Series against the New York 
Yankees. ``I had nothing to lose if he took me deep. I wanted to go 
out there with a no-holds-barred attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As if to drive that point home, he charged to the mound like a  
mad bull in search of a red cape. After striking out Rodriguez -- or 
so he says; the Texas catcher was unavailable to rebut the story -- 
the furious, 100-yard dash from the bullpen would be the trademark 
of a Rocker appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's a sign of immaturity,'' he said, certain to get no  
argument from New Yorkers. ``But I just have an intense will to 
win. I'm a perfectionist at whatever I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 25, nearing the end of his first season as the Braves'  
closer, Rocker has left an indelible impression on the postseason 
with a pattern of conduct totally out of character for his team. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Braves have been criticized for being too businesslike  
about their eight straight playoff appearances, Rocker picked a 
fight with Mets fans prior to the NL Championship Series by calling 
them ``stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he came on the field for Game 3 at Shea Stadium, he hardly  
ran away from the spotlight. Instead, Rocker walked slowly toward 
the outfield, soaking in the boos with an sarcastic smile and tip 
of the cap. He even stopped to sign autographs for a couple of kids 
wearing Mets jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Braves left New York, Rocker described Mets fans as  
``subhuman.'' After totaling his sports car in a wreck the day 
before Game 6 -- escaping without a scratch -- he pitched two 
scoreless innings in the 10-9 victory that sent the Braves to the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker says now that his seemingly rash actions were a  
well-conceived plan to motivate himself and rattle the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something where I just shot my mouth off,'' Rocker  
said. ``It was sort of a motivational tool. It worked out just like 
I thought it would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of his teammates simply shake their heads when discussing  
the 6-foot-4, 210-pound left-hander, who became the closer after 
Kerry Ligtenberg was injured, and wound up with 38 saves -- one away 
from the team record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been here a very long time and, yeah, there's things I've  
wanted to say, but I knew I didn't have the right to say them,'' 
John Smoltz said, squirming a bit against his locker. ``He seems to 
be thriving on that. The guys are just leaving him alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker is clearly in his element in the World Series, where  
every comment is scrutinized, every action is analyzed. Cheer him, 
boo him, it doesn't matter. Just make sure you notice him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd much rather pitch in front of a large crowd,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I pitch with intensity, emotion and aggressiveness,'' said  
Rocker, usually seen around the clubhouse in a T-short bearing the 
name of pro wrestler Bill Goldberg. ``At times this year, I didn't 
have enough emotion or adrenaline. Those were the games where I 
didn't pitch as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A football player in high school, he readily admits he would  
rather be playing with the NFL Falcons than the Braves. But he 
wasn't very fast and his strong left arm made him better suited for 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker's competitiveness is unquestioned. Some of his actions  
could also be interpreted as selfish, however. 
</P>
<P>
	He shot off at his teammates last month when Eddie Perez's  
throwing error after a strikeout cost the Braves a victory -- and 
Rocker a save. In the division series against Houston, Rocker 
escaped a bases-loaded, no-outs situation in the 10th inning of 
Game 3 -- then said afterward that he felt no pressure when he came 
in because the runners wouldn't go on his pitching line. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rocker has been a dominating presence in the postseason,  
carrying the Braves to the World Series for the first time since 
1996. He has one win and three saves, allowing only three hits and 
no earned runs in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Braves point of view, he can keep on talking.  
</P>
<P>
	``Have you seen how big he is?'' Chipper Jones quipped. ``Who's  
going to say anything to him? Not me. He'd pound me in the ground. 
There would probably be a problem if he said things and then didn't 
perform on the field. But he's backing it up. If it's not broke, 
don't fix it.''

<HEADLINE> Meat Diet Fattens Prices at Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The high-protein diet craze that has people  
pigging out on steak, chops and even bacon may be plumping up meat 
prices on the wholesale market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confirmed pasta eaters are now red meat eaters,'' says Chicago  
analyst Bill Plummer, who is among the industry watchers contending 
that the phenomenon is boosting prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-protein weight-loss diet has been promoted in such best  
sellers as ``Protein Power'' and ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet 
Revolution.'' It's a meat lover's dream because it recommends lots 
of protein instead of carbohydrates. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, prices are rising for meat and livestock  
futures, which are speculative contracts for cattle, hogs and pork 
bellies. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for beef is expected to increase 1.6 percent over last  
year, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said Friday. Demand 
for pork is up 2.3 percent this year, according to the National 
Pork Producers Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are in  
the healthy 70-cent-a-pound range. And fresh pork bellies -- bacon 
to you and me -- have flirted with the 80-cent-a-pound mark, 
surpassing even the traditionally pricier untrimmed pork loins, 
though at least some of the rise is attributed to the flooding in 
North Carolina that wiped out about 30,000 hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Vaught, a livestock analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St.  
Louis, say the high-protein fad is playing a role in bolstering hog 
prices, which traditionally drop when people put their grills away 
as summer and BLT season end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly don't think it's hurting,'' says Alisa Harrison, a  
spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. But she 
also points to healthy disposable incomes and an improving economy 
in Southeast Asia, especially in meat-hungry South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas Hockman of the National Pork Producers Council says he is  
more inclined to attribute the increased pork demand to ``chicken 
fatigue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Greenberg, a 28-year-old administrative assistant from  
Highland Park, Ill., says she has lost 18 pounds since mid-June on 
the high-protein diet. She buys big, juicy slabs of meat and fish 
and figures she easily spends an extra $20 a week on groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the good stuff, the filet mignon and the Angus beef,''  
she says. ``If I'm going to do this, I'm going to have the good 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Michael Swinford of Rosenthal-Collins Inc. in Chicago  
thinks the fad will be short-lived, especially since the American 
Dietetic Association recently called high-protein diets ``a 
nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, the diet seems to be spreading, even to Wyoming,  
where third-generation cattleman Tom Herbst lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``My neighbor's doing it,'' says Herbst, who lives near  
Torrington, Wyo. ``I think it's a good deal for us.''

<HEADLINE> Florida St. Rules on Warrick Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick can play for Florida  
State only after serving any jail time that is part of his plea 
agreement, the university president said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The star receiver and his lawyer met with Florida State  
president Sandy D'Alemberte on Thursday night. Warrick, a leading 
Heisman Trophy contender, is not expected to play Saturday against 
Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the jail or prison time behind someone before they  
play,'' D'Alemberte said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating for everybody,'' said Warrick lawyer John  
Kenny, who must work out another deal with the state attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, a former teammate and a store clerk were charged with  
felony grand theft when the two players purchased more than $400 
worth of designer clothes Sept. 29 at a mall for $21.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick's lawyer this week reached an agreement to reduce the  
charge to a misdemeanor with the state attorney, but would have 
required the player to spend 30 days in jail at the end of the 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a fan, do I want him back? Absolutely yes,'' D'Alemberte  
said. ``But as a university president, I want him back after he's 
finished any problems with the criminal justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick has missed two games for the top-ranked Seminoles. On  
Saturday, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden goes for his 300th 
career victory. He will be facing son Tommy Bowden, the Clemson 
coach, in the first father-son matchup in Division I-A history. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick practiced Tuesday and Wednesday all week and can  
continue to do so. But when he rejoins the team for games is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I enter a plea that is acceptable to the court and is  
acceptable to the state attorney's office, but won't help him get 
back on the field, it's not going to make Peter Warrick very 
happy,'' Kenny said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Dillard's clerk, Rachel Myrtil, pleaded no contest  
Thursday to grand theft and was sentenced to two years' probation, 
10 days on a county work program, ordered to pay $308 in court 
costs and stay out of Dillard's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Laveranues Coles, who paid for the clothes, was kicked off the  
Florida State team.

<HEADLINE> Court To Hear Unabomber Plea Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed Friday to  
hear Theodore Kaczynski's request to withdraw his guilty plea for 
the Unabomber killings, go to trial and face a possible death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski, a Harvard-trained mathematician who became a forest  
recluse, pleaded guilty in 1998 to mail bombings that killed three 
people and injured 23. Kaczynski's statements have connected the 
attacks to his campaign against technological tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed Friday to consider  
whether Kaczynski's guilty plea was voluntary; whether he was 
properly denied the right to represent himself; and whether a 
defendant, in a death penalty trial, has a right to prevent his 
court-appointed lawyer from presenting evidence of mental 
impairment as a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department had agreed to the guilty plea and life  
sentence after a psychiatric examination concluded Kaczynski was a 
paranoid schizophrenic but competent to stand trial. The exam had 
been arranged by Kaczynski's lawyers over his objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski had wanted to present a defense based on his views  
about technology and the environment. But his attempts to represent 
himself or bring in a lawyer who would argue his chosen defense 
were rejected by U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell of Sacramento, 
who said the requests were made too late and would delay the case 
unduly. 
</P>
<P>
	Burrell later refused to let Kaczynski set his guilty plea aside  
and found that his arguments, filed from his prison cell in 
Colorado, were not serious enough to justify an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Lapham declined to discuss the  
order or the government position in the case. Before the guilty 
plea, prosecutors argued that Kaczynski should be allowed to 
control his defense, even at the risk of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mello, a Vermont Law School professor who helped  
Kaczynski with his legal filing, said the appeals court order 
``took an enormous amount of courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of power: Who has the legitimate power to make  
the most important, fundamental decisions about the defense? Is it 
the guy whose life is on the line or is it the guy's 
well-intentioned, paternalistic lawyer?'' Mello said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Courts Vermont Others Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARREN, Vt. (AP) -- As most of his competitors for the Republican  
presidential nomination showed themselves off during a nationally 
televised debate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush was dozens of miles 
away raising campaign cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the GOP front-runner, said he had agreed to attend the  
Vermont fund-raisers before Friday night's debate in New Hampshire 
was scheduled. ``I'm a man who keeps my word,'' he told reporters 
during an earlier appearance in Durham, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was skipping another debate next week because it falls  
on the same evening that his wife Laura is scheduled to receive an 
award from her alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is my priority, and if it costs me votes for  
honoring my wife, so be it,'' Bush said, explaining his decision to 
miss the Oct. 28 event in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to participate in debates with other GOP candidates  
before the start of the primary and caucus season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush attended two fund-raisers in Vermont on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The first was a $1,000-per-person private reception at a  
Waitsfield country inn that drew about 100 people. The event was 
expected to add $100,000 to the coffers of a campaign that already 
has raised a record $57 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He also addressed the Vermont Republican Party's annual fall  
dinner, attended by about 1,000 of the party faithful paying $125 
apiece to hear him speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush called on them to help him ``rally armies of compassion.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running so our conservative minds can match our  
compassionate hearts,'' he said, in a variation on his campaign 
theme of ``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also spoke of the need to preserve Social Security while  
allowing beneficiaries to establish personal savings accounts 
within the system, the need for a strong military, to give families 
the right to choose the schools their children attend and to cut 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Vermont, he told reporters he opposes gay marriage,  
no matter what the Vermont Supreme Court rules on a pending case 
seeking to legalize it. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion is we should not have same-gender marriage,'' Bush  
said after landing at the airport in South Burlington. ``I believe 
marriage is between a man and a woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he opposed the effort by New England states to win  
congressional reauthorization of a compact that provides farmers in 
the region with higher prices for milk. He said he preferred a 
``national dairy plan'' because ``that leads to competing compacts, 
states competing with each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also urged President Clinton to sign a bill the Senate  
passed this week to outlaw certain late-term abortions.

<HEADLINE> Water Law Alarms W. Va. Coal Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- West Virginia's coal mining industry  
warned that it is headed for ruin and the governor ordered a state 
hiring and spending freeze Friday after a federal judge barred the 
dumping of strip mine waste in streams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impact of this ruling will be devastating to state and  
local budgets,'' Gov. Cecil Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a victory for environmentalists who sued the coal industry  
last year, U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II ruled Wednesday 
that dumping mining waste in West Virginia's streams fouls the 
water in violation of the federal Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The law bans mining operations within 100 feet of a stream.  
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could all but shut down mountaintop removal mining, a  
strip mining technique used increasingly in Appalachia. The top of 
a ridge is sheared off, the coal is extracted, and the leftover 
rock and dirt are pushed into a nearby river valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal industry leaders warned that the ruling could also cripple  
traditional underground mining, which also disposes of waste in 
river valleys. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave us a death sentence, is what they've done,'' said  
Ernest Woods, president of United Mine Workers Local 5958. ``We're 
dinosaurs now. And they'll be going after the deep mines next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia is the No. 2 coal-producing state, behind Wyoming.  
The coal industry accounts for 3 percent of all jobs in West 
Virginia, down from 9.5 percent in 1979. The nearly 19,000 jobs 
tied to the industry provided more than $950 million in wages in 
1998, with workers averaging $50,800 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had 392 underground mines and 227 strip mines last  
year, with strip mining accounting for less than one-third of West 
Virginia's total production of 181 million tons of coal. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators said they do not yet know exactly how many  
mines are affected by the ruling. But the state Tax Department said 
it could cost West Virginia as much as $100 million this fiscal 
year, out of an annual budget of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the governor told state agencies to prepare for a  
10 percent budget cut in January, and put a freeze on hiring and 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The director of the U.S. Office of Surface Mining, Kathy Karpan,  
said the ruling could also affect mining operations nationwide. 
``It could virtually stop all coal mining -- not just strip mining 
but underground mining as well,'' Ms. Karpan said. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia's congressional delegation has asked federal  
regulatory agencies to join in an appeal of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountaintop-removal strip mining is growing in West Virginia, in  
part because that is where the untouched deposits lie and because 
coal companies that practice such mining are often freed from the 
requirement that they restore the land to its approximate original 
contour. 
</P>
<P>
	They simply fill in the nearby stream, leaving terrain that is  
flat or gently rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was upset with the ruling. Cindy Rank, a  
spokeswoman for the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, one of the 
environmental groups that sued, was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always believed that the law was meant to protect all  
our resources, including streams and people, much more than has 
been done in the past 10 years,'' Ms. Rank said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Welcomes House Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Picking up his third endorsement from a House  
Democrat, presidential candidate Bill Bradley said elected 
officials shouldn't feel duty-bound to support Al Gore just because 
he is the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can be for Bradley and not vaporize,'' the former New  
Jersey senator said Friday after Rep. Diana DeGette, announced she 
was supporting him. ``I think there will be others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeGette, elected in 1996 to replace Pat Schroeder in a  
Denver-based district, said she liked Bradley's positions on health 
care for the uninsured, gun control and helping average people 
balance jobs and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``These challenges require big ideas and big solutions,''  
DeGette said. ``Senator Bradley is the candidate who offers the 
solutions to unite this country and forcefully address these 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, Bradley told a closed-door meeting of about 20  
liberal members of the House Progressive Caucus that he thought 
personal attacks in the campaign were ineffective and would hurt 
the Democratic Party, participants said afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he believed his poll numbers rose in Iowa this  
month after he declined to fight back when Gore accused him of 
quitting Congress when Democrats needed him most. 
</P>
<P>
	``His numbers rose and he said that there was nothing else to  
explain it,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who also has 
endorsed Bradley. ``He said fighting back's not necessary. He 
didn't think it would be useful for the party to have a 
bloodletting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore met the Progressive Caucus earlier this week. Both  
candidates are chasing endorsements from the Democratic nominating 
convention ``superdelegates,'' who are generally elected or party 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates discussed issues such as trade, the environment,  
labor and campaign finance reform, lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we wanted to do is have our issues, issues that affect  
working people and middle-class people, injected into the 
campaign,'' said Rep. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said a sharp contrast between the  
two was that Gore criticized Bradley by name over several issues, 
including his Senate voting record. Bradley, on the other hand, 
never mentioned the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of an odd reversal,'' DeFazio said. ``It's usually  
the challenger who goes after the incumbent. Gore acted much more 
like the underdog. Maybe he knows he's got a real race on his 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeGette, Nadler and Rep. William Lipinski, D-Ill., are the House  
members publicly supporting Bradley so far. Sens. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan of New York, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of 
Minnesota also have endorsed him.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Sign Hansen As Punter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the mystery surrounding Matt Turk's broken  
finger deepened Friday, the Washington Redskins signed 39-year-old 
Brian Hansen to punt in Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen has played with New Orleans, New England, Cleveland and  
the New York Jets over a 14-year NFL career. He averaged 39.8 yards 
over seven games last season before the Jets released him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best guy we worked out,'' said coach Norv Turner, who  
auditioned six punters and wanted someone with good directional 
ability to minimize the threat from Cowboys return man Deion 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, no one wanted to say much about a report in The  
Washington Post that cast suspicion on Turk's injury. The report, 
which appeared beside a lengthy interview with owner Dan Snyder, 
cited unidentified sources who claimed the Redskins suspect that 
Turk broke his finger playing basketball Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That would appear to contradict the account of Turk's brother,  
long snapper Dan Turk, who said he saw Matt's injured left middle 
finger on the plane as the team returned from Sunday's game at 
Arizona. Both brothers thought it was only sprained, and Matt Turk 
did not report the injury until Tuesday. He had surgery Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post report said that Turk could be fined for not  
playing against the Cowboys if it is confirmed that the injury 
resulted from basketball and not football. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Turk has not commented on his injury. Dan Turk stood by his  
story Friday when asked by a reporter. Neither Turner nor general 
manager Vinny Cerrato would discuss the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no comment on all that,'' Cerrato said.  
</P>
<P>
	Turner left open the possibility that Hansen could remain with  
the team for more than one game. Meanwhile, quarterback Brad 
Johnson will assume Matt Turk's holding duties on field goals and 
extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Hansen on the roster, the Redskins released  
guard Rod Milstead.

<HEADLINE> Berger Slams 'Isolationist Right' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The United States will not have the authority to  
remain the world's leader if isolationists continue to control 
Congress, national security adviser Sandy Berger told a foreign 
policy group in a scathing criticism of Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Following two major foreign policy defeats in Congress for the  
Clinton administration, Berger called for a national debate on 
foreign policy and said the administration would fight 
``isolationist right'' lawmakers during President Clinton's last 15 
months in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new isolationism of 1999 fails to understand precisely  
what the old isolationism of 60 years ago failed to understand -- 
that local conflicts can have global consequences,'' he said. ``In 
effect, they believe in a survivalist foreign policy -- build a 
fortified fence around America and retreat behind it. And if other 
nations complain ... let them, because we are stronger and richer 
than they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas dismissed the speech  
as ``random name-calling by a frustrated administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey, in a statement, said ``today's world of peace and  
prosperity was built on the Republican policies of free trade, a 
strong military, a larger NATO and support for Democratic allies 
like Taiwan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush were not  
isolationists ``and neither are we,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Thursday to the Council on Foreign Relations, a private  
group that usually supports an activist U.S. foreign policy, 
Berger's comments also appeared to be an effort to make foreign 
policy a larger campaign issue in 2000. He attacked conservative 
Republicans who blocked a ban on nuclear weapons testing and are 
cutting back overseas programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, a foe of the test ban treaty, said the notion  
of lost U.S. leadership was ``absurd,'' adding that the treaty's 
defeat actually would help restore American stature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will improve our international respect and leadership,  
because we said we are not going to unilaterally disarm anymore,'' 
Inhofe, R-Okla., said in Washington. ``We are going to gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president is now giving priority to peacemaking in the  
Middle East and in Northern Ireland and to working with Russia on 
missile defenses while also supporting democracy and capitalism 
there, Berger said, adding that the $12.6 billion foreign aid bill 
that Clinton vetoed on Monday could have hampered U.S. efforts to 
promote peace and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress cut $2 billion from Clinton's proposed budget for  
foreign aid while adding $5 billion to the Pentagon's budget, a 
move that Berger denounced, saying, ``if we underfund our 
diplomacy, we will end up overusing our military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said most Americans ``understand that we are fortunate to  
be in a position of leadership, and that to maintain it we must 
continue to lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional isolationists, he said, were consumed with an  
impulse ``to withdraw from the world in a way that would squander 
our advantages, alienate our friends, diminish our credibility, 
betray our values and discredit our example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Describing congressional conservatives as ``nostalgic for the  
good old days'' when the Soviet Union was a distinct adversary, 
Berger said some have designated China, with its growing economy 
and nuclear program, as the new ``great adversary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said China is a country that has lifted tens of millions  
of its people from poverty and expanded personal freedoms. But it 
also is resisting political reform that is needed for long-term 
growth and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our interest lies in protecting our security while encouraging  
China to make the right choices,'' Berger said. ``We can only do 
that if we continue a policy of principled, purposeful engagement 
with its leaders and people.''

<HEADLINE> Research: Psychotherapy Predictable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- Researchers say they have developed the  
first successful way to predict how long a psychotherapy patient 
will need to recover, a key step in designing proper and successful 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Kopta, the University of Evansville psychology professor  
who led the research, said the predictions can be made with 75 
percent accuracy, depending on a patient's level of mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	The model allows therapists to decide which treatment to try but  
``one that you're more sure will work,'' he said Thursday. ``This 
ultimately can save resources because it can apply psychotherapy to 
people that are most likely to benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The research is published in the October issue of the Journal of  
Consulting and Clinical Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which started collecting data in 1995, studied 870  
psychotherapy patients in the United States. About 80 percent were 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	By tracking the patients through their psychotherapy sessions,  
researchers developed a model for predicting courses of recovery 
for individual patients. The model also calculates the likelihood 
that the predictions will be correct. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some, we were 25 percent accurate. For others, almost 100  
percent,'' Kopta said. ``It would vary depending on the type of 
patient, the predictability of the estimate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is more difficult to accurately predict the recovery time for  
an individual who is deeply depressed or extremely anxious than for 
someone who is more optimistic about their chances, Kopta said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value is, we're getting closer to be able to tailor a  
person's treatment needs before they begin therapy,'' he said. 
``Before, when a patient came in for therapy, often money was 
wasted in trial-and-error approaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By using the model, a psychologist might, for example, decide  
that a patient would benefit more by using medication than by 
undergoing weeks or months of psychotherapy. That can save money 
for patients and their health-insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Madhukar Trivedi, an associate professor of psychiatry at the  
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said 
everyone in the field of psychotherapy is interested in this area 
of study. 
</P>
<P>
	If the researchers' findings were accurate, he said, ``that is  
exciting. Nobody's done that yet and that really could give us very 
strong ideas.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Gains Independents' Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Independent, or undeclared, voters can be  
key in New Hampshire's presidential primary, and Republican John 
McCain said Friday that he's gathering some key support from them. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain announced he's been endorsed by nearly 200 independents,  
which he said shows his campaign appeals to a wide range of people. 
</P>

	Independents can vote in New Hampshire's presidential primary by

<HEADLINE> President Signs $8.7B Farm Bailout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today signed into a law a  
record $8.7 billion package of emergency assistance to compensate 
farmers for depressed commodity prices and weather-related crop 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is contained in a $69 billion bill that will fund  
operations of the Agriculture Department and related agencies for 
the 2000 budget year. 
</P>
<P>
	The first assistance checks will be going to farmers in two to  
three weeks, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton agreed to sign the legislation despite his  
administration's reservations that some of the aid will be going to 
large farms and landowners who don't need the money, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of moderate-size farmers who need these  
payments to survive, there's no question about that,'' Glickman 
said, speaking to reporters after a brief signing ceremony at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to develop an alternative way to distribute future  
aid that would target the money to ``family-size'' operations, 
Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money in the measure, about $6 billion, is intended  
to help grain, cotton and soybean farmers cope with a second year 
of low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also provides $1.4 billion for weather-related crop  
and livestock losses, including $200 million earmarked for Eastern 
livestock producers who were hurt by this summer's drought; $400 
million in crop-insurance discounts; $328 million to compensate 
tobacco producers for falling cigarette sales; and $125 million in 
subsidies for dairy producers.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Buchanan To Skip GOP Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Five Republican presidential candidates  
gathered Friday for their first debate and some needling of the 
front-runner who stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush opted weeks ago to skip the New  
Hampshire forum, as his $57 million campaign kitty and sizable lead 
in public opinion polls provided no real incentive for a 
face-to-face encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch, Alan Keyes and John  
McCain agreed to participate in the Friday night forum, sponsored 
by New Hampshire Public Television, The Union Leader of Manchester 
and New England Cable News. C-Span planned to broadcast the session 
live. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be an appetizer for people,'' Forbes  
said. ``They're going to want more real debates, not just an hour 
session. They're going to want all the candidates involved and so I 
think it's going to put pressure on Gov. Bush to be more 
participatory in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said earlier that Bush's no-show could make it harder for  
the governor ``to convince the voters of New Hampshire that he's 
got a governing vision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who had campaign stops in New Hampshire on Friday, said he  
had committed to a fund-raiser for Vermont Republicans at the same 
time of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	He also declined to participate in a debate next Wednesday  
because it conflicted with a ceremony honoring his wife, Laura, at 
her alma mater, Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign said it told the debate organizers before  
invitations were mailed to the candidates that the governor would 
not be able to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's debate came one day after the latest New Hampshire poll  
found Bush with a commanding lead but McCain strengthening his 
position in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone survey of 600 likely Republican voters, Bush had  
the support of 42 percent, about what he had in August. McCain had 
26 percent -- 10 points better than in August -- with most of his 
gains coming at the expense of other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting also came two days after Elizabeth Dole, the lone  
woman seeking the GOP nomination, quit the race citing difficulty 
raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Bush, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan also skipped  
the debate. He is expected to announce Monday that he is leaving 
the Republican Party to seek the nomination of the Reform Party.

<HEADLINE> Justice Served for American Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEART BUTTE, Mont. (AP) -- Josephine Spotted Bear Wildgun knows  
nothing of courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	She is 75 years old with a sixth-grade education. When a  
stranger strikes up a conversation, she giggles, flashing a 
gap-toothed grin, and burrows her chin in her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	She lives a simple life in a peaceful place far from Washington,  
D.C., and the legal battle between American Indians and the federal 
government over mismanagement of Indian trust accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	But what she does know is that she is a landowner and has little  
to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody else is getting rich on it,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge this month ordered a mediator to help negotiate  
the settling of 300,000 trust accounts worth more than $500 
million. The decision came in a 1996 class-action lawsuit against 
the Interior Department and its Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, the largest class-action ever brought by Indians,  
made headlines after the judge this year held Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt and then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt 
for ``egregious misconduct'' in failing to hand over documents to 
the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath all the courtroom rhetoric lies a tragic tale of  
history, deceit and survival. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the story of people like Josephine Spotted Bear Wildgun,  
and places like Heart Butte. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On the southern edge of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in  
northern Montana, a mountain shaped like a heart rises above golden 
plains where cattle and horses graze. It is the anchor of a 
community called Heart Butte. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many other Indian communities across the United States,  
Heart Butte doesn't have much. There are three churches, the 
Baptist, Methodist and Roman Catholic, a school, a senior citizens 
center, the health department, a post office and a volunteer fire 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	Its only grocery store and gas station closed years ago. Now the  
closest are a 30-minute drive across the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The only recent development, besides a new sanctuary for the  
Catholic church, is the row of federally subsidized houses that 
greets visitors on their way into town. They frame the road like a 
string of paper dolls, each the same bland image of the one before. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare is the primary source of income for the 800 or so people  
who live here. 
</P>
<P>
	A block off the main road, around the corner from the subsidized  
housing, Josephine lives with her daughter-in-law and grandchild in 
a three-bedroom plywood house the color of dirt. Her son visits 
when he's not out of town looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Josephine lives on $374 a month in Supplemental Security Income  
and whatever money her son can send home. When her husband died 
five years ago, she had to borrow $500 to pay for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get money,'' she explains, ``I've got my phone, my  
lights and gas. Those three I pay for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other things, even groceries, are harder to afford.  
</P>
<P>
	It's difficult to conceive that this woman who struggles to buy  
food owns an interest in 8,718 acres of land, some leased for 
grazing, most for oil and gas exploration. A computer printout of 
all her holdings unfurls to almost 6 feet in length, taller than 
Josephine herself. 
</P>
<P>
	For this she also receives income. The checks arrive  
sporadically, every four to six months. Every once in a while 
they're as high as $200 or $300. More often they're for much less: 
$36.75 in September 1998; another, in July 1998, for all of $2.82. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there's a lot of money she should be getting,'' her  
daughter-in-law, Diana, says as she tickles her baby girl on the 
floor of the cramped living room. ``I think they're cheating her 
really big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They'' are the Interior Department and the Bureau of Indian  
Affairs, which for more than 100 years have managed Indian trust 
accounts consisting of lease revenue, court settlements and 
royalties from the sale of petroleum, timber and other resources 
off 11 million acres of land. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the 300,000 individual Indian accounts that are  
part of the lawsuit, the government oversees 1,500 accounts worth 
more than $2.5 billion for 338 tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust accounts date back to 1887, when Congress carved up  
Indian reservations and distributed the land to tribal members in 
160-, 80- or 40-acre parcels. Leftover land was declared surplus 
and sold to non-Indians, resulting in the eventual loss of 90 
million acres. 
</P>
<P>
	The intent of the allotment law, known as the Dawes Act, was to  
assimilate Indians into white society by dissolving tribalism and 
forcing them to become independent farmers, while at the same time 
opening up large tracts of reservation land to white farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the heart of it was the idea ... that once the Indians  
became citizens and no longer dependent on the government, then the 
so-called 'Indian problem' would disappear,'' says L.G. Moses, 
professor of American Indian history at Oklahoma State University. 
``The only real result you got out of the Dawes Act was the loss of 
land accompanied by an assault on Indian cultural values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1900s, the Dawes Act had proved a failure. Indian  
land sat idle, while their white neighbors longed to use the 
acreage. By 1910 the government began leasing Indian property to 
white farmers for grazing. Oil exploration began soon after, and so 
did the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no accounts receivable system to determine whether  
Indians were being paid, and when Indian landowners died, there 
generally were no wills. That meant the land was divided among 
hundreds or thousands of heirs, creating a record-keeping 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	Some land was held in probate for years; some heirs were simply  
never found. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of a lack of oversight, many Indians suspect oil  
companies and others have underreported what they've taken from the 
land and gotten away with it for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any Indian community it's just been something that we grew  
up with, our parents questioning and wondering why they were not 
getting paid,'' says Elouise Cobell, a Blackfeet member and the 
lead plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems gained little notice until the 1980s, when people  
like Ms. Cobell began complaining to Congress and numerous audits 
documented the severity of the problem: Records had been lost or 
ruined; auditors couldn't locate 50,000 account holders whose 
trusts totaled almost $50 million. One account with no name was 
worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has long admitted the trust funds are in  
disarray, and recently installed a $60 million computer system to 
manage the accounts better. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying in court in July, Babbitt said the program was  
``heading toward a safe harbor of compliance'' and vowed to have a 
better accounting system in place when he leaves office in January 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians want a complete overhaul of the system and contend the  
government owes account holders at least $10 billion misplaced 
because of poor record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we hear all the time is, `Oh, most of these accounts only  
have $25 or 'x' amount,''' Ms. Cobell says. ``What does $25 mean to 
a family? Maybe she's able to cook a meal and share that with her 
family for once. That $25 stretches out to be much more than 25 
bucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like I have an inheritance that I didn't even know  
about,'' says the Rev. Dan Powers of St. Anne's Catholic Church in 
Heart Butte, who speculates almost every resident in his community 
owns an interest in the 1.5 million-acre reservation. Many of his 
church members receive trust money but remain in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the people get lease money twice a year,'' he says.  
``Family members sit around waiting to be fed by that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates there are 7,700 Blackfeet  
with trust accounts, although Ms. Cobell says the number is closer 
to all the 14,700 enrolled tribal members, of whom about two-thirds 
live on the reservation, amid a 70 percent unemployment rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, where the average monthly income for a family of four is  
just $600, restitution could provide a fresh start for many, 
Blackfeet leaders say. It could also mean attaining what the 
government tried to manufacture so long ago: economic independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could start buying our land back ... work the land  
ourselves,'' says Blackfeet Treasurer Joe Gervais. ``If we do it 
ourselves, we prove that we can succeed. We take control of our own 
destiny.''

<HEADLINE> Florida St.-Clemson Game Anticipated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- The motor homes are three deep. The tickets  
are all gone. About the only one who's apparently not going to the 
Florida State-Clemson game is Seminoles star Peter Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was supposed to be polishing his Heisman Trophy  
acceptance speech for No. 1 Florida State (7-0, 5-0) in time for 
coach Bobby Bowden's 300th victory. 
</P>
<P>
	But a plea agreement to get him back on the field was postponed  
in connection with a department store scam that would reduce a 
felony grand theft charge to a misdemeanor. Warrick's lawyer, John 
Kenney, was hoping to get Warrick back this week, but the agreement 
has not been satisfactory to Florida State University President 
Sandy D'Alemberte. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I enter a plea that is acceptable to the court and is  
acceptable to the state attorney's office, but won't help him get 
back on the field, it's not going to make Peter Warrick very 
happy,'' lawyer John Kenny said Thursday. ``So I've got to try to 
work between the state attorney's office and the university. And 
right now, I don't have that set in concrete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About everything else for the historic game is, however. Clemson  
coach Tommy Bowden said an unheard number of fans, 87,000, are 
expected to fill Death Valley to see big-time college football's 
first father-son match. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said there might be as many as 15,000 fans who can't get  
in who'll just listen outside the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be careful, Tommy and I both, that it does not  
become too much of a distraction,'' Bobby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Campers steadily pulled in behind the Tigers practice field all  
afternoon. Fans were sitting in lawn chairs and dressed in football 
sweat shirts 60 hours before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Knight of St. George Island, Fla., has traveled with the  
Seminoles for more than 35 years and said he and his wife, 
Lorraine, weren't going to miss this one. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Ringle and his wife, JoAnn, of Oxford, Conn., parked next  
to the Knights. ``There are just so many family ties in this one, 
it's hard to keep track,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The town is buzzing, too. Former soccer coach I.M. Ibrahim said  
he sold more than 500 ``Bowden Bowl'' T-shirts from his two stores 
and expected the remaining stock to be gone by today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some dismal years,'' Ibrahim said. ``But coach Bowden's  
arrival has made Clemson paraphernalia a very hot item.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson sports information director Tim Bourret said 535  
reporters, photographers and others have credentials for the game. 
Normal requests are about 200. State troopers will start traffic 
management at 9 a.m., 10 hours before kickoff, and will designate 
some two-way streets as one ways for the possible record crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby and Tommy shared ESPN appearances and radio shows  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Tommy to get out of town,'' Bobby said when the two were  
linked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to know who said Dad could horn in on my show. He  
recruits my state, he steals my players, I want him out now,'' 
Tommy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``See you Friday, Dad,'' Tommy said, signing off.  
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Bowden said his players are feeling as loose as he is.  
He's not worried about Warrick's status, since ``they just replace 
one Parade All-American with another Parade All-American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His Tigers are big underdogs, so why should they worry, Bowden  
says. ``The problem is going to be our X's tackling their O's,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke said he and his teammates  
have done a good job pushing away the overwhelming hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't talk about the 300th victory, we don't talk about  
anything except the fact that we need to win this football game and 
we need to find a way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson defensive coordinator Reggie Herring said he's tried to  
prepare for this like any other game, ``but obviously, who are you 
kidding?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And don't believe Tommy when he says he's just going to enjoy  
his father's potential 300-win milestone, said Herring, Clemson's 
defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be jumping out of his skin. He'll be foaming at the  
mouth,'' Herring said. ``I've coached six games with him on the 
sidelines and I think that's wishful thinking on his part.''

<HEADLINE> Reviewing Turow's Latest Novel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The scene was a federal courtroom in downtown  
Chicago. The defendant was a Cook County judge snared on corruption 
charges during an undercover investigation dubbed Operation 
Greylord. One of the prosecutors was an aspiring novelist named 
Scott Turow. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen years later, Turow is now a successful defense  
attorney, albeit a part-time one. He spends most of his time these 
days writing best-selling novels. 
</P>
<P>
	Turow's latest suspense thriller, ``Personal Injuries,'' is a  
tale of judges for sale, lawyers who buy courtroom victories and a 
womanizing lawyer, Robbie Feaver, who agrees to work undercover, 
wire and all, to catch the crooks and to keep himself out of 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a fictionalized Greylord, a real-life investigation that  
led to the convictions of 15 judges, 49 lawyers and dozens of court 
personnel in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, many things have changed. Cook County is now  
fictional Kindle County, familiar turf to Turow fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The characters are made up, too. And, as Turow himself has  
pointed out, ``Greylord had no Robbie Feaver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my unhappy Greylord responsibilities was trying to run  
a corrupt lawyer that we hoped to use as an insider,'' Turow 
recalled during a recent interview in his law office on the 77th 
floor of the Sears Tower. ``Greylord was a great success, but its 
success would have been even greater had we been able to turn a 
lawyer who was inside and put him out there'' with a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Turow's characters sometimes reflect real people.  
</P>
<P>
	He sees himself, for example, in Stan Sennett, the U.S. attorney  
heading the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the book, Sennett recalls how his Uncle Petros was  
swindled in a land deal years earlier. When a young Stan asked him 
why he didn't sue, Petros said, ``A poor man like me? I can't 
afford to buy a judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turow says that incident was lifted from a conversation he had  
as a youngster with his own beloved grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	``It filled me with a sense of moral purpose,'' he said. And, as  
an assistant U.S. attorney, it prompted him to ask to be a part of 
any investigation of judicial corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, Greylord already had secretly begun. But Turow got a  
belated role in it and in 1986 helped convict Circuit Judge 
Reginald J. Holzer on charges of racketeering, extortion and mail 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The main character in Turow's novel, though, is not Sennett. It  
is Feaver, the personal-injury lawyer and lovable bad boy who goes 
undercover. Feaver drives a Mercedes and dresses in Armani. He 
flirts easily but loves patiently. He lives up to the image of an 
ambulance-chasing lawyer, and, as Turow writes, is ``your basic 
Kindle County hustler, complete with South End accent and too much 
cologne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as Turow pointed out in his office overlooking the city  
where the Greylord bribes once exchanged hands, Feaver does have a 
few good qualities. Not the least of which is that, despite his 
womanizing, he lovingly cares for his wife, who at 38 is dying of 
Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, Turow left the U.S. attorney's office to finish  
``Presumed Innocent,'' his first published novel. It was a hit and 
later was made into a movie starring Harrison Ford. ``Personal 
Injuries,'' which quickly went to best-seller lists, is his sixth 
book, all novels except for the first -- ``One L.'' Published in 
1977, it is about Turow's experiences as a first-year student at 
Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Turow's four previous novels have sold just over 3 million in  
hardback copies. And according to Warner Books, which has published 
his novels in paperback, a total of 15.8 million paperback copies 
of Turow's first four novels are in print 
</P>
<P>
	Now 50, Turow devotes about a quarter of his work time to his  
law practice; the rest goes to his writing. Married and the father 
of three, the small man with thinning hair speaks deliberately, 
thoughtfully measuring his words. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, there were dangers for the Greylord prosecutors, but, he  
says, ``I knew they would come for a lot of other people before 
they came to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turow's life has gone almost full circle. He was interested in  
writing as far back as high school when he worked on his student 
newspaper. In 1970, he received a fellowship to the Stanford 
University Creative Writer Center. He later taught creative writing 
at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was headed for life as an English professor,'' he says, but  
it wasn't a career he wanted. ``So, I started looking around for 
other ways to make a living because it was clear my fiction was not 
going to support me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of his friends were lawyers. And he, too, became fascinated  
by the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``My deal with myself when I went to law school was that I would  
keep myself alive as a writer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did just that, squeezing in fiction writing between all those  
legal briefs. He wrote during his train commute to and from work 
and got constant encouragement from his artist wife, Annette, whose 
paintings hang on his office walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, all of Turow's novels in some way deal with  
the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be happy to write about something else if I ever got bored  
with the law,'' he said, ``but that hasn't happened.''

<HEADLINE> Bush To Skip GOP Candidates' Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Five Republican presidential candidates  
gathered Friday for their first debate, but the focus was on the 
rival who was not there: front-runner George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor opted to skip the New Hampshire forum weeks  
ago, as his $57 million campaign kitty and sizable lead in public 
opinion polls provided no real incentive for a face-to-face 
encounter with his challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch, Alan Keyes and John  
McCain agreed to participate in the Friday night forum, sponsored 
by New Hampshire Public Television, The Union Leader of Manchester 
and New England Cable News. C-Span planned to broadcast the session 
live. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry that Governor Bush is continuing to play this delay  
game, hoping to force everybody out of the issue by burying them 
with big dollars,'' Bauer said Thursday as he arrived in the state 
for a local forum with Hatch and Keyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's actually going to make it harder for Governor  
Bush to convince the voters of New Hampshire that he's got a 
governing vision,'' Bauer added. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who had campaign stops in New Hampshire on Friday, said he  
had committed to a fund-raiser for Vermont Republicans at the same 
time of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	He also declined to participate in an Oct. 28 debate because it  
conflicted with a ceremony honoring his wife, Laura, at her alma 
mater, Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's debate came one day after the latest New Hampshire poll  
showed Bush with a commanding lead but McCain strengthening his 
position in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone survey of 600 likely Republican voters, Bush had  
the support of 42 percent, about what he had in August. McCain had 
26 percent -- 10 points better than in August -- with most of his 
gains coming at the expense of other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting also came two days after Elizabeth Dole, the lone  
woman seeking the GOP nomination, announced she was quitting the 
race because of difficulty in raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Bush, one prominent GOP candidate who also skipped the  
forum was conservative commentator Pat Buchanan. He is expected to 
announce Monday that he is leaving the Republican Party to seek the 
nomination of the Reform Party.

<HEADLINE> Safety Agency Issues Halloween Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's more than ghouls and goblins to watch  
out for on Halloween, the government warns. Flames from 
jack-o'-lanterns and candles and motorists who might not see 
trick-or-treaters darting from house to house pose dangers as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a list of safety  
tips Thursday regarding costumes, treats and decorations: 
</P>
<P>
	--Get costumes, masks, beards and wigs made of flame resistant  
fabrics such as nylon or polyester, and avoid costumes made with 
flimsy materials or big baggy sleeves or skirts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make sure costumes are bright and easily visible to motorists,  
add reflective tape that will glow in a car's headlights and carry 
flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
	--Costumes should not drag on the ground, shoes should fit well --  
no oversized high heels -- and accessories such as swords or knives 
should be made of soft, flexible material. 
</P>
<P>
	--Masks should fit well and provide adequate ventilation.  
</P>
<P>
	--Children should not eat any treats before an adult has examined  
them for evidence of tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make sure toys received by young trick-or-treaters are not  
small enough -- and do not have components small enough -- to present 
a choking hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	--Keep candles, jack-o'-lanterns and obstacles away from  
trick-or-treaters. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make sure lights have been tested for safety, discard damaged  
sets and don't overload extension cords.

	U.S. Concerned by Chechnya Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House expressed concern today about  
the ``terrible loss of life'' in Chechnya -- at least 143 killed in 
a missile attack-- and urged Moscow to open a dialogue with leaders 
of the breakaway Russian republic. The administration avoided 
pointing a finger of blame for the attack after a Russian military 
spokesman said it was a special operation and Russian political 
officials denied any responsibility. ``There are conflicting 
reports. ... We don't have a conclusive answer at this point,'' 
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.

	Parachutist Dies in Protest Jump  
</P>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A 60-year-old parachutist  
plunged to her death when her chute failed to open while jumping 
off a 3,200-foot-cliff today during a protest of park rules banning 
such jumps. Jan Davis was one of five jumpers off Yosemite's most 
forbidding peak, a protest organized in response to the June 9 
death of a jumper who successfully parachuted off El Capitan, only 
to drown in the river below while trying to elude rangers. The 
danger of the extreme sport of jumping off cliffs, buildings and 
other stationary objects led the National Park Service to ban such 
jumps. 

</P>
<P>
	Bush-Bashing Book Recalled  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- St. Martin's Press today recalled 70,000 copies  
of ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of an American 
President,'' already in stores. The move comes after the disclosure 
that the biographer, James Howard Hatfield, was convicted in 1988 
for plotting to murder a co-worker. The publisher yesterday 
suspended sales, shipment and promotion of the book. The book 
accused the GOP presidential front-runner of burying a cocaine 
arrest. 

</P>
<P>
	Budget Wrangling Goes on  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders embraced a 1.4  
percent across-the-board cut in federal agency budgets today to 
keep spending bills from eating into Social Security surpluses. The 
proposal, opposed by President Clinton, adds one more point of 
contention to the fight between the White House and Congress as the 
two sides struggle over unfinished spending measures for the new 
fiscal year. GOP leaders said that under their plan, aimed at 
saving $4.5 billion this year, agency heads would be asked to weed 
out waste, fraud and abuse from their budgets. 

</P>
<P>
	Deal Reached on Financial Overhaul Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lengthy political struggle may be coming to  
an end over legislation that would make it easier for banks, stock 
brokerages and insurance companies to combine and sell each other's 
products. Key Republican lawmakers reached agreement early today 
with Democrats and Clinton administration officials on provisions 
in the bill dealing with community lending rules for banks. The 
bill is designed to overhaul Depression-era financial services 
laws. 

</P>
<P>
	Milosevic To Allow Montenegro Split  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbian officials said today that  
President Slobodan Milosevic will allow Montenegro to leave the 
Yugoslav federation if the republic decides to do so. The 
government of Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic has demanded 
radical restructuring of the Yugoslav federation, a process that 
would virtually abolish Milosevic's control over the small 
republic. Montenegro plans to hold an independence referendum in 
case Milosevic rejects its proposal. 

</P>
<P>
	NYC Allowed To Unmask Klansmen  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a victory for New York City, a federal  
appeals panel ruled today that the city does not have to allow Ku 
Klux Klan members to wear their masks at a planned rally tomorrow. 
Yesterday, a lower court had ordered the city to allow KKK members 
to hold the rally while wearing their hooded white masks. City 
attorney Michael Hess said the KKK leaders had not applied for a 
permit yet. 

</P>
<P>
	Dow Ends Up 172.56 at 10,470.25  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today on the possibility  
that legislation will soon allow banks, stock brokerages and 
insurance companies to combine. The Dow Jones industrial closed up 
172.56 at 10,470.25. Advancing issues on the New York Stock 
Exchange led decliners 1,960-1,062. The Nasdaq composite index was 
up 14.57 at 2,816.52. 

</P>
<P>
	Gaston Interviews for Indians Job  
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cito Gaston today interviewed for the Cleveland  
Indians' managing job. Gaston, who led the Toronto Blue Jays to 
Series titles in 1992 and '93, met with Indians general manager 
John Hart and assistant GM Mark Shapiro for more than three hours. 
The Indians fired Mike Hargrove last week following their collapse 
against the Boston Red Sox in the first round of the AL playoffs. 
Hart plans to meet with Braves hitting instructor Don Baylor and 
New York Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Ore. City Bans After-School Fights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OREGON CITY, Ore. (AP) -- Derick Garcia hasn't seen the new  
violent movie ``Fight Club'' and he doesn't understand the fuss 
about the punching matches among him and his friends, girls 
included. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon City High School senior has been boxing since he was  
a boy, something done just for fun with his Dad, his older brother 
or his buddies at a park down the street. They wear gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything would have been just fine, Garcia said, if one of his  
classmates hadn't told a newspaper reporter about the unsupervised 
Friday boxing matches held since February at Atkinson Park, a 
thicket of trees atop a bluff overlooking the Willamette River and 
the skyline of nearby Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe it,'' Garcia said. ``Nobody cared it about  
until all of a sudden there were all these TV guys and they're 
making this into some huge thing. They were way out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a time of increased scrutiny of teen violence, word of the  
boxing hit the news about the same time that ``Fight Club,'' a Brad 
Pitt movie centered on a brutal, barefisted club for men, began its 
final advertising blitz before its release to theaters. The film 
received extra attention in Oregon because it's based on a novel by 
a Portland writer, Chuck Palahniuk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even know there was a movie like that until a  
reporter told me,'' said Garcia, 18. ``But this is nothing. It's 
just having fun. There's no grudge matches or anything like that. 
We're all friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few girls tried it too, but ``it was just cat fighting,'' the  
18-year-old Garcia said. ``Nobody hurt anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Oregon City Commission voted Wednesday night to ban  
the fights from city parks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very pleased with the way the city commissioners and the  
police handled it,'' said Barry Rotrock, Oregon City School 
District superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	``They listened and took the time to explain their concerns, and  
tell the kids how it would affect a lot of people if it got out of 
hand,'' Rotrock said. ``They just explained that from a liability 
standpoint they couldn't let it continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rotrock and police said they don't expect the ordinance to stop  
the fights because they can be held on private property as long as 
neighbors are not disturbed. Officials said they hope the youths 
will choose to hold the matches in a place where they can be 
supervised. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've expressed our concerns over safety issues with  
participants,'' said Lt. Rocky Smith of the Oregon City police. 
``At this point we haven't made any headway toward getting them 
into a ring, or some place with supervision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's mother, Cherie, said the teens already have tried  
boxing at each other's homes. She said they have been more careful, 
and are getting better equipment, including headgear and 
mouthpieces. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just really like it,'' Mrs. Garcia said. ``They enjoy it.  
For the last year, it's been a way to get aggressions out have a 
good time, spend time together. They are all friends and all the 
attention has kind of encouraged them more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia says that he and his friends held the fights in the park  
because nobody wanted to join a boxing club or put in long hours of 
training and coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's way too much work,'' he said. ``I'm not going to make a  
career out of it.''

<HEADLINE> Angels Search for GM Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels hoped to have a new  
general manager in place before the start of the World Series, but 
it didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Tim Mead said late Friday no announcement on a  
successor to Bill Bavasi was forthcoming, and a decision wasn't 
expected to be made public over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I've stated previously, the process continues, and there's  
not a definitive time frame,'' Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as the team's previously stated desire to have a GM in  
place before the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves open the 
Series on Saturday night, Mead said, ``That was certainly a goal. 
But the ultimate goal is deciding upon the right man for the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball mandates that no major announcements be made during the  
Series so they will not detract from the games. It's believed the 
commissioner would have to authorize any exception to that rule. 
</P>
<P>
	To this point, Bill Stoneman, an executive with the Montreal  
Expos since 1983, has been considered to be the front-runner for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comment on candidates whatsoever,'' Mead said. ``I'm  
not at liberty to discuss any other issues regarding the GM search 
at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about a Los Angeles Times report that Stoneman met with  
Walt Disney Co. chairman and CEO Michael Eisner in New York on 
Thursday, Mead replied, ``I'm not at liberty to discuss that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman, a 55-year-old former big league pitcher who grew up in  
nearby West Covina, was interviewed twice previously. He has most 
recently served as Montreal's vice president-baseball operations. 
Before that, he worked primarily as the Expos' chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi resigned as the Angels' GM on Oct. 1 -- two days before  
the team completed a 70-92 season. Bavasi held the job for nearly 
six years.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Marino Still Ailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- Ailing Dan Marino did not throw in practice  
for the third day in a row Friday, and he'll likely miss his first 
start since 1996 when the Miami Dolphins play the Philadelphia 
Eagles on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan did take a few snaps and did some conditioning work,''  
coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``We'll make a decision Sunday morning as 
far as what his contribution will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino has thrown on the sideline this week, but he can't  
generate much velocity or distance because of muscle weakness 
caused by a bone spur in his lower neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said earlier this week that he expected Damon Huard to  
make his first NFL start in place of Marino. Huard came off the 
bench in the first quarter last Sunday and rallied Miami past New 
England 31-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Huard worked with the first team again Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I liked what I saw,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Dockworkers Authorize Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii's largest group of union dockworkers  
voted Friday to call a strike if shippers don't meet their contract 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a strike has triggered panic buying of staples  
like rice, Spam and toilet paper in Hawaii, where 90 percent of 
goods arrive by ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The 507-member International Longshore and Warehouse Union  
canceled a contract extension Monday with the state's four major 
shipping companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Oahu members, the largest contingent with 427 workers,  
authorized a strike on Friday, joining union members on the islands 
of Kauai, Maui and Hawaii who voted earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders can call a strike at any time now, but contract  
talks are scheduled for Saturday. The union wants pay raises 
similar to the three-year, 8 percent wage increase West Coast 
dockworkers received. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll make every effort to settle amicably. We're prepared to  
negotiate around the clock,'' said Local 142 President Eusebio 
Lapenia. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Hawaii Employers Council, which represents  
the shippers, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ben Cayetano has offered to mediate. He is so confident  
there will not be a strike that he asked his household staff not to 
raid supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to go out and stock up on bags of rice and  
soap and toilet paper and all that because I feel good about what's 
happening right now,'' he said. ``I think both sides don't want the 
rest of the state to suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, dockworkers staged a work slowdown that created a  
backlog of unloaded cargo ships in Honolulu Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	If dockworkers strike, ships that arrive in Hawaii will sit in  
port without being unloaded. And if the walkout drags on, shipping 
companies will stop sending vessels on the five-day journey from 
the West Coast.

<HEADLINE> BC Hasn't Beaten Miami Since Flutie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The tapes of Doug Flutie's 48-yard desperation  
touchdown pass are getting grainy with age now. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been 15 years since the ``Hail Flutie'' gave Boston College  
its last win over Miami, and Saturday is as good a time as any for 
the Eagles to reverse their nine-game losing streak against the 
Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston College (5-1, 2-1 Big East) won its first four games,  
then took a 14-0 lead against Temple two weeks ago before giving up 
24 consecutive points. The Eagles bounced back with a win over 
Pittsburgh last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (2-3, 0-0) is riding a three-game losing streak, but is  
still ranked No. 23. The Eagles hope to continue the Hurricanes' 
losing streak on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the hard part of the schedule is over now,'' BC coach  
Tom O'Brien said, even though his upcoming schedule includes 
Syracuse, West Virginia, Notre Dame and Virginia Tech. ``To take 
this young football team and go through the expectations that were 
put upon them -- everybody was talking 6-0, 5-1 -- to put that upon 
them was tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we enter a phase where nobody gives them a chance to do  
anything,'' O'Brien said. ``We've got everything to gain and 
nothing to lose. We can relax and play football. Mentally, it will 
be a much better situation for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami beat Ohio State and Florida A&AMP;M before losing to three  
consecutive ranked teams, including No. 1 Florida State. Last 
week's game was supposed to be a streak-stopper, against Temple, 
but it was postponed until Dec. 4 because of Hurricane Irene. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The players) are getting edgy to play,'' coach Butch Davis  
said. ``It seems like all we've done is practice the last 12 weeks. 
We just need to go play a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes have not won since Labor Day weekend, a span of  
more than six weeks -- their longest midseason winless stretch since 
1970. But they've beaten BC nine consecutive times, and 17 out of 
20 in all. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time they met in Chestnut Hill, in 1997, the Hurricanes  
needed two overtimes to take a 45-44 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``In due time, we're going to get our win,'' wide receiver  
Santana Moss said. ``And I think it will be this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although they've yet to play their first Big East game, Miami  
could catapult itself into the Big East race with a victory. Only 
No. 4 Virginia Tech is left unbeaten in the conference, and the 
teams will play Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like two seasons,'' Davis said. ``We had five  
non-conference games, and those are over with. Now we've got to 
turn our attention to seven consecutive conference games and look 
at this as a fresh start. We're 0-0, and we'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Giants RB Brown Is Lost for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New York Giants running back Gary  
Brown is out for the season after arthroscopic surgery Friday found 
``extensive cartilage damage'' in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	After Friday's practice, coach Jim Fassel said that the injury  
and repair should not preclude Brown from returning next season. 
Brown cannot begin rehabilitation until he is off crutches, which 
could take six weeks, team spokesman Pat Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage to Brown's knee is a ``long-term wear-and-team  
injury'' not related to a sprain that the back sustained in the 
final preseason game, Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown did not play after that until Oct. 3, when he gained 87  
yards on 27 carries against Philadelohia. He had 67 yards on 18 
carries Oct. 10 against Arizona, and carried 10 times for 23 yards 
Monday against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery was performed by Dr. Russell Warren, Giants team  
physician, at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown led the Giants in rushing last year with 1,063 yards. He  
missed much of training camp this year with a buttocks injury after 
a motorcycle injury in June. 
</P>
<P>
	LeShon Johnson will replace Brown in the starting lineup Sunday  
against the New Orleans Saints, with rookie Joe Montgomery expected 
to make his first pro appearance, as backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown is the second starter lost to the Giants this week. Kicker  
Brad Daluiso tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee 
on the final play of Monday night's game against the Cowboys.

<HEADLINE> 5 GOP Presidential Hopefuls Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Five Republican presidential candidates  
staged their first debate of the season Friday night, agreeing on 
more than they found to argue about, after needling the 
front-runner who stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharpest line was drawn by conservative Gary Bauer in  
repeated slaps at Steve Forbes, his self-financed rival for backing 
on the GOP right. 
</P>
<P>
	On taxes, trade and health care, Bauer made a point of disputing  
Forbes' proposals. ``Steve, that sounded real good, but we've got 
to go beyond generalities,'' he said after Forbes complained that 
Americans are losing control of their decisions on medical care to 
government and to health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington is gridlocked by special interests,'' said Sen.  
John McCain of Arizona, a champion of campaign finance reform. He 
said Democrats are beholden to trial lawyers, and Republicans to 
the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans trying to overtake the absent front-runner,  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, did differ on trade policy toward China, 
with Bauer and the even more conservative Alan Keyes saying the 
most favored nation treatment Beijing now gets -- which is standard 
for U.S. trading partners -- should be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, Forbes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah criticized  
administration policy toward China, but didn't advocate ending most 
favored nation rules. 
</P>
<P>
	More typically, after McCain rebuked Clinton administration  
policy on national defense, Hatch said he agreed with everything 
his fellow senator had said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes was the most talkative and confrontational of the lot,  
denouncing socialism, urging outright abolition of the income tax, 
telling the others to ``stop talking out of both sides of our 
mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hourlong forum was sponsored by New Hampshire Public  
Television, The Union Leader of Manchester, and New Hampshire Cable 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	C-Span broadcast the debate nationally.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush opted weeks ago to skip the forum, and one next week, too,  
since his lead in campaign funds and in the public opinion polls 
left no incentive for face-to-face encounters with his challengers 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said the opener would be an appetizer for people who will  
want to hear from Bush. ``They're going to want more real debates, 
not just an hour session. They're going to want all the candidates 
involved and so I think it's going to put pressure on Gov. Bush to 
be more participatory in the future,'' Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said afterwards that he and Forbes are battling to be the  
conservative alternative to Bush. ``I believe that Steve Forbes has 
peaked just as the foliage in New Hampshire has,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who had campaign stops in New Hampshire on Friday, said he  
had committed to a fund-raiser for Vermont Republicans at the same 
time of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	He also declined to participate in a debate next Wednesday  
because it conflicts with a ceremony honoring his wife, Laura, at 
her alma mater, Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign said it told the debate organizers before  
invitations were mailed to the candidates that the governor would 
not be able to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's debate came one day after the latest New Hampshire poll  
found Bush with a commanding lead but McCain strengthening his 
position in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone survey of 600 likely Republican voters, Bush had  
the support of 42 percent, about what he had in August. McCain had 
26 percent -- 10 points better than in August -- with most of his 
gains coming at the expense of other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting also came two days after Elizabeth Dole, the lone  
woman seeking the GOP nomination, quit the race citing difficulty 
raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Bush, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan also skipped  
the debate. He is expected to announce Monday that he is leaving 
the Republican Party to seek the nomination of the Reform Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, who has scored zero percent in some recent polls, said he  
brought more to the campaign than some of the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I like Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes and Steve Forbes --  
and I think they're good people, I think any one of them would make 
a better president than what we have right now -- I do think it's 
very important to be able to start working Day One, to know what 
you're doing,'' the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think it's important to have run for office before and  
have had the experience of having to face the electorate.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Church Van Overturn Kills 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATASCADERO, Calif. (AP) -- A church-rented van carrying 14 people  
overturned on a central California highway and rolled down an 
embankment in a late-night accident, authorities said. Seven people 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A Los Angeles-based church had rented the van, which was en  
route to San Francisco when it crashed on Highway 101 about 11 p.m. 
Thursday, California Highway Patrol spokesman Scott Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The identity of the church was not released. Lee said  
investigators did not immediately know the cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the passengers, who ranged in age from 5 to 60, was  
wearing a seat belt, police said. Lee said five of the seven who 
died had been thrown from the van. 
</P>
<P>
	Four men and a woman were hospitalized in serious condition and  
another woman was treated for minor injuries. Aretha Fike, 5, was 
in serious condition at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, nursing 
supervisor Carol Dolyak said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was near Atascadero, about 210 miles north of Los  
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The crumpled vehicle came to rest on its passenger side in a  
10-foot-deep roadside ditch. Rescue workers righted the vehicle by 
propping it with boards to gain access to those trapped in the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Purses, backpacks and plastic utensils were strewn on the  
highway, surrounding a trail of debris left by the van as it 
tumbled across the center divider and two lanes.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Education Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told teachers today that  
public schools were the winners when House lawmakers took the first 
step toward renewing the nation's largest education law without 
endorsing a move toward private-school choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that we have, I think, an appropriate amount  
of money set aside for education,'' Clinton said in an address to 
the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is that yesterday we had our voucher debate and  
the public school side won,'' Clinton said to applause. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 358-67 Thursday to pass a bipartisan $9.9  
billion plan known as Title I aimed at boosting the achievement of 
10.5 million poor and otherwise disadvantaged school children. 
</P>
<P>
	Affecting a quarter of U.S. schoolchildren in nearly half of the  
nation's schools, the five-year plan would provide books, teachers, 
computers and other help if signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have long argued the federal government  
interferes too often with local schools. On Thursday, the GOP lost 
bids to give federal aid directly to parents for vouchers, but won 
passage of a separate bill giving 10 states in a pilot program more 
freedom in complying with Title I and other federal school 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Title I and the other education programs under the 34-year-old  
Elementary and Secondary Education Act have yet to come before the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats, joined by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,  
stressed at a news conference today that they would reject, and 
Clinton would veto, any education spending bill that does not 
adequately fund the administration's goal of hiring 100,000 new 
teachers to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP leadership has tried to cut those funds in ongoing talks  
on the fiscal 2000 education spending bill. ``The Republican 
leadership and the Republicans in Congress have consistently voted 
against what Americans want in education. They have denied 
thousands of children the chance to learn in smaller classes,'' 
Mrs. Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Democrats were heartened by 52 Republicans who  
helped them defeat, 257-166, a plan by House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, R-Texas, that would spend $100 million a year to let 
children in low-performing schools attend private and parochial 
schools with $3,500 vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and  
the Workforce Committee, also declared victory. He said he had long 
believed that education programs on the federal level weren't 
working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we passed Title I and for the first time we are  
demanding accountability,''' said Goodling, who voted against the 
voucher plan. 
</P>
<P>
	A second bill, pushed all year by the House GOP leadership with  
busloads of smiling youngsters at photo opportunities, was meant to 
free any willing state from federal rules. But on Thursday moderate 
Republicans cut a deal with conservatives to limit the program to 
an experiment for 10 states -- many of them run by Republican 
governors who want to be free of the Education Department 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academic Achievement for All Act, or ``Straight A's,'' was  
passed 213-208, under threat of veto. Democrats say it just turns 
the programs into a lump sum of money that states could use on 
children who are neither poor nor low-achieving. 
</P>
<P>
	As the two parties roll into an election year, they have  
scrambled to prove their worth on the popular topic of education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to this Congress to make education a priority, not to  
make it a political issue,'' charged Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C., 
who opposed Straight A's bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Some educators criticized the Title I bill for making too little  
change in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The so-called 'reforms' in this package, while not harmful,  
don't amount to a hill of beans,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., 
president of the Fordham Foundation national education research 
group and a former education official under the Reagan 
administration. ``Every important idea for real change has been 
defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The Title I bill is H.R. 2. The Straight A's bill is H.R.2300.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Jolts Southern Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A strong tremor shook earthquake-rattled  
Taiwan today, damaging schools, blacking out thousands of homes and 
injuring about 200 people, officials and local media said. No 
deaths were immediately reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6.4-magnitude quake that struck near the southern city of  
Chiayi was not related to the stronger tremor that killed more than 
2,300 people one month ago in central Taiwan, seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage from today's quake was minor compared to the  
7.6-magnitude tremor on Sept. 21. Only a few buildings were damaged 
today, while thousands were destroyed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 aftershocks followed today's tremor but only a few were  
strong enough to be felt, including 5.1- and 6-magnitude tremors, 
the Central Weather Bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiayi, with a population of 263,000 and located 180 miles south  
of Taipei, has been hit by several strong quakes in the past 
century, and seismologists have said it was due for another big one 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The island's main evening newspapers reported today that about  
200 people were taken to hospitals. Most suffered only minor 
injuries, TVBS television reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake knocked over bottles of chemicals in a lab at  
Chungcheng University in Chiayi, causing an explosion and a fire 
that was quickly extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything fell off the shelves and the glassware shattered  
and everyone ran out of the laboratory,'' one student told TVBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Another student told TVBS, ``I knew it wasn't a minor quake  
because the shaking kept getting stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A section of a high school collapsed, injuring seven people,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first floor of a shipping company's two-story building also  
gave way, but there were no reports of serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought one person was trapped in the building, and we were  
calling for him, but five minutes later he escaped through the back 
of the building,'' the company's owner told TVBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in Chiayi closed and sent children home for the rest of  
the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90,000 homes lost power.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1906, a quake of magnitude 7.1 hit near Chiayi, killing 1,258  
people. Another tremor, of 7.1 magnitude, killed 358 in the city in 
1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Located along the earthquake-prone Pacific Rim and crisscrossed  
by 51 fault lines, Taiwan is rattled by scores of earthquakes each 
year, most harmless. 
</P>
<P>
	Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the total energy released  
by an earthquake, as indicated by ground motion recorded on 
seismographs. An increase of one digit in the scale represents a 
tenfold increase in the strength of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a  
populated area.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Pay 'Travel Loans' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- With fellow Kosovars being kidnapped and  
killed and their homes burning around her, Arijeta Blakaj didn't 
hesitate when a refugee agency offered to fly her to America. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until she was on U.S. soil that the agency told her  
she would have to pay the U.S. government $760 for the flight or 
return to Kosovo, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not good. It's not fair,'' the 21-year-old said from the  
church rectory in Elizabeth, N.J., where she has been staying and 
trying to start a new life in America. ``I need money for 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees flown to the United States have been asked to reimburse  
the government for their airfare and domestic travel costs since 
the 1950s, said Norman Runkles, comptroller of the State 
Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. Congress 
made it official policy in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the policy, the refugees have to sign contracts in  
their own languages agreeing to pay back the loan before boarding 
planes to America, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But relief agencies acknowledge that, due to the speed of the  
Kosovo effort, many ethnic Albanians may not have been told about 
the policy until they arrived at the refugee center at Fort Dix, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	They still will be billed for airfare to the United States and  
for any flights they were put on to other parts of the country, 
Runkles said Friday. The $740 budgeted per refugee for housing and 
food each month is not considered part of the ``travel loan'' and 
doesn't have to be paid back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they pay back goes towards the next crisis,'' said Lauren  
Engle, spokeswoman for the International Organization for 
Migration, which leads much of the country's refugee resettlement 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees have paid well over $400 million in travel loans since  
the process began -- about half of the money the government has 
loaned out, Runkles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who return to their homeland after the danger passes do  
not have to pay the plane fare, he said. The primary reason, he 
said, is that the country has no practical way of collecting back 
loans once the refugees leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 14,129 Kosovar refugees airlifted to the United States  
since the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, 2,462 had 
returned as of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest, like Blakaj, will have 46 months to pay the airfare  
back, Runkles said. Most won't be billed until next summer. Those 
who refuse to pay and stay in the country eventually will be 
reported to credit bureaus, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threat Forces Hockey Forfeit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Ontario (AP) -- A bomb threat disrupted an Ontario  
Hockey League game at Memorial Centre for 45 minutes Friday night 
and it became a forfeit when the visiting team refused to return to 
the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat was phoned in during the second intermission of the  
game between the Kingston Frontenacs and Erie Otters. It forced the 
evacuation of 2,600 people from the arena and police searched the 
building for 45 minutes before spectators were allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
	The game didn't resume because Otters' management balked at  
having its players return and as a result, Kingston was declared a 
7-3 winner. Jonathan Schill scored three goals to lead the 
Frontenacs, who led by that score after two periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the bomb threat came through 911 and the identity of  
the caller is being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Erie coach Dave MacQueen, who consulted with OHL commissioner  
David Branch before making his decision to forfeit the game, said 
his primary concern was the safety of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Springer, co-owner of the Frontenacs, said someone was  
playing a ``dangerous and sick'' game with the bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question in my mind there's some whacko out there  
having a laugh,'' Springer said. ``But it's not funny, not at all. 
This is a very serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springer has already seen his team miss three home games because  
of a municipal labor strike and had another postponed by ice 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never have dreamed this would happen,'' Springer said.  
``It's just unfortunate people haven't had the opportunity to see 
what I think is a very good hockey team. But they will.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Frees Convicted Child Abuser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- One emotional chapter of the 15-year  
Fells Acres child abuse case has ended with a judge ruling that 
Cheryl Amirault LeFave does not have to return to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Her conviction stands on child-abuse charges from one of the  
most lurid mass child-molestation cases of the 1980s, but 
Thursday's decision by Judge Paul Chernoff means she finally is 
free of the specter of court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as if it's the beginning of my life all over again,''  
Ms. LeFave, 41, said in an interview at her lawyer's office. ``But 
I'm still an innocent woman convicted of a crime. There are still 
some corrections to be made. I'm not the person they claimed me to 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave already had served eight years of an eight- to  
20-year sentence. Chernoff allowed the time served to stand after 
prosecutors did not oppose a motion to reduce her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave had been freed in 1995 when a judge overturned the  
convictions of her and her late mother, Violet Amirault. In August, 
Ms. LeFave's conviction was reinstated by the state's highest 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women along with Ms. LeFave's brother, Gerald Amirault,  
were convicted of sexually assaulting young children at their day 
care center in Malden, the Fells Acres Day School. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amiraults have insisted they are innocent. They say they are  
the victims of a sex abuse hysteria that swept the country in the 
1980s, and that prosecutors relied on the questionable testimony of 
child witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In agreeing to the sentence reduction, prosecutor Lynn Rooney  
said Ms. LeFave cannot contact the victims or their families, can 
have no unsupervised contact with children, and that she must agree 
not to profit as a result of her crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. LeFave also agreed to two other, unenforceable provisions  
termed a ``gentlemen's agreement'' by District Attorney Martha 
Coakley -- she cannot pursue any further legal appeals of her case, 
and she cannot speak before television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Violet Amirault died two years ago and Gerald Amirault is still  
in prison, having lost his appeal requests. He is serving a 30- to 
40-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there were about 40 victims between the ages of  
2 and 4. Coakley has long maintained that the children told the 
truth when they described being tied to trees, sexually penetrated 
with knives and tortured by a ``bad clown'' in a ``secret room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No corroborating physical evidence and no testimony from a  
teacher or visitor at the school supported the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Other high-profile abuse cases that surfaced in the 1980s and  
'90s have fallen apart, including the McMartin Preschool case in 
California, the Little Rascals case in North Carolina and the 
Margaret Kelly Michaels case in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Marathoner Seeks U.S. Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Khalid Khannouchi is the United States' best hope  
for an Olympic medal in the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	There's just one problem: He's not an American citizen yet.  
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan-born runner's request for expedited citizenship was  
rejected in June, leaving on hold his hopes of running in the 
Sydney Olympics as an American. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still working on it and I'm always positive that I'll  
get my citizenship,'' said Khannouchi, the 1997 LaSalle Banks 
Chicago Marathon champion and a favorite to win again Sunday. 
``Hopefully, I'll be able to run in the Olympics as an American. I 
want to give something back to this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Khannouchi, American prospects are dim. Besides  
Khannouchi, the favorites in Chicago on Sunday are world 
record-holder Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil; defending champion Ondoro 
Osoro of Kenya, and South Africa's Hendrik Ramaala, who is running 
his first marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	The top American in the field, Todd Williams, has a personal  
best of 2:11:17, more than five minutes behind da Costa's 
world-record of 2:06:05. 
</P>
<P>
	The outlook isn't much better among the women. Ireland's  
Catherina McKiernan, who has won all three marathons she's entered, 
has a personal best of 2:22:33, while Joyce Chepchumba of Kenya won 
last year's race in 2:23:57. 
</P>
<P>
	The top Americans in Sunday's field, Kristy Johnson and Libbie  
Hickman, have run 2:29:05 and 2:33:06, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always darkest before the dawn,'' Carey Pinkowski, the  
Chicago Marathon's race director, said of the United States' 
long-distance prospects. ``It's got to get better. So I'm not going 
to give up on it. We'll have another Frank Shorter or Alberto 
Salazar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, though, the best hope is Khannouchi. He played soccer  
as a boy, then took up running when his father encouraged him to 
try an individual sport. After only a year of formal training, he 
won the Moroccan cross country championship. He also won junior 
titles at 5,000 and 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	But Morocco had other elite runners, and Khannouchi didn't get  
the support he wanted from his country's running federation. So in 
1993, he moved to New York without money or a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the support from the Americans I didn't get from my own  
country,'' he said. ``They knew I was a great runner, but they 
didn't give me the support. Americans took me in and carried me to 
the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning six road races at shorter distances in 1997,  
Khannouchi made his marathon debut in Chicago and won in 2:07:10, a 
world debut best and the fourth-fastest time ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory made Khannouchi famous. He even got to meet Michael  
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This morning, at the airport, I met a guy who shook my hand  
and another man called out my name. I love that,'' Khannouchi said 
Thursday. ``That's the reason I'm training hard. That's the reason 
I want to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running with a stress fracture in his left heel, Khannouchi  
finished second last year to Osoro, who broke Khannouchi's debut 
record with a time of 2:06:54. 
</P>
<P>
	He's run nine races this year, winning five and finishing second  
in three. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy the way I'm racing,'' he said. ``I'm in good shape,  
but it doesn't matter if I'm in better shape or not. Sometimes you 
can prepare right and just not have your day. But the training went 
according to my plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something telling me I'm going to have a good race  
...''

<HEADLINE> S.E. Asia Said Committed to Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Southeast Asian countries remain  
committed to economic reform despite their unexpectedly fast 
recovery from financial crisis, an official of a regional 
association of governments said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodolfo Severino, secretary general of the Association of  
Southeast Asian Nations, said there was some concern that the rapid 
recovery in the region would diminish efforts for reform. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there is ``no sign that there is such a  
slackening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``ASEAN is trying to ensure that these reforms continue and that  
no development that could affect everybody would surprise us 
again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an executive of the U.S. investment banking firm  
Goldman Sachs, speaking in Singapore, urged Asian companies to 
reform how they operate and focus on core businesses to sustain the 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's economic crisis, which began in July 1997, has been  
blamed on government favoritism toward certain companies, 
inadequate financial regulation, and massive flows of foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN leaders will hold their annual summit next month in  
Manila. 
</P>
<P>
	An ASEAN Free Trade Area will be ``substantially completed''  
early next year, with 85 percent of goods traded within the region 
subjected to no more than a 5 percent tariff, he said. Most ASEAN 
goods will be tariff-free a few years after that, Severino said. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN consists of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,  
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Richard Gnodde of Goldman Sachs said Friday that the  
improving economic performance in the region should give 
governments support to continue making reforms rather than creating 
a sense of complacency. 
</P>
<P>
	Governments already have made progress in strengthening market  
oversight, bankruptcy laws and other regulations, said Gnodde, who 
heads the merchant bank's operations in Asia outside of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's economies and markets have rebounded far faster  
than expected from the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market capitalization in the Asian region outside of Japan  
has returned to the pre-crisis level of $2 trillion, after plunging 
60 percent, Gnodde said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said mergers and acquisitions are also picking up. The value  
of announced or completed mergers and acquisitions so far this year 
has come to $100 billion, surpassing the $70 billion recorded in 
the nine months of 1997 before the crisis broke out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the equities markets, he said new share issues have hit a  
record $18.3 billion this year, reflecting increased investor 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic prosperity will help governments continue down the  
path of Peform,'' Gnodde said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries Wartime Internment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt recalled ``a  
sad chapter'' in U.S. history Friday as he joined in breaking 
ground near the Capitol for a memorial to Japanese-Americans who 
were interned or fought during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before banners naming the camps where more than 115,000  
Japanese-Americans were interned, Babbitt delivered a statement 
from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a tragic reality,'' Clinton said, ``that during World  
War II many Japanese-American families were placed in internment 
camps during a sad chapter in our nation's history. Rising above 
the indignity and discrimination of that experience, 
Japanese-Americans volunteered by the thousands to serve in the 
military to defend our country, and in fighting against tyranny 
abroad as well as prejudice at home, they set an inspiring example 
of patriotism for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those who volunteered stood with Babbitt at the  
groundbreaking: Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii. He said in an 
interview that he was living about five miles away on Dec. 7, 1941, 
the day the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, a 17-year-old listening 
to the radio before going to church. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly the disc jockey began screaming, `The Japanese are  
bombing us ... the Japanese are bombing us,'' he recalled. ``We 
went out in the street and saw the black puffs in the sky and knew 
they were explosive charges. Nonexplosive charges just gave white 
puffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inouye led a platoon of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the  
first Japanese-American unit authorized. In Italy's Po Valley two 
days before the European war ended, enemy fire shattered his right 
arm and wounded him in the legs and stomach, but he managed to 
throw grenades into three machine gun nests, saving his unit. He 
got the Distinguished Service Cross, spent two years in army 
hospitals and was discharged a captain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese-Americans can be proud of their own profound and  
lasting contributions to our national lot. This memorial honors 
those sufferings and sacrifice ... and compels us to learn from 
mistakes of the past,'' the Clinton statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents of both parties have apologized for the internment.  
Congress appropriated $1.6 billion for 82,000 of those interned and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese American Memorial Commission surpassed its goal of  
$8.6 million to build the monument, due to be completed in a year. 
It collected $10.1 million and now hopes to reach $11 million by 
the end of the year. The surplus is to be used for an educational 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Fine Arts Commission on Thursday approved the  
memorial's design, dominated by a 14-foot statue of two cranes -- a 
traditional Japanese symbol of happiness -- struggling through 
barbed wire. Some members had misgivings about two of the nine 
inscriptions planned. A controversy about the inscriptions has been 
going on for two years, both in the commission and on the 
memorial's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	A short English poem in a traditional Japanese haiku form was  
seen by some commission members Thursday as hard for many potential 
visitors to understand. A ``Japanese-American creed'' written the 
year before Pearl harbor, was criticized on the ground that no 
other ethnic group has such a creed. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the board, Melvin H. Chiogioji, a retired rear  
admiral in the U.S. Navy, said the panel would review the 
inscriptions Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Can Gophers Finally Beat Buckeyes? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Maybe they're so accustomed to disparaging  
comments that the University of Minnesota football team doesn't 
know a compliment when it hears one. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24th-ranked Gophers are slight favorites over No. 22 Ohio  
State on Saturday, and Buckeyes coach John Cooper calls strong 
safety Tyrone Carter the Big Ten's best. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Gophers (5-1, 2-1 Big Ten) are looking for revenge,  
not respect. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Buckeyes (4-3, 1-2) routed Minnesota 45-15 in  
Columbus and afterwards didn't even bother to shake hands with the 
Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was disrespectful,'' Gophers running back Thomas Hamner  
said. ``It's something we held in the back of our heads. We aren't 
holding a grudge, but we demand respect and sometimes you've got to 
take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter hasn't forgotten the snub, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``They think we're a pushover,'' Carter said. ``They've been  
killing us over the years and we just got to go out there and take 
the game away from them and let them know we are for real this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper has the utmost respect for Carter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I've seen a better defensive player in our  
league in a long, long time,'' Cooper said. ``He's just an 
outstanding football player. I've never seen as many tackles as he 
makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers, who haven't beaten the Buckeyes since 1981,  
returned to the rankings after a 37-7 whipping at Illinois left 
them just one victory shy of their first winning season since 1990. 
A win Saturday and they'd be eligible for their first bowl berth 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers haven't been 6-1 since 1967, and the Buckeyes  
haven't been 1-3 in the Big Ten since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamner, who is from Hamilton, Ohio, rushed for a career-best 184  
yards and a touchdown at Illinois. The senior is averaging a 
conference-best 148 yards rushing. Quarterback Billy Cockerham 
threw for 95 yards and rushed for 100 more against the Illini. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckeyes quarterback Steve Bellisari also piles up yards on the  
ground, twice leading his team in rushing. But Cooper said that's 
not so much a sign of his mobility as it is an indication of Ohio 
State's struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``When our quarterback, who we picked up because of his passing  
ability, leads us in rushing, that illustrates some of the problems 
we're having on offense,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gophers coach Glen Mason, who attended and coached at Ohio  
State, sees it another way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any time you have a mobile quarterback, which he is  
very mobile, that adds another dimension to what you can do. He's 
an awfully good athlete,'' Mason said. ``I know he pulled the ball 
down against Penn State, the best defense there is, and scrambled 
for 44 yards. I think that speaks volumes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes are looking to bounce back offensively after  
mustering just 35 yards rushing in their 23-10 loss to Penn State 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was probably the worst offensive production we've had in  
a long, long, time,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers are on a roll just in time for the meat of their  
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to intimidated by any team in the Big Ten,''  
Minnesota center Ben Hamilton said. ``We know we can play with 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Berger Slams 'Isolationist Right' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The United States will not have the authority to  
remain the world's leader if isolationists continue to control 
Congress, national security adviser Sandy Berger told a foreign 
policy group in a scathing criticism of Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Following two major foreign policy defeats in Congress for the  
Clinton administration, Berger called for a national debate on 
foreign policy and said the administration would fight 
``isolationist right'' lawmakers during President Clinton's last 15 
months in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new isolationism of 1999 fails to understand precisely  
what the old isolationism of 60 years ago failed to understand -- 
that local conflicts can have global consequences,'' he said. ``In 
effect, they believe in a survivalist foreign policy -- build a 
fortified fence around America and retreat behind it. And if other 
nations complain ... let them, because we are stronger and richer 
than they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas dismissed the speech  
as ``random name-calling by a frustrated administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey, in a statement, said ``today's world of peace and  
prosperity was built on the Republican policies of free trade, a 
strong military, a larger NATO and support for Democratic allies 
like Taiwan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush were not  
isolationists ``and neither are we,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Thursday to the Council on Foreign Relations, a private  
group that usually supports an activist U.S. foreign policy, 
Berger's comments also appeared to be an effort to make foreign 
policy a larger campaign issue in 2000. He attacked conservative 
Republicans who blocked a ban on nuclear weapons testing and are 
cutting back overseas programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, a foe of the test ban treaty, said the notion  
of lost U.S. leadership was ``absurd,'' adding that the treaty's 
defeat actually would help restore American stature. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will improve our international respect and leadership,  
because we said we are not going to unilaterally disarm anymore,'' 
Inhofe, R-Okla., said in Washington. ``We are going to gain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president is now giving priority to peacemaking in the  
Middle East and in Northern Ireland and to working with Russia on 
missile defenses while also supporting democracy and capitalism 
there, Berger said, adding that the $12.6 billion foreign aid bill 
that Clinton vetoed on Monday could have hampered U.S. efforts to 
promote peace and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress cut $2 billion from Clinton's proposed budget for  
foreign aid while adding $5 billion to the Pentagon's budget, a 
move that Berger denounced, saying, ``if we underfund our 
diplomacy, we will end up overusing our military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said most Americans ``understand that we are fortunate to  
be in a position of leadership, and that to maintain it we must 
continue to lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional isolationists, he said, were consumed with an  
impulse ``to withdraw from the world in a way that would squander 
our advantages, alienate our friends, diminish our credibility, 
betray our values and discredit our example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Describing congressional conservatives as ``nostalgic for the  
good old days'' when the Soviet Union was a distinct adversary, 
Berger said some have designated China, with its growing economy

	Berger said China is a country that has lifted tens of millions  
of its people from poverty and expanded personal freedoms. But it 
also is resisting political reform that is needed for long-term 
growth and stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our interest lies in protecting our security while encouraging  
China to make the right choices,'' Berger said. ``We can only do 
that if we continue a policy of principled, purposeful engagement 
with its leaders and people.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Gains New National Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a dozen years after the idea was  
proposed, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison River in western 
Colorado has become a national park. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton on Thursday signed the bill creating the first  
new national park in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the 30,000-acre Black Canyon of the Gunnison  
National Park is a canyon 2,900 feet deep and only 40 feet wide at 
its narrowest point. It is called the Black Canyon because sunlight 
reaches the canyon floor for only about an hour a day, said Sen. 
Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The canyon, about 250 miles southwest of Denver, became a  
national monument in 1933. It is renowned for trout fishing in the 
Gunnison River, rock climbing on the sheer canyon walls and hiking 
in surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a statement, said it was ``a true national  
treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This bipartisan bill demonstrates once again that preserving  
our environment for future generations is a cause that transcends 
party lines,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black Canyon is the first new national park since the creation  
in 1994 of the Joshua Tree and Death Valley parks in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Colorado residents began pitching the idea of a national  
park for the Black Canyon in the 1980s as a way to boost tourism 
for the canyon, which now gets about 230,000 visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The park is to be jointly managed by the Bureau of Land  
Management and the National Park Service. Of the 7,000 acres being 
added to the former national monument, 4,400 will be managed by the 
bureau as wilderness.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq After-Hour Quotes Start Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market plans to stick to its  
schedule and will extend operations of its stock quote ticker 
beginning Monday to accommodate after-hours traders, it was 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticker provides the stock price information that scrolls  
across the bottom of television screens and is distributed to 
millions of investors via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Nasdaq officials said the extension might be  
delayed for third time to allow stock brokers and dealers more time 
to upgrade computer systems to adjust to changes stemming from 
after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Nasdaq said broker-dealers who are unable to update their  
systems in time would be granted waivers from some regulations 
related to the new extended hours. ``Recognizing the legitimate 
technological constraints of these market participants, a brief 
deferral of trade-reporting requirements between the hours of 5:15 
p.m. and 6:30 p.m. has been sought and obtained from the Securities 
and Exchange Commission,'' Nasdaq said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Confusion arose late Thursday when a news release posted on  
Nasdaq's Web site announced there would be a delay until Nov. 15 to 
allow broker-dealers more time. However, Nasdaq spokesman Scott 
Peterson said the statement was prematurely released and that a 
decision had yet to be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq initially planned to extend its ticker hours on Oct. 4,  
but that was delayed until Oct. 11, while the plan awaited approval 
from the SEC. After the SEC gave the go-ahead, Nasdaq pushed back 
the date until Oct. 25 to give brokers and security dealers time 
for computer system upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq plans to keep its system open until 6:30 p.m. Eastern  
time from 5:15 p.m. Late quotes also are planned for the system 
that reports trades on shares listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Both systems currently stop distributing quotes at 5:15 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in after-hours trading sessions scattered across a  
number of different markets -- primarily on electronic 
communications systems, or ECNs -- has prompted calls for the 
extension of hours of centralized stock information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq last month offered to extend the hours of its ticker to  
address that need. A week later, the organization that runs the 
NYSE's ticker also agreed to extend its ticker hours because the 
Chicago Stock Exchange, which trades NYSE listed stocks for 
regional customers, will soon keep its market open until 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE and Nasdaq are also planning extended sessions, but not  
until next year.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Held on Calif. Bus for Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) -- Eight elderly passengers say they  
became ill after they were kept on a bus for up to four hours by a 
driver who got lost and refused to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orange County Transportation Authority bus was taking  
passengers from the Leo Fessenden Adult Day Health Care Center to 
their homes on Tuesday. Some threw up and complained of back pain 
from being confined for so long, said Bill White, the center's 
program director. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was one individual -- an Alzheimer's patient -- who threw  
up all over the bus. When he got home, they had to carry him off 
the bus,'' White said Thursday. ``It's terrible, the abuse these 
people suffered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White said the driver received the wrong address of one of the  
passengers and drove around trying to find it until one woman 
finally talked the driver into stopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation authority spokesman John Standiford confirmed the  
passengers' account of the trip, saying the driver received the 
wrong address due to a computer error. 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged, ``there could have been better ways of handling  
the situation, rather than driving around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver has been put on paid leave pending an investigation  
and ``older, veteran drivers'' will take over the route, said Dave 
Simpson, another authority spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, whose identity was not released, works for Laidlaw  
Transit, a private company contracted by the authority to provide 
specialized bus service. Laidlaw referred inquiries to the 
transportation authority. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the third time this year that elderly passengers using the  
special bus service have reported similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a driver was arrested for punching an  
Alzheimer's patient who unbuckled her seat belt and walked around 
the bus while it was moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months ago, an elderly man was on a bus for four hours and  
needed to go to the bathroom. The driver refused to stop and told 
the man to use a tin can, White said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Plant To Boycott Mitsubishi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The managers of 15 U.S. mutual funds  
announced Friday they are joining a boycott against Japan's 
Mitsubishi Co. to protest its plans to build a new salt factory on 
a Mexican lagoon used by gray whales for birthing. 
</P>
<P>
	The area where Mitsubishi operates the world's largest salt  
evaporation plant in conjunction with the Mexican government -- and 
where they are planning to build another $150 million plant -- is 
also Latin America's largest biosphere reserve and the winter 
refuge of the gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
	The whales spend their summers feeding in the Bering Sea and the  
Gulf of Alaska and swim to the San Ignacio Lagoon on the Baja 
California peninsula to breed during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors' decision ``sends a wake-up call to Mitsubishi  
that a whole community of investors thinks that their environmental 
performance is so bad that they don't want to invest in the 
company,'' said Jared Blumenfeld of the International Fund for 
Animal Welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitsubishi boycott is supported by the Calvert Group,  
Citizens Funds, Crown Futures, Domini Social Investments, Everest 
Asset Management, First Affirmative Financial Network, Global 
Environment Fund, Green Century Fund, Miller/Howard Investments, 
MMA Praxis, Parnassus, Pax World Fund, Prentiss Smith &AMP; Co., 
Trillium Asset Management and Walden Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups have launched an international campaign to  
prevent the expansion. In July, 34 distinguished scientists signed 
an open letter protesting the expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors' support for IFAW's ``Don't Buy It'' campaign  
against the company ``will start a movement by other investors to 
think twice before they invest in Mitsubishi,'' Blumenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Brumm, executive vice president for Mitsubishi  
International, said the company's plans are compatible with the 
environment and that the investors backing the campaign did not 
have all the facts on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The saltworks would pump 6,600 gallons out of the lagoon each  
second and flood more than 115 square miles to create evaporation 
pools, the scientists said.

<HEADLINE> Canadiens' Hackett Expected Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal Canadiens goaltender Jeff Hackett was  
expected to start Saturday night in Toronto after missing only one 
game with a bruised shoulder and back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Karl Dykhuis, acquired Wednesday from Philadelphia  
for future considerations, was expected to make his Canadiens' 
debut in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	But right wing Dainius Zubrus joined the Canadiens' already  
lengthy injury list with a hip pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett was injured when he was run over by Steve Webb while  
playing the puck alone the sideboards during Montreal's 4-2 loss to 
the New York Islanders last Monday. He sat out a 2-1 loss to the 
Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Zubrus did not make the trip to Toronto, nor did fourth-line  
wing Aaron Asham, who will miss a second game with a sore back. 
</P>
<P>
	With Zubrus out, the Canadiens are expected to promote Martin  
Rucinsky to their top line with center Saku Koivu and wing Brian 
Savage, who has nine goals in as many games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's practice, the second line had Craig Darby centering  
for Scott Thornton and Trevor Linden. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadiens returned goaltender Mathieu Garon and defenseman  
Stephane Robidas to Quebec of the AHL.

<HEADLINE> Wizards' Strickland Is Absent Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington Wizards point guard Rod Strickland,  
fined and suspended for an exhibition game this week over an 
unexcused absence, was not at practice again Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought until he got his head squared, I didn't want him to  
be out there,'' said coach Gar Heard, who spoke to Strickland by 
phone Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Heard said he didn't know where Strickland was and didn't ask.  
Heard said Strickland would be with the team Saturday for an 
exhibition game against Cleveland at Baltimore, but would not say 
whether Strickland would play. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was fined and suspended for Thursday night's game at  
Cleveland after missing practice Wednesday. Strickland had been 
allowed to skip Tuesday's practice to attend a funeral in New York, 
then called the Wizards' offices Wednesday to say that he'd missed 
his fight home. The Wizards did not release the amount of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	As to why Strickland still wasn't around Friday, Heard wouldn't  
say. He referred questions to general manager Wes Unseld. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not at liberty to tell you what went on with him  
personally,'' Heard said. ``Wes is going to handle it at his end 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unseld refused to comment, other than to say that the matter was  
being handled ``in-house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Rod Strickland's agent, David Falk, were not  
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland has been a standout performer for the Wizards since  
joining the team in 1996, but his three seasons in Washington have 
been clouded by a drunken driving conviction, a fight with a 
teammate in a hotel room, routine tardiness at practices and games, 
and a poor diet that sometimes has him getting sick during games. 
He also is scheduled to appear in court on another drunken driving 
charge next week.

<HEADLINE> Panel Rejects Primary Date Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iowa and New Hampshire will have the kickoff  
of the Democratic presidential selection process all to themselves 
after a panel refused Friday to allow four other states to move 
their contests into February behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But the special status of Iowa and New Hampshire is likely to  
come under increasing fire when the Democratic Party starts 
wrestling with rules for the 2004 elections because of building 
resentment from other states. 
</P>
<P>
	A rules panel of the Democratic National Committee denied  
requests from Arizona, Michigan, South Carolina and Washington 
state to move their presidential primaries or caucuses into 
February. They sought the change to save money and stay competitive 
with state Republican parties that have moved events into February. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Democratic Party allows only Iowa and New Hampshire to  
hold caucuses or primaries before March 7 without penalty. The 
Republican National Committee does not set such limits, and state 
Republicans have taken advantage of the freedom by moving several 
other state events into February. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the panel decided to allow Iowa to move its leadoff  
caucuses to Jan. 24 and New Hampshire to move its 
first-in-the-nation primary to Feb. 1. But it decided Friday to 
hold the line there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're continuing the fight that the Democratic Party has been  
carrying out for the last decade to keep this primary process from 
expanding into a permanent election,'' said Jim Roosevelt, 
co-chairman of the rules panel. 
</P>
<P>
	States have been jockeying for earlier positions on the calendar  
-- and increased influence -- ever since California decided earlier 
this year to move up to March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Liz Smith, a panel member and supporter of Vice President Al  
Gore, said she had checked with the Gore campaign and was told that 
changing the schedule at this late date would disrupt the campaign 
schedule and spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Wyche, a spokesman for Bill Bradley, said the former New  
Jersey senator's campaign would make the best of whatever primary 
schedule was set. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, South Carolina's Democratic primary will be March  
9, and Arizona and Michigan will hold their primaries March 11. 
Washington state had requested a Feb. 29 primary and a March 7 
caucus, but state party officials say their plans are ``up in the 
air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC plans to begin examining the 2004 primary process at a  
Nov. 20 hearing. The RNC also is looking into the process, and the 
nation's secretaries of state are lobbying for a system of rotating 
regional primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., complained at the meeting that Iowa  
and New Hampshire are ``in a monopoly position.'' He said many 
states' Democrats are at a disadvantage ``all because of this 
cockamamie privilege for two states.''

<HEADLINE> Publisher Halts George W. Bush Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Publication of a new book about Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush has been suspended while the publisher resolves 
questions about the author's background, including a report that 
the writer had served a prison term on a felony charge. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Martin's Press had heavily promoted the book, particularly a  
chapter that alleged, citing anonymous sources, that Bush had been 
arrested for cocaine possession in 1972 and that the record of the 
arrest had been expunged as a favor to his father. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News reported this week that J.H. Hatfield,  
author of ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of an 
American President,'' was paroled from a Texas prison in 1993 after 
serving time for a felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield told the newspaper it was a case of mistaken identity.  
</P>
<P>
	St. Martin's Press issued a statement Thursday saying it had  
stopped all sales, promotion and other publishing activities for 
the book and was notifying booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get to the bottom of this. We just don't know  
what to think at this point. We are struggling,'' Sally Richardson, 
president of the trade division of St. Martin's Press, told The New 
York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The book alleges that Bush was arrested for cocaine possession  
in 1972 but the matter was dropped after he performed community 
service arranged by his father, former President Bush. The book 
also alleges that a judge expunged any record of the arrest from 
court records at the request of the senior Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the front-runner for the race for the Republican  
presidential nomination, has called the allegations ``science 
fiction'' and ``totally ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times said that the Department of Criminal Justice  
in Texas had records showing a James H. Hatfield was convicted in 
1988 of solicitation of capital murder and served five years in a 
Texas prison. It said J.H. Hatfield's first name was James. 
</P>
<P>
	The convicted felon, cited by the Dallas paper, had hired a hit  
man to use a car bomb to kill a former employer, according to 
published reports.

<HEADLINE> IOC Not Concerned About 2004 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee is not  
worried about efforts to fund the 2004 Olympics despite the 
cancellation of plans of an online gambling network that was seen 
as a key money maker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely not concerned,'' Jacques Rogge, head of the  
IOC coordination commission for the Athens games, said Friday 
following three days of meetings with organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The online gambling program was called off by Premier Costas  
Simitis on Wednesday after it was fiercely criticized by opposition 
parties. Besides being a political embarrassment, it was seen as a 
possible blow to Greece's struggling efforts to pay for the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge also discussed another possible difficulty ahead for  
Athens organizers: keeping to the construction schedule for venues 
and other sites. Some of the projects have been turned over to 
government ministries, which could entangle the process in 
political bickering and Greece's bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge urged the government for a ``fast resolution'' on any  
outstanding details. Although about 75 percent of the venues 
already exist, some need to be modernized, Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge, IOC director-general Francois Carrard and sports director  
Gilbert Felli met with the secretariat involved in communication 
between the ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	In other points discussed during the visit:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Organizers promised the host broadcast company for the games  
would be set by December. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The IOC requested the creation of a special task force to  
study transportation issues in chronically crowded Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rogge urged continued attention to anti-terrorist measures.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Jolts Southern Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A strong tremor shook earthquake-rattled  
Taiwan today, damaging schools, blacking out thousands of homes and 
injuring about 200 people, officials and local media said. No 
deaths were immediately reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6.4-magnitude quake that struck near the southern city of  
Chiayi was not related to the stronger tremor that killed more than 
2,300 people one month ago in central Taiwan, seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage from today's quake was minor compared to the  
7.6-magnitude tremor on Sept. 21. Only a few buildings were damaged 
today, while thousands were destroyed last month. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 aftershocks followed today's tremor but only a few were  
strong enough to be felt, including 5.1- and 6-magnitude tremors, 
the Central Weather Bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiayi, with a population of 263,000 and located 180 miles south  
of Taipei, has been hit by several strong quakes in the past 
century, and seismologists have said it was due for another big one 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The island's main evening newspapers reported today that about  
200 people were taken to hospitals. Most suffered only minor 
injuries, TVBS television reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake knocked over bottles of chemicals in a lab at  
Chungcheng University in Chiayi, causing an explosion and a fire 
that was quickly extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything fell off the shelves and the glassware shattered  
and everyone ran out of the laboratory,'' one student told TVBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Another student told TVBS, ``I knew it wasn't a minor quake  
because the shaking kept getting stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A section of a high school collapsed, injuring seven people,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first floor of a shipping company's two-story building also  
gave way, but there were no reports of serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought one person was trapped in the building, and we were  
calling for him, but five minutes later he escaped through the back 
of the building,'' the company's owner told TVBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools in Chiayi closed and sent children home for the rest of  
the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90,000 homes lost power.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1906, a quake of magnitude 7.1 hit near Chiayi, killing 1,258  
people. Another tremor, of 7.1 magnitude, killed 358 in the city in 
1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Located along the earthquake-prone Pacific Rim and crisscrossed  
by 51 fault lines, Taiwan is rattled by scores of earthquakes each 
year, most harmless. 
</P>
<P>
	Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the total energy released  
by an earthquake, as indicated by ground motion recorded on 
seismographs. An increase of one digit in the scale represents a 
tenfold increase in the strength of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
	An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a  
populated area.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A series of television ads running in  
Washington and New Hampshire and mocking the Democratic

	More than half of the council's advisory board -- 13 of 23 -- have  
endorsed Bush, and several RLC leaders are raising money for Bush 
or chairing his state campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads are not covered by federal election laws since they do  
not specifically urge viewers to vote against Vice President Al 
Gore or Bill Bradley. But Democratic National Committee officials 
questioned the arrangement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These new revelations make it look like George W. Bush is  
using third-party groups to run ads more than a year before the 
election,'' said DNC spokeswoman Jenny Backus. ``The close ties 
between his campaign and the RLC are going to raise some serious 
questions and deserve close investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Miller, the council's executive director, denied any link  
between the $150,000 ad buy and the Bush campaign. The ads are 
running in advance of next week's New Hampshire debate between Gore 
and Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be a lot of talk about this debate,'' said  
Miller. ``What they're really going to debate is how much money 
they're going to spend on this program or that program. We think 
that it's important to highlight the issues that the Republican 
Leadership Council promotes: lower taxes, less government and more 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analysts say it will be the Texas governor who benefits.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he's a beneficiary of this campaign, since it's  
pointed at the two Democratic contenders,'' said Herbert Alexander, 
professor emeritus of political science at the University of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the RLC's board with ties to the Bush campaign  
include: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Michigan Gov. John Engler, chairman of the Bush campaign in  
that state and a member of the Texas governor's advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, honorary chairman of the  
campaign in his state. 
</P>
<P>
	-- New York Gov. George Pataki, who recently accompanied the  
Texas governor on a fund-raising tour of the Empire State. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Former Maine Gov. John McKernan, Bush's New England regional  
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Frank Murkowski, honorary chairman for the campaign in  
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, at least two members of the group's executive  
committee are top fund-raisers for Bush, known as Pioneers. They 
are lobbyist Wayne Berman, who temporarily left the campaign after 
federal investigators began examining his business dealings with 
ex-Connecticut state Treasurer Paul Silvester, and Sam Fox, head of 
a Missouri investment company. Former Massachusetts Gov. William 
Weld is an advisory board member and a Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	The council previously aired commercials ridiculing Gore's claim  
that he helped invent the Internet, as well his support of 
President Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction bill, which included tax 
increases largely aimed at the wealthiest Americans.

<HEADLINE> Pistons' Bison Dele Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons are thinking about placing  
center Bison Dele on the suspended list rather than the retirement 
list, a spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-11 Dele has filed retirement papers with the NBA  
office in New York, fulfilling a promise he made last month. 
</P>
<P>
	If he is placed on the suspended list, the Pistons could  
reinstate him if he changes his mind -- or trade him. If Dele goes 
on the retirement list, he will have to sit out the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman J.J. Carter said Friday that the team hadn't made  
a decision yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the start of the season, he would probably be on the  
suspended list,'' Carter said, although he added, ``he's pretty 
much said he's not coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pistons general manager Rick Sund said Thursday that the team  
was not surprised by Dele's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said from the beginning that his talent helps our club,''  
Sund said. ``If he wanted to come back, we would look at that 
situation very strongly. Or, if he wanted to be traded we could 
look at that if it was something that made sense for our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Lakers and at least one other team have inquired  
about Dele, The Detroit News reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, who averaged 10.5 points and 5.6 rebounds in 49  
regular-season games and 10.6 points and 6.4 rebounds in five 
playoff games last season, will forfeit the $5.67 million he stood 
to earn this season. He has five years and $36.45 million left on 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, formerly known as Brian Williams, was the team's  
highest-paid player. 
</P>
<P>
	Dele, 30, told the Pistons last month about his possible desire  
to retire. He missed training camp and preseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent two seasons in Detroit after signing as a free agent,  
and his relationship with his teammates was said to be strained.

<HEADLINE>  Italy's Prada Beats AmericaOne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Italy's Prada defeated San  
Francisco's AmericaOne in the challenger series for the America's 
Cup in a race marked by spinnaker problems for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	After racing was postponed Thursday because of gale-force wind,  
conditions were nearly perfect today for fast match racing among 
the syndicates fighting for the chance to take on New Zealand for 
sailing's most prized trophy next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most anticipated and exciting race of the regatta so far,  
with a breeze blowing a steady 15 knots, skipper Francesco de 
Angelis' beat the Americans at the start and built a lead of 24 
seconds by the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians hit trouble after rounding the mark, twice losing  
their spinnaker -- and their lead -- in the first downwind leg of the 
12.5 nautical mile course on Hauraki Gulf when a shackle snapped 
open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians made up two boat lengths on the next leg and were  
within striking distance of Paul Cayard's AmericaOne as they headed 
downwind towards the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Cayard looked to have held off Prada when, with just a few  
hundred yards to go, the giant green spinnaker burst and collapsed 
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada powered past and won the race by 17 seconds. AmericaOne  
raised another spinnaker but crossed the line with shreds of the 
torn old sail flapping from the top of the mast. 
</P>
<P>
	Cayard said tactical mistakes had been made on board AmericaOne  
and that Prada would have led all the way if it wasn't for their 
equipment problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``They deserved to win,'' Cayard said. ``They had some bad luck  
on the first run and I think it was appropriate that we had some 
bad luck on the last run. I'm happy for the accounting to be that 
way. For the time being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was still confident AmericaOne would be one the boats  
in the challenger final series. 
</P>
<P>
	It was AmericaOne's first loss of the regatta, and ended what  
had been a three-way leadership deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada went ahead on points but has yet to have their bye. New  
York challenger Young America is also undefeated, but must beat 
Prada in their next race, expected Saturday, to draw even, and go 
ahead of AmericaOne. 
</P>
<P>
	In other races, the Spanish Challenge defeated Young Australia  
by 37 seconds; America True defeated Stars and Stripes by 41 
seconds; Nippon defeated Le Defi Francais by 1 minute, 53 seconds; 
and Young America defeated Abradabra by 1 minute, 24 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of races on today was half that of previous days  
because of a local racing regatta on waters near the two challenger 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
	In more than 700 races over four months, the 11 challenger teams  
from seven countries score one point for each victory in the first 
of three round-robins, four points in the second and nine in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of a finals series will meet Team New Zealand in a  
best-of-9 regatta starting in February 2000 for the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Smith &AMP; Wesson Requiring Ethics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) --The nation's largest handgun  
manufacturer is requiring dealers in its collective advertising 
program to sign a code of ethics designed to prevent the illegal 
sale of guns. 
</P>
<P>
	More than three-quarters of Smith &AMP; Wesson's 3,500 registered  
dealers in the program have signed the agreement since the company 
began mailing them in mid-July, said Paul Pluff, manager of retail 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the code requires dealers to obey all  
firearms laws, sell only Smith &AMP; Wesson guns with safety locks and 
to closely monitor buyers to avoid illegal purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Springfield-based company warned that dealers will be  
dropped from collective advertisements and won't receive other 
marketing help if they run afoul of the law or fail to sign the 
agreement by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, because the company doesn't sell directly to retailers,  
stores need not belong to the advertising program to sell Smith &AMP; 
Wessons, spokesman Ken Jorgensen said after being asked about a 
report in Friday's Washington Post about the ethics code. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of negligent sales has been raised in several lawsuits  
that have been filed by various cities against the gun industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith &AMP; Wesson has been cleared in lawsuits that have been  
decided so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smith &AMP; Wesson has not been found negligent. We want to make  
sure that the people we are doing business with are in step with us 
and the law in that way,'' Jorgensen said.

<HEADLINE> Republican Leads Miss. Gov. Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Republican Mike Parker has moved narrowly  
ahead of Democrat Ronnie Musgrove in the race for governor, 
according to the Mason-Dixon Research poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, a former congressman, had 47 percent of the total  
compared to 42 percent for Musgrove with 11 percent of the voters 
still undecided, in the poll conducted earlier this week. The poll 
had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the Nov. 2 election will succeed Gov. Kirk  
Fordice, the state's first Republican governor since 
Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 605 likely voters was commissioned by media outlets  
including the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal in Tupelo and 
WAPT-TV in Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove, the lieutenant governor, had a 13 percentage point  
lead in June in a Mason-Dixon poll. Since then, Parker has steadily 
climbed in the poll, pulling even with Musgrove in September and 
passing him in the most recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi is one of three states electing governors this year.  
Louisiana holds an open primary on Saturday in which Republican 
Gov. Mike Foster is given a shot at winning a second term without a 
runoff. In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Paul Patton is favored to win 
a second term on Nov. 2.

<HEADLINE> Clinic Probed in Knight Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LADYSMITH, Wis. (AP) -- A clinic is under investigation for  
failing to tell police about a gunshot wound after Indiana coach 
Bob Knight accidentally shot a friend while hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusk County Sheriff Dean Meyer said Friday he is awaiting  
reports from a state conservation warden, who is looking into the 
actions of the Ladysmith clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sure we will bring it to a conclusion and find out why  
and make sure it doesn't happen again,'' Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Mikunda, 49, of Exeland, was treated Oct. 12 at  
Marshfield Clinic-Ladysmith Center after being shot in the back and 
upper shoulder when Knight's 20-gauge shotgun accidentally 
discharged as he attempted to aim at a grouse, the state Department 
of Natural Resources said. 
</P>
<P>
	A game warden said Friday that Knight did not accompany Mikunda  
to the clinic and returned home to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight did not immediately return a telephone message left at  
his office Friday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wisconsin law, doctors must report all gunshot wounds to  
law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ladysmith clinic's medical director, Dr. Doug DeLong, said  
the physician who treated Mikunda was not aware that a wound from 
shotgun pellets needed to be reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikunda was struck by 16 pellets, the DNR said. The clinic  
treated him and he went home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any type of gunshot wound is a serious situation. I would  
think they would have reported it to us and would know they have 
the obligation to report it,'' Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight failed to report the accident. He also was cited for  
failure to report a hunting accident and for hunting without a 
nonresident small game license in 1999 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNR said the fines for each of the three citations is $165.

<HEADLINE> GOP Embraces Budget Cut Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republican leaders embraced a 1.4  
percent across-the-board cut in federal agency budgets Friday to 
keep spending bills from eating into Social Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, White House officials used budget talks with  
lawmakers to propose a new savings plan of their own: a tax on 
tobacco companies triggered if teen-age smoking rises, said 
participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The across-the-board cut, opposed by President Clinton, adds one  
more point of contention to the fight between the White House and 
Congress as the two sides struggle over unfinished spending 
measures for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders said that under their plan, aimed at saving $4.5  
billion this year, agency heads would be asked to weed out waste, 
fraud and abuse from their budgets. No programs covered by the 13 
annual spending bills would be exempted, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is going to probably complain we're going to  
hurt all these vulnerable people,'' said House Budget Committee 
Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, one of the plan's proponents. ``But 
this is a great opportunity for us ... to begin to root out the 
duplication and wasteful programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said that under the  
proposal, when Pentagon officials testify before Congress, 
``instead of having two colonels hold your paper, you'll have only 
one major.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not affected would be the salaries of members of Congress. Since  
1981, the money for their pay comes from a part of the federal 
budget not controlled by the spending bills. The rest of Congress' 
budget, such as office expenses, would be subject to the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers voted themselves a 3.4 percent pay raise this year.  
That $4,600 increase will boost their salaries to $141,300 
beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's payroll would be affected, but individual  
federal workers' salaries could not be cut because they are set by 
law. Payroll savings could be achieved by not filling positions of 
civil servants who quit or retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Also not affected would be Social Security, Medicare and other  
benefits paid by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be up to agency officials to decide where the  
reductions would come from. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Clinton threatened to veto legislation making  
across-the-board reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials and Democrats say the cut would damage  
programs covering education, the environment and other areas while 
not achieving the GOP's goal of leaving Social Security surpluses 
alone. Citing Congressional Budget Office analyses, they say 
Republican spending plans dip into Social Security surpluses by at 
least $13 billion more than the GOP admits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bad idea that is unacceptable,'' said White House  
budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Social Security surpluses for other spending has been done  
by both parties for decades, and has no effect on the government's 
ability to pay Social Security benefits. Protecting those surpluses 
also does nothing to revamp the program, which many experts say is 
needed to prepare it for baby boomers' approaching retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, both parties have latched onto the issue as they  
position themselves as guardians of the giant pension program for 
next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, across-the-board reductions have not fared well  
in Congress, where they inevitably end up cutting programs that 
lawmakers like. 
</P>
<P>
	But GOP lawmakers have coalesced around their leaders' calls to  
protect Social Security's surpluses. They believe the strategy has 
made it harder for Clinton to find ways to pay for his spending 
demands, and helped burnish the GOP's image among the program's 
mostly elderly recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	The across-the-board reduction will be attached to a mammoth  
spending measure covering the departments of Education, Labor and 
Health and Human Services that Congress plans to send Clinton next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the last of the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal  
2000, which began Oct. 1, to be sent to Clinton. He has threatened 
to veto it -- one of six he has vetoed or might veto -- because it 
ignores his demands for $1.4 billion for hiring schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
	For further savings, that bill will also contain $1.3 billion in  
savings by delaying some grants to the National Institutes of 
Health and other health agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, White House budget chief Jack Lew told congressional  
budget writers about the administration's new plan for taxing 
tobacco companies. The levy, which he referred to as a penalty, 
would encourage cigarette makers to stop marketing their product to 
teen-agers, he said, according to participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Lew provided no details about the tax.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has conceded his plan to raise cigarette taxes by 55  
cents a pack cannot pass Congress.

<HEADLINE> Heaters Recalled for Fire Hazard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Holmes Products Corp. is recalling 45,000  
portable heaters with improperly positioned thermostats that can 
cause fires, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``wide-angle'' Model HFH-297 heaters, made in 1998 and sold  
by mass merchandisers through July, are about 12 inches high and 
shaped like a half circle, with white fronts, gray backs and two 
knobs on top. The date code, which includes ``98,'' is on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should immediately stop using the heaters and call  
Holmes toll free at 1-888-227-8936 for information on how to get a 
refund, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said. The Web site 
http://www.holmesproducts.com also has information. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, of Milford, Mass., received 11 reports of the units  
overheating and catching fire, the commission said. No injuries 
were reported.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Reaches Union Settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After seven months of often tense negotiations,  
Dow Jones &AMP; Co. has settled a dispute over retirement benefits with 
the union representing reporters and editors at The Wall Street 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Paul Steiger told employees Friday that he will stay on as  
the Journal's managing editor. CNN had been courting Steiger to 
head up its business news operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over retirement benefits had left Journal employees  
working without a contract for nearly two months. It also led to 
picketing by staffers and angry speeches by two senior reporters at 
the company's annual shareholders' meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement with the Independent Association of Publishers'  
Employees/CWA Local 1096 calls for wage increases totaling 9.5 
percent over three years and a company contribution of up to 12 
percent of an employee's salary to pension plans. The pact still 
needs the approval of the union's 2,400 members. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest disagreement was over the size of Dow Jones' pension  
contributions, which the company wanted to decrease. Under a 
previous plan, Dow Jones contributed 15 percent of an employee's 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones chairman Peter Kann and general counsel Peter Skinner  
sent a note to employees Friday saying: ``While the negotiations 
that led to last night's agreement have been lengthy and sometimes 
difficult, we think that both sides here have achieved their key 
objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other protests from Journal reporters over the summer included  
refusing to appear on CNBC, which has an arrangement with Dow 
Jones, and bombarding Dow Jones executives with e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Paul Steiger, managing editor of The Wall Street  
Journal, told his staffers at a regular morning meeting that he 
would stay at the newspaper, Dow Jones spokesman Richard Tofel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN had been trying to recruit Steiger to head up the network's  
business news operations, a post left vacant by the departure of 
Lou Dobbs in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Tofel declined to discuss details of Steiger's negotiations with  
CNN, and a spokeswoman for CNN also declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Sues Internet Pharmacies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Illinois has filed suit against four online  
pharmacy firms, saying they aren't licensed to practice in the 
state and therefore can't send drugs here. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Thursday in circuit court by Attorney General  
Jim Ryan, seeks to block the Internet pharmacies from doing 
business with Illinois residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prescription medicines should only be dispensed under the care  
and supervision of properly licensed doctors and pharmacies,'' Ryan 
said. He said the Web businesses ``were ignoring the law and 
putting any consumer who has a computer and a modem at risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association and two state doctor and  
pharmacist groups are supporting the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Named as defendants were ExpressMed Services Co. and Express  
Today Inc. of Chandler, Ariz.; M.D. Healthline of Phoenix; DVM 
Enterprises Inc. of Midlothian, Va., and Male Clinic of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Henglefelt, owner of Plaza United Pharmacy, which dispenses  
drugs through M.D. Healthline, said he did not know of a law 
blocking his firm from Illinois sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a law could be produced that is correct, we would stop  
selling in Illinois,'' Henglefelt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said he filed suit after his aides surfed the Internet to  
determine if prescription drug Web sites verified the health status 
of their customers as claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his staffers, then pregnant, was able to get a seller to  
ship her Viagra from out of state, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Coles of the Coalition for Consumer Rights said she had  
concerns about cutting patients off from low-cost sources of drugs 
but also noted she had heard of problems arising from Internet 
sales.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley Sues Over Web Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A rose called by any other name might smell as  
sweet, but for a financial services giant, having to come up with 
another Web address because someone else owns the one it wants just 
stinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. is suing the 17-year-old  
creator of the http://www.msdwonline.com site, saying the Web address 
infringes on the company's trademarks and asking a judge to stop 
him from using it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Wong of Hillsborough, Calif., said his site, ``Mud Sweat's  
Downhill World,'' is named after the store that sold him his 
mountainbike, Mud, Sweat and Gears. The similarity to Morgan 
Stanley's main site, http://www.msdw.com, was just a coincidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in its lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,  
Morgan Stanley says the address was targeted specifically in hopes 
of getting the company to pay up to buy the domain name back. 
</P>
<P>
	A company set up by the boy's father, Sau Wong, has registered  
dozens of domain names, many using the names of investment banks, 
including jpmorganonline.com and goldmansachsdirect.com, The New 
York Times reported today. The company, Smart Ideas, registered 
www.msdwonline.com in May, not long before Morgan Stanley decided 
that msdwonline should be the domain name for its new online 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	In a motion filed this week, Morgan Stanley said ``the defendant  
in this case has targeted MSDW and the New York investment banking 
community with particular precision and malice.'' Morgan Stanley 
says the boy's bicycle-themed page didn't even appear until after 
the lawsuit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley said it had been willing to pay Ivan Wong $10,000  
to buy the name back, with one official describing the offer as ``a 
nice bag of money'' for a teen-age boy. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the company received a demand for $75,000, and when  
Morgan Stanley balked, it got a message from the boy's father, 
saying, ``you are not dealing with a kid,'' the newspaper reported. 
The company withdrew its offer and filed suit Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The company considers the case to be an example of  
``cybersquatting,'' the practice of registering domain names in 
hopes of selling them to companies that have a commercial use for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Samuelson, a professor of law at the University of  
California at Berkeley, told the newspaper a federal law is 
intended to stop cybersquatters from diluting the value of 
established trademarks. But Morgan Stanley doesn't have as strong a 
case, she said, because MSDW is relatively new and not that famous. 
Morgan Stanley merged with Dean Witter in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Drug Use Down in U.S., Up in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Illegal drug use is falling in the United  
States but rising sharply in Europe, U.S. officials say. The amount 
of drugs seized in Europe more than doubled this year as South 
American traffickers targeted the continent. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's chief drug policy adviser,  
is holding a series of drug summits across Europe next week to 
address the problem. He is also pushing for a drug-free Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-drug authorities classify 13 million Americans as current  
illegal drug users, compared with 25 million in 1980. Cocaine use 
has dropped the most dramatically, from 5.7 million in 1985 to 1.8 
million, according to McCaffrey's Office of National Drug Control 
Policy. A current drug user is anyone who used drugs at least once 
in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparable statistics are not available for most of Europe,  
although surveys taken in recent years show cocaine use ranging 
from 0.5 percent of the population in Belgium to 3.3 percent in 
Spain. Ross Deck of McCaffrey's office, who has been meeting with 
European officials tracking drug use, said there is ample evidence 
that drug use is increasing across Europe although countries are 
only beginning to compile statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cocaine is looking for new markets,'' McCaffrey said at a news  
conference Thursday, and it's finding them in Europe, where 
attitudes toward some narcotics differ from those in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Narcotics Control Board, in its latest report,  
cited increased demand for illegal synthetic drugs in Europe and 
said heroin use is up in some countries. It said preventing illegal 
drug use is difficult on a continent ``where it is increasingly 
being viewed as an almost normal cultural phenomenon.'' It said 
cocaine use is not seen as a major public health problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The board, based in Vienna, Austria, said Europe is not only a  
major destination for drugs, including heroin, but an emerging 
producer of marijuana and illegal synthetic drugs such as 
``ecstasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said Americans need European help in stopping the flow  
of 700 metric tons of cocaine a year from Colombia, Bolivia and 
Peru, about half of which still ends up on U.S. streets. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey leaves Sunday for meetings with officials in Britain,  
Belgium, Portugal and France. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his message will be that cocaine is not a soft drug and  
that Europeans should contribute more in the battle against 
narcotics from Latin America. He credited good police work by the 
Spanish and Dutch for much of a sharp increase in cocaine seizures 
this year, but he said the increase in busts every year for six 
years ``is indicative of a changing problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said Europeans should contribute more to alternative  
economic development in the Andean region and step up efforts to 
stop drug production and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure they get the point that they are now the  
target of a drug threat that is searching for new customers,'' 
McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another focus of his trip will be on the use of performance  
enhancing drugs in sports, McCaffrey said, leading up to a Nov. 
14-17 Australian sports summit aimed at eliminating drug use by 
athletes in the 2000 summer Olympics in Sydney and the winter games 
in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to come up with some notion on how to create a level  
playing field, where competitors don't think you have to chemically 
engineer the human body, or you can't win,'' McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, in an interview, said his foreign travel and his  
participation in a planned Western Hemisphere 34-nation drug summit 
Nov. 9-10 is justified by the need for international cooperation to 
stop the flow of drugs into the United States. His top goal, he 
said, is to educate and enable American youth to reject illegal 
drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interdependent world,'' he said. ``Clearly, you've got  
to have a cooperative relationship'' with other countries on money 
laundering, trafficking, doping in sports and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey's office estimates that 80 to 130 metric tons of  
cocaine is available for consumption in Europe, with expected 
seizures this year of 40 to 50 metric tons. In the first six months 
of the year, seizures were already double those of last year, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report estimates that 57 percent of the South American  
cocaine flowing into Europe lands in Spain or Portugal, 15 percent 
in the Netherlands, 6 percent in Belgium and 7 percent at unknown 
entry points.

<HEADLINE> Stunning Retrospective Shows Ensor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Fifty years after his time, a major  
show on James Ensor reveals just how much ahead of his time the 
Belgian painter really was. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of his life, his genius was ignored, even ridiculed by  
critics. As recently as a dozen years ago, Belgium let go of 
Ensor's absolute masterpiece without much ado, with the drone of 
indifference drowning out the few shrieks of outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ensor, who died in 1949, gets some of his due back with a  
spectacular retrospective show at the Beaux-Arts Museum in central 
Brussels that runs through Feb. 13. It has received rave reviews 
since the Sept. 24 opening. 
</P>
<P>
	In the biggest show of Ensor work since the 1920s, his breath of  
talent is on full show and will satisfy anyone with a taste for the 
moody seascapes of William Turner, the vivid colors and strokes of 
van Gogh, and Edvard Munch's angst-ridden penchant for the macabre. 
</P>
<P>
	The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., refused to allow his  
1888 magnum opus ``Christ's Entry Into Brussels'' to travel, but 
the exhibition's organizers could well have dispensed with the 
reproduction that now only distracts from the wealth of his other 
work in the show. 
</P>
<P>
	The show centers on his most creative period, from 1885 to 1895,  
when masks, skulls, daring colors and unconventional vision made 
him one of the greatest precursors of 20th-century art. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discover the greatest artist. It is this painter whom this  
fascinating and exciting retrospective most truly celebrates,'' 
gushed William Packer, art critic of London's Financial Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps we are lucky Ensor rarely heard such glowing comments  
since he thrived on mainstream rejection. When he was made a baron 
in a belated sign of recognition, he had long lost his zest to defy 
society and even much of his inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so in the 1880s, when he turned the attic above his mother's  
curiosity shop on the North Sea coast in Ostend into a cauldron of 
artistic renewal. Alfred H. Barr, the founder of New York's Museum 
of Modern Art, said Ensor was at the time perhaps the most 
progressive artist, bar none, from a list that includes van Gogh, 
Gauguin and Cezanne. 
</P>
<P>
	He experimented with light in such works as the 1887 ``Adam and  
Eve Expelled From Paradise'' and ``Carnival on the Beach'' of the 
same year. He used masks and their power of expression in the 
1883's ``Scandalized Masks,'' and showed his fascination with death 
in the 1885 work, ``Skeleton Watching Curiosities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got the idea for his masks from those on display in his  
mother's shop and marveled at their symbolic meaning. He painted 
them for every occasion and often highlighted their escapism -- to 
be what one is not without being recognized -- as he condemned their 
inherent falsehood. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his death, he headed the jury of Ostend's Mardi Gras mask  
festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Masks often shared the scene with skulls and bones. Death  
fascinated him. His 1889 ``Self-portrait With Skull,'' in which his 
face is eaten away with decay, exposing the bare bones, shockingly 
contrasts with his youthful ``Self-Portrait With Masks,'' painted a 
decade later. 
</P>
<P>
	His work held the germs of impressionism, expressionism and even  
surrealism all at once. Add to that the thrill to outrage, and even 
Dada is well represented: viewers were thrilled by his ribald humor 
of puking art critics, defecating politicians and flatulent 
magicians. At the same time bourgeois ladies marveled at the 
painterly opulence of the ``Oyster Eater'' and the inner light 
``Somber Lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1893, the conservative bourgeoisie could not care less. When,  
in a fit of depression, Ensor offered to sell his entire works for 
a measly $210, including many of his masterworks, he found no 
taker. He was derisively considered a painter of seashells. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1987, things had changed to the extent that the authorities  
could not hold on to ``Christ's Entry Into Brussels,'' and it was 
whisked away to Malibu for a sum reportedly in excess of $10 
million. Ensor's paintings are now scattered as far as Fort Worth, 
Texas and Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps it is the artist's final irony that he now graces the  
100 franc bill, Belgium's most commonly used bank note, worth $2.50 
in American money.

<HEADLINE> Norris Gets Wish To Fight Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson's comeback story is becoming  
increasingly familiar. So are the plans of those who enter the ring 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlin Norris knows what he has to do to win Saturday night when  
he meets the former heavyweight champion in Tyson's latest comeback 
bid: Follow the game plans of Evander Holyfield and Francois Botha, 
and hope he doesn't get hit with a big punch. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked for Holyfield, and it was working for Botha before a  
right hand that crashed into his face brought a sudden halt to the 
Jan. 16 fight in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Botha fought him the right way for the time he fought him,''  
Norris said. ``He did a lot of things right and he didn't stay in 
front of him until that last round. He fought Tyson the way you're 
supposed to fight Tyson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, a former cruiserweight champion with a mediocre record  
in the heavyweight division, gets the chance of his boxing career 
when he meets Tyson in a scheduled 10-round fight at the MGM Grand 
hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a fight Norris sought a decade ago, when Tyson was at his  
prime and Norris saw an opportunity that seemed destined never to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a fight I've always wanted,'' Norris said. ``We're  
both the same height, one's a puncher and one's a boxer. I've 
always thought it would be a very good fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers here don't, however, making Tyson a 12-1 favorite in  
the fight that will be shown on the Showtime cable network 
beginning sometime before midnight EDT, but after the end of the 
first World Series game. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact Tyson is not on pay-per-view is an indication both that  
the intrigue of his fourth comeback has not risen to the level of 
previous comeback bids and that the 34-year-old Norris is not 
considered a serious contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, however, remains an attraction, though it is as much for  
his unpredictability as his boxing skills these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``People love Mike Tyson,'' said Dan Goossen, president of  
promoter America Presents. ``They love to see him win. They love to 
see him lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson weighed in officially Thursday at 223 pounds, which was  
his weight for the Botha fight. Norris weighed 218 pounds, two 
pounds less than when he stopped Pele Reid on June 26 in his only 
fight in 12 1-2 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am planning to bring a lot of pain,'' Tyson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Norris, 50-5 in his lengthy career, will try to avoid that pain  
by fighting Tyson from the outside, and tying him up when the two 
get inside. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not likely to pose a knockout threat himself, with the 27  
stoppages on his record coming mainly with an accumulation of 
punches in late rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson showed he hasn't lost his knockout punch against Botha,  
who was his first opponent since being banned from boxing for 
biting Holyfield's ears. Tyson has been inactive since, having to 
serve 3 1/2 months in a Maryland prison for assaulting two men 
following a minor traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has not gone the distance in a fight since a decision over  
Razor Ruddock eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he is going to hit me. I have to avoid the big bombs,''  
Botha said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson brought back his former lead trainer, Jay Bright, to help  
Tommy Brooks train him for Norris. He looked good in an open 
training session earlier this week, knocking down a sparring 
partner, and Brooks said his 33-year-old reflexes are coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The true confidence for Mike is the ability for him to step in  
the ring and hit and not be hit and that's what he's doing,'' 
Brooks said. ``He's landing and he's not taking shots and thus he 
is beginning to believe that he is good enough and that he can get 
it all back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, whose financial problems are well known, is getting  
somewhere between $7 million and $10 million for the fight, while 
Norris will earn $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If Tyson wins and looks good enough in doing so, his handlers  
want him to fight once again this year, in December in a 
pay-per-view bout. Though he has lost two of his last three fights 
and was losing badly to Botha when he knocked him out, Tyson still 
figures to be a force in a heavyweight division that pretty much 
begins and ends right now with Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	In another fight on the card, undefeated Diego Corrales will  
challenge another unbeaten fighter, Roberto Garcia, for Garcia's 
IBF junior lightweight title. Corrales is 28-0 and the No. 1 
challenger to Garcia, who is 32-0.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Beetles Threaten California Oaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT TAMALPAIS, Calif. (AP) -- Thousands of the state's majestic  
oak trees, already weakened by a mysterious disease, now face a 
second threat from bark-burrowing beetles killing the trees from 
the inside out. 
</P>
<P>
	Bewildered tree experts and stunned homeowners have watched as  
trees wither in a matter of weeks. The beetles have claimed 
thousands of live oaks and tan oaks along a 200-mile swath of 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one knows what's going on. Not even the state,'' said Mitzi  
Staley, a gardener for the University of California's extension 
service. ``We don't know if it's a cyclical thing or a pollution 
thing because we haven't had anything like this for a long time. 
And once it starts, there's not much you can do about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two types of beetles are being blamed: the Western oak bark  
beetle, which burrows under the bark until it falls off, and the 
oak ambrosia beetle, which tunnels into the wood and deposits a 
fungus that clogs the trees' circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts aren't sure why the trees became sick in the first  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	One theory is that the tan oaks were somehow weakened by  
drought, El Nino or pollution and developed some kind of 
unexplained disease. Beetles then preyed on the weakened tan oaks, 
and eventually spread to the live oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Svihra, a researcher with the university extension  
service, called the problem an ``entomological blitzkrieg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This epidemic is critical for two reasons,'' he said. ``One,  
it makes the ecosystem unstable. Two, as trees die, each becomes 
fuel for fire. And fires can be extremely explosive in an area like 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few thousand trees out of California's 10 million acres of oak  
woodlands may seem insignificant. But the problem affects urban 
areas, too, disturbing a well-off coastal population whose property 
value has everything to do with trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a lot of well-heeled Marin County residents with  
hundreds of trees dying,'' said Bruce Hagen of the California 
Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Live oaks are almost emblematic of the state. They're durable  
trees that can grow many hundreds of years,'' he said. ``People 
have learned to love their oaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Moerdyke cut down 200 trees on his 140-acre ranch near  
Santa Cruz, and hand-sprayed several thousand more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The alternative would be losing all my trees,'' he said. ``I'm  
hopefully getting it under control.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From GOP Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from the Republicans' debate Friday:  

</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer:  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``But there's another important way we need to be involved and  
that's American values. In Tiananmen Square, Chinese students stood 
up, waving copies of our Declaration of Independence in the face of 
the People's Liberation Army. But we've got a policy towards China, 
not driven by the Declaration and its words, ``All men are created 
equal,'' but driven by trade -- big corporations calling the shots 
in the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. As president, I 
will end Most Favored Nation status for China immediately. The days 
of them playing us for suckers should be over.'' 

</P>
<P>
	-- ``There's nothing moral about taking the truck driver in  
Manchester, New Hampshire, who's working 18 hours a day to put food 
on his table, take his money and send it to the Soviet Union to 
subsidize some thug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes:  
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Well, the reason we have an education crisis in America is  
because education is a monopoly. Monopolies don't work in business. 
They don't work in education. Every American parent should have the 
freedom to send their child to the school they think best for that 
child. That means taking money from the Education Department, 
block-granting it back to states and municipalities with the 
proviso -- and this is what I'll do as president -- with the proviso 
that parents have genuine free choices to pick their own school, 
any school they wish.'' 

</P>
<P>

right. When that baby is conceived, that is a separate being

<HEADLINE> Chinese Emigre Actress Makes It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUZHOU, China (AP) -- On a drizzly day in an antique walled  
garden, a film crew fusses over cameras and lights packed into an 
ornate pavilion. Outside, a sound man hunches over his recorders, 
sheltered by a narrow verandah. 
</P>
<P>
	The director of ``Pavilion of Women'' calls for quiet, and actor  
Willem Dafoe, dressed in a gray, ankle-length Chinese robe, looks 
into the camera and speaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Love is never a sin. It's the greatest feeling in the world,''  
he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene is one of the last steps in a long, tough journey for  
Chinese actress Luo Yan, who is Dafoe's co-star as well as the 
movie's producer and co-screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Luo gave up a promising screen career in China to try  
to break into Hollywood. She earned a master's degree in theater 
but searched in vain for roles. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to get into an American movie, she decided, was to  
make it herself. 
</P>
<P>
	She worked as a secretary, started her own production company  
and wrote a script from an American novel. She showed it to dozens 
of backers before striking gold: Universal Pictures bought it and 
signed Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pavilion of Women,'' based on a Pearl Buck story set in 1937,  
uses as its backdrop Suzhou, an ancient silk-trading center famous 
for its wealth of classic houses and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	Luo plays Madame Wu, a wealthy landowner's wife with a very  
modern affliction -- a midlife crisis. She causes an uproar when she 
decides at 40 to free herself for a more intellectual life by 
finding her husband a concubine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe is an American missionary who falls in love with Madame Wu  
after being hired to tutor her son, who suffers a romantic crisis 
of his own over an arranged marriage. Directing is Hong Kong 
veteran Yim Ho, maker of the acclaimed ``The Day the Sun Turned 
Cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent day, the Ouyang Garden had been turned into the Wu  
family house. Power lines snaked around the garden's ponds and 
sculpted rocks, and rooms where mandarins once relaxed served as 
dressing rooms. Crew members sweating in the muggy rainy season 
heat exchanged instructions in Mandarin, Cantonese and English. 
</P>
<P>
	One pavilion was outfitted as a parlor where the missionary  
dazzles the Wu family by showing off the wonders of the modern age 
-- electric light and a hand-cranked phonograph. So little space was 
left over that director Yim had moved into the next room to follow 
the action by video monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice he had to call a halt to filming when midmorning traffic  
noise outside the garden ruined the illusion that the Wu house was 
in the tranquil countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	Luo said that being allowed to film in fragile, centuries-old  
sites wouldn't have been possible without her inside knowledge of 
China's arts bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think an American producer could have gotten all of  
these things approved,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Luo is businesslike about her goal. She wants a dramatic,  
American love story for a mainstream Western audience. All of the 
movie's dialogue is in English. 
</P>
<P>
	She isn't interested in imitating Chinese star directors Chen  
Kaige and Zhang Yimou. Their ``Farewell My Concubine'' and ``Raise 
the Red Lantern'' put China on the cinema map. But those slow, 
visually sumptuous Chinese-language epics were bigger hits with 
critics than with the ticket-buying public. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't an art house movie,'' Luo said as a technician  
touched up her makeup between scenes. ``I picked Pearl Buck because 
she is well-known. I don't have to sell her to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in China to missionary parents, Buck received a Pulitzer  
Prize in 1931 for her compassionate novel about Chinese life, ``The 
Good Earth.'' She was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 
1938. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a high-necked, jade-green silk gown, her hair pulled  
back in a matronly bun, Luo looked remarkably serene as she juggled 
acting and management roles -- and did it all in English, a language 
she could barely speak when she left China. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough job,'' she said. ``But as a teen-ager ... I  
worked in a textile factory for five years. That taught me to be 
mentally tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe said he took the role to work in China and to play a  
romantic hero -- a ``flat-out good man, the kind of character I 
don't get to play.'' He is better known as a tormented anti-hero, 
like the maimed thief in ``The English Patient'' or an ambivalent 
Christ in ``The Last Temptation of Christ.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that I am playing a Christian missionary, and I  
realize the political sensitivity of that,'' he said. ``I try to 
avoid making him religious. He's just a teacher, and a guy who runs 
an orphanage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving China for Boston University, Luo had won a  
theater award and appeared in ``The Girl in Red,'' winner in 1985 
of China's top film honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like I had reached a ceiling. I wanted to make myself  
better,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Luo runs a thriving Los Angeles import firm started to  
finance her moviemaking ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	To make ``Pavilion of Women,'' she called on old mainland  
connections, recruiting state-owned Beijing Film Studio, run by a 
former co-worker, as Universal's local partner. 
</P>
<P>
	That cut official fees by giving the movie the status of a  
Chinese production and eased access to work permits and Chinese 
talent. Eighty crew members are from Zhang Yimou's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget is, along with her age, something she won't discuss.  
Hugo Shong, her executive producer, would say only that the film's 
cost was well below $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``An American director would have to spend five times our budget  
to get this same look,'' Luo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmakers also imposed a punishing shooting schedule of  
just six weeks, working up to 18 hours a day even as summer rains 
flooded nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, we are working to maintain high-quality  
visuals and sound,'' said Yim, slumped in a chair watching Dafoe's 
plea for love played back on a video recorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Luo said Universal plans to use her hybrid U.S.-Chinese  
filmmaking formula to shoot three to five movies a year. 
</P>
<P>
	With her hard-won experience, she said, ``The next one will be  
easier.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Diggs Stays in the 'Groove' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It doesn't take much to figure out why Taye  
Diggs makes women swoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one look at his smooth, unblemished skin usually does it.  
Or his taut, lean muscular body. Or that steamy shower scene in 
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as he relaxes -- fully clothed -- in a pinstriped suit in a  
midtown hotel, the bespectacled Diggs professes not to understand 
what it is about him that makes women so hot and bothered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to intellectualize it, and you can't. ... A lot of it is  
the fact is that I don't feel like I'm worth someone screaming 
about,'' says one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful people. 
</P>
<P>
	What everyone's screaming about is a 29-year-old Rochester,  
N.Y., native who is fast becoming one of Hollywood's brightest new 
stars. His film debut in 1997 as Angela Bassett's sexy young 
Jamaican lover in ``Stella'' made him an instant star -- and a sex 
symbol. Since then, he's blazed the screen in ``Go'' and ``The 
Wood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his new film, ``The Best Man,'' Diggs plays a newly published  
author whose supposedly fictional book about love and romance 
threatens to wreak havoc on his best friend's nuptials as his old 
buddies try to decipher hidden clues about their own lives in the 
book. The Universal Pictures release opens Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The ensemble cast stars co-stars Nia Long, but Diggs gets top  
billing. Not bad for a struggling actor who was working at Tokyo 
Disneyland just a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never would have thought that I would be working with Nia  
Long or Morris Chestnut ... Ryan Phillipe, cats who I would read 
about in these magazines,'' Diggs says. ``I get to work with these 
people, and I'm still at a level where I still trip on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a far cry from his childhood in Rochester, where he and his  
four younger brothers and sisters lived in the gritty part of the 
city. Young Scott Diggs (Taye is his nickname) liked to dance 
around the house, and his mother, who now teaches drama at Indiana 
University, recognized star quality in her son and sent him to 
Rochester's School of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother said, 'You're talented, so go to school so you can  
work on this,'' he remembers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was upset because I wanted to go to a school that had  
sports. I wanted to play on the athletic teams and what not. But 
then I took all the classes -- I took dance classes, I took singing 
classes and acting classes and enjoyed doing them all equally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was then that the young Diggs began to develop as an  
entertainer. He also began to blossom as a young man and grew out 
of his awkward teen-age period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before that school, I was a nerd,'' he says. ``I wasn't very  
accepted, as far as a lot of the social groups are concerned, so I 
really found myself at that school. Friends that I have today, 
those relationships were formed there. It was a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the School of Arts, Diggs went to Syracuse University, and  
after he graduated, headed to New York City to pursue his acting 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Diggs landed roles here and there, including a part in the  
musical ``Carousel.'' But after working in New York for a year, he 
had a notion to see the world and so auditioned for a Caribbean 
cabaret bit at Tokyo Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	After his seven-month stint in Japan, Diggs hit pay dirt in 1996  
when he won the part of the landlord Benjamin Coffin III in the 
original cast of the Pulitzer and Tony award-winning musical 
``Rent.'' Like just about everyone else, Diggs had no idea the 
musical would become a Broadway blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hyped because it was a gig. At that point, I had told  
myself that I didn't want to sing again, so I was a little annoyed 
that I had to sing. But it was a job ... and I was ecstatic to be 
working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, when it blew up, that's when the excitement came. It was  
like my first little dose of fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his role in ``Stella,'' that put Diggs on the  
Hollywood map. It was a part for which his sexy good looks and 
chiseled body proved to be more of a draw than his acting 
abilities, including learning an accent that has people to this day 
believing he is a born and raised Jamaican. 
</P>
<P>
	Landing the role was a major coup for Diggs, who didn't think he  
had any hopes of getting it when he went in for his audition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember thinking, just go in there, do a good job so that  
the casting director knows you, and he'll keep you in mind for 
something else. And the director, he found something in me that he 
dug, and to this day, if I every win any Academy-type award, I will 
thank him, because if wasn't for him, I wouldn't be in the game 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diggs says he'll always remember his reaction when he found out  
he got the role. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just ended up jumping up and down on my bed, like pounding  
the bed so hard,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I kind of miss that. Like, I'll never have that again,  
because once you do that first movie, nothing can compare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides roles in the upcoming movies ``House on a Haunted  
Hill,'' ``Mary Jane's Last Dance'' and ``The Way of the Gun,'' 
Diggs also plans a return to the New York stage. He is set to star 
early next year in the off-Broadway version of the musical ``The 
Wild Party,'' based on a jazz-era poem by Joseph Moncure March. 
(Another version is planned for Broadway in April.) 
</P>
<P>
	But theater remains his true love.  
</P>
<P>
	``Theater, it's do or die,'' he says. ``You get out there, and  
it feeds you. ... It's truly acting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taye still lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side and rides the  
subway, enjoying life with actress-singer Idina Menzel, who was 
nominated for a Tony for her role of Maureen in ``Rent.'' The two 
met while appearing in the musical and have been dating ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have all the people I need in my life right now,'' Diggs  
says. ``I don't need anyone else. I have a really good friend, a 
best friend, I've got my girl and my family. And if I don't ever 
have another friend in life, I'm straight with that.''

<HEADLINE> Renault Eyes Global Auto Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Renault SA's alliance with Nissan Motor Co. will  
help the French automaker boost its share of the global market and 
possibly get back into the U.S., the company's top executive said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault, which bought a 37 percent stake in Nissan earlier this  
year, is looking to the Japanese company for lessons about about 
efficiency and quality, Renault chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer Louis Schweitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan, and specifically Nissan, are a benchmark of quality,''  
Schweitzer said. ``Clearly, we have things to learn from Nissan in 
our manufacturing processes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renault will not attempt to reintroduce its brand in the United  
States, a market it fled 12 years ago with a reputation for 
poor-quality cars, Schweitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the company will consider selling Renault vehicles  
in the United States under the Nissan brand name. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks came just days after Nissan's new chief operating  
officer sent by Renault, Carlos Ghosn, announced drastic measures 
to cut costs at the debt-ridden Japanese company by shutting down 
plants and shaving off 14 percent of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, 17 executives from Renault will be at  
Nissan, while 21 former Nissan executive will be working at 
Renault, Schweitzer said. He stressed, however, that the two 
companies will maintain their separate identities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an alliance, not a merger,'' Schweitzer said. ``We do  
not want to try to merge the French culture and the Japanese 
culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said Renault will use Nissan's worldwide  
administrative and sales network to help it enter markets such as 
Mexico, a country where it lost money and left in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer also said that Renault is not ready to inject more  
money into Nissan Diesel Motor Co., Nissan's ailing truck 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Diesel must solve its own debt problems first before the  
French automaker will consider possible cooperation with its own 
truck-making arm, Renault VI, he said.

<HEADLINE> Huang Soon May Be Telling His Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Justice Department official said Thursday  
night that the way soon may be clear for John Huang, a central 
figure in the campaign fund-raising investigation, to testify 
before a congressional committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has been conducting an espionage investigation of Huang.  
</P>
<P>
	While not saying that the espionage investigation is completed,  
the department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
the Justice Department no longer will oppose granting limited 
immunity from prosecution to Huang. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee led by Rep. Dan Burton,  
R-Ind., has been seeking Huang's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	But Huang's lawyer has set a grant of immunity as a condition  
for his client to testify to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	An immunity grant would make it extremely difficult for the  
government to prosecute Huang if it ever uncovered evidence of 
espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang, a former Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, has  
pleaded guilty in the probe of campaign finance abuses in the 1996 
presidential election. Huang in August admitted he had conspired to 
violate campaign finance laws and was sentenced to one year of 
probation and a $10,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Family Argues Over Finances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The ``scandalous behavior'' of some IOC  
members has ``tarnished the rings'' of the Olympic movement and 
made fund raising more difficult, according to an internal U.S. 
Olympic Committee memo inadvertently released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other confidential memorandums show the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee arguing over money with the USOC and scrambling to meet 
new and tougher conditions imposed by its bank because of the 
vote-buying scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC President Mitt Romney called the accidental release of the  
memos embarrassing to the USOC and possibly to some Olympic 
sponsors. The letters were disclosed Friday as the USOC prepared 
for a weekend board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents reveal squabbling in the Olympic family over the  
untangling of octopus-like financial relationships to satisfy a 
Bank of America demand to be repaid first out of Olympic 
sponsorship dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is financing Salt Lake City's 2002 Winter Games with a  
$130 million line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the memos reflect ``tough, hard'' negotiations  
hidden ``beneath the candy-coated shell'' of the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	In one memo, USOC lawyer Donis G. Walker attacked the  
unwillingness of the International Olympic Committee to admit fund 
raising was damaged by a scandal implicating one-fifth of its 
103-member body. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker blamed ``the scandalous behavior of some of their board  
members, which has tarnished the rings and made financing the games 
through corporate sponsorships more challenging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sent the letter to Salt Lake Olympic officials in August.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised by the harsh tone of your introductory  
comments regarding the IOC,'' responded Kelly Flint, senior vice 
president for marketing and legal affairs for the Salt Lake 
committee. ``We are unsure why you addressed them to us. If you 
wish, we can forward your letter to the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC asked for and received promises of ``priority'' access  
to hotel rooms, tickets, transportation and parking for the Salt 
Lake Olympics in exchange for granting the SLOC financial 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Salt Lake officials flatly turned down the USOC on other  
demands, including veto power over the budget and senior management 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is not something which found itself into the final  
agreement,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at issue was Salt Lake's refusal to contribute to a USOC  
image-building campaign by giving it $1 million worth of 
advertising the SLOC had with Time and Sports Illustrated 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	And Salt Lake maneuvered to avoid paying lucrative commissions  
to a company hired to salvage fund raising for the Utah Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC finally relented, Romney said, in exchange for more  
than $5.5 million worth of corporate goods and services from USOC 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Those value-in-kind donations were set to expire before the USOC  
could use them. The deal includes goods and services from Xerox, 
Panasonic, General Mills, McDonald's and Time-Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporate benefits should match what the SLOC expects to pay  
in commissions to International Management Group, the outside 
fund-raiser, so the deal ``ends up not costing us anything,'' 
Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, he said, is wrapping up concessions from the U.S. and  
international Olympic committees that will be worth tens of 
millions of dollars for the Salt Lake City Games.

<HEADLINE> Bears' Conway To Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Wide receiver Curtis Conway, who  
despite an ankle injury practiced earlier this week and was 
expected to return to the starting lineup, was scratched Friday by 
the Chicago Bears for Sunday's game with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Also declared inactive Sunday for the Bears (3-3) were  
quarterback Shane Matthews (hamstring), linebacker Sean Harris 
(ankle) and running back James Allen (knee). 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews and Conway also sat out last Sunday's loss to  
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews says he hopes to be able to return for next Sunday's  
game at Washington. Rookie Cade McNown makes his second NFL start 
in Matthews' place against the Buccaneers.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Clinton Wrangle Over Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House traded political charges with  
congressional Republicans today about budget negotiations, as both 
sides accused each other of spending Social Security surpluses and 
poisoning the atmosphere with political attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said Republicans were ``trying to accuse us of  
doing what they have done on the Social Security surplus. But I am 
committed to turn the other cheek until we see if we can work it 
out together.'' With a laugh, he added, ``I guess it's easier when 
you're not running for anything to do that.'' He went on to 
criticize Republicans for failing to approve his education 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration singled out Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House  
Republican whip, for particular criticism. ``Unfortunately there 
are some other forces, I think led by Representative DeLay, who has 
more of a political agenda, who likes to tell willing and waiting 
reporters that they'll bring us to our knees and things like 
that,'' presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said. ``It's much more 
difficult in that environment to get something done when they're 
just trying to score political points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Budget Director Jack Lew was expected at the  
Capitol, two days after his first session with leaders of the House 
and Senate appropriations committees. Since then, the two sides 
have done little but accuse each other of spending Social Security 
surpluses, and complaining about each other's attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``To all of the Democrats who want to raise taxes or raid Social  
Security to balance the budget, the Republican Congress says no,'' 
DeLay said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments like that -- and television ads the House GOP's campaign  
committee has run in some Democrats' districts -- have drawn 
Democratic ire. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as Republicans let Tom DeLay drive the boat, we're  
going to be locked in a bad disagreement,'' said House Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republicans seemed on the brink of pushing the last  
of the 13 spending bills for the new fiscal year through Congress, 
a measure providing the departments of Health and Human Services, 
Labor and Education with more than $310 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Should they succeed, Republicans would consider that a major  
tactical victory, letting them assert that they finished their 
spending business without touching Social Security's reserves. 
Democrats say the bills do dip into Social Security, citing reports 
from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has threatened to veto the labor-education bill, one of  
five he has vetoed or threatened to veto. The measure ignores most 
of his $1.4 billion plan to hire teachers, instead providing $1.2 
billion to states for a range of education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep their spending bills from eating into Social Security  
surpluses -- the GOP's primary budget goal of the year -- Republican 
leaders were making final decisions on the roughly $5 billion in 
savings they will need. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of it -- about $4.3 billion -- will come from an  
across-the-board cut in all spending bills, said Republicans 
speaking on condition of anonymity. They say such a reduction would 
be barely felt, which Democrats contest. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining savings are expected to come from delaying some  
grants to the Centers for Disease Control and other agencies. 
Postponing those payments from September 2000 into the next month 
would count as fiscal 2000 savings because the spending would not 
occur until fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton signed a stopgap bill letting agencies  
continue operating through Oct. 29. The first such temporary 
extension expired Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, six of the 13 bills for fiscal 2000 -- which started Oct.  
1 -- have been signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved the twelfth of those bills on Thursday, a  
$14.5 billion bill financing federal land and culture programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-Senate compromise, which passed by the House by  
225-200 and the Senate by voice vote, encapsulated the GOP's 
strategy of mixing confrontation with cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	It added hundreds of millions of dollars to earlier versions and  
even restored a program Republicans boasted about killing in 1995. 
But it has provisions for mining, ranching and oil interests the 
White House says would hurt the environment, and less than 
President Clinton wants for buying park lands. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure included $68 million for a financially ailing fund  
that finances health care for more than 60,000 retired mine 
workers, won by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. A second item, $22 
million to help Alaska communities where lumber plants are closing, 
was promoted by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Added in late negotiations was $40 million to buy the  
95,000-acre Baca ranch in New Mexico, a purchase supported by the 
administration and New Mexico's congressional delegation, and $30 
million for a historic preservation fund favored by first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It also restored $2 million for an urban parks and recreation  
fund Republicans touted in 1995 among the programs they eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backs GOP's Abortion Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, N.H. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush lined up with  
Senate Republicans on Friday in supporting a ban on certain 
late-term abortions, but he said there were other important issues 
for the country to address. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding a town meeting in a fire house near Lake Sunapee, the  
Republican presidential candidate told a female questioner he was 
opposed to a specific abortion procedure the Senate seeks to ban, 
but people should be allowed to disagree on abortion rights and the 
government should instead work to streamline adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Senate voted in favor of a resolution upholding  
Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. 
Senators then passed a bill to ban an abortion procedure that 
involves partial delivery of the fetus, although the 63-34 vote was 
four short of the margin needed to override a promised veto by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain, a rival of Bush for the GOP  
nomination, voted for the ban but did not vote on the question of 
Roe vs. Wade. His spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said McCain was en 
route from a campaign stop to vote against the resolution when 
Senate leaders moved up the time of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said earlier in the campaign he would not nominate Supreme  
Court justices based on their abortion views. At the same time he 
has said he would support a constitutional amendment limiting 
abortion rights but would not push for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit to Newport and later to Keene was the fifth that Bush  
has made to New Hampshire this year. The state holds the nation's 
first presidential primary on Feb. 1, eight days after the Iowa 
caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit also came the same day five Republican hopefuls were  
gathering for a debate at the University of New Hampshire. Bush 
declined an invitation and was appearing instead at a party 
fund-raiser in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	In Vermont, Bush told reporters that he opposes gay marriage, no  
matter what the Vermont Supreme Court rules on a pending case 
seeking to legalize it. ``My opinion is we should not have 
same-gender marriage,'' he said. ``I believe marriage is between a 
man and a woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at an airport news conference in South Burlington, he  
said he opposed the effort by New England states to win 
congressional reauthorization of a compact that provides farmers in 
the region with higher prices for milk. He said he preferred a 
``national dairy plan'' because ``that leads to competing compacts, 
states competing with each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to participate in debates with other GOP candidates  
before the primary and caucus season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pundits have questioned Bush's commitment to New Hampshire,  
and polls indicate that while the governor retains about 42 percent 
of the support of likely voters in the Republican primary, McCain 
has moved into a solid second place with about 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the criticism, Bush said in New Hampshire that he was  
invited to the Vermont event in June, and ``I'm a man who keeps my 
word.'' He said he was skipping another debate next week because 
his wife was receiving an award from her college. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is my priority, and if it costs me votes for  
honoring my wife, so be it,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire house audience urged Bush to appoint quality people to  
government and asked him about making Elizabeth Dole his running 
mate. Dole ended her campaign Wednesday, citing Bush's overwhelming 
advantage in money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Dole brought grace and dignity to the campaign, but it  
was premature to talk about a running mate. ``I will speculate out 
loud after I win the party's nomination,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giving his standard stump speech, Bush emphasized that America's  
prosperity must be used to improve the lot of all its citizens. He 
said that dream that can be realized through tax cuts, education 
improvements and by working with religious organizations to 
increase charity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand before you as a uniter, not a divider,'' he declared,  
drawing hearty applause from a crowd of more than 200. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance reaffirmed the beliefs of one couple in the  
audience, Luther and Margaret Williams of Hudson, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	``We voted for his father and we're going to vote for him,''  
said Williams, a 70-year-old retired security officer, referring to 
former President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has a fresh outlook on everything that's going  
on,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Prices Fall Further in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Consumer prices fell by 6.0 percent in  
September compared with the same month last year, as prices in a 
wide range of retail outlets kept dropping, the Hong Kong 
government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing and footwear prices dropped the most, by 23.1 percent.  
Hong Kong consumers also paid less for housing and meals. 
</P>
<P>
	Deflation is the sign of a troubled economy, and although Hong  
Kong has recently shown signs of growth after a 15-month recession, 
prices aren't yet rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lower prices boosted consumer demand and inbound tourism  
arrivals. The volume of goods sold rose by 2 percent in August, the 
Census and Statistics Department said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But in terms of value, the $1.9 billion in retail sales is an 8  
percent drop compared to the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's prices have been dropping for 11 consecutive months.

<HEADLINE> Navy Promotes Man Who Claimed Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reversing itself, the Navy is promoting an  
intelligence officer who had claimed he was improperly denied 
advancement after a laser beam damaged his eye as he flew over a 
Russian cargo ship in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday  
a special group that reviewed the case of Lt. John Daly recommended 
he be promoted, and Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre approved 
the decision this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy had denied Daly's promotion in August. But after the  
Navy's inspector general found fault with the way the decision had 
been made, the Navy convened a special board to reconsider the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Daly told a House Armed Services Committee hearing  
that he and the pilot of a Canadian surveillance helicopter 
suffered irreparable eye damage and that he believes the laser beam 
came from a Russian vessel, the Kapitan Man, that was sailing in 
the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he had been monitoring the Kapitan Man because he  
believed the Russian vessel was engaged in surveillance of American 
submarines, even though it was legally operating as a merchant 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon investigated Daly's claim about a Russian laser and  
concluded from medical examinations that the injuries to his eye 
were consistent with retinal damage from a low-power laser device. 
But it said there was no evidence to prove it was a laser. No laser 
was found on the ship and the Russian captain denied having any 
such equipment.

<HEADLINE> Possible Alzheimer's Enzyme Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- California researchers report they may have  
isolated an enzyme that is thought to play a role in formation of 
beta-amyloid, a protein that plays a key role in Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study appearing today in the journal Science, researchers  
at Amgen Inc. in Thousand Oaks, Calif., report that they have found 
an enzyme called beta-secretase that is thought to start the 
process that leads to the formation of beta-amyloid. 
</P>
<P>
	The enzyme works by cutting beta-amyloid from another compound  
called amyloid precursor protein, or APP. Beta-amyloid collects in 
the brains of Alzheimer's patients and is thought to kill neurons, 
the central feature in the disease process. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe that identifying the correct enzyme could  
lead to drugs that would block beta-amyloid formation. But even if 
drugs are found to inhibit the build up of beta-amyloid, 
researchers are still uncertain if this alone will slow or halt the 
Alzheimer's disease process. 
</P>
<P>
	``The case is not airtight,'' Science said in a commentary.  
</P>
<P>
	Alzheimer's disease is a lethal disorder that gradually destroys  
the brain. Its most prominent feature is the slow loss of memory 
and the ability to reason. Eventually even the brain functions 
vital to life are destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the beta-secretase enzyme was identified as part of  
the disease process, many laboratories have attempted to isolate 
it. At least a dozen research teams have claimed to have made the 
discovery, but the findings have been disputed by others. 
</P>
<P>
	Another California firm, Elan Pharmaceuticals of South San  
Francisco, holds a patent on what the company claims is 
beta-secretase. It is different from the protein identified by 
Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
	Still another enzyme has been isolated by SmithKline Beecham,  
and researchers from that drug firm plan to describe their finding 
at a meeting this week in Miami of the Society for Neuroscience. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Science magazine reports that a number of independent  
experts say they find the Amgen claim to be credible. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have both cell biological evidence and evidence that the  
purified enzyme acts with the (right) specificity,'' Bart De 
Strooper, a Belgium neuroscientist, said in Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Sangram Sisodia, a University of Chicago beta-amyloid specialist  
who also commented in the journal, called the Amgen claim 
``incontrovertible.''

<HEADLINE> Judges Allow KKK Hoods at NYC Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge has rebuffed the city's attempt  
to keep the Ku Klux Klan from rallying in downtown Manhattan this 
weekend, ruling the group's wearing of hoods enjoys First Amendment 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour rally scheduled for Saturday in front of the  
Manhattan Courthouse will likely be held with Klansmen in trademark 
white regalia unless the decision is reversed. City lawyers say an 
appeal of Thursday's ruling was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit on behalf of the  
KKK this week after the city denied the Klan's application for a 
permit. Officials cited a rarely used state law preventing groups 
congregating in public places in masks or with disguises, except 
for authorized masquerade parties or other entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	But while acknowledging the ``tortured history'' of masks in  
America, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein ruled the 
disguises also protect those who espouse controversial viewpoints 
from their detractors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Harold Baer, joining with Hellerstein,  
quoted Oliver Wendell Holmes' statement that ``we should be 
eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of 
opinions that we loathe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, their ruling did not declare New York's law  
unconstitutional, which Klan leaders say is part of their 
objective. Similar statutes have been struck down in Indiana and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani criticized the court's decision, calling  
it ``another example of the ideology extended from the '60s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This ruling says people don't have to take responsibility for  
what they say or what they do even as they support organizations 
that encourage anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, racism and 
hatred,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. James W. Sheley, a Klan grand dragon from Walden, N.Y.,  
said he was ``extremely pleased'' with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 50 and 80 people are expected to attend the rally,  
according to the Klan's suit. A counter demonstration is also 
planned by the Partisan Defense Committee, whose right to protest 
Saturday was also affirmed by the court.

<HEADLINE> Can Gophers Finally Beat Buckeyes? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Maybe they're so accustomed to disparaging  
comments that the University of Minnesota football team doesn't 
know a compliment when it hears one. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24th-ranked Gophers are slight favorites over No. 22 Ohio  
State on Saturday, and Buckeyes coach John Cooper calls strong 
safety Tyrone Carter the Big Ten's best. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Gophers (5-1, 2-1 Big Ten) are looking for revenge,  
not respect. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Buckeyes (4-3, 1-2) routed Minnesota 45-15 in  
Columbus and afterwards didn't even bother to shake hands with the 
Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was disrespectful,'' Gophers running back Thomas Hamner  
said. ``It's something we held in the back of our heads. We aren't 
holding a grudge, but we demand respect and sometimes you've got to 
take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter hasn't forgotten the snub, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``They think we're a pushover,'' Carter said. ``They've been  
killing us over the years and we just got to go out there and take 
the game away from them and let them know we are for real this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper has the utmost respect for Carter.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I've seen a better defensive player in our  
league in a long, long time,'' Cooper said. ``He's just an 
outstanding football player. I've never seen as many tackles as he 
makes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers, who haven't beaten the Buckeyes since 1981,  
returned to the rankings after a 37-7 whipping at Illinois left 
them just one victory shy of their first winning season since 1990. 
A win Saturday and they'd be eligible for their first bowl berth 
since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers haven't been 6-1 since 1967, and the Buckeyes  
haven't been 1-3 in the Big Ten since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamner, who is from Hamilton, Ohio, rushed for a career-best 184  
yards and a touchdown at Illinois. The senior is averaging a 
conference-best 148 yards rushing. Quarterback Billy Cockerham 
threw for 95 yards and rushed for 100 more against the Illini. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckeyes quarterback Steve Bellisari also piles up yards on the  
ground, twice leading his team in rushing. But Cooper said that's 
not so much a sign of his mobility as it is an indication of Ohio 
State's struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``When our quarterback, who we picked up because of his passing  
ability, leads us in rushing, that illustrates some of the problems 
we're having on offense,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gophers coach Glen Mason, who attended and coached at Ohio  
State, sees it another way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think any time you have a mobile quarterback, which he is  
very mobile, that adds another dimension to what you can do. He's 
an awfully good athlete,'' Mason said. ``I know he pulled the ball 
down against Penn State, the best defense there is, and scrambled 
for 44 yards. I think that speaks volumes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes are looking to bounce back offensively after  
mustering just 35 yards rushing in their 23-10 loss to Penn State 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was probably the worst offensive production we've had in  
a long, long, time,'' Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers are on a roll just in time for the meat of their  
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to intimidated by any team in the Big Ten,''  
Minnesota center Ben Hamilton said. ``We know we can play with 
them.''

<HEADLINE> President Signs $8.7B Farm Bailout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today signed into a law a  
record $8.7 billion package of emergency assistance to compensate 
farmers for depressed commodity prices and weather-related crop 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is contained in a $69 billion bill that will fund  
operations of the Agriculture Department and related agencies for 
the 2000 budget year. 
</P>
<P>
	The first assistance checks will be going to farmers in two to  
three weeks, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton agreed to sign the legislation despite his  
administration's reservations that some of the aid will be going to 
large farms and landowners who don't need the money, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of moderate-size farmers who need these  
payments to survive, there's no question about that,'' Glickman 
said, speaking to reporters after a brief signing ceremony at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to develop an alternative way to distribute future  
aid that would target the money to ``family-size'' operations, 
Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money in the measure, about $6 billion, is intended  
to help grain, cotton and soybean farmers cope with a second year 
of low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also provides $1.4 billion for weather-related crop  
and livestock losses, including $200 million earmarked for Eastern 
livestock producers who were hurt by this summer's drought; $400 
million in crop-insurance discounts; $328 million to compensate 
tobacco producers for falling cigarette sales; and $125 million in 
subsidies for dairy producers.

<HEADLINE> Waste Management Has Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Waste Management Inc. acknowledged Friday that a  
massive audit of its dumps and garbage-collection operations found 
more accounting problems that will hurt its third-quarter and 
annual earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation's largest trash hauler said the findings also  
will pave the way for a recovery from its multibillion-dollar 
troubles, and its shares rose modestly on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts were not surprised by the preliminary audit results or  
by reports that the intensive examination will lead Waste 
Management to take a $1 billion charge against earnings when it 
releases third-quarter results and audit findings on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully this will be the last shoe to drop for Waste  
Management. There have been several in the last few months,'' said 
Melville Cody, an analyst with Sanders Morris Mundy. 
</P>
<P>
	In early 1998, Illinois-based Waste Management took a $3.54  
billion pretax charge to correct years of shoddy accounting. The 
company was acquired later that year by Houston-based USA Waste 
Services Inc., which retained the Waste Management name in the 
$13.5 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the Houston-based company announced a $250 million  
revenue shortfall. A shakeup of top management followed in August, 
along with the acknowledgment of a federal insider-trading 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing today is an indictment of accounting at USA  
Waste,'' said Doug Augenthaler, an analyst with CIBC World Markets 
Corp. ``Basically, they're just overpaying for assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates in Waste Management's search for a chief executive  
have been briefed on its troubled past, company spokesman Bill 
Plunkett said. Outside board members have been running the company 
since the departure of John E. Drury, former chairman and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	The board ordered the recent review -- involving 1,160 auditors  
at a cost of $3 million per day -- at its 1,200 facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're going to take a bath, you've got to get all the  
way in,'' board member and acting chairman Ralph V. Whitworth told 
the Wall Street Journal, which reported on the new problems Friday. 
``We want to deliver an absolutely pristine set of books to our new 
CEO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe many of the company's troubles stem from a  
failed acquisition strategy and cite the 1998 merger as the most 
obvious example. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really a function of a troubled company -- Waste  
Management -- getting involved with a flawed company -- USA -- and 
creating a giant problem,'' said Augenthaler. ``Hopefully they'll 
hire a good CEO and get their stock back on the road to recovery. 
But I think it's going to be a long, hard road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management shares were up 31 1/4 cents at $17.12 1/2 a share in  
late trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Senators Weigh Panama Canal Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservatives pressed their claim Friday that  
China is moving to gain authority over the Panama Canal. But a top 
U.S. general said environmental damage and terrorism may pose 
bigger threats to the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm, chief of the Southern Command,  
told a Senate hearing there is no evidence China has designs on the 
canal through Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., a Hong Kong-based shipping 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhelm told the Senate Armed Services Committee, however, that  
``the canal must always be regarded as a potential target'' given 
its strategic location and importance for world commerce. And he 
said that vulnerability will increase when the United States leaves 
for good Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to represent  
the United States at a Dec. 14 handover ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Panama Canal is not endangered,'' Alberto Aleman Zubieta,  
the canal's Panamanian administrator, told the panel. ``Its 
operation shall not be interrupted for any reason whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is looking into worries by conservatives including  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that China is becoming an 
increasingly menacing presence at the canal. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is Panama's 1997 award to Hutchison Whampoa of a  
long-term contract to operate terminals for container ships on the 
canal's Atlantic and Pacific entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is a publicly traded multinational corporation with  
major offices in Hong Kong and Featherstone, England. Its major 
shareholder, billionaire Li Ka-shing, has ties with the Chinese 
government, according to critics of the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These Chinese companies do what the government tells them,''  
said Lott, who participated in Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, a conservative independent from New Hampshire,  
likened the presence of Hutchison Whampoa at either end of the 
canal to ``having the Chinese army in Williamsburg'' and saying it 
would have no effect on ship movements in nearby Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Lino Gutierrez, deputy assistant secretary of state for Western  
Hemispheric affairs, told the panel ``we have found no information 
to substantiate'' allegations that Hutchison Whampoa has ties to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the company will have no control or authority over  
passage of ships through the canal, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhelm said the threat of terrorism remains a major problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to figure out when they might strike, or who they  
might be,'' the Marine general testified. He said Panama needs to 
strengthen its ability to defend the canal and suggested U.S. help 
in that effort. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited ``environmental degradation'' as potentially the  
biggest threat to the canal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deforestation of the canal through clear-cutting, grazing or  
development could threaten the watershed or lead to increased 
silting, ultimately jeopardizing canal operations,'' Wilhelm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caspar Weinberger, secretary of defense in the Reagan  
administration, told the panel the United States needs to negotiate 
with Panama precise terms under which the U.S. military might 
intervene to open the canal if it were blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panama Canal treaties, ratified by the Senate in 1978, give  
the United States the right to intervene militarily should the 
canal be closed or traffic through it hindered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be catastrophic if there were any attempts to  
interfere with the operation of the canal,'' Weinberger said.

		   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, led by financial  
shares that soared on the possibility that legislation will soon 
allow banks, stock brokerages and insurance companies to combine. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 172.56 at 10,470.25, 
erasing Thursday's 94-point decline. The Dow ended a volatile week 
with a combined gain of 450.54 points. Broader stock indicators 
also closed higher. The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.88 to 
2,816.83. Financial stocks drove the market higher after 
Republicans and Democrats settled a dispute on bank lending rules 
that threatened to derail legislation that would overhaul the 
financial services laws.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market will will extend

accommodate after-hours traders. The ticker provides the stock 
price information that scrolls across the bottom of television 
screens and is distributed to millions of investors via the 
Internet. Yesterday, Nasdaq officials said the extension might be 
delayed for third time to allow stock brokers and dealers more time

unable to update their systems in time would be granted waivers

for free. In a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman 
Bill Kennard, Gore recommended that the FCC hold a public 
proceeding to consider the obligations of broadcasters in the new

	MONTREAL (AP) -- Air Canada said today it earned $84 million in  
the third quarter in contrast to a loss of $41 million a year ago. 
The 1998 figures were affected by a two-week pilots' strike that 
severely hindered service. Earnings amounted to 44 cents a share, 
compared with a loss of 22 cents in the third quarter last year. 
Revenue rose to $1.22 billion in the latest quarter from $1 billion 
a year earlier. Air Canada this week offered to buy back shares in 
order to block an Onex takeover bid, helped by major investments by 
global partners Lufthansa and United Airlines.

turn around at the diversified shaving giant, but not before it 
tackles a few serious kinks in its operations, analysts said. 
Gillette stock fell as much as 10.6 percent today but then regained 
some of the ground. Gillette shares were at 36, down 1 7/8.

registered dealers in the program have signed the agreement since 
the company began mailing it in mid-July, said Paul Pluff, manager

securities fraud. The regulators said today that Cresvale 
executives gave kickbacks to Japanese companies and provided false

interest-bearing promissory notes to about 100 Japanese companies,

<HEADLINE> Buchanan's Advice Comes Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan is getting some advice that  
sounds remarkably similar to some he gave President Nixon back in 
1971: Don't let the conservatives bolt from the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, then a White House speechwriter, warned Nixon that  
unless he placated disgruntled conservatives, they would leave and 
weaken the party's chances of holding onto the presidency in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Far Right of our party goes charging off in New  
Hampshire, and is humiliated and routed, a good many people will be 
embittered,'' Buchanan wrote in a memo filed among Nixon papers at 
the National Archives. ``Wounds will have been opened within the 
party which may not have healed in time for November when we need 
everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have the same concern about Buchanan. They worry  
that his bolt to the Reform Party, expected Monday, will fracture 
the GOP and undermine its chances of winning the presidency in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-eight years ago, Buchanan was warning Nixon about John  
Ashbrook, a conservative congressman from Ohio who challenged the 
president in the primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ashbrook used the occasion for a `let's get aboard speech'  
instead of an announced candidacy, it would truly help us in 
resolving our difficulties with the Right -- and unite the party for 
an election where we are going to have to be united,'' Buchanan 
wrote Dec. 13, 1971, in a memo to Attorney General John Mitchell 
and Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buchanan campaign was given copies of several of the memos  
Buchanan wrote about conservatives in the 1970s, but did not return 
repeated telephone calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo to Nixon, dated Jan. 6, 1971, Buchanan reported that  
the Republican Party's right wing thought the president's domestic 
policies were too liberal. They complained that the White House had 
no conservative policy-maker. They grumbled that his administration 
had failed to respond adequately to a Soviet arms buildup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a serious political problem developing on the right,''  
Buchanan wrote in a seven-page, single-spaced letter he titled 
``Trouble on the Right.'' ``One of the constant complaints heard is 
that Richard Nixon 'takes the conservatives for granted; he doesn't 
think we have anywhere else to go.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's perceived threat from the right never amounted to  
much in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashbrook and anti-war Rep. Pete McCloskey of California did  
challenge the president in the New Hampshire primaries, but the 
president trounced them and went on to beat Democrat George 
McGovern in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Buchanan's own threat to the Republican Party more daunting?  
He won the New Hampshire primary in 1996 and put a scare into 
then-President Bush in the 1992 primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Bond, former Republican national chairman, said Buchanan is  
right in how he assessed conservatives' discontent with the GOP 
then and now. But he's wrong about the effect, Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's wrong about again is the consequence of his own  
break-off,'' Bond said. ``He won't be credible enough to stop the 
Republican nominee from winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner for 2000,  
says he wants Buchanan to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to whip him in the primary,'' Bush said. ``I'd like  
to have his ideas out there in Iowa, New Hampshire and South 
Carolina and see whether or not Republicans embrace or don't 
embrace what he stands for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while campaigning recently in California, Bush said: ``The  
question is: Will some of the people who supported Pat Buchanan, 
who are loyal Republicans, stay with the Republican nominee?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was Buchanan's concern for Nixon in 1972. ``Right now, we  
could win without these conservatives and their train; but right 
now is not October of 1972,'' Buchanan wrote to Haldeman and 
Mitchell on Dec. 3, 1971. ``A National Conservative Party in the 
general election could be a problem.''

<HEADLINE> Ore. Flag Law Reveals Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The lawmakers who voted to put the Pledge  
of Allegiance back in Oregon's schools apparently didn't realize 
they would need to put the flag back, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, which takes effect Saturday, school districts  
must display flags and give students the opportunity to recite the 
pledge at least once a week. The pledge used to be a part of the 
morning ritual, but the practice dropped off, particularly in 
middle and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was, after so many years of pledge-free classrooms,  
flags were tattered or missing altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	A few districts bought their own, but others appealed to the  
Oregon Republican Party for a total of 3,000 flags. The party has 
supplied 1,000 flags and is helping raise money to buy more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought schools would have flags -- little did we know,''  
party executive director Darryl Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law doesn't specify how many flags must be in the school or  
in which rooms. Administrators as most schools wanted to put flags 
in each classroom and assembly area. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is the law's lack of a specified time or  
location to say the pledge. Some students have ended up reciting it 
more than once a day in different classes and assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a health class at Harriet Tubman Middle School, several  
students said they don't believe in God and wouldn't say the 
pledge, with its vow of allegiance to ``one nation under God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the class decided it would be up to the students to  
suggest reciting the pledge each day. Those who didn't want to do 
so would stand respectfully. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like it's a big chore or anything -- it's respectful  
to our country,'' said Sam Stuckey, 12. ``If you live in this 
country then you should do it.''

<HEADLINE> Parachutist Dies in Protest Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- A 60-year-old veteran  
parachutist plunged to her death when her chute failed to open 
while jumping off the top of 3,200-foot El Capitan on Friday to 
protest park rules banning the extreme sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Davis was one of five jumpers who planned to leap off the  
sheer granite cliff, a protest organized in response to the June 9 
death of a jumper who successfully parachuted off El Capitan only 
to drown in the river below while trying to flee park rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was the fourth jumper, the first three were beautiful. And  
then she jumped. Everybody thought it was OK, and then people said 
'Open up! Open up!' Then ... the whole place turned quiet,'' said 
Paul Sakuma, an Associated Press photographer. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was meant to demonstrate that the jumps can be made  
safely. 
</P>
<P>
	The first jumper took about four minutes to float down into  
Yosemite Valley in a brilliant blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis fell for more than 20 seconds before she hit amid a piles  
of rock at the base of El Capitan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers quickly cordoned off the area after the 2 p.m. accident,  
and the fifth parachutist hiked down, said Scott Gediman, a 
spokesman for the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a veteran with more than 70 jumps in the past 16 years,  
was using a borrowed parachute and gear that had a cord on the leg, 
unlike her usual gear where the cord was on her back, her husband, 
Tom Sanders, told friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``If only she had used her own gear; if she had only had her own  
gear,'' Sanders said repeatedly, according to friends. She used 
borrowed gear because she didn't want hers to be confiscated by 
rangers waiting to arrest her on the valley floor, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, of Santa Barbara, Calif., was the first woman to jump  
from Angel Falls in Venezuela, the highest waterfall in the world, 
and worked closely with her husband, who has done skydiving 
sequences for James Bond movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who was among the spectators, slumped onto his camera  
after she fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The extreme sport of jumping from fixed objects like cliffs or  
buildings is so dangerous that the National Park Service has banned 
such stunts. Nationwide, an estimated 21 people have died during 
so-called BASE jumps -- the acronym for buildings, antennae, spans 
and earth -- in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	BASE jumping was legal in the park for a trial period in 1980,  
but restrictions on when people could jump and the number of jumps 
per day were routinely violated, so the activity was banned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the sixth death since 1980 due to BASE jumping in the  
park, and we've had numerous injuries. It's a poor track record,'' 
Gediman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, rangers have arrested anyone they catch jumping off  
El Capitan and other cliffs, seized their equipment and put them in 
the local jail. The fine runs $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have tried to reach an accommodation after rangers  
who staked out a landing area tried to capture Frank Gambalie III 
in June. Gambalie, 28, tried to flee, and drowned in the 
runoff-swollen Merced River. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, Gambalie's mother joined about 150 people, including the  
five jumpers' families and friends, in what was supposed to be a 
carefully staged demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	The parachutists, accompanied by rangers at the top of the peak,  
agreed to land in a designated area, be arrested and forfeit their 
equipment, then pursue their opposition to the ban in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also did not bring a backup parachute because she would  
have had to turn it over to park rangers afterward, said Chris 
Conkright, an employee of Aerial Focus, the Santa-Barbara-based 
aerial cinematography company she and her husband ran.

<HEADLINE> Serbia To Let Montenegro Go Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a major policy shift, President  
Slobodan Milosevic will allow pro-Western Montenegro to leave the 
Yugoslav federation without bloodshed if the republic decides to do 
so, Serbian officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll never resolve the problems that exist between Montenegro  
and Yugoslavia with force,'' Yugoslav Vice Premier Tomislav Nikolic 
told the independent Palma Plus TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikolic, an official of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical  
party, admitted that ``nearly all functions'' of the Yugoslav 
government have been frozen in Montenegro, which with Serbia forms 
the current federation. 
</P>
<P>
	And Milosevic's spokesman, Ivica Dacic, told The Associated  
Press that the ``union of Montenegro and Serbia depends on the 
citizens of Montenegro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, made the same statement  
during a recent rally in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic has  
demanded radical restructuring of the Yugoslav federation, a 
process which would virtually abolish Milosevic's control over the 
small republic. Montenegro plans to hold an independence referendum 
in case Milosevic rejects its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between the two republics' delegations are scheduled for  
next week. There have been widespread fears that if the 
negotiations fail, Milosevic might crack down militarily in 
Montenegro, Yugoslavia's only access to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not ready to negotiate Montenegro's hegemony over  
Serbia,'' Dacic said. He added, however, that the ``Serbian people 
certainly will never be an obstacle for the Montenegrins to have 
their own country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro, annoyed by Milosevic's autocratic policies and  
Yugoslavia's international isolation, has already taken big steps 
toward independence. It has been forming its own police force and 
economy, and plans to introduce a separate currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Djukanovic recently said that Yugoslavia, in fact, no longer  
exists. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has been pressing Montenegro to remain in  
Yugoslavia, hoping it could lead to the eventual ouster of 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest statements by Milosevic and his allies indicate he  
would rather let Montenegro leave than be faced with its 
pro-democracy influence in Serbia. Milosevic used the same strategy 
with Slovenia, one of former Yugoslavia's six republics, on the eve 
of the federation's bloody breakup in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	While indicating they would let Montenegro secede without  
bloodshed, Serbian officials have also been warning Montenegrins 
living in Serbia that the split could make them ``foreigners'' in 
Yugoslavia -- and thus would require them to apply for residence 
status. A negative reply would mean they would lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some 600,000 Montenegrins living in their republic and  
just as many as in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikolic went even further, saying that in case Montenegro  
secedes, Serbs living in Montenegro would come to Serbia, while 
Muslims living near Serbia's borders with Montenegro would have to 
move there. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a year or two, Montenegro would become an Islamic state,  
and then Milo Djukanovic will no longer be'' its president, Nikolic 
said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Seek Alzheimer's Clues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Yale University researchers say they  
have found a way to restart the growth of brain cells, a potential 
step toward understanding and perhaps preventing Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Brain cells normally stop growing when people reach adolescence,  
but the Yale team found that the cells can be stimulated to grow 
again as people get older. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which appears in today's edition of the journal  
Science, says scientists were able to trigger a kind of ``on-off 
switch'' in the brains of mice. 
</P>
<P>
	As the human brain develops through the teen years, new cells or  
neurons grow by forming extensions and making millions of tiny 
connections. Once the growth stops, the connections in the brain's 
cerebral cortex, or thinking center, begin to stabilize. When the 
cells become stable, the brain establishes long-term memories. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Alzheimer's patients, the connections start to  
disintegrate and memories are lost. Patients, most of them older 
than 60, deteriorate from forgetfulness to dementia and usually die 
five to 10 years after diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Pasko Rakic and his colleagues say something called the  
``Notch signaling pathway'' gradually inhibits the extension of new 
cells in the brain and keeps them stable in maturity. By 
essentially turning the Notch off, researchers were able to get 
cells to start growing again in a petri dish. 
</P>
<P>
	However, if the Notch is turned off in Alzheimer's patients, the  
cells apparently become so destabilized that the connections 
between neurons break down, rather than grow, said Rakic, professor 
and chairman of neurobiology at the Yale School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The key is understanding why this happens and how to stop it,  
since the loss of the connections means a loss of memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his team's discovery, Rakic said it was more important  
to preserve and stabilize existing connections than to create new 
ones. In Alzheimer's patients, he said, ``You have to counteract 
the activity and make the Notch inactive somehow to prevent the 
degradation and degeneration and breaking up of connections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers hope the discovery could improve efforts in  
treatment and prevention of memory loss that comes with Alzheimer's 
and other neurological disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no known cure for Alzheimer's, a disease that is  
believed to affect more than 4 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Anjen Chenn of Brigham and Women's  
Hospital in Boston and Christopher Walsh of the Harvard Institutes 
of Medicine said the study demonstrates ``quite beautifully'' the 
role of the Notch in neuron growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The $64,000 question is: Is Notch required for Alzheimer's  
disease or is it implicated in causing Alzheimer's? We still don't 
know,'' Walsh said. ``Every memory is basically tied to a new 
connection, and there has to be a way for neurons to decide which 
to keep and which to give up.''

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Dougherty recorded his second  
consecutive shutout and Brian West scored his first playoff goal as 
the Columbus Crew advanced to the Eastern Conference finals with a 
2-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew captured the best-of-3 series two games to none.  
Columbus will face either D.C. United or Miami in the conference 
finals. Game 2 in that series, which United leads 1-0, is Sunday in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	West put the Crew up 1-0 in the 23rd minute when his shot from  
15 yards out wound up just inside the left post. Jeff Cunningham 
added a goal for Columbus in the 88th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty helped extended his former team's playoff scoring  
drought to 325 minutes. The goalkeeper made several strong saves, 
including a diving effort on Manny Lagos' 15-yard shot late in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mutiny have dropped six straight playoff games dating back  
to the 1996 season. Tampa Bay's last postseason goal, scored by 
Gilmar, came on Oct. 5, 1997. 
</P>
<P>

	``The Sunderland workforce is a winning team. Their commitment  
to quality and determination to be the best in the industry has won 
this investment,'' said John Cushnaghan, managing director of 
Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK). 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan confirmed Thursday that the next generation of Primera  
would be built at the plant, which employs 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers called Nissan's  
decision ``a vote of confidence in the workforce and in the U.K. as 
a place for manufacturing and investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has received $8.3 million in government money to help  
finance the project, Byers said.

<HEADLINE> Government Finds Hospice Case Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A government agency has found a clerical error -- but no serious  
wrongdoing -- in the case of a hospice that reported a woman dead 
when she was very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Lawler of Indianapolis spent the last 10 months of her  
life in limbo, trying to keep her Social Security and Medicare 
benefits coming after she was reported dead on April 13, 1998, the 
same day she fired Odyssey HealthCare as her hospice provider. 
</P>
<P>
	An 83-year-old widow who suffered from emphysema, Mrs. Lawler  
died on Feb. 19 of this year -- but not before she complained to the 
office of U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Her story was reported locally, and nationally by The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released by Lugar on Thursday, the Office of  
Financial Management of the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services found that Odyssey did falsely report Mrs. Lawler's death, 
but said this was merely ``a clerical data entry error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said it could not substantiate charges that Odyssey's  
representative was verbally abusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lawler had been in and out of hospitals since 1992, when  
she was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Last 
year, her doctor told the family she should be kept at home and 
made comfortable. She recommended that Odyssey be engaged to manage 
her care. 
</P>
<P>
	Odyssey case manager Debi Vaughn met with Mrs. Lawler on two  
occasions. According to Mrs. Lawler's daughter, Jane Joyal, the 
case manager told Mrs. Lawler that she would have to change her 
oxygen supplier and get a new hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lawler said she did not want to do it, and did not want  
Odyssey's care. According to Mrs. Joyal, Ms. Vaughn begged the 
family to reconsider, and finally, when she was asked to leave, she 
said, ``You know, Mrs. Lawler, you will be sorry. ... You do need 
our services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Financial Management investigators ``were unable  
to substantiate the allegation of verbal abuse,'' wrote Penny 
Thompson, director of the office's Program Integrity Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``These results do not mean that the allegation made by Ms.  
Lawler was untrue. As you can imagine, determining what transpired 
in a conversation between two individuals in a private home is 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But an examination of Ms. Vaughn's file turned up no complaints  
and several letters of gratitude from families. In telephone 
interviews, one patient and four families had only compliments for 
Ms. Vaughn's work. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the data entry mistake, the agency said Odyssey had  
changed its computer process to ensure that the error would not be 
made again. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did charge the federal government $695.80 for Mrs.  
Lawler's care, though investigators found no proof that she had 
signed an Election of Hospice Services form. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has reimbursed that amount to the government.  
Investigators said they examined the files for 15 other Odyssey 
patients, and the proper paperwork had been done in each case.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame's Driver Out For Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame tailback Tony Driver has been  
suspended for the rest of the season by the university's Office of 
Student Affairs, coach Bob Davie said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Davie would not elaborate why the junior was suspended by the  
board, which enforces the university's student handbook that covers 
student conduct issues ranging from cheating to dorm room visits 
from members of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Davie said Driver is still on scholarship and in school. He is  
expected to rejoin the team for spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a Student Affairs decision. I feel bad for a lot of  
people, but most of all Tony Driver,'' Davie said. ``It's 
unfortunate, but that's what it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Driver started the season splitting time with Tony Fisher as the  
starting tailback, but he began seeing fewer carries with the 
emergence of freshman Julius Jones. Driver had 49 carries for 187 
yards and four touchdowns this season, and he became primarily a 
short yardage back the last several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the third Irish player suspended from the team this year.  
Cornerback Brock Williams was suspended before the season started, 
and fellow corner Lee Lafayette was disciplined for academic 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Driver's departure also means just 12 of the 19 players from  
Davie's original recruiting class are available to play the rest of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish (4-3) are off this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Martin Wins Pole at Pop Secret 400 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKINGHAM, N.C. (AP) -- If Dale Jarrett is feeling any pressure  
as he nears the Winston Cup championship, it's not apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin and Jeremy Mayfield took the front row positions in  
Friday's opening round of qualifying for the Pop Secret Popcorn 400 
at North Carolina Speedway, while Jarrett was a solid third. 
</P>
<P>
	That was just another in a series of steps for Jarrett, who is  
counting down to the title without taking anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the race last Sunday (in Talladega, Ala.), Todd  
(crew chief Todd Parrott) said, `Just four more Fridays and four 
more Sundays,' '' Jarrett said. ``After I crossed the finish line 
today, I was thinking, `Another Friday down.' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to get a good, solid starting position that will  
allow us to run the way we want. That means not to have to do a 
tremendous amount of passing early in the race. It just allows you 
to settle in and give yourself plenty of room. If you're back in 
the pack, anything can happen in traffic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett heads into Sunday's 400-mile race on the 1.017-mile oval  
with a 246-point lead over runner-up Bobby Labonte. Martin is 
third, 319 behind. 
</P>
<P>
	With four races remaining on the 34-race schedule, both remain  
mathematically alive. But it would take a major collapse by Jarrett 
for him to be overtaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, neither of the pursuers is letting up.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who won the pole for Saturday's Busch Series race  
earlier in the day, came back to grab his fifth Rockingham pole in 
the Winston Cup division, turning a fast lap of 157.383 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	That broke the race qualifying record of 157.194, set by Jarrett  
in 1996, but he was shy of his own track mark of 157.885, set in 
February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beautiful,'' Martin said. ``I hadn't had a pole this  
year and this was probably our best shot at it. I couldn't beat 
that if I had another chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the championship race, Martin, a three-time series  
runner-up, said, ``We can't even think about that now. We just have 
to go out and try to win every race and we'll count up points when 
it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayfield, who is a disappointing 11th in the standings and has  
had a mostly frustrating season, came close to Martin with his lap 
of 157.083. The time difference between the top laps was only 
.290-seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we've been running, we're happy to see that,''  
Mayfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time series champion Jeff Gordon was fourth at 156.810,  
followed by Labonte at 156.803, Jeff Burton at 156.475, Ricky 
Craven at 156.381 and top rookie Tony Stewart at 156.048. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Wallace, who is seeking his 50th career victory Sunday,  
qualified 25th -- the last position guaranteed a starting spot in 
the opening round of time trials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stumped because ... the car felt great,'' Wallace said.  
``I kept it on the bottom of the track really nice down there in 
turns three and four and thought I picked up the throttle good in 
one and two. It just got slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another disappointment was Dale Earnhardt, coming off a victory  
last Sunday. He finished 37th. 
</P>
<P>
	``That stinks,'' Earnhardt said. ``That's the best lap I'd run.  
I was right on it and the number wasn't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one plus for the drivers who will have to requalify Saturday  
-- or stand on their first-day laps -- is the extended pit road which 
will allow everyone to pit on the frontstretch Sunday. In the past, 
second-day qualifiers had the disadvantage of pitting on the 
backstretch.

<HEADLINE> Bush-Bashing Biographer Had Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The unauthorized biographer of GOP presidential  
front-runner George W. Bush was hoping for a best seller. He may 
end up with a libel lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	His publisher already has recalled the book and suspended  
further sales, shipment and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	James Howard Hatfield, who accused the Texas governor of burying  
a cocaine arrest, allegedly hid a secret of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Friday that Hatfield was convicted in 1988 for  
plotting to murder a co-worker. And they tell of a second 
conviction in an embezzlement scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday afternoon, publisher St. Martin's Press had recalled  
all 70,000 copies of the book -- ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and 
the Making of an American President'' -- from stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelation, first reported in The Dallas Morning News, had  
the Bush campaign's legal staff reviewing the work for possible 
libel implications. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious (the book) was not checked,'' Bush spokeswoman  
Karen Hughes said Friday. Bush had previously denounced the book as 
``science fiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have enough information from our own investigation to make  
the decision that the book must be pulled,'' said Sally Richardson, 
president and publisher of St. Martin's Press trades division. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly believe it would be irresponsible to continue to  
keep the book in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield was still on parole from a 15-year prison term while  
writing the book, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	He alleged that Bush was arrested in 1972 for cocaine  
possession, but only did community service after his father, former 
President Bush, intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest record was later expunged at the request of the elder  
Bush, the book alleged. Hatfield attributed the story to three 
anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Hatfield through St. Martin's Press were  
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, due out in January 2000, was released early after the  
manuscript arrived with the cocaine story. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some merchants, such as online bookseller Amazon.com,  
said they would no longer sell the book, the flap wasn't enough to 
dissuade other merchants like Barnes &AMP; Noble, which said it will 
continue peddling the biography. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield, 41, maintains it's a case of mistaken identity.  
</P>
<P>
	But Eddie Cobb, the Arkansas parole officer overseeing the  
convict's parole, said the writer and former prisoner are one and 
the same, according to published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dallas attorney also identified the author as the convicted  
criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyer Norman L. ``Happy'' Nelson Jr., who knew Hatfield for  
about nine years before the 1988 conviction, was stunned to see 
Hatfield's picture in a local newspaper as the Bush biographer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture in the paper ... that was him,'' Nelson said. ``I  
quite frankly didn't like him denying that he had a record, when I 
knew he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Castlebury, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal  
Justice, confirmed that a James Howard Hatfield was arrested in 
February 1987 for solicitation of capital murder -- hiring a hit man 
to plant a bomb beneath a co-worker's car. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was found guilty, Hatfield went to prison in April 1988  
and spent the next five years there. Upon his release, Hatfield was 
turned over to federal authorities; he wound up doing a short 
stretch in El Reno, Okla., for embezzling nearly $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield was released in December 1994 after doing time in a  
halfway house, said El Reno spokesman Leon Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield then moved to Arkansas with the approval of Texas  
authorities and remained on parole through April 15, 2003, said 
Castlebury.

<HEADLINE> Two British Tourists Killed in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVENPORT, Fla. (AP) -- A dump truck allegedly ran a red light  
and collided with a rental van carrying six English tourists to the 
airport for their flight home, the Florida Highway Patrol and 
witnesses said. Two of the tourists were killed, including a 
pregnant woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened Thursday at a highway intersection in  
Davenport, 30 miles southwest of Orlando. According to witnesses, 
the tourists had been on vacation at Disney World and were en route 
to the airport to return to England. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was rented to Martin Griffith of Petersen, England. In  
the vehicle with him were Carolyn Griffith, Ronald New, Linda New, 
53, Jordan Griffith, 9, and Megan Griffith, 7. Authorities said 
Ronald New and Carolyn Griffith died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the occupants in the van were wearing seat belts, FHP  
investigating officer Trooper D.W. Taylor said. Their relationships 
were not immediately disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The patrol said the truck driver, Daniel Adams II, apparently  
ran a red light. Charges were pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith was listed in stable condition today, while Linda New  
was in critical but stable condition, said Bill West, a supervisor 
at Lakeland Regional Medical Center. The extent of New's injuries 
was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan was being treated for chest and abdominal injuries and  
was in stable condition at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and 
Women. Megan Griffith was in critical condition, breathing with the 
help of a respirator.

<HEADLINE> Houston's Barkley To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Rockets forward Charles Barkley said  
Friday he will announce his retirement Sunday, effective at 
season's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Barkley has threatened several times in recent  
years to retire, but the 6-foot-6 forward insisted this time he 
means it. He said he will make the announcement at halftime of 
Sunday's exhibition game between the Rockets and Detroit Pistons at 
Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Birmingham is less than a half-hour's drive from his hometown of  
Leeds, Ala., so his family will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Barkley's 16th NBA season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just time,'' said Barkley, who has been upgraded to  
questionable for Sunday's game after missing the last four 
preseason games with tendinitis in his right elbow. ``It's time. 
That's it. I'm not going to answer any more questions about it. 
It's just time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I'm going to do (after he retires). I might  
just take some time off. But I'm making it official Sunday. I'm 
announcing it there (in Birmingham) because that's my hometown, and 
I'll have a lot of family and friends there. This is my last year, 
period. I don't care how well I'm playing -- this is it. I want to 
get it over with, and that's it. I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley has long been one of the league's top draws, especially  
internationally. He was on the original Dream Team, playing with 
Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson on the juggernaut that 
won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Barkley, then with the Phoenix Suns, teamed with  
current Rockets teammate Hakeem Olajuwon on the U.S. team that won 
a gold medal in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Charles has decided that this is his last season, then we  
should all relish one more chance to be entertained by one of the 
most spectacular players in NBA history,'' NBA deputy commissioner 
Russ Granik told the Houston Chronicle. ``Charles is certainly a 
one-of-a-kind personality, but first and foremost, he is a truly 
great talent on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets owner Leslie Alexander agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's one of the greatest who ever played the game,''  
Alexander said. ``He is a great player, but he also made the game 
fun. People love to be around Charles, and an attitude like that is 
rare in any sport. His routine will be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley averaged less than 10 rebounds only once, when he  
averaged 8.6 as a rookie with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1984-85. 
Entering this season, Barkley has scored 23,468 points (13th on the 
career list) and pulled down 12,337 rebounds, once leading the 
league (14.6 in 1986-87) and hauling in a career-high 33 in his 
first game as a Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the NBA's second leading rebounder last season with 12.3  
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who said he is not surprised by the decision, is  
happy to have Barkley play his last game as a Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely,'' Alexander said. ``It's nice to have a great one  
retire in your uniform. And he's one of the greatest of all.''

<HEADLINE> Credit Repair Companies Settle Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a dozen ``credit repair'' companies  
and individuals who promised consumers new credit histories and 
phantom Social Security numbers over the Internet must provide full 
refunds as part of a government settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission announced Thursday that sixteen  
firms had agreed to settle federal charges that they sold 
instructions for creating phantom Social Security numbers and using 
``them illegally to build new credit profiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firms had been targeted in a FTC crackdown on sales of false  
credit identities called ``Operation New ID-Bad Idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to get the word out to consumers to watch out for  
this sort of thing,'' said Steven Baker, director of the FTC's 
Midwest office and the operation's organizer. ``There isn't any way 
to repair your credit short of paying off your bills and developing 
a good credit history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In settling the cases, the companies did not admit to any crime,  
officials said. Baker refused to say if any criminal investigations 
were still underway. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen of the firms will fully refund their fees, but three  
others said they couldn't afford to repay customers. Cases against 
seven other firms are still ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit repair scams are among the top twenty complaints received  
by the FTC, Baker said and ``a lot of these companies do business 
over the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These types of operations lure consumers who have been denied  
loans or credit cards because of poor credit histories, sometimes 
sending letters to people who have filed for bankruptcy. For 
anywhere from $29.95 to $400, the companies promise to instruct 
customers on how to develop a new credit identity through a process 
called ``file segregation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies then sell consumers instructions on how to apply  
to the Internal Revenue Service for an employer or taxpayer 
identification number. Businesses use these numbers to set up a tax 
account for their filing purposes and they shouldn't be used in 
place of a Social Security number. 
</P>
<P>
	But the scam operations tell consumers to do exactly that--using  
the numbers instead of their Social Security number in credit 
reports or loan applications, enabling them to start a fresh, new 
credit record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem here is not just the money that people spent, but  
the risk that consumers actually followed this advice, got a new 
credit identity and got loans they were not able to repay or they 
filed financial statements and are subject to criminal 
prosecution,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also the risk that someone else's real Social Security  
number could be used, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of turning to illegal methods, consumers should ``sit  
down with a counseling service and review their options,'' said 
Judith Stevens, an education specialist with the Consumer Credit 
Counseling Service, a national nonprofit organization that helps 
consumers manage their debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens advises consumers to get their credit report every year  
and to dispute any inaccuracies, which can often be fixed for free. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit repair firms involved in the settlement varied widely  
in size from less than $100 of business and some more than 
$100,000, said FTC Spokeswoman Claudia Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
	Both she and Baker said they couldn't reveal the number of  
victims involved or the total amount of money the firms had taken 
from consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to repaying the money, the firms must notify their  
customers that using false identification numbers to apply for 
credit is illegal. The settlement also bars the companies from any 
new misleading advertising and from selling their customer lists.

<HEADLINE> Longhorns Like Nebraska's Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Enough of this gushing over which team has  
the nicest fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers just want to beat No. 18  
Texas on Saturday, not play nice. 
</P>
<P>
	With victories in 1996 and 1998, Texas joins Florida State as  
the only two teams to beat Nebraska twice this decade. It's a badge 
of honor earned against one of the dominant teams of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	While Texas has fond memories of its 20-16 victory last year --  
which snapped Nebraska's 47-game home winning streak -- Cornhuskers 
center Dominic Raiola said the loss turned his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate Texas,'' Raiola said. ``They're this high-and-mighty  
deal. I don't like that song either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas players and coaches sing ``The Eyes of Texas'' after every  
game. After the victory, Texas players hoisted coach Mack Brown on 
their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my helmet on, my head down,'' Raiola said. ``It was  
cloudy and kind of dark. It made me disgusted to hear that song. It 
made me sick to see them celebrating on our field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas coaches and players have more pleasant memories.  
</P>
<P>
	First came the stunned silence when the clock ran out. Then came  
the standing ovation from several hundred Nebraska fans that Brown 
said he'll remember forever. 
</P>
<P>
	In an age when boos, taunts and even worse sometimes rain down  
on players from the stands, Nebraska fans are among the best in 
sports, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just unbelievable,'' he said. ``We can all learn  
from those people about sportsmanship and how to make an opposing 
team feel comfortable while still trying to win on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All week, calls to sports-radio talk shows have told stories of  
slaps on the back and free dinners from Nebraska fans after Texas' 
victory last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has implored Texas fans to return the good will -- win or  
lose -- during Nebraska's first trip to Austin since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's make the Nebraska people, when they leave Austin, say  
the same things that we've said for a year about Lincoln,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be easy to do if Texas (5-2, 2-1 Big 12) can beat  
Nebraska (6-0, 3-0) for the third straight time. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas beat the Cornhuskers 37-27 in the 1996 Big 12 title game --  
a loss that ended Nebraska's bid for a third consecutive national 
title -- before last year's upset in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it helps us, knowing we're the only team that's been  
able to beat them two in a row in a long time,'' Texas wide 
receiver Ryan Nunez said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Texas players say last year's game means  
little to them anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the Big 12 and ascending the AP Top 25 to join the elite  
teams like Nebraska means everything. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have done some things against them the past two years, but  
it doesn't mean anything this season,'' cornerback Ahmad Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want to be Big 12 contenders, we have to beat  
Nebraska.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Disney, Hong Kong Agree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. and the Hong Kong government  
have reportedly reached key agreements on how to finance a new 
theme park here, as the two sides finalize details ahead of the 
Oct. 31 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will provide the roads and other related  
infrastructure, but Disney must give the city some kind of 
financial compensation for the land, the independent Sing Tao Daily 
reported, quoting unidentified government sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong has been in negotiations with the Burbank,  
Calif.-based Disney for months, but had to extend the talks over 
the summer, saying at the time that financial obstacles remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Chau, a government spokeswoman, refused to comment on the  
report, but said an announcement is expected by Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial Secretary Donald Tsang reportedly said this week the  
government is ready to talk to rival Universal Studios if it cannot 
reach a deal with Disney by the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Earnings Likely To Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Gillette Co. may have the top-selling razor,  
but it's still is getting nicked. 
</P>
<P>
	A report of listless third-quarter earnings and warnings of dim  
prospects in the final months of the year sent Gillette stock 
sliding Friday. Things may turn around at the diversified shaving 
giant, but not before it tackles a few serious kinks in its 
operations, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the burdens Gillette must bear: profits have been in the  
doldrums for several product lines -- including Braun appliances and 
Paper Mate and Parker pens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Gillette is feeling the consequences of a double  
whammy right now,'' said Ira R. Weiss, dean of the College of 
Business Administration at Northeastern University. ``They are 
committed to being either first or second in every sector that they 
serve, and I think they are going through some problems in some of 
the weaker sectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a report after markets closed Thursday, Gillette reported  
flat earnings for the third quarter and its chairman and chief 
executive officer, Michael C. Hawley, warned investors to expect a 
fourth-quarter sales decline ``in the mid-single digits and 
quarterly earnings decrease in the middle to high teens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Its stock fell as much as 10.6 percent Friday before regaining  
some lost ground. It ended the day down 5 percent, or by $1.87 1/2, at 
$36 a share. Its stock has been falling steadily since March, when 
it hit a 52-week high of $64.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	William Steele, an analyst with Bank of America Securities,  
expects Gillette to fix its problems, but said the immediate future 
could be rocky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they understand the nature of the problem and they can  
turn it around,'' he said. ``The question is: what is going to be 
the effect on earnings for the next 12 to 18 months?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profits for Gillette's flagship line of razors and blades  
climbed 24 percent in the July-September quarter, and Duracell 
batteries and Oral-B toothbrushes also brought in earnings. But 
profits for Braun products dropped 39 percent. And for the first 
nine months of the year, profits from stationery products fell by 
78 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After the earnings report was released Thursday afternoon,  
company officials suggested they might try to shed underperforming 
products, a strategy Weiss applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really need to think about whether the stationery and  
appliance companies can really ever get back to double-digit 
growth,'' he said. ``My sense is they have got to go back to some 
of the core products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slumping markets in Latin America and Asia also have hurt  
Gillette sales. Also, a strong dollar has eaten into profits on 
strong European sales, which are made in local currencies, Weiss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conversion rate is killing them in Europe, even though  
sales are good there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette continues to dominate the United States shaving market.  
Its triple-bladed Mach 3 razors and blades -- which were introduced 
last year and retail for more than $6 -- were the nation's top 
sellers in the one-year period ending July 18, according to 
Information Resources Inc., a Chicago-based firm that tracks 
product sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the time being, Wall Street remains cool on Gillette.  
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Catherine Lewis of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter continued  
to rate the stock neutral for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock looks expensive on estimates that decline every  
couple of months and in which we have no confidence,'' she said. 
``We expect (Gillette) will eventually get its act together, most 
likely before yearend 2000.''

<HEADLINE> United States 9, World All-Stars 6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Cindy Parlow scored three goals Friday night  
to lead the United States to a 9-6 victory over a team of world 
all-stars in the first stop of the 12-city Toys 'R Us Victory Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no penalty-kick shootout that followed 120 scoreless  
minutes like in July when the United States won the Women's World 
Cup over China. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the game was played indoors and there were goals.  
Lots of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is a perfect way to thank the fans, to thank all  
the kids and families who supported us during the World Cup and 
celebrated with us after,'' said Mia Hamm, who scored two goals. 
``We want this tour to be about fun, a celebration of the game. 
This isn't win at all costs. This is fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parlow said her playing has improved quite a bit since her days  
growing up in Memphis playing soccer in indoor arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty bad then,'' she said. ``This was a lot better  
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve of 19 players on the roster suit up in each city on the  
tour. Six of the cities were also World Cup sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 9,875 fans, many of them children, turned out to watch the  
game Friday night. Hamm thanked them before the game, encouraging 
them to show the same excitement that characterized her team's run 
through the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans didn't disappoint, cheering ``Mia, Mia'' almost every  
time she touched the ball. When the game was in hand, they jumped 
to their feet chanting ``U-S-A, U-S-A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the tour is about more than adulation. Hamm and her  
teammates show up to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to win,'' Hamm said. ``I think as this tour goes on,  
we'll start getting used to the indoor game. You're going to see 
some pretty good soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tour continues Sunday when the teams play in Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	The players, reportedly making $40,000 each for the tour, were  
without midfielder Michelle Akers, who is injured and may not play 
at all on the tour.

<HEADLINE> LSU Has Mississippi State's Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi State is motivated more by  
a losing streak than its nine straight regular-season victories. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because no matter how much success the 12th-ranked  
Bulldogs (6-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) have had in recent 
years, they haven't been able to beat LSU, regardless of how bad 
the Tigers have been. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have beat us seven straight times. That's our No. 1  
motivation. We owe them,'' senior linebacker Barrin Simpson said. 
``It doesn't matter what their record is, they have talent and play 
their best football against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State, one of just seven undefeated I-A teams, is  
home for the first time in a month when it plays host to LSU (2-4, 
0-4) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the defending SEC West champion Bulldogs are off to their  
best start in 55 years, things have gotten so bad at LSU that 
athletics director Joe Dean was forced this week to publicly refute 
rumors that coach Gerry DiNardo was being fired midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	DiNardo knows the rumors and distractions have affected his  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``How positively and how negatively, that's the uncertain thing.  
I just know it's human nature,'' said DiNardo, the fifth-year coach 
who has refused to discuss his future status. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers have lost seven straight SEC games and 10 of 11.  
Their lone league victory in that span was 41-6 last October 
against the Mississippi State team that went on to win the SEC 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs haven't beaten LSU since 1991, coach Jackie  
Sherrill's first in Starkville. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the Bulldogs have won their first SEC football title  
of any kind since 1941, played in four postseason bowl games and 
won 50 games -- none of them against LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I've seen is that there are a lot of teams that have made  
some plays against them and that has hurt,'' Sherrill said of LSU. 
``But they've got an awful lot of talent. And LSU has always played 
us tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LSU is the next hurdle as the Bulldogs try to strengthen their  
position to defend the SEC West title. Three of their last five 
games are at home, but one of their road games is Nov. 13 at 
10th-ranked Alabama (5-1, 4-0). 
</P>
<P>
	With a victory over LSU, the Bulldogs would become the last of  
the current 12 SEC teams to start a season with seven straight 
victories. They would also have a 4-0 SEC record for the first time 
in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to think down the road, or we many never get  
there. There are so many potholes and so many curves,'' Sherrill 
said. ``Things could flip-flop in a hurry since we have five tough 
games in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State knows about those late season reversals of  
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Mississippi State was 7-2 before losing its last  
two games. The Bulldogs missed a chance to win the SEC West title 
and were left out of the postseason altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Bulldogs won the West and made it to the SEC  
Championship Game last year, they lost in the title game to 
eventual national champ Tennessee and then were beaten by Texas in 
the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our motto is to finish. We don't think last year that we  
finished,'' senior defensive back Ashley Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the last two years have taught the Bulldogs ``how  
to finish and to play the whole season strong. It helped us learn 
how to win and play in big games and finish out the season.''

<HEADLINE> Renault Eyes Global Auto Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Renault SA's alliance with Nissan Motor Co. will  
help the French automaker boost its share of the global market and 
possibly get back into the U.S., the company's top executive said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault, which bought a 37 percent stake in Nissan earlier this  
year, is looking to the Japanese company for lessons about about 
efficiency and quality, Renault chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer Louis Schweitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan, and specifically Nissan, are a benchmark of quality,''  
Schweitzer said. ``Clearly, we have things to learn from Nissan in 
our manufacturing processes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renault will not attempt to reintroduce its brand in the United  
States, a market it fled 12 years ago with a reputation for 
poor-quality cars, Schweitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the company will consider selling Renault vehicles  
in the United States under the Nissan brand name. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks came just days after Nissan's new chief operating  
officer sent by Renault, Carlos Ghosn, announced drastic measures 
to cut costs at the debt-ridden Japanese company by shutting down 
plants and shaving off 14 percent of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the year, 17 executives from Renault will be at  
Nissan, while 21 former Nissan executive will be working at 
Renault, Schweitzer said. He stressed, however, that the two 
companies will maintain their separate identities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an alliance, not a merger,'' Schweitzer said. ``We do  
not want to try to merge the French culture and the Japanese 
culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said Renault will use Nissan's worldwide  
administrative and sales network to help it enter markets such as 
Mexico, a country where it lost money and left in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer also said that Renault is not ready to inject more  
money into Nissan Diesel Motor Co., Nissan's ailing truck 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Diesel must solve its own debt problems first before the  
French automaker will consider possible cooperation with its own 
truck-making arm, Renault VI, he said.

<HEADLINE> Shop Caters to Hardcore Horror Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Donnie Gillespie was a typical 1970s  
teen-ager who camped out at the drive-in to watch campy B-movie 
horror films and eagerly awaited weekends when he could catch the 
golden age of horror in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike most of his peers who forgot the movies and moved on  
to careers and office jobs, Gillespie turned his passion for 
society's forgotten films into his life's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie's store, Diabolik, caters to baby boomers looking for  
dusty old fright films and to a new generation of horror and cult 
movie fans. The store has more than 4,000 movies, most not found in 
a typical neighborhood video store. 
</P>
<P>
	The store has been busy lately as many boomers' interest in the  
horror films of their youth has been reawakened by the success of 
this summer's independent sleeper, ``The Blair Witch Project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing is just a labor of love,'' said Gillespie,  
42, who sports long black hair and a well-trimmed goatee and 
usually wears black clothes. ``How many other jobs are there where 
you can spend your day watching horror and science fiction 
movies?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diabolik has all the trappings of a horror movie set -- a  
skeleton in a wheelchair sits in front of the window, posters from 
classic Universal Pictures horror films line the walls, and a glass 
display case features old autopsy tools. 
</P>
<P>
	Available for rental are horror staples like ``The Bride of  
Frankenstein,'' little-known horror films by Italian director 
Umberto Lenzi and 1950s B-films like ``Attack of the Crab 
Monsters'' and ``The Giant Gila Monster.'' Many films in the store 
are virtually impossible to find elsewhere, available only from 
collectors who copied the movies from 16-mm films. 
</P>
<P>
	``These films give you the same thrill as a roller coaster,''  
Gillespie said. ``People like being scared but knowing nothing is 
going to happen to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie also rents rare crime documentaries, sells horror and  
science fiction soundtracks and collects and sells old horror 
magazines and books. 
</P>
<P>
	The shop is a gathering place for film connoisseurs who often  
exchange movie recommendations or talk about film. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that strikes me about the store is the  
comprehensiveness and intelligence of the selection,'' said Jim 
Hurley, a film scholar and English professor at the University of 
Richmond. ``He's paid real attention to films that have developed 
powerful underground reputations and films as a rule that are very 
difficult to find.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The store has attracted customers from all over the country and  
overseas because horror fans simply can't find films they want to 
rent elsewhere. Gillespie said customers routinely drive from 
out-of-state to rent films for a week and then mail them back when 
they are finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie also does mail order sales and will search for rare  
and obscure films. If he finds one, he charges a customer based on 
how rare the picture is and how difficult it was to track down. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie's passion for horror and fantasy started in his  
childhood in Virginia. He would watch TV shows including ``Chiller 
Theater'' and ``The Outer Limits'' and old pictures from the 1930s 
like ``Dracula.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie later found a box in the attic filled with his  
father's horror comics like ``Tales From the Crypt,'' and ``Vault 
of Horror.'' He was soon reading fantasy authors including Conan 
creator Robert E. Howard and searching for movies he hadn't seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie collected films for years while working jobs such as  
record store manager and disc jockey. He started assembling his 
video collection after purchasing his first videocassette recorder 
in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	While living in Los Angeles, Gillespie took his gigantic  
personal collection and opened the Goblin Market in 1995. He 
returned to Virginia last year after a death in the family and 
opened his new store last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie said there are still gaps in his collection. On the  
top of his wanted list is the lost Lon Chaney Sr. film ``London 
After Midnight,'' the holy grail to horror film collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Although horror and cult film devotees are naturally drawn to  
Diabolik, Hurley said the shop is also a strong draw to boomers who 
grew up with horror films produced before Hollywood marketing 
strategies and computer generated special effects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I walked into the store I saw title after title  
that resonated because I had watched these films when I was a 
kid,'' he said. ``They registered very deeply with me and I was 
still carrying around images from them and awareness of them but 
hadn't had an opportunity to see them in years.''

<HEADLINE> Military Aviation Deaths Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Deaths in U.S. military aviation accidents  
fell this year to 43 from 77 the year before, and the Pentagon's 
overall air safety record improved slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual report on military safety, the Pentagon said  
Thursday that in a year in which hundreds of U.S. aircraft 
participated in the 78-day air campaign over Kosovo, it recorded 
1.58 major aviation accidents for every 100,000 hours of flying 
time. That compares with a rate of 1.64 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident count covered the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.  
</P>
<P>
	The military overall recorded 108 on-duty accidental deaths and  
319 off-duty deaths. The accidental death rate was 30 per 100,000 
military members, the same as the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	In other safety categories for the period:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The military lost 55 airplanes in accidents, down from 60 the  
year before. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Privately owned motor vehicle accidents were the leading  
killer for the military, accounting for 280 deaths. The year before 
there were 249 such deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The military recorded $3.3 billion in property losses, about  
$1.9 billion of which was from damage to three satellites. Aviation 
accidents accounted for $1.23 billion of the total property losses.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Seeking Genocide Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *BY PAULINE JELINEK   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Rwandan genocide tribunal nears its  
fifth anniversary with little progress, Rwanda is urging the 
world's governments to hand over suspects hiding in their 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Washington press conference, Rwanda's ambassador to the  
United Nations, Joseph Mutaboba, said about 1,000 people believed 
to have helped plan the 1994 massacre of at least 500,000 Rwandans, 
mostly ethnic Tutsis, are still at large. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 20,000 more fugitives include militia, former  
soldiers and others who participated in the widespread killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the European countries there are many,'' said Mutaboba.  
``And we have some here as well,'' he said. ``In Washington, even, 
there are some, in New York there are some. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's every single country in the world that should look around  
and sweep the streets of its own cities to find them. They are 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutaboba noted that Cameroon has detained and sent back nine  
suspects, Kenya 11, and Togo, Benin and others have ``done as much 
as they could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Many more are still at large, and the international community  
(should) live up to its responsibility,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutaboba said the Nov. 8, 1994, United Nations resolution  
setting up the tribunal binds all U.N. member nations to identify, 
arrest, detain and hand over suspects living within their borders. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight of militia and other suspects to neighboring  
countries such as Congo and Burundi, and Rwanda's campaigns to 
flush them out, has contributed to a war in Congo and greatly 
destabilized much of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same way we are worried about those who are across the  
borders, we are worried about those who are hiding, who are living 
the high life here -- and there are many,'' Mutaboba said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no difference as far as we are concerned between the  
one who lives in Burundi, the one who lives in Congo and the one 
who lives in France. They are all the same criminals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutaboba noted the tribunal set up in Arusha, Tanzania, has been  
plagued by mismanagement, but he said it has been improved since 
the problems were exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal has spent $209 million in disposing of only five  
cases.

<HEADLINE> Alabama's Alexander Faces Vols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Despite Shaun Alexander's Heisman aspirations, Tennessee doesn't  
plan to try anything special to slow him down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to do anything different for Shaun  
Alexander,'' Volunteers linebacker Raynoch Thompson said. ``We'll 
just get after him like we have everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, neither team is expected to do anything unusual. No.  
10 Alabama (5-1, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) will try to run. No. 
5 Tennessee (4-1, 2-1 SEC) will rely on its defense to try and stop 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do what we've done the last five years and see  
how it unfolds,'' Tennessee defensive coordinator John Chavis said. 
``We've got a good defensive front. We're proud of our defensive 
front. It's a week they'll have to play at their best. We're 
expecting them to win some battles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And no doubt lose a few. The Crimson Tide has run the ball  
successfully against every team they've played. 
</P>
<P>
	In this, the 56th straight year the teams have played -- and the  
first time since 1930 the game is being played in Tuscaloosa 
instead of Birmingham's Legion Field. -- Alabama is promoting 
Alexander for the Heisman Trophy. The tailback has a chance to make 
the case himself Saturday against the Vols, who have one of the top 
rushing defenses in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama's offensive line, led by tackle Chris Samuels, has  
cleared the way to the top of the SEC rushing lead at 191 yards per 
game. Alexander is averaging 155 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samuels is probably the best offensive lineman in the  
country,'' Chavis said. ``He's strong, he's physical and he's 
nasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander ran for 214 yards and three touchdowns last week  
against a Mississippi defense that went into the game giving up an 
average of 45 yards rushing. He's had at least 100 yards in every 
game this year, including 106 against a Florida defense that 
limited Tennessee's rushers to 95 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I describe him as a skater,'' Chavis said. ``He can make quick  
cuts because his feet are always close to the ground. If there's a 
crease, he can accelerate through it. When you see a guy who's in 
the top three or four for the Heisman, he has to be talented and 
getting the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's defense is third in the nation against the run,  
giving up 64.4 yards per game. Wyoming managed 8 yards rushing, 
Florida 123, Memphis 62, Auburn 75 and Georgia 54. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest challenge we've seen this year,'' said  
Tennessee defensive end Will Overstreet, who will be opposite 
Samuels much of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Saturday, No. 1 Florida State will be at Clemson,  
No. 2 Penn State at No. 16 Purdue, No. 3 Nebraska at No. 18 Texas, 
No. 7 Kansas State at Oklahoma State, Illinois at No. 9 Michigan, 
No. 11 Michigan State at No. 17 Wisconsin, LSU at No. 12 
Mississippi State, No. 13 Texas A&AMP;M at Oklahoma, Kentucky at No. 14 
Georgia, No. 15 Marshall at Buffalo, No. 19 BYU at UNLV, Tulane at 
No. 20 East Carolina, Cincinnati at No. 21 Southern Mississippi, 
No. 22 Ohio State at No. 24 Minnesota, and No. 23 Miami at Boston 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 4 Virginia Tech, No. 6 Florida, No. 8 Georgia Tech and No.  
25 Mississippi are idle. 
</P>
<P>
	The game between Florida State (7-0) and Clemson (3-3) is  
intriguing because Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden will be going for 
career win No. 300, against his son, Clemson coach Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy says the pressure will be on the Seminoles.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they lose, they lose a national championship,'' he said.  
``If we lose, we're 3-4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State's Peter Warrick, suspended the past two games  
because of legal problems, probably won't play Saturday because his 
court case has been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (7-0) will have to contend with Drew Brees of Purdue  
(5-2), who passed for more than 500 yards in last week's upset of 
previously unbeaten Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees was 39-of-58 for 361 yards against Penn State last year,  
but the Nittany Lions won 31-13, with the help of six sacks and an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska (6-0) has a few scores to settle with Texas (5-2).  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Texas ended Nebraska's 47-game home winning streak  
with a 20-16 upset as Major Applewhite threw for 269 yards and two 
TDs and Ricky Williams ran for 150 yards. And in '96, the Longhorns 
upset the Cornhuskers 37-27 in the first Big 12 title game, denying 
Nebraska a chance for a third straight national title.

<HEADLINE> Woodhall To Defend WBC Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TELFORD, England (AP) -- Richie Woodhall, hoping to unify the  
world super-middleweight title, defends his WBC title Saturday 
night against Germany's Markus Beyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodhall, fighting in his home town at the Telford Ice Rink, is  
making the third defense of the title he won in March 1998 from 
South Africa's Sugar Boy Malinga. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodhall won a disputed decision six months later over Glenn  
Catley, then stopped Italy's Vincenzo Nardiello in six rounds last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodhall has a 25-1 record, his only defeat coming in a  
final-round knockout by American Keith Holmes for the WBC 
middleweight title in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodhall is hoping to follow up a victory over Beyer with  
unification showdowns against WBO champion Joe Calzaghe of Britain 
and IBF champion Sven Ottke of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to unify the super-middleweight division by this time  
next year,'' Woodhall said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Beyer, unbeaten in 16 fights, has plans of his own.  
</P>
<P>
	``Woodhall is ready to be beaten,'' he said. ``I have watched  
his last two fights on tape and nothing he did remotely impressed 
me.''

<HEADLINE> Gillette Earnings Likely To Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Gillette Co. may have the top-selling razor,  
but it's still getting nicked. 
</P>
<P>
	A report of listless third-quarter earnings and warnings of dim  
prospects in the final months of the year sent Gillette stock 
sliding Friday. Things may turn around at the diversified shaving 
giant, but not before it tackles a few serious kinks in its 
operations, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the burdens Gillette must bear: profits have been in the  
doldrums for several product lines -- including Braun appliances and 
Paper Mate and Parker pens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Gillette is feeling the consequences of a double  
whammy right now,'' said Ira R. Weiss, dean of the College of 
Business Administration at Northeastern University. ``They are 
committed to being either first or second in every sector that they 
serve, and I think they are going through some problems in some of 
the weaker sectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a report after markets closed Thursday, Gillette reported  
flat earnings for the third quarter and its chairman and chief 
executive officer, Michael C. Hawley, warned investors to expect a 
fourth-quarter sales decline ``in the mid-single digits and 
quarterly earnings decrease in the middle to high teens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Its stock fell as much as 10.6 percent Friday before regaining  
some lost ground. It ended the day down 5 percent, or by $1.87 1/2, at 
$36 a share. Its stock has been falling steadily since March, when 
it hit a 52-week high of $64.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	William Steele, an analyst with Bank of America Securities,  
expects Gillette to fix its problems, but said the immediate future 
could be rocky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they understand the nature of the problem and they can  
turn it around,'' he said. ``The question is: what is going to be 
the effect on earnings for the next 12 to 18 months?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profits for Gillette's flagship line of razors and blades  
climbed 24 percent in the July-September quarter, and Duracell 
batteries and Oral-B toothbrushes also brought in earnings. But 
profits for Braun products dropped 39 percent. And for the first 
nine months of the year, profits from stationery products fell by 
78 percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	After the earnings report was released Thursday afternoon,  
company officials suggested they might try to shed underperforming 
products, a strategy Weiss applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really need to think about whether the stationery and  
appliance companies can really ever get back to double-digit 
growth,'' he said. ``My sense is they have got to go back to some 
of the core products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slumping markets in Latin America and Asia also have hurt  
Gillette sales. Also, a strong dollar has eaten into profits on 
strong European sales, which are made in local currencies, Weiss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conversion rate is killing them in Europe, even though  
sales are good there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette continues to dominate the United States shaving market.  
Its triple-bladed Mach 3 razors and blades -- which were introduced 
last year and retail for more than $6 -- were the nation's top 
sellers in the one-year period ending July 18, according to 
Information Resources Inc., a Chicago-based firm that tracks 
product sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the time being, Wall Street remains cool on Gillette.  
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Catherine Lewis of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter continued  
to rate the stock neutral for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock looks expensive on estimates that decline every  
couple of months and in which we have no confidence,'' she said. 
``We expect (Gillette) will eventually get its act together, most 
likely before yearend 2000.''

<HEADLINE> Attitudes Change for Yanks, Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Terry Mulholland can understand why a lot of  
people grew weary of watching the Atlanta Braves each October. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt the same way, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I played on other teams, I couldn't stand them,'' the  
Braves pitcher said Thursday. ``I was tired of seeing them in the 
postseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, that's all changed now. Traded by the Chicago Cubs to  
the Braves on July 31, he's now trying to help them beat one of his 
former clubs, the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	A lot has changed since the Yankees and Braves met in the World  
Series three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The old stadium in Atlanta is just a parking lot now, with  
painted lines where the basepaths used to be. Jimmy Key and Cecil 
Fielder are out of baseball. Mark Wohlers and Marquis Grissom are 
out of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're going to spend a lot of time figuring out  
what's the difference between now and 1996,'' Braves pitcher Tom 
Glavine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine will start against Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, MVP  
of the AL Championship Series, in Game 1 Saturday night at Turner 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The addresses have switched, and so have the attitudes going  
into a rematch of that World Series won by New York in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``That team wasn't sure if it was good enough to beat the  
Braves,'' said pitcher David Cone, one of 12 Yankees left from that 
club. ``We had never done it before. Now we have the experience to 
know what we can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Tino Martinez said: ``That year we were the  
underdogs. We wanted to win, but this year we expect to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chipper Jones is one of only eight Braves still remaining.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're a lot closer as a team, we're a lot tighter,'' the third  
baseman said. ``We didn't have a lot of injuries in '96, we didn't 
have a lot of adversity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves' only setback came that season after they won the  
first two games of the World Series at New York. Back home, in the 
final three games ever at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, they lost 
three in a row to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pivotal play of the series, Jim Leyritz hit a three-run  
homer in the eighth inning on a hanging breaking ball from Wohlers 
in Game 4. The long drive sailed over the glove of left fielder 
Andruw Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a mistake that he hit it,'' Jones said after  
Thursday's workout. ``But I don't remember that stuff. That was 
1996 and this is 1999. I'm hoping things go differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion Yankees are trying to win their third  
championship in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, in the postseason for the eighth straight time, is  
hoping to win its second title in the '90s -- and avoid becoming the 
first team to lose four World Series in a decade since the New York 
Giants from 1910-19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves won two of three at Yankee Stadium in July during  
interleague play. But slugger Ryan Klesko, who homered twice in one 
of those games, said that won't have much effect on what happens in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko said the results from 1996 won't play a role, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've changed a lot more than they have.''  
</P>
<P>
	To be on the safe side, however, Klesko planned to watch tapes  
Thursday night from that other World Series with the Yankees. He 
was limited to a lone single in 10 at-bats in that matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone will start Game 2 for New York against Greg Maddux. When  
the series moves back to Yankee Stadium, it will be Atlanta's Kevin 
Millwood against Andy Pettitte in Game 3 and then John Smoltz vs. 
Roger Clemens in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the pitchers missing from 1996 Series are World Series MVP  
John Wetteland and Key from the Yankees and Denny Neagle, Steve 
Avery and Wohlers from the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone from the starting lineup in Game 1 that year are Grissom,  
Mark Lemke, Fred McGriff, Jermaine Dye and Jeff Blauser from the 
Braves -- catcher Javy Lopez is injured -- and Wade Boggs, Mariano 
Duncan and Fielder from the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a whole lot of guys left on the teams,'' Maddux  
said. ``All that matters now is 1999.''

<HEADLINE> Major Daumier Retrospective Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Biting political satires and gripping portrayals of  
human suffering that once sent Honore Daumier to jail have gone on 
display at the Grand Palais in a major retrospective of works by 
the 19th-century artist. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 300 lithographs, paintings and sculptures, the  
show is the most comprehensive overview of Daumier's work since 
1878, a year before he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-sponsored by Canada's National Museum of Fine Arts in Ottawa,  
the show runs in Paris through Jan. 3. It then travels to the 
Philipps Collection in Washington, D.C., also a co-organizer along 
with the French National Museum Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Daumier is best-known as a political satirist with the fine,  
steady hand of a draftsman. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a keen and unrelenting observer of the times whose  
satirical lithographs captured the political climate of corruption 
and social injustice of France in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	Daumier's portraits and mini-sculptures of doctors, lawyers and  
judges, peasants, thieves and actors run the gamut of the human 
condition: ambition, desperation, hypocrisy and arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
	Daumier was inspired by the events of the day and remained an  
anti-royalist and ardent defender of human rights until his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rue Transnonain'' depicts the midnight massacre by royalist  
troops of an innocent family in their bedroom, bodies slumped 
across the bloodied floor. The father lays on top of his dead 
child, the mother is a crumpled heap nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Orsay Museum director Henri Loyrette says visitors don't have to  
be steeped in French history to appreciate Daumier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daumier's style is so powerful, the rendition of the events is  
so strong that they become universal,'' he said in an interview. 
``Look at Rue Transnonain! What a tragedy! It could be Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Daumier's audacious drawings got him into trouble. In  
1831, he received a six-month jail term for ``Gargantua,'' a 
portrayal of the French king as Rabelais' fictional, gluttonous 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence was first suspended, but another provocative  
caricature a few months later caught the attention of authorities 
who imprisoned the artist for ``inciting hatred and disrespect of 
government authority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daumier's talent went beyond the hooked noses, double chins and  
exaggerated gestures of his many caricatures, and critics widely 
regard him as a forerunner of Impressionism. 
</P>
<P>
	In his final years, paintings such as ``Third Class Railway  
Carriage,'' ``The Drowning'' and his Don Quixote series feature the 
thickly applied paint, the bold brushstrokes, the denial of 
pictorial accuracy and use of light that would later mature in the 
works of Monet and Renoir.

<HEADLINE> Stoneman Frontrunner for Angels GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Bill Stoneman, an executive with the  
Montreal Expos since 1983, appears to be the front-runner to become 
general manager of the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reported Stoneman was to have met again  
with Disney officials Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman, a 55-year-old former major league pitcher who threw  
two no-hitters, had two previous interviews, as did former New York 
Yankees GM Bob Watson, team spokesman Tim Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who interviewed were New York Mets assistant GM Omar  
Minaya and Houston Astros assistant GM Tim Purpura. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing definitive at this point regarding the  
announcement of our next general manager,'' Mead said Thursday. 
``The interview process will continue today. I'm not at liberty to 
discuss names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Bavasi resigned as general manager of the Angels three  
weeks ago -- two days before the team finished a 70-92 season and in 
last place in the AL West. Bavasi held the job for nearly six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels hope to hire a GM before the World Series begins  
Saturday. Baseball mandates that no major announcements be made 
during the Series so they will not detract from the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times, quoting an unidentified source, said Stoneman hadn't  
been offered the job before Thursday, but a multiyear contract 
offer was imminent and an announcement could be made today. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman has most recently served as Montreal's vice  
president-baseball operations. Before that, he worked primarily as 
the Expos' chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoneman pitched in the majors for eight years with a 54-85  
record and 4.08 ERA. He pitched with the Chicago Cubs for two years 
and the Expos for five before completing his career with the Angels 
in 1974. His no-hitters came with the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	The first priority for the new general manager would be to hire  
a manager. Terry Collins resigned Sept. 3 and was replaced by bench 
coach Joe Maddon on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Baylor, hitting instructor of the NL champion Atlanta  
Braves, is believed to be a leading contender for the manager's 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who played for the Angels from 1977-82 and won AL MVP in  
1979, managed the Colorado Rockies from 1993-98. He was NL manager 
of the year in 1995, leading his team to postseason play in its 
third year. He was fired one day after the 1998 season.

schedule and will extend operations of its stock quote ticker 
beginning Monday to accommodate after-hours traders, it was 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticker provides the stock price information that scrolls  
across the bottom of television screens and is distributed to 
millions of investors via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Nasdaq officials said the extension might be  
delayed for third time to allow stock brokers and dealers more time 
to upgrade computer systems to adjust to changes stemming from 
after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Nasdaq said broker-dealers who are unable to update their  
systems in time would be granted waivers from some regulations 
related to the new extended hours. ``Recognizing the legitimate 
technological constraints of these market participants, a brief 
deferral of trade-reporting requirements between the hours of 5:15 
p.m. and 6:30 p.m. has been sought and obtained from the Securities 
and Exchange Commission,'' Nasdaq said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Confusion arose late Thursday when a news release posted on  
Nasdaq's Web site announced there would be a delay until Nov. 15 to 
allow broker-dealers more time. However, Nasdaq spokesman Scott 
Peterson said the statement was prematurely released and that a 
decision had yet to be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq initially planned to extend its ticker hours on Oct. 4,  
but that was delayed until Oct. 11, while the plan awaited approval 
from the SEC. After the SEC gave the go-ahead, Nasdaq pushed back 
the date until Oct. 25 to give brokers and security dealers time 
for computer system upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq plans to keep its system open until 6:30 p.m. Eastern  
time from 5:15 p.m. Late quotes also are planned for the system 
that reports trades on shares listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Both systems currently stop distributing quotes at 5:15 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in after-hours trading sessions scattered across a  
number of different markets -- primarily on electronic 
communications systems, or ECNs -- has prompted calls for the 
extension of hours of centralized stock information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq last month offered to extend the hours of its ticker to  
address that need. A week later, the organization that runs the 
NYSE's ticker also agreed to extend its ticker hours because the 
Chicago Stock Exchange, which trades NYSE listed stocks for 
regional customers, will soon keep its market open until 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE and Nasdaq are also planning extended sessions, but not  
until next year.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T, British Telecom Venture OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators gave final clearance Friday  
to a global joint venture between AT&AMP;T and British 
Telecommunications PLC, a deal that would combine the two 
companies' international operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The combine would deal mostly with voice and data service,  
mainly for large commercial users. The venture originally was 
valued at $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission found the application for  
the alliance to be in the public interest but imposed some limited 
conditions on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC approval is the final step in the regulatory process. The  
companies expect to launch the global venture, called Concert, in 
about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased the regulatory agencies both in Europe and the  
U.S. agree that our global joint venture will benefit customers as 
well as the competitive telecommunications marketplace,'' said 
David Dorman, the venture's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC conditioned its approval on the companies compliance  
with an agreement reached among them, the Defense Department, the 
Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The 
accord had to do with potential national security and law 
enforcement problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement requires that domestic telecommunications  
facilities owned by the companies will be controlled by their 
subsidies and located within the United States. This will ensure 
that U.S. law enforcement authorities have both the jurisdiction 
and the technical ability to conduct electronic surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies agreed to take reasonable measures to prevent  
improper use of domestic telecommunications facilities and to adopt 
and maintain policies to ensure electronic surveillance orders and 
other legal authorizations are kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the companies will require security clearances for people  
with access to sensitive network facilities and to keep access from 
unauthorized people. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the FCC's other conditions, AT&AMP;T and their subsidiaries  
would be prohibited from getting exclusive operating agreements 
with British Telecom because of the joint venture. The commission 
also required that BT comply with British regulations that the 
company must give its competitors access to local customers for 
long-distance and international calls at the same level of access 
that BT has. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies will use their combined international networks to  
become a ``carrier's carrier'' for long-distance services offered 
by telephone companies operating in numerous markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, in announcing the deal in July 1998, said the  
venture would operate in three main areas: 
</P>
<P>
	--A worldwide voice and data business offering telephone networks  
to multinational corporations and other big institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	--A global sales and service business that initially will target  
corporate clients in the financial, oil and information technology 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	--An international carrier services business that will develop  
low-cost communications links around the world for both individual 
and business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, AT&AMP;T and BT carry about half the calling traffic  
between the United States and Britain but own less than 20 percent 
of the network capacity.

<HEADLINE> Special Visa Introduced in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. is proposing a new  
immigration visa category for foreign-born technology workers to 
make up for what he says is a shortage of Americans qualified for 
high-tech jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under legislation introduced by Robb, a foreign worker would  
need an advanced degree in mathematics, science, engineering or 
computer science and a job offer paying at least $60,000 a year to 
qualify for the visa. Recipients would be limited to recent 
graduates of U.S. master's or doctoral programs currently in the 
country on student visas. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses would have to pay $1,000 for each visa, which would  
allow a foreign worker to remain in the United States for five 
years. Extensions would cost $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be used to help pay for grants to improve  
mathematics, science and technology education in U.S. public 
schools, Robb told the Senate Judiciary Committee's immigration 
subcommittee at a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy has grown, the number of quality jobs has  
increased and a new and increasingly more important form of 
commerce has been born,'' he said. ``But as with any burgeoning 
industry, there are likely to be growing pains, and the most 
significant one that we see now is the shortage of skilled workers 
to fill the nearly 350,000 vacant information technology jobs in 
this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech companies have been lobbying hard for Congress to  
allow more skilled immigrants into the country for jobs they say 
can't be filled adequately by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Congress raised the limit on ``H-1B'' visas, which  
are reserved for foreigners with specialized job skills for any 
industry, from 65,000 in fiscal 1998 to 115,000 in each of the 
following two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Those visas ``can be granted to anyone from bakers to  
occupational therapists, computer programmers to fashion models,'' 
Robb said. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech executives say their businesses are growing so fast  
that those visas no longer are enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens when companies like mine can't hire the workers  
we need?'' asked Susan Williams DeFife, chief executive officer of 
womenCONNECT.com, an Internet site for women in business. ``We have 
to delay projects, and in the Internet industry where change occurs 
daily and competitors are springing up all around you, waiting to 
execute a project can be lethal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics say the government should step up efforts to make sure  
that companies aren't simply trying to hire foreign workers at 
lower salaries than they would have to pay Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb said supplementing the U.S. work force with more highly  
educated foreign workers is a short-term solution. ``The long-term 
challenge is to find ways to upgrade the skills of our existing 
work force and to improve the quality of our education system so 
that the next generation of Americans has the skills needed to 
maintain our global dominance in the technology area,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bill, introduced by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas,  
would increase the number of H-1B visas to 200,000 annually over 
the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Internet Users Defy Secret 'Spies' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defying an ultra-secret spy network believed  
to be scanning overseas e-mails for subversive messages, Internet 
protesters tried to overwhelm U.S. government eavesdroppers by 
flooding the system with fabricated messages about terrorist plots 
and bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	But even supporters of Thursday's electronic civil disobedience  
campaign acknowledged that the effort likely caused ``a lot of 
laughter,'' not consternation, at America's super-secret National 
Security Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers urged Internet users on dozens of Web sites and in  
discussion groups to send millions of e-mails with 
subversive-sounding language. ``Give the (NSA) their keywords!'' 
one person wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The intent was clear: Flood the powerful NSA computers with  
enough suspicious traffic to crash them and disrupt the mysterious 
high-tech listening system, code-named ``Echelon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 report commissioned by the European Parliament described  
``routine and indiscriminate'' monitoring of faxes, e-mails and 
telephone messages in Europe by the global spy network, which it 
said was coordinated by the NSA with the help of other nations' 
security organizations. Another study for the European Union this 
year brought out new details. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., has said he supports congressional  
hearings to determine the scope of the spy network's capabilities 
and to prevent abuses. The network is said to include a listening 
station in Sugar Grove, W.Va., about 250 miles from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The NSA is prohibited from spying within the United States. But  
it's unclear how those prohibitions are respected with e-mail, 
which can travel outside U.S. borders on a zigzag path across the 
Internet even when sent by one American to another. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency declined to comment Thursday on its network or the  
potential impact of the day's e-mail campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agency doesn't discuss alleged intelligence operations,''  
NSA spokeswoman Judith Emmel said. ``It doesn't confirm or deny any 
Echelon-type technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even supporters of the jamming campaign were pessimistic  
that their efforts would have much impact. They suggested the spy 
network was smart enough to ignore e-mails typically sent with 
lists of random words, especially since many of the messages were 
in plain English and not in foreign languages or code. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will cause a lot of laughter up at NSA, to tell the  
truth,'' said Wayne Madsen of the Washington-based Electronic 
Privacy Information Center, who tracks news about Echelon. ``If 
they seriously think they're going to bring the computers at the 
NSA to a grinding halt, they're going to be seriously 
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not, in fact, have any effect on their operations,''  
agreed Duncan Campbell of Edinburgh, Scotland, who wrote the most 
recent report about Echelon for the EU. ``They're used to 
electronic warfare and screening out noise put up by enemies. This 
is noise from dissenting citizens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said even if their e-mail campaign didn't cause the  
NSA's computers to crash, it was important at raising awareness of 
the spy network's rumored abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Internet, where conspiracy theorists flourish, it was  
impossible to know for sure precisely who thought up ``Jam Echelon 
Day,'' as it was called in one message from an Australia-based Web 
site. It was also impossible to count how many e-mails protesters 
might actually have sent, much less determine their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll ever know,'' said Simon Davies, who heads  
London-based Privacy International, a human rights organization. 
``I would guess maybe it will be 10 years before we understand the 
ramifications of any civil disobedience campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Said Averse To Gore Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House liberals said Democratic presidential  
candidate Bill Bradley told them Friday he won't engage in a 
``bloodletting'' negative campaign against Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also picked up an endorsement from Rep. Diana DeGette,  
D-Colo., only the third House member to publicly back the former 
New Jersey senator. Three Senate Democrats have also endorsed 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes courage and leadership to step forward and support my  
campaign,'' Bradley said. He said the latest endorsement shows: 
``You can be for Bradley and not vaporize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told a closed-door meeting of about 20 members of the House  
Progressive Caucus that he thought personal attacks were 
ineffective and would hurt the Democratic Party, participants said 
afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bradley said he believed his poll numbers rose in  
Iowa earlier this month after he declined to fight back when Gore 
accused him of quitting Congress just when Democrats needed him 
most. 
</P>
<P>
	``His numbers rose and he said that there was nothing else to  
explain it,'' said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who has also 
endorsed Bradley. ``He said fighting back's not necessary. He 
didn't think it would be useful for the party to have a 
bloodletting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore met the Progressive Caucus earlier this week as both  
candidates chase endorsements from the Democratic nominating 
convention ``superdelegates,'' who are generally elected or party 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The two candidates discussed issues such as trade, the  
environment, labor and campaign finance reform, lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we wanted to do is have our issues, issues that affect  
working people and middle-class people, injected into the 
campaign,'' said Rep. Bernie Sanders, independent from Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said one sharp contrast between the  
two was that Gore criticized Bradley by name over several issues, 
including his Senate voting record. Bradley, on the other hand, 
never mentioned the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of an odd reversal,'' DeFazio said. ``It's usually  
the challenger who goes after the incumbent. Gore acted much more 
like the underdog. Maybe he knows he's got a real race on his 
hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeGette, elected in 1996 to replace Pat Schroeder in a  
Denver-based district, said she favored Bradley because of his 
positions on health care for the uninsured, gun control and helping 
average people balance jobs and family. 
</P>
<P>
	``These challenges require big ideas and big solutions,''  
DeGette said. ``Senator Bradley is the candidate who offers the 
solutions to unite this country and forcefully address these 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley called the endorsement ``a tremendous boost'' and said  
it demonstrated that Democratic elected officials shouldn't feel 
duty-bound to back Gore just because he's vice president. Most 
House Democratic leaders are for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGette, Nadler and Rep. William Lipinski, D-Ill., are the House  
members publicly supporting Bradley so far. Sens. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan of New York, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of 
Minnesota have also endorsed him.

<HEADLINE> Congress, Clinton Resume Budget Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials and  
congressional budget-writers seem ready to resume talks on a string 
of spending bills after a day of caustic partisan exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Budget Director Jack Lew was expected at the Capitol  
today, two days after his first session with leaders of the House 
and Senate appropriations committees. Since then, the two sides 
have done little but accuse each other of spending Social Security 
surpluses, and complaining about each other's attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``To all of the Democrats who want to raise taxes or raid Social  
Security to balance the budget, the Republican Congress says no,'' 
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said at a news conference 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments like that -- and television ads the House GOP's campaign  
committee has run in some Democrats' districts -- have drawn 
Democratic ire. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as Republicans let Tom DeLay drive the boat, we're  
going to be locked in a bad disagreement,'' said House Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republicans seemed on the brink of pushing the last  
of the 13 spending bills for the new fiscal year through Congress, 
a measure providing the departments of Health and Human Services, 
Labor and Education with more than $310 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Should they succeed, Republicans would consider that a major  
tactical victory, letting them assert that they finished their 
spending business without touching Social Security's reserves. 
Democrats say the bills do dip into Social Security, citing reports 
from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has threatened to veto the labor-education bill, one of  
five he has vetoed or threatened to veto. The measure ignores most 
of his $1.4 billion plan to hire teachers, instead providing $1.2 
billion to states for a range of education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep their spending bills from eating into Social Security  
surpluses -- the GOP's primary budget goal of the year -- Republican 
leaders were making final decisions on the roughly $5 billion in 
savings they will need. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of it -- about $4.3 billion -- will come from an  
across-the-board cut in all spending bills, said Republicans 
speaking on condition of anonymity. They say such a reduction would 
be barely felt, which Democrats contest. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining savings are expected to come from delaying some  
grants to the Centers for Disease Control and other agencies. 
Postponing those payments from September 2000 into the next month 
would count as fiscal 2000 savings because the spending would not 
occur until fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton signed a stopgap bill letting agencies  
continue operating through Oct. 29. The first such temporary 
extension expired Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, six of the 13 bills for fiscal 2000 -- which started Oct.  
1 -- have been signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress approved the twelfth of those bills on Thursday, a  
$14.5 billion bill financing federal land and culture programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-Senate compromise, which passed by the House by  
225-200 and the Senate by voice vote, encapsulated the GOP's 
strategy of mixing confrontation with cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	It added hundreds of millions of dollars to earlier versions and  
even restored a program Republicans boasted about killing in 1995. 
But it has provisions for mining, ranching and oil interests the 
White House says would hurt the environment, and less than 
President Clinton wants for buying park lands. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure included $68 million for a financially ailing fund  
that finances health care for more than 60,000 retired mine 
workers, won by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. A second item, $22 
million to help Alaska communities where lumber plants are closing, 
was promoted by Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Added in late negotiations was $40 million to buy the  
95,000-acre Baca ranch in New Mexico, a purchase supported by the 
administration and New Mexico's congressional delegation, and $30 
million for a historic preservation fund favored by first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It also restored $2 million for an urban parks and recreation  
fund Republicans touted in 1995 among the programs they eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Making Heavyweight Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- They are a couple of aging heavyweights -- Mike  
Tyson, hoping to recapture glory, and Orlin Norris, thirsting for 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been almost 13 years since Tyson, at age 20, became the  
youngest heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with his skills eroded by time and inactivity, Tyson is  
aiming to become a heavyweight champion for the third time. An 
impressive win over Norris in their 10-round bout Saturday night in 
the MGM Grand would be a step toward that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Norris has had a successful career in terms of  
wins and losses. But he has never achieved the kind of recognition 
that he would gain by beating Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Being a cruiserweight champion, which Norris once was, is one of  
boxing's better-kept secrets. Norris also long fought in the shadow 
of younger brother Terry, a flashy junior middleweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson is a 10-1 favorite in his first fight since serving 3 1/2  
months in a Maryland jail for assaulting two motorists after a 
minor accident. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last fight, his first since the disqualification for  
biting Evander Holyfield's ears in 1998, Tyson knocked out Francois 
Botha in the fifth round Jan. 16, 1999. But in that fight he lost 
the first four rounds on two cards and three of the first four on 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who guide and promote Tyson's career hope he looks much  
sharper Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be only the eighth fight in eight years for Tyson. He  
spent three years in prison on a rape conviction, had no bouts in 
1998 because of his license revocation from the Bite Fight and 
served jail time in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm rusty I'm rusty,'' he said. ``I'll still look  
sensational. I'm in a perfect frame of mind for fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson weighed in Thursday at 223 pounds, his weight for the  
Botha fight. He said he weighed 280 pounds when he was released 
from jail May 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris has fought less than one full round in 14 1/2 months and  
could also be rusty. He stopped Pele Reid in the first round June 
26, 1999, at London. His previous fight had been on Aug. 6, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect Tyson to come out and try to blow me out in one, two  
or three rounds,'' said Norris, 218. ``That's the type of fight he 
is. He wants to get it over with quickly and get out of there. I 
knew that way back. It doesn't bother me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $800,000 purse is by far the biggest payday for Norris  
(50-5, 27 knockouts), of San Diego. Tyson (46-3, 40 KO's) 
reportedly is getting $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be televised by Showtime, with the telecast to  
begin at 11 p.m. EDT. Showtime hopes the World Series game between 
Atlanta and the New York Yankees is concluded before Tyson fight, 
but Jay Larkin of Showtime said the fight should start no later 
than midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the telecast will be an IBF junior lightweight title  
fight between champion Roberto Garcia (32-0, 24 knockouts) and No. 
1 contender Diego Corrales (28-0, 23 knockouts) of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be Garcia's third defense of the 130-pound title he won  
on points over Harold Warren on March 13, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Penn St. To Go After Star QB Brees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Penn State long has been known as  
Linebacker University. Nine former linebackers have earned 
All-America honors in the 34 years Joe Paterno has been coach. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's trio of LaVar Arrington, Brandon Short and Mac  
Morrison possibly could join the list of linebackers who went on to 
successful NFL careers -- Jack Ham, John Skorupan, Ed O'Neil, Greg 
Buttle, Kurt Allerman, Shane Conlan and Andre Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's safe to say that they have the three best  
linebackers in the conference, certainly as a group,'' Purdue coach 
Joe Tiller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Short leads the team with 50 tackles, including six for losses.  
Arrington has 10 tackles for 40 yards in losses among his 34 
tackles, including three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Purdue's record-setting quarterback Drew Brees  
faces the trio as the second-ranked Nittany Lions visit Ross-Ade 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) is the conference's only  
undefeated team after No. 16 Purdue (5-2, 2-2) downed previously 
unbeaten Michigan State 52-28 last Saturday. The Boilermakers have 
won 10 straight on their home field where their only loss since 
Tiller took over in 1997 was to Penn State. The Lions, who lead the 
series 4-1-1, won here 42-17 that year and won 31-13 at State 
College last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees and Tiller had more concerns than Penn State's linebackers  
while preparing for a fourth consecutive game against a Top 25 
team. Defensive end Courtney Brown is a major reason Penn State's 
front line is considered one the best in college football. Brown 
has only 27 tackles, but 15 were for losses and he leads the 
Nittany Lions with six sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington and Brown are among 12 semifinalists for the Lombardi  
Award, presented to the nation's top lineman, and Tiller thinks 
they and Short are going to be first-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington, the first sophomore to be chosen the Big Ten  
defensive player of the year last year when he was a second-team 
All-America, also is a favorite to win the Butkus Award awarded 
annually to the linebacker considered the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arrington is a a threat to make a play -- the play -- at any  
time,'' Tiller said. ``You have to account for him, know where he 
is at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brees faced Penn State's defense last year. He was sacked only  
16 times last season -- the fewest sacks allowed by any Big Ten 
Conference team. Penn State had six of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Penn State's front seven is incredible, so we're going to have  
to get the ball off quick,'' Brees said. ``We're going to have to 
execute well. Their secondary, they have good athletes with a lot 
of speed. And they run an all-around good scheme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Brees has been sacked only five times, while Penn  
State has recorded 23 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiller contends that Penn State's defense, with nine returnees  
from 1998, is as dominant as last year. Penn State is 19th 
nationally in total defense (299.7 yards per game) and 13th in 
scoring defense (16.0 points per game). 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes for a lot of sleepless nights getting ready for these  
guys,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The game matches the two most productive offenses in the  
conference. Purdue leads the Big Ten in total offense with a 464.6 
average. Penn State is second at 459.3. Penn State leads the 
conference with a 36.7 scoring average, followed by Purdue at 35.7. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees has thrown for 6,537 yards and 55 touchdowns in less than  
two full seasons as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Paterno has 314 victories and is tied with Amos Alonzo Stagg for  
third among the winningest coaches in major college history.

<HEADLINE> U.N. To Send Force to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council voted Friday to send  
a 6,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force to Sierra Leone to help 
restore peace after an eight-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone will be established for six  
months at first to help safeguard the peace deal signed July 7 by 
the government and rebel leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Leone's new U.N. ambassador, Ibrahim Kamara, said the  
vote had reassured Sierra Leoneans that their plight was not at the 
bottom of the council's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. peacekeepers won't actually be responsible for  
maintaining security in Sierra Leone. That job will remain with the 
West African peacekeeping force that helped end the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	But the resolution authorizes the U.N. force to take ``necessary  
action'' to ensure the security and movement of U.N. personnel, and 
to protect civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6,000 peacekeepers, including 260 military observers, should  
be sent within 60 days to locations throughout the West African 
country to help disarm and demobilize the combatants, 
Undersecretary-General for Peacekeeping Bernard Miyet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamara stressed that the Nigerian-led force, known as ECOMOG,  
was crucial for implementing the July peace accord, and appealed to 
the Security Council to do everything it could to ensure that the 
force remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria's U.N. ambassador, Arthur Mbanefo, commended the council  
for dispatching U.N. forces, saying it ``relieves us of a 
disproportionate burden in human and material resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not comment on whether Nigeria's troops would remain in  
Sierra Leone, but said the country ``stands ready to play its 
part'' in the U.N. mission. 
</P>
<P>
	During the war, tens of thousands of people were killed by  
members of the Revolutionary United Front and their allies. 
Thousands more had their hands, ears or lips hacked off in a 
display of rebel terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the July 7 agreement, rebel leader Foday Sankoh and Sierra  
Leone's president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, agreed to form a 
power-sharing government. 
</P>
<P>
	Pledging America's support for the peace agreement, U.S.  
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said that, in discussing U.S. arrears 
with Congress, he emphasized that ``there is no double-standard in 
the United States concerning African peacekeeping -- that Sierra 
Leone is equally important to us as Kosovo and East Timor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said, though, that the United States remained  
committed ``to the pursuit of accountability'' for war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. special envoy for children in armed conflict, Olara Otunnu,  
urged rebel leaders to level with Sierra Leone's children, many of 
whom have been displaced or maimed, and ``acknowledge fully their 
role in the horrific atrocities committed during the war.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Impressed With Gaston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cito Gaston took a casual-Friday approach to  
his interview for the Cleveland Indians' managing job, electing not 
to wear a tie with his sport coat and dress slacks. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he made sure he put on one of his two World Series  
championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have them both on,'' he said. ``I think that would  
have been a little much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston, who led the Toronto Blue Jays to Series titles in 1992  
and '93, met with Indians general manager John Hart and assistant 
GM Mark Shapiro for more than three hours to discuss Cleveland's 
managerial opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was outstanding,'' Hart said. ``He came just as advertised.  
Cito is a guy who has a presence about him, one that demands 
respect. A quiet strength. He did a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston is the third candidate to interview with the Indians, who  
fired Mike Hargrove last week following their collapse against the 
Boston Red Sox in the first round of the AL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Hart met with former Chicago Cubs manager Jim  
Riggleman and Indians hitting instructor Charlie Manuel, considered 
the frontrunner to replace Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Gaston, Hart left for the World Series in  
Atlanta where he plans to meet with Braves hitting instructor Don 
Baylor and New York Yankees hitting coach Chris Chambliss during 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with our list,'' Hart told the Associated Press  
before boarding his plane. ``But that doesn't mean that it won't 
grow either. There could be some others we will eventually meet 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said he was especially looking forward to talking with  
Chambliss, who in 1971 was the AL Rookie of the Year with the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy I hope blows me away is Chambliss,'' Hart said. ``He  
has not managed at the major league level yet, but from what people 
have been telling me, he has all the credentials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does Gaston. And his two World Series rings as Toronto's  
manager give him something none of the other candidates can match. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cito knows what it takes to win,'' Hart said. ``He has brought  
a club home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home, in Cleveland, means a World Series championship. The  
Indians haven't won it all since 1948, and Hargrove's inability to 
get his team to the ``next level'' -- as Hart put it -- cost him his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaston already has proved he can take a veteran club like the  
Indians to a title. His '93 team in Toronto, which featured Rickey 
Henderson, Devon White, Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter, was similar 
to the one in Cleveland now. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've been winning here for a long time,'' Gaston said.  
``They've probably had more success than we had in Toronto except 
for winning the World Series. They're right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said the Indians had not put a timetable on completing  
their managerial search, and that any finalists would be brought 
back for a second interview and meeting with team owner Dick 
Jacobs.

<HEADLINE> Papon Captured in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Maurice Papon, the former Vichy  
official who fled France rather than face jail for his role in 
sending Jews to Nazi death camps, has been arrested at a luxury 
hotel in a Swiss mountain resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Papon, 89, was hospitalized after apparently becoming ill soon  
after he was taken into custody Thursday night. Bernhard Kummer, 
spokesman for University Hospital, Bern, said Papon was being cared 
for in a ``special place'' at the hospital but would not give 
details on his health. 
</P>
<P>
	French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was in contact with Swiss  
President Ruth Dreifuss to ask her to ensure Papon's quick 
repatriation, French officials said. How or when he might be 
extradited, however, was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Papon, a former high-ranking police official in France's  
pro-Nazi Vichy regime, was arrested Thursday night at the Hotel 
Roessli in Gstaad, about 60 miles south of the capital, Bern, Lars 
Widmer, the son of the hotel manager, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father thought he wasn't very distinctive,'' Widmer said.  
``He saw Papon's picture in the paper and said to me, 'He looks 
almost like the man in room 115.''' 
</P>
<P>
	An arrest warrant for Papon had been issued Thursday in  
Bordeaux, France, after he failed to appear in court. The Court of 
Cassation, France's highest court, ruled Thursday that Papon lost 
his right of appeal by failing to report to prison as required. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, Papon said he had chosen exile to  
uphold his honor. 
</P>
<P>
	His flight was made possible by a controversial decision by the  
Bordeaux court at the beginning of his trial in 1997. The court 
accepted medical testimony that Papon was in poor health and freed 
him for the duration of the trial and the appeals period after he 
spent three days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	His disappearance triggered widespread criticism of the French  
Interior Ministry for letting him slip out of the country. It was 
also an embarrassment for French officials who did not place 
judicial controls on Papon or revoke his passport. 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac said Papon's arrest marked ``the  
return to a respect of the law.'' Lawmakers at the National 
Assembly, the French parliament, broke into applause at the news 
that he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Papon was convicted in April 1998 and sentenced to 10 years in  
jail for complicity in crimes against humanity for his role in 
deporting 1,590 Jews from Bordeaux. Most deportees later died at 
the Auschwitz death camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld, the head of the Association of Sons  
and Daughters of Deported Jews of France, told France Info radio 
that Papon's arrest represented ``a triumph of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect that he will return to France very soon and will be  
incarcerated,'' Klarsfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss officials said Thursday that Papon stayed under a false  
name at a hotel in the western Swiss town of Martigny from Oct. 11 
to 16. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 14, authorities issued an order barring Papon from  
entering Switzerland. Police authorities say they were unaware that 
Papon was already in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Papon is the highest-ranking official of the pro-Nazi Vichy  
regime to be convicted of crimes against humanity committed during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial opened old wounds about French collaboration with the  
Nazis, and his flight has raised questions about the nation's 
determination to confront its role in the Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> TCU's Tomlinson Is Top Rusher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- LaDainian Tomlinson doesn't play on a  
team with national championship hopes, doesn't have a computer 
mousepad with his likeness on it, doesn't have a catchy nickname 
like ``Cool Brees'' and he doesn't sport dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
	All the Texas Christian tailback has is numbers.  
</P>
<P>
	Tomlinson, a junior, is the nation's leading rusher at 177 yards  
per game. By reaching 1,060 yards in six games, he set a school 
record for fewest games to compile 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet ``L.T.,'' as friends and teammates call him, hasn't been  
seen as a serious contender for the Heisman Trophy or the Doak 
Walker Award for the nation's top running back, and he doesn't 
think that's right. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is annoyed by whispers that his stats have been built at  
the expense of weak teams, even though it's true that more than 
half his yards (569) came against Arkansas State and San Jose 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't look at it like that because it's all Division I-A  
football,'' he said. ``You have Tulsa playing Texas A&AMP;M, who has 
good backs, and LSU playing San Jose State. None of those backs got 
the same amount of yards. Every team in Division I-A has some 
talented scholarship players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Tomlinson continues his quest to break the school  
single-season rushing record of 1,611 yards, an interested observer 
is former Buffalo Bills star Kenneth Davis, who has held the mark 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really thought about the quality of competition as a  
factor,'' said Davis, an All-American tailback in 1984 and 
nine-year NFL veteran. ``That's really interesting to me, but I 
still don't think it should matter. With the type of stats he has 
run for and with the young man getting ready to smash my record, I 
would like to think L.T. should be considered for the Heisman. He's 
definitely a great running back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Waco University High School grad shared time in the  
backfield the last two seasons with Basil Mitchell, who made the 
Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent. He rushed for 1,255 
yards during that time and earned second-team All Western Athletic 
Conference honors as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlinson almost lost his chance to finally carry the load when  
he and former TCU basketball star Lee Nailon were arrested on 
charges of marijuana possession and evading arrest in July. But the 
case was eventually dropped and Tomlinson was cleared of any 
wrong-doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really bothered me how everything went down,'' he said. ``I  
was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. But now I've learned 
from it and I've moved on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that episode firmly behind him, Tomlinson burst onto the  
national scene against then top 25-ranked Arizona with 170 yards 
and a touchdown in a 35-31 TCU loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he's getting most of the carries, Tomlinson is showing  
what he can do. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of our best offensive weapons,'' TCU coach Dennis  
Franchione said. ``Whoever stands at the tailback position in this 
offense needs to produce. L.T. is certainly going to get his 
opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlinson has learned the downside of success, too. Such as when  
Fresno State limited him to 49 yards on 20 carries three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys talked trash to me, trying to get me out of my  
game,'' he said. ``They were saying stuff like, `Where's your 
Heisman now?' So I've just had to go out and focus on my game and 
not worry about what they or anybody else is saying about me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even in one of his lesser outings this year, Tomlinson earned  
the respect of Fresno State coach Pat Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the guy has big-time ability,'' Hill said. ``You've  
really got to want to tackle this guy. He's also very good in the 
open field. He's got it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not everything. He's lacking some sort of novelty or  
uniqueness that would help carve a national identity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Tomlinson has four tattoos, but that's old news these  
days. His only two piercings are in each ear. 
</P>
<P>
	How about a signature touchdown dance?  
</P>
<P>
	``You know, that's pretty funny, because a lot of people have  
asked me about that,'' Tomlinson said, laughing. ``Maybe I need to 
see if I can find some dance I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While TCU offensive coordinator Dan Dodd will try helping  
Tomlinson get to the end zone, he doesn't want to have anything to 
do with what Tomlinson does once he gets there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trust me, there will be no dances,'' Dodd said. ``Well, maybe  
if the offensive line gets up there and shakes it with him. But it 
wouldn't be a pretty sight.''

<HEADLINE> Nomura, Nikko Report Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Bouncing back from last year's losses, two top  
Japanese brokerages, Nomura Securities and Nikko Securities, posted 
robust first-half profits generated in part by strong gains on the 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura Securities Co. reported Friday a group net profit of  
54.73 billion yen, or $519 million, for the six months through 
September in contrast to a loss of 207.26 billion yen a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Nomura's group earnings were squeezed by massive  
trading losses overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Nikko Securities Co. reported earnings of 54.63  
billion yen, or $518 million, in the first half versus a loss of 
57.72 billion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Both brokerage concerns said their latest results were  
underpinned by surging trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the exchange's major  
barometer, began the fiscal year at 16,327.56 points but rose as 
high as 18,623.15 at one point during the day in July -- the highest 
intraday level since September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei has since settled back, closing Friday at 17,438.80.  
</P>
<P>
	Nikko's earnings were also helped by the joint venture it set up  
with Citigroup in March, spinning off its wholesale securities 
operations to Nikko Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint venture contribited revenue of 67 billion yen, or $635  
million, out of the group's overall revenue of 234.15 billion yen, 
or $2.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Colts Add Jones to Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- With the availability of E.G. Green and  
Jerome Pathon still up in the air for Sunday's game with 
Cincinnati, the Indianapolis Colts made a roster move Friday to try 
and shore up their injury-depleted receiving corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The team activated former Purdue standout Isaac Jones from the  
physically unable to perform list for Sunday's home game. To make 
room for Jones, Lake Dawson was placed on injured reserve, meaning 
he will miss the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerome didn't do anything (today) and we just kind of rested  
E.G.,'' Colts coach Jim Mora said Friday following a spirited 
indoor workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Green and Pathon are still recovering from minor knee injuries,  
and both are listed as questionable. Marvin Harrison and rookie 
Terrence Wilkins are expected to be the Colts' starting receivers 
against Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	In regards to the roster moves, Mora said something had to be  
done to help provide better depth at a key position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just felt like we had do that with the way that the  
receiver situation was,'' Mora said. ``That means that we'll have 
to make a decision Sunday probably as to whether Jerome can play or 
not. He's the one least-ready to play. If he can't play, then Ike 
(Jones) would be playing Sunday. I don't know yet though. It could 
be that either one of them (Green and Pathon) will be out. We'll 
just have to wait and see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mora has been impressed with Jones' progress in rehabilitating  
an injured foot. He missed most of training camp as well as the 
first five games with the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Ike,'' Mora said. ``He's worked hard. He's a good-sized  
guy. He catches well, he runs good routes. He has good speed. He's 
been impressive out here for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, running back Keith Elias missed his third day of  
practice Friday with recurring headaches. Elias has been sidelined 
since incurring a mild concession in last week's game at the New 
York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	``No word yet on Keith,'' Mora said. ``We know that he's going  
to the doctor again this afternoon (Friday) and have another 
checkup. I probably won't know anything more on him until later 
today or tomorrow (Saturday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Elias cannot play Sunday, running back Darick Holmes is  
expected to be activated. Holmes, who signed with the Colts as a 
free agent in the spring, has been sidelined since mid-August with 
a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeties Tito Wooten (hamstring) and Jason Belser (groin),  
offensive guard Waverly Jackson (ankle), and defensive end Chad 
Bratzke (ankle) are all listed as probable for Sunday.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European share prices rose sharply Friday, lifted  
by technology and oil stocks. The U.S. equity market's morning rise 
supported European gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 614 European companies rose 5.72  
points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 306.75. The technology index, 
the best performer, rose 5.1 percent, followed by energy, which 
rose 3.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericsson shares climbed 15 percent after the company announced  
it expects a ``strong improvement in performance'' for next year, 
with order intake up 36 percent in the third quarter and 13 percent 
in the nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finnish technology company Nokia rose 6 percent after  
reporting third-quarter results up 36 percent, with mobile phone 
sales up 58 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the oil sector, BP Amoco and Shell rose with the front-month  
Brent contract rising 64 cents to $22.75 a barrel on London's 
International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Philips Electronics rose 5.1 percent, adding to Thursday's 2.5  
percent gain, which followed the company reporting a 
better-than-expected third-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
	In Frankfurt, shares of SAP rose 5.6 percent, recovering from  
sharp declines that followed the release of downward earnings 
adjustments two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other gainers, utility RWE continued its rise after saying  
Thursday it plans to merge with VEW to form Europe's largest 
privately held utility. RWE shares closed up 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets have been pretty resilient this week,'' said Joe  
Hall, head of marketing for European equities at Deutsche Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows there's going to be a U.S. rate increase, and  
that is being discounted in the market. People are expecting a 
European increase as well, and the markets are coming to terms with 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 310 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed up 6.12 points at 
323.32.

<HEADLINE> Joopy Doopy Wins Sunny Slopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Joopy Doopy overtook Orangeman and Here's  
Zealous in the late going to win Friday's $78,350 Sunny Slopes 
Stakes in Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Victor Espinoza, Joopy Doopy covered six furlongs in  
1:08 4-5 and paid $17.80, $6.60 and $3.40. The winning time was 2-5 
of a second off the stakes record set by Thisnearlywasmine in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the second in five lifetime starts for Joopy  
Doopy and was worth $47,010, increasing the career earnings of the 
2-year-old son of Gilded Time to $101,459. 
</P>
<P>
	Orangeman, the 2-1 second choice ridden by Chris McCarron,  
crossed the finish line a head in front of Here's Zealous and 
returned $4.20 and $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's Zealous, the 7-5 favorite ridden by Iggy Puglisi, was two  
lengths ahead of Magical Dragon at the wire and paid $2.20 to show.

<HEADLINE> S.E. Asia Said Committed to Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Southeast Asian countries remain  
committed to economic reform despite their unexpectedly fast 
recovery from financial crisis, an official of a regional 
association of governments said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodolfo Severino, secretary general of the Association of  
Southeast Asian Nations, said there was some concern that the rapid 
recovery in the region would diminish efforts for reform. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there is ``no sign that there is such a  
slackening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``ASEAN is trying to ensure that these reforms continue and that  
no development that could affect everybody would surprise us 
again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, an executive of the U.S. investment banking firm  
Goldman Sachs, speaking in Singapore, urged Asian companies to 
reform how they operate and focus on core businesses to sustain the 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's economic crisis, which began in July 1997, has been  
blamed on government favoritism toward certain companies, 
inadequate financial regulation, and massive flows of foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN leaders will hold their annual summit next month in  
Manila. 
</P>
<P>
	An ASEAN Free Trade Area will be ``substantially completed''  
early next year, with 85 percent of goods traded within the region 
subjected to no more than a 5 percent tariff, he said. Most ASEAN 
goods will be tariff-free a few years after that, Severino said. 
</P>
<P>
	ASEAN consists of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,  
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Richard Gnodde of Goldman Sachs said Friday that the  
improving economic performance in the region should give 
governments support to continue making reforms rather than creating 
a sense of complacency. 
</P>
<P>
	Governments already have made progress in strengthening market  
oversight, bankruptcy laws and other regulations, said Gnodde, who 
heads the merchant bank's operations in Asia outside of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's economies and markets have rebounded far faster  
than expected from the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market capitalization in the Asian region outside of Japan  
has returned to the pre-crisis level of $2 trillion, after plunging 
60 percent, Gnodde said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said mergers and acquisitions are also picking up. The value  
of announced or completed mergers and acquisitions so far this year 
has come to $100 billion, surpassing the $70 billion recorded in 
the nine months of 1997 before the crisis broke out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the equities markets, he said new share issues have hit a  
record $18.3 billion this year, reflecting increased investor 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economic prosperity will help governments continue down the  
path of Peform,'' Gnodde said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Soccer Team Touring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- For those who wondered where American women's  
soccer team was going following a World Cup championship that drew 
unparalleled attention to the sport, here's the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next 2 1/2 months, it will go from Pittsburgh to Cleveland  
to Chicago and New York, Raleigh to Anaheim and San Jose and five 
other cities during an exhibition tour similar to those 
post-Olympic swings by figure skaters and gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
	How about that: a sport that once was a blip on the national  
sports map is going where only Mary Lou Retton and Tara Lipinski 
went before -- into the arenas of America, with major league ticket 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember, this is women's soccer, not hockey or the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is important because we're getting to play in cities and  
venues where we never could have played before,'' Mia Hamm said of 
a tour that starts tonight in Pittsburgh. ``It's exciting, because 
there's still a lot of buzz about what we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tour will help the U.S. national team keep their game legs  
during what usually is a down period before an Olympic year. It 
also will keep the sport before a public that is embracing women's 
athletics like never before. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will raise the kind of cash that, before the U.S. team's  
overtime shootout victory over China in the Rose Bowl, simply was 
not associated with any women's sport but figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
	And, after the Sydney Olympics, it is possible a U.S. pro league  
might be formed in 2001 to rival the men's MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to play before 3,000 outdoors, now it's 30,000, 40,000  
every place we play, and that's amazing,'' goaltender Briana Scurry 
said. ``It's good because now we don't have to do as much 
promotion, because people are excited about the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So excited that the tour sponsors are asking, and getting, top  
dollar for tickets. Prices tonight in the Civic Arena range from 
$18 to $35; a nice-sized crowd is expected, though it won't be a 
sellout. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of doors have opened up for us since Pasadena,'' team  
captain Carla Overbeck said. ``It's unbelievable that so many big 
names and big corporations are behind the team, putting up 
sponsorship money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players are as curious as anyone to see how their game  
translates indoors, where women's soccer has seldom ventured 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm going to get killed,'' said Scurry, accustomed to  
playing in wide-open stadiums, not cozy arenas on an artificial 
playing field surrounded by protective glass. ``I'm going to wear 
arm pads, knee pads, all the protective padding I can get. I'll 
probably need a helmet by the end. I just hope I don't break 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most players have minimal indoor experience, derived mostly from  
two charity games played in Milwaukee for Hamm's brother, Garrett, 
who had a rare blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	There is nothing at stake in the games against a collection of  
international players, but Hamm suggested that might change after a 
game or two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Soccer players are competitive by nature, but I hope we're not  
out to kill each other,'' she said. ``I had enough stress this 
summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the top names -- Hamm, Scurry, Brandi Chastain, Michelle  
Akers, Joy Fawcett, Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, Tiffeny Milbrett -- 
will play, though only 12 will appear in each city. Some have other 
commitments, such as Tiffany Roberts, who will juggle appearances 
with classwork at North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	That there is a tour at all remains a sense of wonderment to  
players such as Overbeck and Hamm, who spent years on the team when 
it was watched mostly by curious youngsters and soccer moms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is important because we all want a pro league, and this  
can only help,'' Hamm said.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets 4 Months for Killing Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A man who shot his wife to death after  
finding her with a lover got four months in prison Friday -- about 
as much as the judge could impose after the jury recommended only 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not how we wanted the case to turn out,'' prosecutor  
James Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the jury found Jimmy Watkins guilty of murder  
but decided he acted with ``sudden passion'' when he discovered his 
wife, Nancy, with Keith Fontenot at the couple's home last 
December. The jury recommended 10 years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Judge Robert Gill sentenced Watkins to four months in  
prison in addition to the probation. Because of the jury's 
recommendation, the most the judge could have given Watkins was six 
months behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins admitted killing his wife and wounding her lover. He  
claimed temporary insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins still faces trial on attempted murder charges in the  
shooting of Fontenot. He could get life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors said they recommended probation because they didn't think  
Watkins could be rehabilitated in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel for the family, but Jimmy needs help. The prison  
system just won't give him help,'' juror Alex Davis told the Fort 
Worth Star-Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
	Another juror, James Laurie, e-mailed the newspaper, saying: ``I  
pray Jimmy will use the break that we gave him to turn his life 
back in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watkins bowed his head and wept as the jury's decision was  
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure it was a very difficult decision for that jury to  
wrestle with, but we're pleased with their decision,'' defense 
attorney Kyle Whitaker said.

<HEADLINE>  Cohen Oversees War Games in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL-OMAYED, Egypt (AP) -- Egyptian, British and Dutch troops  
jumped out of inflatable rafts Friday and charged up a 
Mediterranean beach. American warplanes screeched overhead while 
U.S., Italian and Greek troops trudged through whirling sand 
whipped up by helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	The biannual Bright Star war games brought together 11 nations  
in a show of force that has been a tradition since 1981. U.S. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen, who watched the troops storm the 
beach, said Iraq should take notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``One country that is not represented here today should pay very  
close attention to what Bright Star represents,'' Cohen told 
reporters after proclaiming the drill a success. ``(Iraqi 
President) Saddam Hussein remains an outlaw in his own 
neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a clear reference to Saddam, Cohen said the nations taking  
part in the maneuvers are ``building prosperity for their people 
and not palaces for their cronies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amphibious assault exercises are intended to improve the  
ability of troops from the United States, Europe and the Middle 
East to work together in times of war. The maneuvers, which will 
finish Nov. 2, began 18 years ago as an U.S.-Egyptian training 
exercise and have grown to include nearly 70,000 troops, including 
18,000 Americans from all branches of the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, France and Germany  
have joined this year's drills, the largest coalition since the 
1991 Gulf War against Iraq . 
</P>
<P>
	At El-Omayed, 50 miles west of the port city of Alexandria,  
British hovercrafts glided ashore. Egyptian soldiers jumped out on 
the sand, raced up the beach and shouted ``Allahu Akbar!'' -- ``God 
is Great!'' -- at an invisible enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen watched the landing from stands on the beach along with  
his Egyptian counterpart, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, British 
Defense Minister Geoffrey Hoon and the man in charge of U.S. forces 
in the Gulf, Gen. Anthony Zinni. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command, Lt. Gen.  
Michael Dodson, said he was pleased with the maneuvers given their 
complexity and language barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly gives everyone confidence,'' Dodson said. ``We  
don't all have to have the exact same equipment, but we have to 
know what each other's procedures are so that we can work 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the United States was not only keeping an eye on Iraq  
but also on Iran. U.S.-Iranian relations have improved slightly in 
recent years, but Cohen said the United States would continue to 
watch Iran closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will cooperate and work with all of our partners and allies  
in the region to make sure that no country would seek to undermine 
the peace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, Cohen held talks with Egyptian President Hosni  
Mubarak on the Middle East peace process and regional defense 
issues such as cooperation in the face of attacks with biological 
or chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who is touring nine Middle East countries, was expected  
to leave Egypt Saturday for Kuwait and then make stops in Oman, 
Jordan and Israel. He has already visited Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi 
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> USOC To Vote on Drug Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Seeking to quell criticism of its  
drug-testing program, the U.S. Olympic Committee is expected to 
approve an independent agency to control everything from test 
samples to sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency would take domestic drug testing entirely out of  
the USOC's hands and remove the USOC and its governing bodies from 
the hearing process. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC board of directors, meeting Saturday and Sunday, will  
vote on whether to approve funding of up to $24 million for four 
years for the new agency, double the amount the USOC now spends on 
drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, one of the byproducts of this would be to take us  
out of the glare of the kind of criticism that we get, particularly 
from European countries, that we do our own drug testing, therefore 
we're the fox guarding the henhouse,'' USOC spokesman Mike Moran 
said. ``This group would have a board of directors and employees 
that would be chosen by itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, which would still use IOC-accredited labs in  
Indianapolis and Los Angeles, would be responsible for the 
collection of test samples, handling, processing, transportation, 
lab results, notification, sanctions and the appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new agency is approved, a bid process will be held to  
select the company that would run the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of independence is similar to one faced by the  
International Olympic Committee, which wants to have its World 
Anti-Doping Agency operating by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. drug adviser Barry McCaffrey, who has criticized the IOC's  
drug-testing efforts, met Wednesday in Washington with IOC vice 
president Dick Pound at a Senate Commerce Comittee hearing on drugs 
in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the IOC's third appearance of the year on Capitol Hill.  
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch is to appear before a House 
committee in December to discuss IOC reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharpest criticism of the IOC at the hearing came from  
Doriane Coleman, a Duke law professor who helped set up 
out-of-competition testing in the United States in the 1980s. She 
called WADA ``a false start'' because it lacks independence and 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	WADA initially plans to conduct 5,000 out-of-competition tests a  
year and defer testing in some sports to existing federations. 
</P>
<P>
	``So long as testing continues to be conducted by the IOC or  
member entities ... then nothing's being done,'' Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound countered that since the IOC has only one-eighth  
representation on WADA's board, the IOC cannot control the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman praised the USOC's plan to remove drug testing from its  
control, but said it still wouldn't be completely independent since 
the board of the agency will be composed of USOC members or those 
selected by the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran defended the agency's independence. He said non-USOC  
members would be picked by ``public-sector members of the USOC who 
have no affiliation with USOC organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other items on the USOC board's agenda this weekend are the  
selection of the U.S. bid city for the 2007 Pan American Games -- 
either the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina or San Antonio -- 
and a report on restructuring the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by McKinsey and Co., which has been making a  
management review of the USOC for nearly six months, will recommend 
structural changes. Among those will be a redefinition of the 
duties of the president and executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendations will require a change in the USOC  
constitution, which could not take place before the next board 
meeting in February.

<HEADLINE>  Cohen Oversees War Games in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL-OMAYED, Egypt (AP) -- Egyptian, British and Dutch troops  
jumped out of inflatable rafts Friday and charged up a 
Mediterranean beach. American warplanes screeched overhead while 
U.S., Italian and Greek troops trudged through whirling sand 
whipped up by helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	The biannual Bright Star war games brought together 11 nations  
in a show of force that has been a tradition since 1981. U.S. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen, who watched the troops storm the 
beach, said Iraq should take notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``One country that is not represented here today should pay very  
close attention to what Bright Star represents,'' Cohen told 
reporters after proclaiming the drill a success. ``(Iraqi 
President) Saddam Hussein remains an outlaw in his own 
neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a clear reference to Saddam, Cohen said the nations taking  
part in the maneuvers are ``building prosperity for their people 
and not palaces for their cronies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amphibious assault exercises are intended to improve the  
ability of troops from the United States, Europe and the Middle 
East to work together in times of war. The maneuvers, which will 
finish Nov. 2, began 18 years ago as an U.S.-Egyptian training 
exercise and have grown to include nearly 70,000 troops, including 
18,000 Americans from all branches of the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, France and Germany  
have joined this year's drills, the largest coalition since the 
1991 Gulf War against Iraq . 
</P>
<P>
	At El-Omayed, 50 miles west of the port city of Alexandria,  
British hovercrafts glided ashore. Egyptian soldiers jumped out on 
the sand, raced up the beach and shouted ``Allahu Akbar!'' -- ``God 
is Great!'' -- at an invisible enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen watched the landing from stands on the beach along with  
his Egyptian counterpart, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, British 
Defense Minister Geoffrey Hoon and the man in charge of U.S. forces 
in the Gulf, Gen. Anthony Zinni. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command, Lt. Gen.  
Michael Dodson, said he was pleased with the maneuvers given their 
complexity and language barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This certainly gives everyone confidence,'' Dodson said. ``We  
don't all have to have the exact same equipment, but we have to 
know what each other's procedures are so that we can work 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the United States was not only keeping an eye on Iraq  
but also on Iran. U.S.-Iranian relations have improved slightly in 
recent years, but Cohen said the United States would continue to 
watch Iran closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will cooperate and work with all of our partners and allies  
in the region to make sure that no country would seek to undermine 
the peace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, Cohen held talks with Egyptian President Hosni  
Mubarak on the Middle East peace process and regional defense 
issues such as cooperation in the face of attacks with biological 
or chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who is touring nine Middle East countries, was expected  
to leave Egypt Saturday for Kuwait and then make stops in Oman, 
Jordan and Israel. He has already visited Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi 
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Pizza Hut Airs Clinton-Parody Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Pizza Hut television commercial  
lampooning Hillary Rodham Clinton as a carpetbagger because of her 
undeclared Senate aspirations has some Democrats crying ``strike 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the board of Tricon Foods -- the parent company of Texas-based  
Pizza Hut -- is Kenneth Langone, a billionaire backer of Rudolph 
Giuliani, New York City's Republican mayor and Mrs. Clinton's 
likely rival in next year's Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani also hasn't formally entered the race, but he and Mrs.  
Clinton are raising money to run for the Senate seat being vacated 
by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon's political action committee has donated $2,500 to  
Giuliani's exploratory committee while Langone and his wife each 
have given $1,000, according to Federal Election Commission 
records. Langone once was Giuliani's campaign finance chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite a set of coincidences,'' Mrs. Clinton's campaign  
spokesman Howard Wolfson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Langone vigorously denied any impropriety.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea about this ad until right now,'' he said  
Thursday. ``For anyone to imply anything different is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats weren't convinced.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senatorial  
Campaign Committee, said a tape had been delivered to his office, 
which he said implied a political agenda at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``This demands an investigation into whether this was an illegal  
contribution to the mayor's campaign,'' said Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the commercial -- set to debut during Saturday's World Series  
opener -- a blonde woman sporting a business suit and a heavy 
Southern accent extolls the virtues of Pizza Hut's ``Big New 
Yorker'' pizza. She eats a slice on a bunting-decked platform with 
skyscrapers behind her. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do I know so much about New York pizza?'' she drawls.  
``'Cause New York, I want to be your next senator!'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the commercial, a police officer with a New York  
City accent chimes in ``$9.99! What do they think this is, 
Arkansas?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pizza Hut spokesman Jay Allison described the commercial as  
``just tongue-in-cheek fun'' which was all part of the Big New 
Yorker pizza ad campaign that began in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've used some quintessential New Yorkers to give it New York  
flavor and authenticity,'' Allison said, noting that Donald Trump 
and Spike Lee were in earlier ads. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there were no plans for a parody of Giuliani.  
</P>
<P>
	Tricon spokesman Jonathan Blum said the commercial was ``about  
pizza not politics'' and that the board had not approved it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giuliani camp did not return a telephone call Thursday  
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> El Duque Takes Place of Wells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe Torre likes to say that he could pick his  
No. 1 starter out of a hat. It just so happens the same name always 
comes out first. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez got the nod to start Game 1 of the World  
Series against Atlanta and Torre dropped Roger Clemens to fourth, 
giving the five-time Cy Young Award winner just one possible start 
in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone realized with the year `El Duque' had that he earned  
the right to make the start,'' Torre said Thursday. ``Maybe it will 
be someone else next year. But they all recognize that he has 
earned it this year and he's done nothing in the first two rounds 
to make me change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All he's done is go 2-0 with a 1.17 ERA in three starts against  
Texas and Boston and was the MVP of the AL Championship Series. In 
five career playoff starts, El Duque is 4-0 with an 0.97 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	This sure wasn't the way the Yankees thought their rotation  
would turn out when they traded David Wells for Clemens at the 
beginning of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	But after an inconsistent season and a two-inning outing for  
Clemens in the ALCS against Boston, it's the way Torre went. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how you draw it up,'' Clemens said. ``Everybody's  
got to win a game. Obviously, I want to fare better than I did in 
Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, who will pitch Saturday against Tom Glavine in  
Atlanta, will be followed by David Cone, Andy Pettitte and Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens said he wasn't disappointed about being relegated to the  
No. 4 spot and was looking forward to pitch a World Series game in 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's a No. 1 starter here,'' Clemens said. ``I'm happy  
for the other guys to get the opportunity. Especially El Duque. He 
hasn't really had that opportunity until this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez earned it by winning the Yankees' biggest game in the  
1998 playoffs. With New York trailing Cleveland 2-1 in the ALCS, 
Hernandez allowed three hits in seven scoreless innings to beat the 
Indians and the Yankees didn't lose again in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always had the personality of a No. 1 starter,'' Cone said.  
``From the day he got here he had a presence. He had supreme 
confidence and we have supreme confidence in him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez followed it up this season, leading New York with 17  
wins and 214 1-3 innings. Hernandez uses a high leg kick, a variety 
of arm angles, and a deep arsenal of pitches to fool the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	He is extremely tough on right-handers, using a sharp slider and  
a deceptively explosive fastball to hold them to a .187 average 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hernandez hasn't had success in two starts against Atlanta.  
He is 0-1 with a 9.72 ERA against the Braves, but Torre said that 
did not factor into his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's not hitting his spots and changing speeds, they will  
get him,'' Torre said. ``But I've seen clubs beat him up and he 
comes back to beat the same team. He just needs to have command and 
the count on his side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, on the other hand, has been inconsistent all season.  
After winning back-to-back Cy Young Awards in Toronto, the Rocket 
was expected to step in and be the ace that carried the Yankees to 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it is the rest of the team that has often been called  
upon to carry Clemens. He went 14-10 with a career-high 4.60 ERA in 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of individual success,'' Clemens said. ``I've  
won 20 games a lot before and ERA titles and the triple crown in 
back-to-back years. There's no doubt I'd rather be in this 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, who has publicly backed Clemens through his season-long  
struggles, finally revealed a bit of doubt when he picked Pettitte 
over Clemens to start Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andy has pitched well,'' Torre said. ``Almost everybody would  
be available in a seventh game. I still think left-handers have a 
bit of an edge against them because it neutralizes (Ryan) Klesko, 
and he's a big part of their offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes: Torre said Jim Leyritz, not on the roster for the ALCS, will  
be on the team for the World Series. Leyritz, whose homer in Game 4 
of the 1996 Series shifted the momentum, takes the place of Shane 
Spencer. ... The Yankees have not decided on their relievers for 
the Series. Jason Grimsley, who did not make the roster in the 
first two rounds, could be added in place of Hideki Irabu. ... Luis 
Sojo missed the workout to spend time with his ailing father.

<HEADLINE> Knight Shoots Friend While Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOONER, Wis. (AP) -- Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight  
accidentally shot a friend while hunting and was cited by state 
authorities for violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said his trigger finger slipped before he was ready to  
shoot at a bird, and his friend was hit with pellets in the back 
and shoulder. The man was not seriously injured but required 
medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Natural Resources said Thursday that Knight  
will be cited for failing to report a hunting accident. He also 
will receive citations for hunting without a license in 1999 and 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Under state law, Knight was required to report the accident. The  
fine for each citation is $165. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, Thomas Mikunda and two other men were hunting Oct. 12  
when they spotted a grouse, said Dave Zeug, law enforcement 
director for the DNR's northern region. 
</P>
<P>
	The 59-year-old coach told investigators that as he turned to  
aim at the bird, his finger slipped off the shotgun's safety. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the investigation, it was determined Knight did  
not have a $43 nonresident small game license and that he also 
hunted without one last year in Wisconsin, as did two of his 
hunting companions. The two companions will receive similar 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight told investigators he didn't think he needed the license  
to hunt on private property. 
</P>
<P>
	An unsigned statement by Indiana University said: ``This is a  
matter that is outside the scope of coach Knight's university 
duties. The university, however, recognizes that matters relating 
to coach Knight receive significant attention. ... The university 
is confident that coach Knight will respond appropriately to 
resolve this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight did not immediately return a message from The Associated  
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	DNR warden Gerald Carow, who is investigating the shooting, said  
he talked to Knight on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's feeling bad that it happened and feels deeply concerned  
over the victim and is willing to pay any penalty,'' Carow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikunda, an insurance agent, was not carrying a gun at the time.  
He was treated and released at Marshfield Clinic-Ladysmith Center 
in Ladysmith.

<HEADLINE> Cambridge Makes Demand of AT&AMP;T </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The city of Cambridge is demanding that  
AT&AMP;T provide ``open access'' to high-speed Internet connections as 
a condition of a planned cable television franchise transfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would require AT&AMP;T to provide access to MediaOne's  
Roadrunner service to rival Internet service providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has authority to insist on the access requirement  
because it is being asked to approve the proposed transfer of the 
local cable franchise from MediaOne to AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T has a deal to buy 
MediaOne for $58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Without access to RoadRunner's fast connections, America Online,  
Mindspring GTE and other competitors contend that they cannot 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies and some consumer groups want MediaOne to be  
required to make deals allowing its competitors to resell 
RoadRunner access to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T must respond to the demand by Wednesday, City Manager  
Robert Healy told The Boston Globe on Thursday. He said he expects 
AT&AMP;T and state regulators to oppose the city's open-access demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say whether we are going to sue or take other  
action,'' Rick Jenkinson, spokesman for AT&AMP;T, told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In federal court, the company is challenging similar demands  
made by officials in Portland, Ore., and Broward County, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Pay 'Travel Loans' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians who fled their war-torn  
homeland for the U.S. must reimburse relief agencies for their 
airfare here, according to their refugee contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The repayment of so-called ``travel loans'' has been official  
U.S. policy for all refugees since at least 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kosovo refugees told The Star-Ledger of Newark in a story  
published today they were shocked by the repayment rule and felt 
they had no choice but to sign the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are refugees. We left our country for war,'' said Ardian  
Pelaj, 22, who was studying to be a civil engineer when Serb police 
expelled him under threat of death. He now lives in a church 
rectory in Elizabeth, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees who have returned to Kosovo do not have to pay airfare  
because the U.S. government promised them free passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The recouped money is only a fraction of the organizations' cost  
of resettling the refugees, relief officials said. It amounts to 
$760 per person for those settling in New Jersey, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have to pay it right away, and they make small  
installments over time,'' said Lauren Engel, a spokeswoman for the 
International Organization for Migration. ``It helps them build 
credit, and it's not something outrageous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials normally explain the travel loan rules to refugees in  
their native language before they step onto the plane. Relief 
agencies acknowledged that, due to the speedy nature of the Kosovo 
effort, many ethnic Albanians may not have been told until they 
arrived at the refugee center at Fort Dix. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, refugees from around the world have repaid $50  
million in travel loans, which covered the expenses of about 85,000 
migrants. The State Department typically provides the agencies with 
the remainder of their airlift costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Runkles, comptroller of the State Department's Bureau of  
Population, Refugees and Migration, said about half of all refugees 
repay the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Thursday, 2,462 of the 14,129 refugees airlifted to the  
United States had returned to Kosovo, the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Houston's Barkley To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Rockets forward Charles Barkley said  
Friday he will announce his retirement Sunday, effective at 
season's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Barkley has threatened several times in recent  
years to retire, but the 6-foot-6 forward insisted this time he 
means it. He said he will make the announcement at halftime of 
Sunday's exhibition game between the Rockets and Detroit Pistons at 
Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Birmingham is less than a half-hour's drive from his hometown of  
Leeds, Ala., so his family will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Barkley's 16th NBA season.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's just time,'' said Barkley, who has been upgraded to  
questionable for Sunday's game after missing the last four 
preseason games with tendinitis in his right elbow. ``It's time. 
That's it. I'm not going to answer any more questions about it. 
It's just time.

	``I don't know what I'm going to do (after he retires). I might  
just take some time off. But I'm making it official Sunday. I'm 
announcing it there (in Birmingham) because that's my hometown, and 
I'll have a lot of family and friends there. This is my last year, 
period. I don't care how well I'm playing -- this is it. I want to 
get it over with, and that's it. I'm looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley has long been one of the league's top draws, especially  
internationally. He was on the original Dream Team, playing with 
Michael Jordan, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson on the juggernaut that 
won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Barkley, then with the Phoenix Suns, teamed with  
current Rockets teammate Hakeem Olajuwon on the U.S. team that won 
a gold medal in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Charles has decided that this is his last season, then we  
should all relish one more chance to be entertained by one of the 
most spectacular players in NBA history,'' NBA deputy commissioner 
Russ Granik told the Houston Chronicle. ``Charles is certainly a 
one-of-a-kind personality, but first and foremost, he is a truly 
great talent on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockets owner Leslie Alexander agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's one of the greatest who ever played the game,''  
Alexander said. ``He is a great player, but he also made the game 
fun. People love to be around Charles, and an attitude like that is 
rare in any sport. His routine will be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley averaged less than 10 rebounds only once, when he  
averaged 8.6 as a rookie with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1984-85. 
Entering this season, Barkley has scored 23,468 points (13th on the 
career list) and pulled down 12,337 rebounds, once leading the 
league (14.6 in 1986-87) and hauling in a career-high 33 in his 
first game as a Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the NBA's second leading rebounder last season with 12.3  
per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who said he is not surprised by the decision, is  
happy to have Barkley play his last game as a Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely,'' Alexander said. ``It's nice to have a great one  
retire in your uniform. And he's one of the greatest of all.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers Say Farewell to Market Square </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- It was the site of Elvis Presley's farewell  
and Michael Jordan's return. Mike Tyson had his Indianapolis debut 
there, and Hulk Hogan even lost a world wrestling title. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuses, rock concerts, religious crusades and, of course, lots  
of basketball marked the 25-year history of Market Square Arena. On 
Friday night, the Indiana Pacers played their final game there, a 
97-65 exhibition victory over the Utah Jazz. They will move into 
the new Conseco Fieldhouse for the start of the 1999-00 NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it was an exhibition game, we understood the  
significance of it. The guys came out and played really well,'' 
said Reggie Miller, who has played his entire career with the 
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know how much nostalgia this place had until  
tonight,'' said Sam Perkins, a 15-year NBA veteran but starting 
only his second season with Indiana. ``I can't pick one event from 
all that's happened here, but at the end, you still feel goose 
bumps. It's a sad moment for this place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final game Friday night ended with a video of the arena's  
highlights. Most of the players stayed on the court as the arena 
darkened for the video, followed by a shower of confetti floating 
from the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't hit you until right now. The video at the end made  
it more emotional,'' center Rik Smits said. ``I always enjoy that 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16,000-seat Market Square Arena -- now a relic by NBA  
standards -- was built in 1974 for $24 million, which now seems like 
a bargain compared with the $175 million price tag on the new 
18,500-seat fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pacers owners Mel and Herb Simon, millionaire shopping mall  
developers, began pushing city officials several years ago to build 
the new arena with corporate suites and club seating. They claimed 
the team was losing money without such facilities to attract fans 
and big corporate bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction of the new fieldhouse, four blocks south of Market  
Square in downtown Indianapolis, began in July 1997. It will be 
inaugurated Nov. 6 with the Pacers' home opener against the Boston 
Celtics, coach Larry Bird's former team and the same club the 
Pacers faced in their NBA debut in 1976, two years after Market 
Square opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers' first home, when they still played in and dominated  
the old American Basketball Association, was the Coliseum at the 
State Fairgrounds from 1967-73. Crowds were sparse, but the Pacers' 
success, along with the increasing rivalry between the ABA and NBA, 
eventually led to the move downtown to the then-new Market Square 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The arena played to some notable firsts:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Pacers' first game in Market Square, an exhibition against  
the Milwaukee Bucks of the NBA, drew a capacity 16,929, double the 
attendance at their ABA regular-season opener against the San 
Antonio Spurs. Two years later, the Pacers, the Spurs, the New York 
Nets and the Denver Nuggets were absorbed by the older league, and 
Indiana's first NBA game in Market Square was a 129-122 overtime 
loss to the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	--Market Square Arena was the home of the Indianapolis Racers of  
the now-defunct World Hockey Association, and a teen-age Wayne 
Gretzky -- now in hockey's Hall of Fame -- made his pro debut as a 
member of the Racers in the arena in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mike Tyson also was a teen-ager when he first fought in  
Indianapolis in 1982 -- 10 years before he was convicted and sent to 
prison in Indiana for raping a Miss Black America pageant 
contestant. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two years later, Andre the Giant defeated Hulk Hogan for the  
World Wrestling Federation heavyweight title at Market Square Arena 
in the sport's first live prime-time network telecast since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	--Jordan, who quit basketball and played one season of pro  
baseball, ended his retirement and scored 19 points in his comeback 
game against the Pacers at Market Square Arena in 1995. Indiana won 
103-96 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	The arena has seen more than just sports. Elvis' final concert  
was in Market Square Arena in 1977, two months before he died at 
42. And among the final events was an appearance in August by the 
Dalai Lama, who spoke at the start of a 12-day visit to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at the dawn of the millennium, the Pacers are headed to  
their new home.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Probes Russian Exec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank is investigating allegations  
one of its former Washington-based Russian officials passed along 
inside information to a Russian bank that lost its license last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The former official, Leonid Grigoriev, has been placed on  
administrative leave by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in Moscow, 
a Moscow-based policy analysis institute he now heads, the bank 
said Friday. The institute is supported by a World Bank loan and 
the action against him was requested by the Russian government, the 
bank said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations against Grigoriev, appointed by Russia to its World  
Bank mission from 1992 to 1997, were reported Friday in The Wall 
Street Journal. Bank spokesman Jan Pakulsky said the matter was 
brought to the bank's attention by the Journal when it asked for 
comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal report cited documents indicating that Grigoriev  
provided Moscow-based Inkombank with tips on debt-marketing 
investments and acted as its liaison in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Inkombank, one of Russia's largest banks until it lost its  
license last year, has surfaced in U.S. investigators' examination 
of the Bank of New York, through which the Russian mob is believed 
to have funneled $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Russian banking authorities issued an audit linking  
Inkombank to criminal activity and recommending that its business 
be curtailed. The bank folded a year ago, claiming $1.5 billion in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal reported that Grigoriev acknowledges assisting  
Inkombank while in Washington but denies providing confidential 
information or receiving regular payments. 
</P>
<P>
	While at the World Bank, Grigoriev served as alternative  
executive director for the Russian Federation office and later as 
an adviser to the executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``In view of the recent chargers brought to the World Bank's  
attention, the bank has launched a full investigation as a matter 
of urgency'' to determine whether any action is warranted, the bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the bank had hired a law firm, Venable, Baetjer, Howard  
&AMP; Ciovilette, to help with the inquiry. The Russian office at the 
bank and the Russian government also were cooperating fully, it 
said.

<HEADLINE> Breeders Eliminations No Surprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMPBELLVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- The Firepan, who won the Metro  
Pace last month at Woodbine, stamped himself the favorite for the 
$823,347 Breeders Crown 2-year-old colt pace with a strong 
performance Friday night in the elimination heats at Mohawk 
Racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	Favorites dominated the night of elimination heats as the  
continent's best 2-year-old pacers and trotters tuned up for next 
Friday's $5.3 million Breeders Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Firepan, driven by John Campbell, battled I Scoot Hanover  
and Wicked Island before pulling away to win by 1 1/4 lengths in 
1:55.1. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyberwood finished second and I Scoot Hanover held on for third.  
</P>
<P>
	The Firepan will face, among others, Astreos, who won his  
elimination in 1:56.4 as the odds-on choice in front of driver 
Chris Christoforou. It was the fifth win in seven starts for 
Astreos. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Diggler, the 3-1 second choice driven by Ron Pierce, won  
the third elimination in 1:56.4. Favorite Twin B Champ was second 
by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
	The $662,529 2-year-old colt trot final appears to be wide open  
after impressive elimination performances by Dreamaster, Super 
Spicy and longshot Earl of Stormont. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamaster, driven by Dave Magee, coasted home by five lengths  
over Monte Hall and Thunderous in 2:00.3. It was the seventh win in 
10 starts for the son of Victory Dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Spicy, a son of Super Bowl, won the fastest of the three  
trotting colt eliminations, a three-length winner over even-money 
favorite Credit Winner in 1:59.3. Driven by Dave Miller, Super 
Spicy won for the ninth time in 14 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The third elimination went to 38-1 shot Earl of Stormont, driven  
by Trevor Ritchie, who split the pack in mid-stretch and posted a 
two-length win over Smokn Lantern and Berndt Hanover in 2:00.2. It 
was the fifth win in 10 starts for Earl of Stormont. 
</P>
<P>
	Eternal Camnation, the 2-year-old pacing filly sensation who  
went off as the 1-5 favorite with Eric Ledford in the sulky, staked 
her claim as the one to beat in the $637,833 final after jogging 
home 7 1/4 lengths ahead of CR Hot Salsa and Michelles Revenge in 
1:54.3. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter of Cam Fella has won 11 of 12 starts and more than  
$340,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Her next test will likely come from undefeated Arts Virtue, who  
registered a two-length win over Armbro Terrace in 1:55.2 in her 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth win for Arts Virtue, who just started racing  
Sept. 29 but has recorded several impressive victories, including a 
three-length win in the $394,100 Three Diamonds at Garden State 
Park on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Unbeaten Cherished Victory stamped herself the likely choice for  
the $652,092 2-year-old filly trot final following a workmanlike 
half-length victory over long shot Echo Hanover, with Aviano two 
lengths back in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Her biggest challenge may come from Bold Dreamer, who recorded  
an impressive victory of 1:59.2 in her heat.

<HEADLINE> Gore, AARP Talk About Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- ``Flo,'' a feisty television commercial  
character who doesn't want the government to mess with her health 
plan, is no match for a New Hampshire woman of the same name, Vice 
President Al Gore said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting with members of AARP, the nation's largest lobbying  
group for older Americans, Gore criticized the ad, which features 
an elderly woman worrying about the Clinton administration's plan 
to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare. The advertisements 
are financed mainly by drug companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The facts in those commercials, just like that character, are  
fictional,'' said Gore, who is seeking the Democratic presidential 
nomination. ``Let me tell you about a real Flo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he met 88-year-old Florence Seitz of Raymond at a  
similar New Hampshire forum in June, and that she often takes half 
of her prescribed medication to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	``She makes hard choices about which prescriptions she is going  
to do without and which ones she is going to cut back on,'' Gore 
said. ``She feels she has to choose between her medication and her 
food and her rent. We shouldn't put seniors in that position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also highlighted his plan to make it easier for families to  
care for elderly relatives after hearing Joanne Farley describe the 
difficulties she and her husband have caring for her 82-year-old 
mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manchester woman said their biggest problem is affording  
respite care to give the couple a break. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my husband and I decide to go somewhere together it would  
cost us more than $1,600 a week to bring someone in,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said that, if elected, he would push for giving families  
tax credits to help pay for long-term care, and starting a national 
support network for families. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a crushing burden that is often invisible to the rest  
of the community because the people who shoulder the burden don't 
get out much,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar Serard, of Concord, told Gore about his grandson's  
struggle with diabetes and an intestinal disease. He said insurance 
companies have refused to pay for the most effective drug treatment 
doctors have found for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason was there were other alternatives, but the other  
medications did not work,'' Serard said. He asked Gore how he would 
hold health maintenance organizations and insurance companies more 
accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he supports federal legislation giving patients new  
rights in dealing with HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Tornow, a registered Republican from Merrimack, said he  
was impressed with Gore enough to switch parties and vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here today to see how boring you could be, and I'm  
thoroughly disappointed,'' he told Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in Washington, Gore thanked the National Association of  
Police Organizations for the role its members have played in 
helping to reduce crime nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	And, without naming names, he said those who allow criminals to  
have firearms more powerful than the police could be found close to 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not satisfied with the political culture in  
Washington that puts the interests of the gun lobby ahead of the 
needs of American law enforcement,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Penn St. Wrestlers Charged in Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Two Penn State wrestlers were charged  
with rape and related offenses and suspended indefinitely from all 
wrestling activities pending the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel Parker, 20, and Jean Celestin, 20, both of Park Avenue  
in State College, were arraigned Thursday on charges of rape, 
involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, sexual assault and indecent 
assault of an 18-year-old woman in August. Each was released on 
$25,000 bail pending a preliminary hearing Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the two could face up to 20 years in jail for each  
felony count of rape, up to 10 years for sexual assault, and two 
years for indecent assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish to let the legal process run its course before making  
any final judgments, but we will not tolerate this kind of 
conduct,'' said wrestling coach Troy Sunderland. ``Should the 
charges be substantiated, we will dismiss the offending parties 
from the wrestling team and from any association with the 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, Parker and the alleged victim met  
for a date Aug. 20 at the Silver Screen Bar, then went to his 
apartment, where the assaults took place. The victim told police 
about the alleged incident on Oct. 13 after she had several 
arguments with Parker on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 15, police wiretapped a conversation between the victim  
and Parker, who allegedly told her that Celestin, his roommate, 
also had sex with her that night, the Centre Daily Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, a sophomore from Chesapeake, Va., started for the team  
last year after he claimed the 1998 Virginia state championship at 
125 pounds. Celestin, a junior from Miami, was a spot starter at 
149 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Arts May Improve Students' Grade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If your teen-agers want to be in the high  
school band or drama club, let them. It may improve their grades. 
</P>
<P>
	High school students who take music lessons and join theater  
groups do better in math, reading, history, geography and 
citizenship, according to a study of Education Department data to 
be published today. 
</P>
<P>
	``If young Americans are to succeed and to contribute to what  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan describes as our 'economy 
of ideas,' they will need an education that develops imaginative, 
flexible and tough-minded thinking,'' Education Secretary Richard 
Riley said in a message accompanying the study. ``The arts 
powerfully nurture the ability to think in this manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which tracked more than 25,000 students for more than  
10 years, found that students who reported consistently high levels 
of involvement with instrumental music scored significantly higher 
on math tests by the 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
	This observation held true for students regardless of their  
parents' income, occupations and levels of education, said James S. 
Catterall, the lead author and an education professor at the 
University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	While 38.6 percent of higher-income students who were uninvolved  
in music scored high in math, 48 percent of those highly interested 
in music received the high marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids who are more advantaged tend to be more involved in the  
arts. Period. They have more opportunities and you'd expect them to 
do better,'' Catterall said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But the influence of music was far more pronounced among  
lower-income students. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the lower-income students without music involvement, only  
15.5 percent achieved high math scores. But of the musically 
oriented group, more than twice as many excelled in math. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a matter of economic advantage. It's a matter of  
something happening with the arts for the kids,'' Catterall said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that as students progress through high  
school they are less likely to be involved in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a clear trend,'' Catterall said. ``Kids participation  
in the arts declines. It may be that high schools offer fewer 
programs than middle schools or that kids are more concerned with 
academics or admissions to college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 3 percent of seniors take out-of-school classes in  
music, art or dance, compared with more than 11 percent of 
sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the ``high-involvement'' seniors are found in  
top levels on standardized tests, compared with fewer than 43 
percent of the ``low-involvement'' seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also indicated arts study affected students' racial  
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Students at grade 10 were asked if it was OK to make a racist  
remark,'' the authors wrote. ``About 40 percent 'no-drama' students 
felt that making such a remark would be OK, where only about 12 
percent of high theater students thought the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the 12th graders involved in plays were compared to their  
uninvolved counterparts, 20 percent more of those active in drama 
had excellent reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Catterall noted that the work supports strong suggestions, but  
is not definitive. 
</P>
<P>
	This study was one of seven included in ``Champions of Change --  
The Impact of the Arts on Learning,'' by Edward B. Fiske, former 
education editor of The New York Times. The project was sponsored 
by the GE (General Electric) Fund and the John D. and Catherine T. 
MacArthur Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Doleman Hopes for Breakout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Chris Doleman had 15 sacks for the  
San Francisco 49ers last season but hasn't gotten his hands on a 
quarterback since coming out of retirement and joining the 
Minnesota Vikings a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci, whose team will face the  
Vikings at the Metrodome on Sunday, knows better than to dismiss 
Doleman as washed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of Chris. He and I had a good relationship here.  
I was sorry to see him go and he's still a good football player. 
He's managed to stay healthy for a long career, and that's very 
unusual and that's why he's one of the all-time sack leaders,'' 
Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, we know where he is, along with some of their other  
defensive linemen, which is a good defensive line, with John 
Randle, of course, Jerry Ball and Tony Williams. They're something 
to be reckoned with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vikings defensive line coach Andre Patterson said Doleman, who  
started at right defensive end and played nearly 60 snaps last week 
at Detroit, is getting close to a breakout game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's gotten better every week,'' Patterson said.  
``He's playing the run really well and in the pass rush he's 
starting to get into the groove. The pass rush is like hitting, you 
know, training camp in baseball, the pitchers are always ahead of 
the hitters because you have to get into the groove. And the pass 
rushing's the same way. And you can see that starting to come, you 
can see that groove. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's getting ready to break through.''  
</P>
<P>
	Doleman said it's no surprise he's sackless.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough coming in at midstream when you missed training  
camp,'' he said. ``When I'm out there on the field, everything I 
get each week is always new, so you can't just go out and just cut 
it loose as if you've known this stuff for years. It's a matter of 
time before those things start to come. The other thing is the 
conditioning factor, I feel that's coming along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doleman agreed he's about to turn the corner.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel myself getting closer to the quarterback,'' he said.  
``When you get hits on the quarterback and you get hurries on the 
quarterback, it's just a matter of time before you get him on the 
ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's exactly what I'm talking about,'' Patterson said. ``He  
had two really good rushes on Sunday but they happened to be on 
quick passes. So, he beat the guy at the line but the pass was off 
so fast he couldn't get back there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Doleman and return of Ball, a nose tackle who  
recently rejoined the Vikings in a trade with the Cleveland Browns 
for third-year end Stalin Colinet, has solidified the Vikings' 
defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good combination to have Jerry and Chris. One guy's  
been in the league 13 years, one 15, plus Joe Phillips is 14 
years,'' Patterson said. ``I went from a real young group to a very 
experienced group with a lot of knowledge and I think that really 
helps us out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not only taken pressure off a suspect secondary and a  
banged up linebacker corps but it's also allowed Randle to move 
from under tackle, where he was effectively double teamed, to 
defensive end, where he can get to the quarterback more easily. 
</P>
<P>
	Doleman said he wasn't particularly eager to face his former  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to get back on the field. After last week's game,  
I'm looking forward to just trying to get this thing going,'' 
Doleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings are 2-4 and have turned the offense over to Jeff  
George. The 49ers are 3-3 and seeking to avoid their first 
three-game losing streak since 1980. They're led by backup Jeff 
Garcia, with Steve Young out with concussion problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're still a great football team. These guys are  
fighters,'' Doleman said. ``I know the guys on the team, they're 
all fighters, I'm sure they're a little frustrated too, as we 
are.''

<HEADLINE> Hei-Kyung Hong Was Born to Sing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Soprano Hei-Kyung Hong walks past long tables  
holding bolts of fabric, and racks of costumes and shelves holding 
plastic boxes of buttons, gold braid and frog fasteners. 
</P>
<P>
	She's in her workplace, the Metropolitan Opera, on her way to  
costume fittings for her first singing of the Countess in Mozart's 
``The Marriage of Figaro'' on Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	She says hello to the women who sit at sewing machines, and they  
in turn greet her. One seamstress follows her to the dressing room 
and Hong, a size 8, says she thinks her voice might be better if 
she weighed more. The seamstress says she doesn't see how Hong's 
voice could be better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hei-Kyung Hong has one of the loveliest natural lyric soprano  
voices of today, which she uses with great intelligence and 
musicality,'' says tenor Placido Domingo, who sang a duet concert 
with Hong in Seoul, Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``With her physical beauty and unaffected acting ability she is  
a total performer. I am very happy that she will sing Cleopatra in 
Handel's `Giulio Cesare' for us at the Washington Opera this 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though she never seems flamboyant, Hong is a favorite of  
audiences, colleagues and critics. 
</P>
<P>
	During the summer, she sang Mimi in ``La Boheme'' for an  
estimated 35,000 people in Central Park for the Met. Hong turns 
down many overseas engagements because she likes to sing where she 
can drive herself to and from home. Last summer she negotiated with 
the Rome Opera to arrive later than requested to sing Liu in 
``Turandot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because family life is very important to the Korean  
soprano, who lives on Long Island in Bay Shore, with her husband, 
two teen-age daughters and 5-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be one more day away than I have to,'' she  
says. ``When the girls were little, I had to feed them, clothe 
them, drive them places. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to be home even more now. Every experience is a venture  
into their emotional beings. They're still learning, still 
changing. Mother has to be there to be the pillar, the reliable 
person who is the sounding board for them to come to, to say this 
and that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Hong was growing up in Seoul, her mother encouraged her to  
entertain guests and enter contests. 
</P>
<P>
	``She praised me so, I wanted to do it,'' Hong says. ``In my  
career, that has been the basic fuel, that I was praised from an 
early age. I believe this is very important in raising children; 
they need to be praised about their reading or gardening or setting 
the table or tying shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one golden treasure that I learned from my mother.''  
</P>
<P>
	When she was in junior high school, Hong's mother sent her to Ye  
Won, Seoul's music conservatory. Teachers there said she should go 
to Italy or the Juilliard School in New York City. So she came here 
to audition and was awarded a full scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong was 15, alone and didn't speak English. ``A very loving  
American family took me in, in Westfield, N.J. The first year or 
two were undoubtedly the most difficult time in my life. Just to 
finish homework I would stay up till 2 or 3 in the morning,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm glad I came early. I was able to learn the language  
more quickly and adapt more than if I came after college or once my 
profession started. On Saturdays I went to Juilliard. That was the 
fun time. I got to study voice, sing and play piano.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When she was old enough to attend Juilliard full time, she was  
given light soprano roles in opera productions. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation, she took the latest in what she calls a  
succession of good advice and entered the 1982 Met Auditions for 
Young Singers. She became one of 11 evenly ranked winners. The 
competition didn't worry her. ``I've done so many competitions. 
Getting to perform on the stage was so much fun. I felt right at 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The night before Hong's finalists' performance, she and Kim S.  
Hahn got engaged. ``My husband has a very humorous timing of 
things,'' she says. ``He gave me a ring. I didn't know if I was 
more excited about my ring or the stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her Met debut was in 1984 in Mozart's ``La Clemenza di Tito''  
and she has sung at the Met every season since, often in Mozart 
operas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember Hei-Kyung when she first came to us, in 1984, in  
`La Clemenza di Tito,''' Jonathan Friend, Metropolitan Opera 
artistic administrator, recalled. ``She had then a really special 
timbre to her voice. What is so wonderful to have witnessed in the 
last 15 years is how the voice has grown and yet maintained the 
purity that it had back then. 
</P>
<P>
	``The audiences always react very positively to her and when she  
sings a role like Mimi or Liu we all feel that she is one of the 
major artists of the day in this repertoire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Met dressing room, Hong tries on one of the Countess'  
silk, bustled skirts. ``This is so gorgeous, I don't need anything 
on top. I'm going to go out like this,'' she declares. Regina, the 
costume fitter, giggles. 
</P>
<P>
	She dons an unfinished blue bodice the Countess will wear in Act  
3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing Strauss' `Daphne' in Munich,'' Hong says. Regina  
repins a ruffle to the sleeve, to make it comfortable at the 
singer's elbow. ``I think it is fitting my voice quite well. I'm 
excited about that,'' she says. ``I should be doing more Strauss; 
it goes with the color of my voice. It has the beautiful legato I 
love and a high tessitura.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hong and Jennifer Larmore sing the ``Presentation of the Rose''  
duet from ``Der Rosenkavalier'' on ``Beautiful Opera Duets,'' a new 
Teldec CD. Hong has never been asked to sing Sophie on stage. ``I 
think they want a Scandinavian look, blonde with a porcelain 
complexion,'' Hong says. 
</P>
<P>
	She steps out of the dressing room and looks in a tall mirror.  
Two men look up from cutting fabric and give her a thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Singers love to talk about the voice, how to produce it, how  
to support it, how to breathe,'' she says. ``That bores me. I want 
to talk about the person. What kind of life they had, how many 
children, what they love, what makes them fill with emotions. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I love to sing. I was born to sing. It's the career I've  
chosen. ... My concern is my family and my singing. I want to do my 
best and be worthy of the people buying tickets and taking the time 
to come. They expect a great performance and hopefully I provide 
that. If I don't do it, I'm not doing my job.''

<HEADLINE> Washington Post Earns $59.7M in 3Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Post Co. reported a 17 percent  
increase in profits Friday, saying earnings were helped by boosted 
advertising revenue at its flagship newspaper and at Newsweek 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings rose to $59.7 million, or $5.90 a share, for the third  
quarter ended Oct. 3, from $50.9 million, or $5.00 a share, for the 
same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The results did not include a one-time charge this year of $8  
million in startup costs for BrassRing, Inc., a job search and 
recruiting service owned by the company. They also omit a one-time 
1998 gain of $30.9 million resulting from the Washington Post's 
sale of 14 small cable business and stock in the Internet commerce 
company Junglee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post's earnings beat the $5.61-a-share  
expectation of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 6 percent to $539.6 million from $509.3  
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post credited the increased earnings to higher  
subscriber revenues from its cable television division and a 24 
percent drop in its cost for newsprint and an increase in the 
company's pension credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the company said those gains were tempered by increased  
spending on the paper's Internet operations and decreased revenue 
from advertising in its broadcasting division. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, the Washington Post  
reported a 9 percent increase in net income to $172.8 million, or 
$16.97 per share, from $159.1 million, or $15.67 per share in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Those figures don't include the 1999 charge for BrassRing, or a  
total gain of $194.4 million in 1998, when the Washington Post sold 
shares in Cowles Media company in addition to its interests in 
Junglee and the cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, revenue was up 6 percent to $1.62  
billion from $1.52 billion the year before.
