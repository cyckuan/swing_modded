<HEADLINE> Europe, United States Vie for Senior EBRD Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Europeans and the United States
are engaged in a fierce power struggle at the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) over the successor to the
outgoing EBRD first vice-president Ron Freeman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, whose 10 percent stake makes it the bank's
largest single shareholder, is pressing hard for Freeman to be
replaced by another Wall Street banker, according to a report in
today's Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
However, European shareholders of the EBRD are fighting to
preserve the predominantly "European" character of the bank and
are determined to choose a European banker to replace Freeman, a
57-year-old Wall Street banker.
</P>
<P>
The major European investment bank, which was established in
1991 to facilitate the transition of eastern European countries to
market economies, concentrates its banking activity on the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Freeman was chosen as one of two vice-presidents in charge of
the investment banking activities and Italy's Mario Sarcinelli was
put in charge of the development of banking operations.
</P>
<P>
But this division of functions was abolished in 1993 when
Sarcinelli was forced to resign after strong criticism over his
lavish refurbishment of the bank's London premises and Freeman
subsequently combined both operations, strengthening the American
position in the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank is expected to present the names of suggested
candidates for Freeman's job at an informal board meeting Tuesday
and a final decision is likely to be made before the EBRD annual
meeting to be held in London Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Hanbo Owner Gives Contradictory Testimony in Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The founder and owner of South
Korea's dissolved Hanbo Group gave contradictory testimony on
Monday while answering questions from lawmakers over the
bribes-for-loans scandal.
</P>
<P>
Chung Tae-soo, in the televised hearing and under tight
grilling in the Seoul Prison, acknowledged in the morning session
that he had "contributed to the election fund".
</P>
<P>
Asked about the size of the donation, he said: "A political
donation is limited to a maximum of one billion won (about 1.12
million U.S. dollars)."
</P>
<P>
But Chung reneged on his words in the afternoon after parties
involved rushed to release statements denying what Chung had said.
</P>
<P>
Chung also denied widespread allegations that President Kim
Young-sam's second son, Kim Hyun-chul, was involved in one of
South Korea's worst scandals.
</P>
<P>
Monday's hearing, the first of a series that will last for 25
days, focused on whether Chung had provided funds for Kim
Yong-sam's election campaign, which politicians had received money
from the Hanbo Group in exchange for preferential loans to the
group, and whether Kim Hyun-chul was involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Asked key questions about the scandal, Chung simply said: "I
cannot answer because I am on trial," or "I do not remember."
</P>
<P>
The former corporate magnate also faces charges of embezzlement
and tax evasion. He was also indicted for bribing politicians and
government officials to obtain illegal loans without collateral.
</P>
<P>
From Monday until May 1, the National Assembly (parliament)
will hear testimony from 42 witnesses, including Chung, former
presidential advisors, and the president's son and his friends.
</P>
<P>
The Hanbo scandal flared up after the Hanbo steel firm, Hanbo's
flagship, collapsed with debts of 5.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The group was believed to have offered millions of dollars to
the then ruling party presidential candidate, Kim Young-sam, in
1992 presidential election campaigning.

<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Tao Siju, minister of Public
Security, met this afternoon with Hui Ki-on, the Commissioner of
Police of Hong Kong, who is in Beijing for the 25th meeting
between INTERPOL organizations in Hong Kong and in the Chinese
inland area.
</P>
<P>
Tao welcomed Hui, who is a leading member of Hong Kong's
INTERPOL bureau, by congratulating him on being appointed
Commissioner of Police of the first government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years or more, he said, positive results have
been achieved from cooperation between the police in the inland
area and Hong Kong in cracking down on criminal activities through
INTERPOL.
</P>
<P>
Tao said that, according to the provisions of the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong SAR, the security organizations in the inland areas
and the Hong Kong police department, which are not affiliated with
each other, will maintain links and support each other after Hong
Kong returns to the motherland, and their cooperation will become
more extensive, close, and effective.
</P>
<P>
Tao said he is completely confident that the Hong Kong police
will safeguard the stability of the final transition period and do
a good job in public security for the activities during the
return, and expressed the belief that the mainland and Hong Kong
police departments will cooperate in a better way.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Zhu Entao, assistant minister of Public
Security, held talks with Hui on cross-border criminal activities,
and financial, economic, and other criminal activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan called for international solidarity to meet challenges posed
by emerging and re-emerging of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of World Health Day, Annan said
that infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"New diseases with no known cure continue to emerge. In the
past 20 years alone, about 30 new and highly infectious diseases
have been identified, among them Ebola and HIV/AIDS. Old diseases
that once seemed under control -- such as diphtheria and
tuberculosis -- are making a deadly comeback, increasingly
resistant to drugs that once cured us of their effects," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the globalization of trade, changes in
ecology and climate, and mass movements of people, whether
tourists, business travelers, migrants or refugees, are creating
new opportunities for the spread of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
"Infectious diseases affect everyone. There can be no clearer
example of the interdependence of nations than the risks posed by
the spread of infectious diseases. We need to show international
solidarity by meeting this challenge with united, coordinated
action," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Winter Time started
from Sunday night when clocks were set back one hour, reported
the South African Press Association today.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The period ends on the first Sunday in September when standard
time reverts to two hours ahead of GMT.
</P>
<P>
The time change, introduced to prevent children from having to

safety of female employees going home in the dark, while some
sportsmen and women have to train in the dark when no floodlights

<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corporation, the
world's largest software company based in Redmond, Washington
state, is planning to blend the personal computer, the television
and the Internet by acquiring WebTV networks.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made Sunday from a convention of
telebroadcasters in Las Vegas, Nevada state, according to a report
of the New York Times today. Microsoft will send 425 million U.S.
dollars to acquire WebTV networks, a start-up company that
delivers Internet information directly to television.
</P>
<P>
The action is said to be Microsoft's most ambitious effort yet
to extend its reach from the personal computer, which has found
its way into almost 40 percent of American homes, to the
television, which has made entry into 98 percent of all homes in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is also described as a "milestone" in the challenge to the
world's television manufacturers by the computer industry, which
hopes to take over a substantial part of the new 150 billion U.S.
dollar market for digital television over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The plan made to the public just a few days after the Federal
Communications Commission has set a nine-year timetable for the
nation's transition from analog to digital television.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina today called upon the people to unitedly resist the
conspirators who are trying to disrupt the ongoing development
process in this country.
</P>
<P>
"Remain vigilant against any evil design of the conspirators
trying to thwart our march towards progress and prosperity," she
told a huge public meeting held here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The public meeting was organized by Hasina's ruling Awami
(people's) League (AL) to deplore attempts by vested groups to
create law and order situation and subversive activities.
</P>
<P>
Seeking all out cooperation from the cheering crowds, the prime
minister said her government would relentlessly work for the
betterment of the people who returned them to power after 21
years.
</P>
<P>
Referring to her government's achievement in the last nine
months, the prime minister said the long outstanding Ganges water
sharing problem with India had been solved and the Chakma refugees
were coming back to their homes.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful agreement on the Chittagong hill tracts insurgency
problem could be reached through negotiations, she added.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina also told the crowd that she had invited the
opposition to lead the nation unitedly on the basis of consensus.
</P>
<P>
However, she regretted that whenever her government tried to
solve any problems, her efforts were thwarted by the opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who lost election last June.
</P>
<P>
Referring to her recent call for open dialogue on national
issues with the opposition BNP leader Khaleda Zia, "the door is
still open for dialogue," she claimed.

<HEADLINE> Boeing to Boost Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co. is preparing to
increase its rate of production for all planes by 10 percent
beyond the record levels already announced, the Wall Street
Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The company is studying how to double its current output rate
for the 737 aircraft, it said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Boeing said it plans to produce jetliners at a
record rate of 40 a month by the end of 1997, including 21 of the
737s, the popular line of planes in the 150- to 170-seat range.
Boeing's previous record production rate for all models was 39.5
planes a month, reached in mid-1992.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest plane maker has already decided to boost
production by at least 10 percent overall. That will include
turning up production of the 737 to 24 planes a month or more in
the next two years, and increasing production of its 747 jumbo
jets by 25 percent, to five planes a month from four. Boeing has
already said it is increasing production of its 300-seat 777 by 40
percent, to seven planes monthly, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Boeing also plans to produce the 737 at rates of 28 to 31
planes a month in 1999 and 2000. At the moment, it is in the
process of increasing production of that plane to 17 by this fall.
</P>
<P>
The paper said such a move would boost overall production rates
for all models to as many as 48 planes monthly by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By mid-1999, Boeing expects to be making only its three sizes
of "737-X" upgraded versions of the plane, and will have ceased
making three less-efficient "classic" versions.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Causes Lobster Walk-Out in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 7 (Xinhua) -- About 500 to 1,000 tons of
rock lobsters have "walked out" of the sea onto the beaches at
Elands Bay in Western Cape Province at the weekend to escape
toxic red tide which depletes oxygen levels in the waters.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association reported that Hordes of
visitors streamed to the picturesque Cape West Coast beaches
today and on Sunday to collect the delicacy, using black refuse
bags, empty milk carton containers and laundry baskets.
</P>
<P>
The walk-out was the second time in the past two weeks that
huge numbers of crayfish crawled from the sea. About 60 tons of
rock lobsters emerged from the ocean at Elands Bay shortly before
Easter.
</P>
<P>
The Easter rock lobster walk-out was dominated by non-toxic
organisms and the rock lobsters were probably affected by a lack
of oxygen in the water.
</P>
<P>
The latest crayfish walk-out is thought by locals to be the
largest ever in the history of the town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, scientists were reportedly on their way to the area
to ascertain whether red tide was responsible for the walk-out.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities are collecting as many crayfish as possible and
placing them in holding tanks before being relocated to the sea in
other areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Patch-up Chances Between Congress, United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- With both the Congress Party and
the United Front (UF) refusing to climb down from their stand,
chances of reaching a compromise before the April 11 vote of
confidence have receded.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deve Gowda is getting ready for a nationally
televised debate in the Lower House of Parliament on April 11, the
date set by President S.D. Sharma for the UF government to show
its majority in parliament through a vote of confidence following
the withdrawal of support to it by the Congress on March 30. And
he has refused to make way for another candidate to lead the UF
before the trial of strength this Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, leaders of both the Congress and the UF
have had a series of informal contacts trying to solve their
disputes, yet both of them have adhered to their own stand. While
the Congress put the change of the leadership in the UF government
as a precondition for further talks, the UF insisted that the
Congress should reconsider its withdrawal of support. They said
that they could listen to the grievances of the Congress, but they
refused to change the leadership of the UF government.
</P>
<P>
It appears that any realignment among the secular parties, if
at all to be arrived at, will be possible only after the vote of
confidence as Gowda has tremendous faith in his "destiny." The
prime minister is busy with his 40-page speech, to be delivered on
the floor of Parliament, listing achievements and giving
blow-by-blow account of how the corrupt Congress was trying to
browbeat him.
</P>
<P>
Informal meetings are still going on between the Congress and
the UF in a bid to break the present impasse. Indian External
Affairs Minister I. K. Gujral has said that after meeting Congress
President Sitaram Kesri Sunday morning his talks were "positive."
UF Spokesman Jaipal Reddy appeared confident of finding a solution
by April 8 between the Congress and the UF.
</P>
<P>
Indian President S. D. Sharma, who met leaders of the UF and
the Congress in the past week, is learnt to have advised them to
find an amicable settlement to avoid a snap poll in the interest
of the country. Both the Congress and the UF are also reportedly
not in favor of mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
Among the 543 seats in the Lower House of Parliament, the UF
has 188 seats including 11 supporters from the outside and the
Congress has 141 seats while the BJP alliance occupies 193 seats.
With the same purpose to prevent "communal force" of BJP from
coming into power, both the UF and the Congress came together as
"secular force" with the former coming to power on June 1 last
year with the support of the latter. Without the Congress support,
the UF government is expected to fall.

<HEADLINE> Americas Cup Backs to Britain For Repairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The world oldest sporting trophy --
the Americas Cup -- has been brought back to Britain on Monday to
be repaired by the Crown jewellers who created it 146 year ago.
</P>
<P>
The greatest trophy in yachting, which was made in Britain in
1851 but has spent most of the past century in the United States,
was partially destroyed by a protester in March while it was on
display in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"The top third of the cup is very badly damaged. It's been
beaten around quite severely with a sledgehammer and so there is
quite of lot of restoration work to be done on that part of it,"
said John Heise, the commodore of the Royal New Zealand yachting
Squadron who accompanied the cup.
</P>
<P>
It was transported in a specially made case, on a first class
flight from Auckland.
</P>
<P>
Jewellers Garrards estimate it will take up to eight weeks to
repair the silver cup.
</P>
<P>
Militant New Zealand Maori Benjamin Peri Nathan, 27, was
charged with wilfully destroying the cup on March 14.

<P>
TOKYO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Defense Agency chief Fumio
Kyuma and United States Defense Secretary William Cohen today
agreed to maintain the present level of U.S. troops in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Kyodo News Service quoted Defense Agency officials as
saying the two defense chiefs reached the agreement in talks
tonight in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Japan hosts 47,000 of the 100,000 U.S. troops deployed in East
Asia. About 27,000 are stationed on Japan's island prefecture of
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The two men also agreed that the two countries would draw up an
interim report in May, reviewing the 1978 guidelines on
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the two countries would continue a joint study
of the Theater Missile Defense System (TMD), a regional
anti-missile defense system Japan has been studying for about two
years to decide whether or not to participate in its development,
the officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Tokyo earlier today for a three-day visit to
Japan for talks with Japanese leaders on the U.S. military
presence in Okinawa, and cooperation between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- About 3.1 million people were
infected with AIDS and another estimated 1.5 million died of
AIDS-related diseases last year, a report by a sub-institution of
the United Nations showed.
</P>
<P>
The deaths included 350,000 children, according to a report
released today by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
The death figure accounted for about 25 percent of all
AIDS-related mortality since the outbreak of the epidemic in the
early 1980s, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that despite signs of decreases in new infections and
deaths in several countries, new epidemics related with AIDS or
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, are spreading at alarming rates
in Asia and in Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of the Program Coordinating
Board, the governing body of the UNAIDS, said there was a lack of
prevention strategies that are cost-effective and work.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the continuing denial of AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome), in many societies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Taiwan, Hong Kong Industrialists (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qian said that direct shipping across the Taiwan Straits is a
matter of common concern. This will benefit contracts and
exchanges, help them increase mutual understanding, eliminate
differences, reach a consensus, and promote economic relations,
trade, and common prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been unremitting in our efforts to this end," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last August, he said, the Ministry of Communications and the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation announced
management methods for direct shipping, and defined the principle
of "one China" and the meaning of two-way direct shipping and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
This not only safeguards shipping interests across the Taiwan
Straits but also benefits economic cooperation and trade, helping
to promote direct mail exchanges and direct trade and air
transport, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that from ancient times, Xiamen has been regarded as
an important bridge across the Taiwan Straits, and since 1979, it
has done its part in promoting economic exchanges and cooperation
across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, the Xiamen harbor was declared a trial site
for direct shipping, and this year, the first export commodity
fair is being held in Xiamen, providing a chance for direct
cooperation between Taiwan business people and mainland firms.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the belief that the fair will be fully
successful, with the support of compatriots across the Taiwan
Straits, and will contribute to the peaceful reunification of the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Taiwan, Hong Kong Industrialists (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xiamen, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Qian Qichen, in a
meeting with industrial and commercial leaders from Taiwan and
Hong Kong in Xiamen this evening, expressed the hope that the
Taiwan Authorities will no longer prevent entrepreneurs from
investing in the mainland, because it is not in the interest of
Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Qian made a special trip to the southeast Chinese city earlier
this evening to attend the first commodity fair for Xiamen exports
to Taiwan and a travel and shopping festival for Taiwan
Compatriots which is scheduled to open Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taiwan Authorities to take steps to reduce
restrictions on the mainland's exports to Taiwan, and to gradually
decrease the trade deficit with Taiwan to promote trade across the
Taiwan Straits in a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the trend in more exchanges and cooperation
across the Taiwan Straits cannot be stopped by any force at a time
when the situation of mutual promotion and mutual benefit exists
and when economic exchanges are being conducted on a fairly large
scale.
</P>
<P>
He quoted President Jiang Zemin as saying that for the growth
of the world economy in the 21st century, exchanges and
cooperation across the Taiwan Straits will benefit common
prosperity and bring happiness to the entire Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "we will not affect or interrupt
cross-straits economic cooperation with political differences, but
rather will promote such relationships by encouraging Taiwan
business people's investment and follow the law of protecting
Taiwan compatriots' investment and expand trade as well."
</P>
<P>
"We will protect their just and reasonable rights and
interests," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ulster Catholic Church Destroyed in Arson Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A Roman Catholic church in Northern
Ireland was destroyed early today in the fifth arson attack on
church property in a week, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Fire crews were unable to save the Mullavilly Church at
Tandragee in the border county of Armagh after it was set alight
at 0200 GMT today.
</P>
<P>
In the last week, a Catholic church in County Antrim and a
Baptist church in east Belfast have been destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
A second Catholic church in County Antrim and a Church of
Ireland hall in County Tyrone both survived arson attacks.
</P>
<P>
Of all the five damaged churches, three belong to the
province's Roman Catholic minority while the other two serve the
pro-British Protestant majority.
</P>
<P>
These incidents happened against a background of rising tension
in the province caused by guerrilla violence and the start of
Northern Ireland's marching season.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA), which has been fighting for
more than 25 years to end British rule in Ulster, was blamed for
last weekend's bomb scare that wrecked the Grand National horse
race and also for two other bomb alerts on British motorway last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both Protestant and Roman Catholic churches' spokesmen have
condemned the arson attacks on their property.

MAPUTO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique said today it will not
attend the second summit of the Common Market for Eastern and

</P>
<P>
This was announced by Mozambican Minister of Foreign Affairs

A number of the 12 SADC members are also members of the

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With French Officials (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
meeting with French Defence Minister Charles Millon and French
Ambassador to China Pierre Morel in Beijing today, said that
China, after serious study, is ready to sign the UN's
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
So far, concerned departments are doing studies on domestic
legislation related to the covenant.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he highly values French President Jacques Chirac's
decision that France will no longer take part in presenting bills
against China on human rights, and that he appreciates this
independent action by France.
</P>
<P>
Calling it a wise and far-sighted decision, Jiang said that it
shows France has an independent foreign policy of peace and shows
French determination in developing the Sino-French partnership. He
said he is convinced that this will have an important and positive
influence on the overall development of Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that China has, all along, taken an active
part in the UN's efforts to promote and protect human rights, and
highly values the significance of the UN's human rights
conventions in this regard, and that China has participated in 17
international human rights conventions.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We evaluated the International Covenant on Economic,
Social, and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights repeatedly." He pointed out that,
after serious study, China is ready to sign the UN's International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights before the end of
the year, and that related departments are studying domestic
legislation related to this covenant.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the principle of universality in human rights
and China's domestic conditions, the Chinese government has made
efforts to achieve its own people's rights to subsistence and
development, and has raised the level of Chinese people's
economic, social, and cultural rights, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, China has continued to improve the
development of democracy and a legal system to ensure Chinese
citizens' civil and political rights, and that the Chinese people
in fact enjoy comprehensive human rights.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is normal and inevitable that different
views on human rights exist in different countries because of
differences in social systems, economic development, historical
backgrounds, and cultural tradition. There is no wonder that there
are disputes, he said, but that what is more important is the way
these disputes are resolved.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that China has always held that the human
rights issue can only be solved through dialogue and exchanges
that are based on equality and mutual respect, and that China has
held several rounds of dialogues with the European Union, and will
continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some western countries are still considering
presenting bills that go against China, Jiang said he hopes that
France can continue to play a constructive role in getting more
western countries take a proper stand to end confrontation and
move towards dialogue and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Chance of Fokker's Restart "Negligible" as Rescurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The fate of the bankrupt Dutch
aircraft builder Fokker seemed to be finally sealed today after
one of the key parties in rescue talks pulled out and even its
receivers said a relaunch now looked impossible.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch engineering group Stork, which owns the profitable
Fokker aircraft maintenance and components units, announced it was
no longer bound by a memorandum of understanding, signed in March
as the blueprint of a possible resurrection.
</P>
<P>
"Stork has informed the Dutch state, the Deleye Investment
Group and the administrators that it is no longer bound by the
memorandum," Fokker's receiver said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Fokker administrators have now concluded that any chance
of a restart definitely seems negligible," the document said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after the failure of Malaysia's state
investment arm Khazanah Holdings Berhad to guarantee sufficient
financial support.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch aircraft maker collapsed a year ago, folding the
three units that made up 90 percent of its activities.
</P>
<P>
KLM and other airlines gave Fokker several aircraft orders to
keep it going until a rescuer could be found.
</P>
<P>
But the last three planes are nearly completed and many
employees have left in recent weeks, receivers said
</P>
<P>
Without the Malaysian deal, the plant is now expected to be
closed for good this summer and the assets liquidated.

<P>
Jiang said that since French President Jacques Chirac assumed
office, Sino-French friendship and cooperation have seen new
development, and that he is looking forward to Chirac's visit to
China this May, and that China attaches great importance to the
visit and is speeding up preparations.
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced that this visit will have achieve
positive results in political, economic, and other areas.
</P>
<P>
During that visit, China and France will release a joint
statement making clear their common views on major international
issues and their common aspirations for further expanding
bilateral relations between China and France.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that both China and France shoulder
important responsibilities in international affairs, treasure
their national independence, and share identical views on many
major international issues.
</P>
<P>
"We favor a multi-polar world rather than a single-pole world,
one that is conducive not only to world peace, stability and
security, but also to the common development of the economies of
all the countries in the world," Jiang said, adding that there are
broad prospects for Sino-French economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the world is moving toward multi-polarization
while maintaining diversification, China and France should
strengthen exchanges and cooperation with an eye toward the future
from a strategic height, to set up long-term, stable, and new
relations of friendship and cooperation oriented to the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said that the Chinese government agrees to increase
exchanges between the armed forces of the two countries in a bid
to safeguard world peace.
</P>
<P>
Millon said that President Chirac attaches great importance to
the development of relations with China. He also said that both
France and China have important responsibilities for safeguarding
world peace and promoting economic development, and follow
independent foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening bilateral cooperation in various areas has a
practical significance in promoting and acceleration
multi-polarization of the world, Millon noted.
</P>
<P>
While saying that France is willing to increase bilateral
cooperation in the economy, trade, science, technology, and
culture, Millon said that his country is also willing to maintain
friendly cooperation with China in security and defense, and hopes
that both sides can have more exchanges of high-level visits and
strategic dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Through joint efforts, he said, the friendship and cooperation
between France and China can turn a new page in history.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his pleasure at hearing that China intends to sign
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
</P>
<P>
Millon conveyed Chirac's greetings to Jiang, and Jiang asked
Millon to convey his regards to Chirac in return.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Labor Leads Conservatives by 21 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Labor Party
still enjoys a 21-point lead over the ruling Conservatives with
just 23 days to go to the May 1 election, according to a leading
poll organization NOP poll released today.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted for Reuters news agency last Friday, said
the lead is down from 25 percentage points in the previous Reuters
poll conducted three weeks earlier, and just below the level shown
in two other polls published in newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The key thing is that although the lead has narrowed, the
change is not statistically significant," Reuters quoted Nick
Moon, head of political research at the polling organization NOP,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,088 sample voters, 51 percent said they would vote
for the Labor, while 30 percent favored for the Conservatives.
Eleven percent of the voters said they were ready to vote for the
minority Liberal Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
If the electorate cast its votes in line with this poll, Labor
would have 440 members in the 659-seat lower House of Commons, and
the Conservatives 169 seats. The Liberals would have 24 seats,
according to election experts' calculations.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that the Conservatives are starting to benefit
from a growing perception the economy is doing well, but not
enough to repair their damaged reputation for economic competence.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives, ruling the country for the past 18 years,
have been racked by the slip of the party members on Europe
policies and hit hard by the involvement of the Conservative MPs
in financial and sexual scandals.
</P>
<P>
On the UK's relationship with Europe, the Labor Party has more
trust than the Conservatives. The poll shows 33 percent credited
Labor and 29 trusted the Conservatives in that respect.

<HEADLINE> IBM to Enter TV Broadcasting Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM), the world's leading computer maker, is
jumping into the market for television broadcasting equipment, the
Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
The company is joining other computer companies such as
Microsoft in the emerging market, hoping to profit as the TV
industry moves to digital standards.
</P>
<P>
IBM plans to announce today that it will supply digital
production and transmission equipment for cable-TV systems,
broadcast-TV stations and satellite-broadcasting purveyors.
</P>
<P>
But the company will face some competitors in the
broadcast-equipment business, including Sony Corp. It also will be
up against its traditional opponents in the computer industry,
including Hewlett-Packard Co., which also see the TV industry's
move to digital technology as a potentially juicy new market.
</P>
<P>
IBM has already sold a digital-TV setup to an Italian telephone
company, which has been using it since last September to operate a
cable-TV network in Rome, it was reported. That setup converts the
digital signals back to analog, so customers can use their
conventional TV sets, through a special electronic box atop the
sets.
</P>
<P>
But IBM says it has the technology to adapt to all-digital
systems, such as those envisioned for the U.S. market starting
in late 1998.

<HEADLINE> African Anaesthetists Urged to Come Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbafwean Vice-president Simon
Muzenda today urged African anaesthetists meeting in Harare to
pool their resources, particularly in the professional economic
field, in line with current international trends.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said it had been proven that if people organized
themselves into bigger groups, they stood to gain, especially in
the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day All Africa Anaesthetic Congress, Muzenda
said, "for example, if an essential drug list, such as we have in
this country, were compiled for anaesthesia and anaesthetic
related drugs which were acceptable to a whole vast area of
Africa, that area would then become a desirable market."
</P>
<P>
If huge sales were made, the cost of the drugs would fall,
benefiting all, including the pharmaceutical companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a regional grouping would also benefit anaesthetists
in the field of education.
</P>
<P>
He said because rewards outside the universities were great,
many academics were always leaving for greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
Academics, particularly in medicine, made considerable
financial sacrifices in order to study their subjects and teach
the subjects to the leaders of tomorrow, he said.
</P>
<P>
The congress is being attended by anaesthetists from all over
the world and is the first to be held in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Recession Years Cost British People A Lot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The wealth-shrinking effect of the
recession has wiped 6,000 pounds (9,600 US dollars) off the
average Britons' net worth during the past seven years, figures
published today show.
</P>
<P>
According to independent analyst Datamonitor, from a peak in
1989, wealth per head has fallen, in real terms, from 31,851
pounds (50,961 dollars) to 25,442 pounds (40,707 dollars) last
year.
</P>
<P>
Britons are shown as thriftier than in the past and concerned
to stash away money for retirement, with an "earnest" attempt to
accumulate assets.
</P>
<P>
But, as the value of savings plans has grown, the recession has
cut an average of nearly 1,000 pounds (1,600 dollars) from each
person's net worth for every year since the boom.
</P>
<P>
These figures, from Datamonitor, come hard on the heels of
Sunday's publication of the 1997 edition of the Sunday Times' top
500 "rich list," which detected record numbers of billionaires and
multi-millionaires.
</P>
<P>
Those listed, the newspaper said, had seen an overall 23
percent rise in their wealth during the year.
</P>
<P>
Datamonitor said the collapse in average personal wealth was
due in large part to the slump in the property market. Real wealth
per head, said Datamonitor, was still below even the levels seen
in the crisis year 1992.
</P>
<P>
On paper, wealth per head stands at 39,855 pounds (63,768
dollars), against 36,751 pounds (58,802 dollars) in 1989.
</P>
<P>
But, with inflation taken into account, the figures are 25,442
pounds (40,707 dollars) and 31,851 pounds (50,961 dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Datamonitor said, "This drop was mostly due to decrease in
property prices, which have a dramatic effect on the value of net
asset holdings."
</P>
<P>
Harsha Yogasundram, an analyst of Datamonitor, said the trend
should be reversed over the next few years as the property market
recovers.

<HEADLINE> Blood Donor Selection Crucial to Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Transmission of diseases through
blood transfusion could be reduced by improving donor selection,
screening of blood and cutting down on the number of unnecessary
transfusion, a world health organization (WHO) official said.
</P>
<P>
addressing the All Africa Anaesthetic Congress in harare
today, John Emmanuel said governments had the responsibility to
ensure safe blood while a non-governmental organization could be
delegated to manage the transfusion service.
</P>
<P>
''Each country should develop a national blood transfusion
plan so that the aims and objectives are adhered to in the
establishment of a coordinated blood transfusion program,'' said
Emmanuel.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference which opened here comes at a time when
Zimbabwe has made impressive improvements in protecting the blood
supply from transmitting infectious agents, despite the limits of
technology.
</P>
<P>
''The serious threat of infection to the recipients of blood
and blood products has highlighted the state of development of
blood transfusion services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a national blood transfusion program could only be
sustainable if the country's health care and socio-economic
factors were taken into account during the planning and
development phase.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Debt Equals to Continent's Combined GDP: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The OAU chief today said the
stock of Africa's debt is now almost equivalent to the combined
gross domestic product of the continent while the debt burden has
already exceeded 25 percent of Africa's export earnings.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) when he was addressing
the opening session of the 20th ordinary session of the OAU labor
and social affairs commission here.
</P>
<P>
Salim said, the excessive accumulation of the excruciating
external debt of about 340.5 billion Dollars and an annual debt
service of about 24 billion Dollars continues to further
exacerbate foreign exchange constraints.
</P>
<P>
He called on both African countries and creditor countries
''to undertake bold and courageous steps aimed at alleviating the
Africa's debt burden''.
</P>
<P>
''Time has come for our partners in the developed world to
realize that the external debt is strangling our economies and
our countries development efforts and to recognize that Africa
deserves a special treatment in a spirit of genuine cooperation,
solidarity and long term mutual benefit,'' he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Salim described employment crisis as ''one of the most serious
challenges facing African continent in the social sector''.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the employment situation in Africa which had
deteriorated considerably over the past fifteen years continued
to be grim in most of our countries with urban unemployment rates
estimated in the 15 to 20 percent range; under-employment rates
in the 25 to 50 percent; youth unemployment rates in the 25 to 40
percent range; while women unemployment range was twice the
national average.''
</P>
<P>
''Against the backdrop of this employment situation, unless
determined and improved employment and development policies are
implemented, the employment crisis is likely to be aggravated up
to the year 2000 with labor force growth rate rising about 2.8
percent and out-passing annual employment growth rate of 2.3
percent,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On the protection of child and elimination of child labor in
Africa, Salim said it is estimated that about 24 million children
in Africa are forced to sacrifice their health, their education,
their childhood and formative years, in a daily struggle for
survival in violation of national legislation and international
labor standards.
</P>
<P>
The six-day meeting following discussions on the social and
economic issues of the continent, is expected to come up with
proposals that could help alleviate the complex problems of the
African people.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Militants Massacre 101 People in 4 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's Islamic militants killed
101 villagers from last Thursday to Sunday in an atrocious
terrorist campaign launched two months before the legislative
elections to be held in the country, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen people had their throats cut Sunday in Ain Lehdid, 65
kilometers from the village of Tiaret southwest of Algiers, and 13
shepherds were kidnapped in the El-Gaada forest of the same region
Saturday by an armed group of Islamic militants, reported the
Algerian daily Liberte today.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed in a monastery in Sidi Abdelkrim near
Saida by a group of Islamic militants. The victims was the chief
of the monastery and his nephew, reported the Algerian daily El
Watan today.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants killed 84 other people, sometimes with chain
saw, in several mid-night raids upon villages in the center of the
country Thursday and Friday, reported Algerian papers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The most atrocious massacre took place Thursday night in the
hamlet village of Thalit, near Medea 80 kilometers south of
Algiers, where 52 people, including women, children and the
elderly, had their throats cut by a commando of 30 to 40 Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
Nine other people were killed and seven people kidnapped by
Islamic militants in their attacks upon two other villages in the
same province.
</P>
<P>
In Amroussa, a small village in the plain of Matidja, about 15
people had their throats cut and heads chopped off with chain saw
by Islamic militants headed by Antar Zouabri, the feared chief of
the militant group of Armed Islamic Group, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
In the same night, an armed group of Iswlamic militants
attacked a farm in M'ridja, near the seaside resort of
Sidi-Ferruch, 25 kilometers west of Algiers, killing four people.
</P>
<P>
An army barrack was reportedly only located 200 meters from the
site where the killing took place.
</P>
<P>
In the region of Bouira east of Algiers, four people were
killed Thursday on a road between Ain Bessem and Beni Slimane.
</P>
<P>
The massacres took place when Algerian security forces are
launching a heavy anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic
militants since early February in the southwestern regions of
Medea, Saida and Sidi Bel Abbes, and the western region of
Tlemcen.
</P>
<P>
Although the Algerian government has provided no specific
figures of casualties from the operation, Algerian papers said that
a large number of Islamists have been killed.
</P>
<P>
In a recent attack upon an Islamic stronghold in Kabylie, 100
kilometers east of Algiers, about 100 Islamic militants were
killed by the security forces who were backed by military
helicopters, reported El Watan.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militants, estimated at several thousand, use
heavily mined mountains, caves and forests as their bases to fend
off the attacks by government forces.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Turns Eye on Terminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Microsoft Corp., the world's
software giant, is turning its ears to the call for simpler
computers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. newspapers reported today that the company has begun
developing technology for what it calls Windows Terminal, a
desktop machine with no disk drive or stored software of its own.
Its software and files would be executed on a computer called a
server, with which the terminal would communicate over computer
networks.
</P>
<P>
"So that's a machine you never have to replace until there's
some radical change in the way that people interact with the
computers," said Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, in a speech
last week.
</P>
<P>
The concept is strikingly similar to a machine that Oracle
Corp. and others have called as a network computer (NC).
</P>
<P>
Desktop personal computer is known for its great flexibility
and efficiency. But the idea of centralizing computing resources
is beginning to regain momentum.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's shift, mentioned by Bill Gates, comes as Oracle
prepares to ship two long-awaited pieces of software that will be
used to power the network computers.
</P>
<P>
Oracle also plans to disclose soon its first substantial NC
order with a New York based company. Sun Microsystems Inc. and
International Business Machines Corp. also are big proponents of
NCs, which are expected to cost 500 to 1,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has long resisted the NC concept as one that could
reduce the need for companies to buy its operating systems and
applications software.
</P>
<P>
A research company predicts that NC sales to companies will
swell from 1.7 million units this year to 6.7 million by 2000.
Another research firm found that 58 percent of major corporations
it surveyed are evaluating NCs.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for 126.2 Mln Dlrs to Aid DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- UN Under-Secretary-General
Yasushi Akashi today called for 126.2 million dollars to meet
urgent humanitarian needs in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The appeal was based on proposals by the World Food Program,
the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations
Children's Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the
World Health Organization. It covered the period from April 1997
through March 1998, according to Akashi.
</P>
<P>
It focused on urgent needs in three priority sectors, resulting
from the effects of unprecedented flooding in the DPRK in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
The leading sector was food aid to meet the most urgent need
with an estimated expenditure over 95 million dollars. UN agencies
noted that the food situation in the DPRK has deteriorated with a
current grain shortfall of 2.36 million metric tons. The food aid
was aimed at providing nutritional support for children under six,
for hospitals and food for work projects.
</P>
<P>
The other priority sectors were food security for resuming
normal food production at a cost of nearly 21 million dollars and
restoration of basic health services which would need 9 million
dollars.

<P>
harare, april 7 (xinhua) -- government should provide
incentives that will encourage people, particularly in the rural
areas, to invest in solar, an expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Expert from U.N. Development Program (UNDP) Global Environment
Facility (GEF) solar energy project Gibson Mandishona said there
was need for a market-driven strategy which initiates an enabling
environment for the spread and use of solar.
</P>
<P>
He said the world solar summit hosted by Zimbabwe last year
had served to create an awareness on the need and importance of
renewable energy for development.
</P>
<P>
''It is now possible to embark on a more aggressive strategy
because the message has reached all corners of the world. It is
now important for us to ensure that the technology is made
available at affordable prices through installation of small
units such as solar kits and mobile lamps for lighting,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said GEF intended to forge ahead more vigorously and it was
now necessary to increase the capital base to facilitate the
expansion of the technology base.
</P>
<P>
He stressed solar energy had also ushered in other forms of
renewable sources of energy.

PARIS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Foreign Minister Don
Mckinnon today met here with his French counterpart, Herve de
Charette, during his visit in Paris which marked the end of
tension between the two countries over French nuclear tests in the
South Pacific from autumn 1995 to early 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon also met with French Minister of Cooperation Jacques
Godfrain and Delegate-Minister in Charge of Overseas Affairs
Jean-Jacques de Peretti.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the foreign minister, who also joined a ceremony

since New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger visited France in
1994.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said today,
"The visit in France by Mr. Mckinnon gave evidence to the
relaunching of dialogue between our two countries."
</P>
<P>
"Our belonging to the Pacific community and our attachment to
the democratic values, which the fighting given in common in the
past has illustrated, make New Zealand an important interlocutor
in the (Pacific) region," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ties between France and New Zealand were
marked in the past few years by an increased coordination in
providing assistance to the developing countries in the South

<P>
SARAJEVO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The UN Mission in Bosnia (UNMIBH)
today called on the world community to donate more funds for the
demining and related education efforts in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The appeal followed a tragic event Sunday in which three
children were killed when one of them accidentally set off a mine
near the house to which their family had just returned.
</P>
<P>
"With spring coming and more refugees and displaced persons
returning to their homes, we believe that more people will be
putting themselves at risk with regard to mines in
Bosnia-Herzegovina," said UNMIBH spokesman Alexander Ivanko.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we urgently need additional resources for the UN
effort to fund mine clearing activities in Bosnia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian land is believed to have been dotted with two
millions of mines during the war. While the UNMIBH has requested
for 38 million US dollars for demining programs in Bosnia, only
6.5 million US dollars are available now.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Bill to Be Tabled to Kenyan Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government would take
tough actions against tobacco advertizing, smoking in public
places and cigarette sales to under-18s if the Tobacco Control
Bill is passed at the current parliamentary session.
</P>
<P>
The bill to be debated at the last session of the seventh
parliament will require cigarette manufacturers to disclose the
tar and nicotine content of their products and to list diseases
related with smoking.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the nicotine standard for cigarettes
sold in Kenya is at a maximum rate of 2.2 miligrams per cigarette
and the cigarette packets should carry "low", "medium" and "high"
tar designations.
</P>
<P>
Punitive measures will be taken against smoking in such public
places as restaurants, buses, ships and aircraft flying internal
routes.
</P>
<P>
Selling cigarettes to those under 18 years will incur a
maximum fine of 10,000 Kenyan Shillings (about 178 U.S. Dollars)
or two months in jail.
</P>
<P>
The bill also says that cigarette advertizements will not be
allowed to run in the general media without the Health Ministry's
approval.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a curriculum to educate the youth against
cigarette and alcohol consumption was intended to be introduced
into the Kenyan primary and secondary school education system.
</P>
<P>
At present, it is being implemented on a pilot basis in some
schools in the east African country.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft to Be Launched to Saturn in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) A spacecraft is scheduled to be
launched to the Saturn on October 6, 1997, which will take a
seven-year, 3.2 billion kilometer trek to the ringed planet.
</P>
<P>
The small-bus-sized spacecraft Cassini-Huygens will be carried
by an American Titan IV-Centaur rocket from Cape Canaveral, the
British Royal Astronomical Society told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Soon after arrival, the European-built Huygens probe will be
released and parachute onto the unexplored surface of the giant
moon, Titan.
</P>
<P>
During the remainder of the mission, the Cassini orbiter will
continue on a four-year tour of the Saturn system, sending back a
stream of information on the planet, its 18 known moons and its
spectacular ring system.
</P>
<P>
Cassini-Huygens is a joint project between NASA, the European
Space Agency (ESA) and ASI (the Italian space agency). NASA has
primary responsibility for the Cassini orbiter while ESA is
responsible for the Huygens probe.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach the Saturn, the spacecraft will have to
complete a complicated tour of the inner Solar System. This will
involve encounters with the Venus (twice) and the Earth, followed
by a final gravity assist from the Jupiter in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
Arrival at the Saturn is scheduled for July 2004. On its first
orbit the Huygens probe will separate and plunge through the
orange clouds into the atmosphere of Titan, the Saturn's largest
moon.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to relay information back to the main
spacecraft until it hits dry land or splashes down in an ocean of
liquid hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
The planet Saturn has previously been visited by three
spacecraft Pioneer 11 in 1979, and the two Voyager spacecraft in
1980 and 1981. However, all these missions were "fly-bys,"
providing only a brief look at the Saturn system.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Locomotives Rolling into Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Four diesel locomotives produced in
China were today delivered to the Nigerian government as part of
the efforts to rehabilitate the country's railway system.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria Lu Fengding, on behalf of the
Chinese government, presented the keys of four Dongfeng brand
locomotives to Nigerian Transport Minister Major-General Ibrahim
Mumel amidst prolonged applause.
</P>
<P>
At the reception ceremony held in the Lagos-based Apapa port
complex, Mumel, who just came back from a visit to China two days
ago, said the arrival of the Chinese locomotives marked the
formal beginning of the reconstruction of Nigeria's more than
3,000 km of railways.
</P>
<P>
"The reception of these locomotives is a prelude, a very
significant prelude to better things to come. It is a prelude
heralding brighter days for the railway industry, and indeed the
transport industry in Nigeria," said Greg Ilukwe, sole
administrator of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC).
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's rail transportation has been nearly at a standstill
because of the poor management of the railways.
</P>
<P>
To revitalize the railway system as part of the effort to
improve its economy, Nigeria turned to China for assistance.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a contract in late 1995, giving green
light to the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation
(CCECC) to come to undertake the project.
</P>
<P>
According to the 526 million U.S. Dollars contract, the
Chinese side will also supply Nigeria with two locomotives and
other rolling stock including 150 coaches, 500 wagons and 100
guard vans.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is to increase the speed of train from the
current 75 km per hour to above 100 km, is scheduled to be
completed at the end of September 1998.
</P>
<P>
The four locomotives were transferred to the NRC this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to CCECC officials, more than 20 locomotives will be
delivered to Nigeria within this year, while the remaining 30 are
expected before the September 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economic Reform Aimed at Enhancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi
today said Kenya's economic reforms are aimed at enhancing the
private sector in the economy, according to a Kenya News Agency
report today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 72nd Rotary International District Conference in
port city Mombasa, he stated that the government confines itself
to those activities which it alone can perform well.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that efforts of the Kenyan government to
create an enabling environment for enterprises are now beginning
to yield results.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that inflation had been brought under control,
the Shilling's exchange rate had stabilized and the country's
foreign exchange reserves increased substantially to a
comfortable level.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth in gross domestic product increased from
0.2 percent in 1993 to 4.9 percent in 1995, which is seen as a
great achievement to Kenya, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi said the government is conscious of the adverse
effects of the Structural Adjustment Program affecting the common
people.
</P>
<P>
To shield the poor people, he stressed, the government has
designed social dimensions of development program and other
initiatives to cater for their needs.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the National Youth Development Fund is
designed to promote self-employment among the youth to address
their problems, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Continues to Drop in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Bank of
Tanzania (BOT) Idris Rashidi today said he is optimistic the rate
of inflation will reach 5 percent within the next 15 months.
</P>
<P>
He made this predication at a banker's conference at
Arusha in northern Tanzania, attributing the on-going decline of
inflation in Tanzania to improved tax collection, government
austerity and favorable external conditions such as stable oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
"If we go on with implementing 'sensible' fiscal and monetary
policies, we will reach the 5 percent target by June 1998, or
earlier," the governor said in a keynote address to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Rashidi noted that the government is striving to live within
its means through a cash-budget system introduced in May 1995,
under which expenditure was matched to revenue collections.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "this very sensible and simple system has
eliminated central bank lending to the government. In other
words, it has eradicated a practice of printing money as a source
of funding the government. And as a result, inflation has
declined precipitously".
</P>
<P>
He further said that a modest economic growth influenced the
slowdown of inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The agricultural sector, which accounts for 55 percent of
total GDP, increased by 7.0 percent," the governor observed,
saying, "as a result of improved agricultural performance,
average food price inflation during the year ended February, 1997
rose by 14 percent against an increase of 25 percent registered a
year earlier."
</P>
<P>
He said a strict monetary policy that aimed at checking excess
liquidity in the economy worked well in curbing inflation,
because money supply in the economy has been significantly
controlled.
</P>
<P>
Rashidi added that external conditions were also favorable,
saying that there was no major increase in oil prices nor
generalized increases in prices of Tanzania's major imports.

<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Church of Ireland
Robin Eames has warned that continued arson attacks on churches
will drag Northern Ireland into a new nightmare of division and
suffering.
</P>
<P>
The top Northern Ireland church leader made the statement
following a Roman Catholic church was destroyed earlier today in
the fifth arson attack on church property within one week.
</P>
<P>
The arsonist's actions were +one more example of the sickness
which lies at the root of so many of our problems,+ Eames said.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to community leaders to speak out against
these arson attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a latest opinion poll showed that almost all of
Northern Ireland's war-weary people want the next British
government to push ahead with the dead-locked Northern Ireland
peace process, but almost all the people polled are pessimistic
about the all-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The poll by Belfast's Queen's University revealed that 94
percent of the province's 1.5 million people supported the peace
talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But 74 percent of the people surveyed doubted that the peace
talks would lead to a negotiated settlement of a 28-year conflict
which has killed 3,200 people.

NAIROBI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) today
took the town of Kipushi on the Zambian border before dawn, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
A force of at least several hundred rebel troops swept through
Kipushi just 30 kilometers west of the crucial mining center and
second largest city of Lubumbashi, capital of Shaba province, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Lubumbashi headquarters of the Gecamines Mining Company
decided to shut up shop, pushing up cobalt prices in European
trading.
</P>
<P>
Airlines cancelled all flights to Lubumbashi as a precaution
in the city.
</P>
<P>
This happened at a time when Zaire peace talks were held in
South Africa without any results because the rebels insist that
President Mobutu Sese Seko quit power before cease-fire is
realized.
</P>
<P>
The rebels took up arms to fight last October and seized
Kisangani, the third largest city of Zaire in late March after
smashing an offensive launched by government troops.
</P>

They are now advancing along the road toward Lubumbashi and
have vowed to capture Kinshasa in June.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Petroleum Enterprise Incurs Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Petroleum
Enterprise has incurred a loss of 30 million Birr (about 4.5
million Dollars) during the last six months, Ethiopian Trade
Minister Kassahun Ayele said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the recent price adjustment on petroleum,
the minister ascribed the loss to last September's price
adjustment which, he said, was not leveled according to the
world market.
</P>
<P>
As government property, the enterprise had only to sell its
products at a fixed price and had been subsidized by the
government until the recent adjustment in the price of petroleum,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise might have been liquidated, had it not been for
the subsidy it used to obtain previously, he said, adding that
the recent price regulation, it is hoped, will enable it to
function at least on a loss-free basis.
</P>
<P>
The government adjusted prices of petroleum products on March
27, 1997 and said it will adjust petroleum prices every six
months.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is an oil import country. It imported 235 million
Dollars of oil and petroleum products in 1995/96.

<HEADLINE> France Reaffirms Support for Freezing Jewish Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- France today reaffirmed its wish for
a freezing of Israel's Jewish settlements in the Palestinian
territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, as well as its
opposition to a new housing project by Israel in Har Homa district
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
France also hopes that the United States will "respond
positively" to a proposed joint initiative by the United States
and the European Union (EU) on the relaunching of the peace
process in the Middle East, said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that our actions (between the United States and the
European Union) should be convergent and complementary," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials of EU countries decided in Brussels
Monday to propose to Washington a joint initiative to help
relaunch the Middle East peace process, which has now entered an
impasse following the Israeli decision to build the Har Homa
housing project with 6,500 flats.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, now on a visit in
Washington, has ruled out the possibility of freezing Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, or stopping the
building of the Har Homa settlement.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the holding of a 1978 David Camp style
tripartite meeting by the United States, Israel and Palestinians
on the resumption of peace talks between the Jewish state and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was judged as "premature" by U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who said Monday that he would like to have dialogue with
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy for the Middle East, Miguel Angel Moratinos, will
meet with French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette today in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said in an interview with a local newspaper, La
Charente Libre, that Europe "should play an active role by
exercising necessary pressure (on Israel) so that the peace
process could resume."
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the possibility of imposing economic sanctions
on Israel as a way to exert such pressure.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not Enthusiastic About Immediate Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said here today that an Arab summit is yet to be convened at a
right timing, but not now.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt believes that Arab leaders will not tarry in responding
to a call for holding an Arab summit if there is need for such a
meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
In statements to reporters after his visit to two high-tech
centers in the capital, Mubarak hailed the lastest Arab League
Council meeting, which has have approved a resolution recommending
Arabs to freeze normalization steps and resume economic boycott
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting last week, the Arabs, for the first time
since hardline Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu took
power last June, agreed to orchestrate concerted positions against
the construction for 6,500 homes for Jews in East Jerusalem, an
Israeli move that has stranded the already-sluggish peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu's insistence on continuing the controversial
project prompted calls for convening another Arab summit to force
Israel to comply.
</P>
<P>
Asked for his view on a meeting between Netanyahu and
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington, Mubarak sounded a
rather conservative tone and said he has not been informed of the
outcome yet.
</P>
<P>
"Let us wait and see what the current contacts will lead to,"
he said of the Netanyahu visit, which was arranged hastily in hope
of reviving the disrupted Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the same vein on Monday, the Egyptian leader
expressed reserved optimism that Clinton could persuade Netanyahu
to stop the settlement building.
</P>
<P>
"If the American initiative could succeed in convincing
Netanyahu, it would be a step ahead... But we'd better wait and
see," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, blaming Palestinian violence for the peace crisis
and refusing to halt the Jewish settlement building, flew to the
U.S. Sunday to seek backing for his offer to seal a final peace
with the Palestinians within six months.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians have refused to resume talks or security
cooperation with Israel unless the construction in East Jerusalem
and expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank stop.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration hopes to bring the two sides to
face-to-face talks with a new initiative aimed to press Netanyahu
to stop the settlement building and to urge Arafat to curb
Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, a longtime critic of Israel's hardline policies,
however, ruled out the possibility of cutting ties with Israel,
saying that it would not serve peace if Egypt, a key mediator in
the peace process, stops contacts with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
An intensive U.S.-Egyptian-Israeli summit at the Camp David,
the U.S., in 1978, led to a peace treaty between Egypt and
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Proposes Euro-Asian Alliance for CIS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said here today that an "Euro-Asian alliance" will be
the best model for the integration of the Commonwealth of the
Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
"The Integration in the CIS on various levels and with
different paces should be built on the basis of respecting each
other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and of mutual
benefit in trade," Nazarbayev told a joint press conference after
talks with visiting Kyrgyz President Askar Akayevich Akayev.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Russia-Belarus Union which was formed last
Wednesday, Nazarbayev said it was a new model in CIS integration.
</P>
<P>
He said the model might provide a new experience of integration
for other CIS countries, but Kazakhstan would wait to see its
development.
</P>
<P>
Akayev voiced support for Nazarbayev's idea of an Euro-Asian
Alliance, and said his country held the same stance as Kazakhstan
on CIS integration.
</P>
<P>
After their talks today, the two presidents signed a treaty on
permanent friendship, and 18 agreements and protocols on
investment, avoidance of double taxation, and on cooperation in
science, technology and military affairs,

parliament leaders, arrived in Alma Ata earlier today for a

<HEADLINE> KEDO Mission Leaves S.Korea for DPRK Direct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A 54-member team from the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) left South Korea
today for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to
negotiate the building of nuclear reactors in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The KEDO team left the eastern port of Tonghae, South Korea,
aboard a trainer ship of the South Korean Maritime University at
6:00 p.m. (0900 GMT), and sailed directly for the DPRK. This was
the first sea-route trip between South Korea and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the KEDO group and DPRK officials will focus
on preparations for ground breaking to build two 1,000-megawatt
light-water reactors in Shinpo, on the northeastern coast of the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was headed by KEDO deputy executive director,
South Korea's Choi Young-jin, and was composed of 40 South
Koreans, three United States delegates, three Japanese and eight
KEDO staff.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in the DPRK between April 9 to 15, the
delegation will survey the infrastructure for building the
reactors.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the implementation of the the five
protocols concluded with Pyongyang on inter-Korean communication,
and the utility of DPRK's human and material resources as well as
other social services.
</P>
<P>
The problem of transportation for the nuclear project is also
likely to be mentioned because South Korea regards the sea route
direct delivery as a good option.
</P>
<P>
The week-long discussion will be the first in a series of talks
which are expected before actual ground breaking for the
construction of the nuclear reactors, officials of South Korea's
office for the light-water nuclear project said.

<HEADLINE> Americans, Canadians Divided Over Anti-Cuba Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadians and Americans are deeply
divided over the United States' trade policy against Cuba, an
Angus Reid poll shows.
</P>
<P>
About 48 percent of Americans who responded to the poll opposed
the Helms-Burton Act, which penalizes foreign companies who do
business with Cuba, while 45 percent said they favored it,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted in March, surveyed 1,000 Canadians and
1,004 Americans. The error margin was 3.1.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade law is less popular in Canada, with 79 percent
of the Canadians polled saying that they were opposed to the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
John Wright, vice-president of the Angus Reid Group, said he
was surprised that so few Americans supported the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
"I would say there's a lot of fodder here for debate," the
Ottawa Citizen newspaper quoted Wright as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It shows the Chretien government is on track in terms of
foreign policy in this country, and there could be some sympathy
in the U.S. for our position."
</P>
<P>
Canada, which has broad trade links with Cuba, has been in the
forefront of the fight against the Helms-Burton Act.

<HEADLINE> German Workers Protest NATO Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- About 7,000 German civilian workers
demonstrated today in the southwestern city of Kaiserslautern in
protest against threatened job cuts by North Atlantic Treaty
Organization bases.
</P>
<P>
At dispute are plans of the United States military and other
NATO troops stationed in Germany to cut back their local service
work forces following the reduction of the troops after the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 12,000 local workers could lose
their jobs this year out of the total of 35,000 currently hired by
the military bases of the United States, Britain, France and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, about 100,000 local German civilian workers were hired
by NATO military bases in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were organized by the German trade union for
public service and transport, the OETV, and the employees' trade
union, the DAG, German media reports said.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 buses and private cars carried the demonstrators
to Kaiserslautern, where the largest U.S. garrison in Europe is
located.
</P>
<P>
The OETV chairman, Herbert Mai, called on the German civilian
workers to continue their strikes which began five weeks ago and
were suspended during Easter.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a job protection agreement at the next round
of negotiations with military employers scheduled for April 16-17
in Koblenz.

Their talks will be focused on the details of NATO's eastward
expansion plan, which France supports, and the envisaged charter
between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO Madrid summit to be held on July 8-9 will decide on
which central and eastern European nations will be absorbed by
NATO in the first wave of its expansion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS, Russia and NATO
could sign a charter specifying their relations by the end of May
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
However, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that it is
still too early to fix the date and venue for the signing of such
a charter, which is designed to install a privileged forum of
dialogue between the two former enemies during the Cold War, and
to alleviate Russian hostility toward NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
France has expressed its understanding of Russia's worry over
NATO expansion, which Moscow thinks would create a new division in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said in Prague last week that
NATO should convince Russia that its expansion would not make up a
humiliation or threat for Moscow.

<HEADLINE> EU Extends Trade Privileges for Andean Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOORDWIJK, the Netherlands, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The European
Union (EU) decided today to extend trade privileges for five
Andean countries, and promised to increase its investment in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The generalized system of preference (GSP), trade privileges,
on agricultural and fishery products would remain in force for the
five countries indefinitely, said a statement following a meeting
of EU foreign ministers with their counterparts of Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The GSP privileges have been granted mainly to encourage the
replacement of narcotic-drug production with food farming.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the GSP privileges, the statement said, there had been
an increase in business opportunities for investors from both the
EU and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The EU's troika -- the foreign ministers of the last, the
current and next presidents of the 15-nation bloc -- were meeting
Andean Pact nations on the periphery of a EU-Latin America
Ministerial Conference now under way in the Dutch seaside town of
Noordwijk.

<HEADLINE> Grace Period Extended for China's Overseas-funded Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council has decided
to extend a grace period by one year for taxes paid by certain
overseas-funded enterprises on imported equipment and materials.
</P>
<P>
According to a previous decision of the State Council, certain
overseas-funded enterprises set up before March 31, 1996 would
enjoy a grace period on imported equipment and raw materials until
December 31, 1996, but that any projects set up after April 1,
1996 would be subject to normal tariffs on imported equipment and
raw materials.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release from the State Council today,
overseas-funded enterprises that have already been approved for
the grace period will get an extension to December 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises are defined to be those that involve a total
overseas investment of less than 30 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the news release, the enterprises must have been
approved by local governments and filed with the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) before September
30, 1995, or have been approved by local governments and passed
assessment by the MOFTEC, the State Planning Commission (SPC) and
the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) between October 1,
1995 and March 31, 1996. They need to pass annual assessments by
the MOFTEC, SPC, and SETC for 1997 also.
</P>
<P>
The decision is intended to allow enterprises that have already
been set up to continue operation and production according to
their initial plans and feasibility studies, and to safeguard the
interest of overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> China's Project Hope Raises Nearly A Billion Yuan in 8 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Project Hope, the national
fund-raising program to help students in poverty-stricken areas,
has collected 978 million yuan over the past eight years, allowing
1.5 million poor youngsters to return to school.
</P>
<P>
The figures come from Liu Peng, chairman of the Board of the
Chinese Youth Development Foundation, who spoke with Xinhua
today. Since 1987, he said, when the organization was founded, it
has helped build over 3,600 Hope primary schools and 10,000 Hope
libraries for village primary schools, and more than 3,000 primary
school teachers have been given rewards or have been provided with
training by project funds.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Project Hope had helped build or plan at
least one primary school for each of the nearly 600 poor counties
in China.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, he said, the national program plans to
start a new round of fund-raising efforts since the government has
set a goal of "basically popularizing nine-year compulsory
education" and "basically solving the problem of food and clothing
for 58 million poor people" by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
This year, Project Hope plans to raise 500 million yuan, help
300,000 dropouts, and build 1,000 Hope primary schools, he said,
noting that a nationwide fund-raising campaign will begin in May.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope will mainly collect donations through banks and a
deal has been made with the China Construction Bank and the
Agricultural Bank of China for this.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa confirmed here today that he has also received
information that exiled New People's Army leader Jose Sison has
ordered his fighters to intensify attacks against the government.
</P>
<P>
De Villa said Sison issued the order to the New People's Army,
the National Democratic Front's military branch, on March 29
during the anniversary of the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
However, de Villa said the peace process between the government
and the NDF in the Netherlands is still on. The two sides are
reported to have reached three agreements and are expected to
conclude their talks in June this year.
</P>
<P>
With Sison's order to step up attacks, the military chief said
that government troops have been told to be careful.
</P>
<P>
"Our troops in the field have been advised accordingly that
there is such an order from the New People's Army leadership," de
Villa said.
</P>
<P>
De Villa declined to speculate on any deadlock in the on-going
talks but expressed the hope that the NDF will negotiate in good
faith and try to help everyone arrive at a mutually acceptable
term.
</P>
<P>
Former Senator Rodolfo Biazon, a consultant to the government
panel negotiating with the NDF, chided Sison for calling for

on a wide scale on the basis of an ever-expanding and deepening
mass base."

ROME, April 8 (Xinhua) -- AS Roma fired Argentine coach Carlos
Bianchi and replaced him with the 74-year-old Swedish legend Nils
Liedholm on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bianchi, who has was appointed to the spot last summer, paid
for a 2-1 defeat to Cagliari on Sunday which left Roma four points
adrift of a place in next season's UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
Bianchi was under contract with Roma until June 1998 and said
he will not be coaching anyone next season.
</P>
<P>
Liedholm has been chosen while Roma look for a permanent
replacement and possibly Bayern Munich's Giovanni Trapattoni will
be the head coach for next season.
</P>
<P>
Liedholm, who left his native Sweden for Italy and AC Milan in
1949, won four league titles as a player (1949, 1950, 1960 and
1961), before starting his coaching career with Milan.

<HEADLINE> EU to Help Bolivia Fight Drug Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOORDWIJK, the Netherlands, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The European
Union (EU) agreed today to provide Bolivia with 30 million ECUs
(34 million U.S. dollars) for its efforts in tackling drug
production.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was singed by Manuel Marin, European Commissioner
responsible for EU relations with Latin America, and Bolivian
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar, in parallel with the EU-Latin
America Ministerial Conference in the Dutch seaside town of
Noordwijk.
</P>
<P>
The first part of the project will provide about 19 million
ECUs (21.5 million dollars) to Bolivia's Chaparral region, where
large quantities of drug are believed to originate. It will be
used for finding alternative crops to coca -- used in making
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Marin said nations which consumed
narcotic drugs should take more responsibility for helping stop
their production, by encouraging alternative crops.
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility cannot be reduced to the producers," he said.
"There is another responsibility for those countries which consume
drugs."
</P>
<P>
The EU's methods of tackling drug production contrasts with
those of the United States -- the world's biggest consumer of
narcotics -- which links aid to countries first showing visible
evidence of tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's lucrative trade privileges with the U.S. were placed
in jeopardy earlier this year when Washington said the country
would be on a list of those not doing enough to tackle drug
production.
</P>
<P>
But Marin said the EU "did not believe in exclusive sanctions"
as a way of tackling drug production.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Revise Penal Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has urged
the legislature to revise the penal code in order to tackle
corruption, drug abuse and child sexual abuse more effectively.
</P>
<P>
Some articles of the present penal code, which exposed "many
mistakes and errors", will be considered and revised immediately
in order to serve the fight against crime, Justice Minister
Nguyen Dinh Loc said.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam News Agency quoted him as saying that lack of
details and clear definition of corruption acts in the present law
hindered the effectiveness of the anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
"This has caused many difficulties for the determination of
corrupt acts as well as punishment scales. This has also created
loopholes for legal abuses," Loc said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "almost all corruption-related offenses will
be given higher punishment scales and focus on individual
offenders."
</P>
<P>
On drug abuse, the minister said the revised law will give a
new chapter to drug-related crimes, as against the existing two
articles on narcotic production, trafficking and abuse in the
penal code.
</P>
<P>
To effectively prevent child sexual crimes, the revised code
will include a new article on the child sexual abuse with tough
punishment scales, the minister noted.

ISLAMABAD, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Agriculture Minister
Abida Hussain said here today the supply of wheat will be improved
in a couple of days while appealing people not to buy more than
necessary and not to hoard.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of imported wheat at Karachi and start of
harvesting season in the provinces of Sindh and Punjab, the
availability of wheat has been started improving, Abida said at a
news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
She said one ship carrying 47,250 tons of wheat has docked at
Karachi and releasing wheat which was being transported to the
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Eight more ships carrying 378,000 tons of wheat would reach
Karachi in the next few days, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said by the time wheat in all the provinces would have been
harvested.
</P>
<P>
The position of wheat supply in other three provinces was under
control whereas there was a problem in North West Frontier
province which was due to reasons of logistics and distribution,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the situation in the NWFP was unfortunately being
multiplied by the blockage of roads and access to the flour mills,
she said. Forced closure of flour outlet and shops also created
problems for the government to ensure a smooth supply of wheat.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Shen Guofang today said that China hopes that those countries that
still insist on making an anti-China motion at the UN human rights
conference will decide to stop confrontation.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question at a press conference here, Shen said
that the decision taken by France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece,
and Japan not to support the anti-China motion at the UN Human
Rights Commission is a wise one.
</P>
<P>
He said that this decision is in keeping with the desires of
the majority of the countries attending the conference for holding
dialogues instead of confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Western nations, for six consecutive years, have presented
anti-China motions to the conference, but all of them have met
with a great deal of opposition, proving that confrontation won't
help solve problems, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said China hopes that those countries that persist in
putting forth anti-China motions will seriously consider the
appeals of the majority of the participants in the human rights
conference and change their position.
</P>
<P>
If certain countries insist on taking the lead in making
anti-China motions, their action will inevitably bring harm to the
bilateral relations and to the normal exchange in the human rights
field, the spokesman said.

The agreement will allow Russia to increase sales to the EU
while gradually developing normal competitive conditions in its
steel industry, notably in competition policy, state aid and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, EU quotas will be raised by 10 percent in
1997, a further five percent increase in 1998 and 2.5 percent more
each year up to the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
This process could come forward depending on when Russia
applies competition, state aid and environmental disciplines
compatible with those in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the deal, Sir Leon Brittan, EU commissioner for
trade policy, said: ``This agreement shows Europe's commitment to
open markets and provides a strong incentive to Russia to build
its steel sector firmly on the principles of fair trade, rigorous
competition and a clean environment."
</P>
<P>
The new agreement with Russia will replace the 1995-96
agreement, which has been extended until June 30, 1997. It will
cover the period until December 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be reviewed if Russia joins the World Trade
Organization before 2001.
</P>
<P>
It will be submitted for approval to the EU Council of
Ministers and the Russian government, and should come into force
in the autumn.

period up to June 30, 1997," a spokesman for the office said.
</P>
<P>
The total estimated provision for the CE and his office is 49.4
 million HK dollars (6.3 million US dollars), comprising the

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Education has become a
billion-dollar export industry for Australia, as in 1995-96
120,000 overseas students studying in the country had brought in
600 million Australian dollars (about 450 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Additional benefits came from their contribution to teaching
and research, future trade opportunities and tourism by their
relatives and friends, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
said in a bulletin today.
</P>
<P>
"The export of education is one of the major success stories of
the Australian service sector in recent years, generating earnings
of more than one billion Australian dollars (780 million US
dollars) annually," the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the students came from the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The students regarded Australia as an easily accessible country
which provides high-quality, internationally recognized education
at a lower cost than the US, the ABS said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- In another sign indicating the
deterioration of relations with the Palestinians, Israel today
did not allow the Palestinian Council members to travel from
Gaza to Ramallah in the West Bank for a weekly meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Queria (Abu Ala), President of the legislative
Palestinian Council, said that "there is no logic in the world
which justified the government of Israel to reach this level of
insolence and arrogance," according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S., Russia, EU and other countries the
world over to act and stop interruptions by Israel of the
activities of Palestinian political bodies and disgracing the
dignity of the Palestinian Council members.
</P>
<P>
As the Palestinian Council failed to convene in Ramallah
today, it decided to put off the session until Wednesday. It is
not clear whether the Israeli authorities have promised to
permit the Gaza members to leave Gaza and enter West Bank
Wednesday or not.
</P>
<P>
The total closure imposed by Israel on the Palestinian
territories following the Tel Aviv suicide bombing last month
remains in force. The Israeli authorites warned that more
terrorist attacks are in the offing.

<HEADLINE> Second Mad Cow Case Found in Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A second case of bovine
spongiform encephalopathey (BSE), or mad cow disease, has been
found in the Netherlands, just over two weeks after the first.
</P>
<P>
Dutch newspapers said on Tuesday that the disease was diagnosed
in a cow in the northern province of Friesland.
</P>
<P>
The first BSE case in the Netherlands was reported on March
21. The cow was slaughtered in late March and the Dutch
government has provided full details of the case to the European
Commission in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, the farm where the infected cow was detected
has been sealed off and all livestock there will be killed. The
slaughterhouse has also been closed and all its stocks of meat
will be destroyed, the government said.
</P>
<P>
The infection is a brain-wasting disease which has been linked
to a new strain of a fatal human equivalent called
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, about 178,000 BSE cases have been confirmed in the
European Union and Switzerland, according to figures published by
the European Commission. The majority of those cases -- around
172,000 -- have occurred in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has also been struggling in recent weeks to
contain an outbreak of swine fever which has already led to a EU
export ban and the destruction of several thousand pigs.

the Republic on matters concerning the politcal life of the
country.

<P>
The draft law also stipulates that Savimbi ranks second among
the leaders of the various parties in the assembly concerning
protocol. He also enjoys the same immunity and other privileges
with leaders of the state sovereign organs born through
elections.
</P>
<P>
The draft law was passed with 120 affirmative votes and 6

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, meeting
with a delegation from the US's Exxon Corporation in Beijing
today, led by vice-president R.E. Wilhelm, expressed his
appreciation for the company's long-term cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government is very attentive to
petrochemical industry developments because it is one of the
pillar sectors of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Exxon is one of the world's best-known
petrochemical corporations and that the China Petrochemical
Corporation (Sinopec) is one of the most powerful in China.
Cooperation between the two giants is beneficial in using each
other's strong points.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier told the American guests that China, which is
developing its economy with its own force, is also seeking foreign
cooperation and support. He said he advocates this kind of
cooperation, combining foreign technology and capital with China's
resources, manpower, and huge market.
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm said that Exxon has had economic links with China for
over 100 years. Since the 1980s, it has actively participated in
China's energy development, including oil and gas exploration,
development and transportation, electricity generation, and
marketing of oil and chemical products.
</P>
<P>
Zou expressed his appreciation for the cooperation between
Exxon and Sinopec and Fujian Province in a huge refinery and
chemical project there, and urged both sides to expand the
long-term cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and equal
development.

<P>
Also present at the meeting were Vice-Minister of the State
Planning Commission Ye Qing and President of the China

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore government ministries
and agencies will, in the next one or two years, start charging
each other for selected support services that are now provided
free, Finance Minister Richard Hu said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that by establishing a buyer-seller relationship
between ministries, it would cultivate a "customer service"
mindset among the departments.
</P>
<P>
It would also allow resources to be better used by discouraging
the tendency to over consume when services were free of charge, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said this to reporters when he
commissioned 102 ministries and government departments as
autonomous agencies (AA).
</P>
<P>
Other initiatives include making the AAs pay the rental of
their premises, including government-owned ones. This, Hu said,
would encourage prudence when choosing the location and size of
office space.
</P>
<P>
These changes are important in reforming the civil service to
one with the best conditions for Singapore to succeed, the finance
minister said.

<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen
Guofang said today that China has paid close attention to the
situation in Zaire, and sincerely hopes that the parties involved
will settle their dispute through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question at a press conference today, Shen said
that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has
taken an active part in UN discussions and consultations on the
Zairian conflict, and it backs a peaceful resolution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has brought deep suffering to the Zairian people
and to refugees in eastern Zaire, and is endangering the peace and
stability of the Great Lake region and the African continent as a
whole, Shen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During a recent special summit meeting held by the Organization
of African Unity and attended by heads of state and government
leaders of a dozen African nations, UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, and OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, efforts by
those involved helped the two sides in the dispute agree to hold
peace talks, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
South African leaders are now presiding over direct talks in
Pretoria between delegates from the two sides of the dispute,
according to the spokesman who said China hopes they will respond
to the appeal for peace by the international community and end the
dispute through negotiations at an early date to maintain national
unity and ethnic harmony, resume social stability, and work
together for the development of country.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates and backs the efforts of the OAU, the UN, and
other African countries to properly settle the dispute, Shen said,
and hopes the negotiations will be fruitful, so that peace in
Zaire will be realized and the people of the region will be free
from the suffering of war.

Nations have appealed for more aid amounting to 126 million
U.S. dollars to meet urgent humanitarian needs in the Democratic

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China has seen a steady increase
in industrial output in the first quarter, according to a monthly
report on the country's industrial production released by the
State Statistics Bureau (SSB) today.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the January-March period, the country's
industry above the township-level had an output value of 452.5
billion yuan, an increase of 11 percent over the same period of
last year, when adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
There is a growing trend in industrial production, the report
said, which last March jumped to 13.5 percent, a sharp rise
compared with the average of 10.4 percent in January and February.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, the output value increased 6.8 percent in
the state-owned sector and in enterprises controlled by the state,
while foreign-funded and other enterprises registered 14.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's light and heavy industries developed in harmony
with each other during the January-March period, with the product
mix improving.
</P>
<P>
Added value in light industry stood at 190.3 billion yuan, up
11.2 percent from the same period of 1996. That for heavy industry
was 262.2 billion yuan, representing an increase of 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that production of durable consumer goods like
color televisions, radios, cameras, washing machines,
refrigerators, and air-conditioners saw a big increase in the
first quarter, with growth rates ranging from 12.7 percent to 33.6
percent.

Energy and major raw materials output saw a comparatively
smooth increase, while sharp increases were reported in building
materials and products for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
Industrial sales saw a slight increase, averaging 93.96
percent, up 0.85 percentage points from the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The light industrial sector reported sales of 93.53 percent, an
increase of 1.12 percentage points over the corresponding 1996
period, while that of heavy industry was 94.3 percent, up 0.63
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the bureau of 360,000 domestic
enterprises, there was upward momentum in profits in the
industry. The composite index for industry in the January-February
period stood at 77.35 points, up 1.21 percentage points over the
same period of last year, while Chinese enterprises had 7.08
billion yuan in profits, a slight rebound of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the SSB monthly report says that existing problems and
difficulties of the industry, especially bottlenecks in production
and management and increasing losses in the state-owned sector,
are far from being solved, in spite of a series of "positive
changes" in the country's industrial operations in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the structural readjustment efforts should
be increased in the industrial sector, and that reforms in
state-owned enterprises should be accelerated for greater progress
in "operation quality" in the industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) has agreed in principle to South Korea's proposal for
opening a trade office in a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
The office is expected to be set up in the DPRK's Rajin Sonbong
free trade zone within this year, said Hong Ji-son, head of the
semi-official Korea Trade Investment and Promotion Agency (KOTRA)
in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hong met officials of the DPRK's Committee for
Promotion of External Economic Cooperation during his eight-day
visit to Pyongyang, and held talks on the trade office proposal.
</P>
<P>
Following Hong's further proposal to send five KOTRA staff to
the trade office, DPRK officials failed to give an immediate
reply, saying they needed time to ponder it.
</P>
<P>
However, KOTRA predicted it would be able to establish the
office in the free trade area in June, in view of recent warming
of DPRK-United States relations.
</P>
<P>
Hong said he also proposed a trade fair in the zone in the
second half of this year and received an affirmative reply from
the DPRK.

CANBERRA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Up to June 30, 1996, the
estimated resident population of Australia was 18,289,000,
representing a national population growth rate of 1.3 percent
since June 30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The net population gain from overseas migration was 114,170,

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Continue Ban on Meat Import From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Agriculture Secretary
Salvador Escudero today announced anew the temporary ban on
importation of livestock, meat and meat products from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Escudero said in a statement the ban is necessary to ensure
that no infected-livestock or contaminated meat and meat products
enter the country.
</P>
<P>
Escudero also directed the Quarantine and Animal/Plant
Inspection in all major entry-exit points such as the
international airports and ports to implement appropriate measures
such as the foot baths to prevent the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said his department will not take any single risk of
endangering its livestock industry, particularly the hog industry
which suffered a major blow in 1995 due to the Foot-Mouth-Disease
(FMD) outbreaks in Luzon.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine Bureau of Animal Industry said the FMD
outbreak, which occurred in Taiwan on March 10, is quite different
from the FMD strains in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has the so-called Asia I type FMD strain whereas in the
Philippines, there are three FMD strains, namely, O1, which is
similar to the Hong Kong FMD strain, and A24 and C3 of the South
American strains, the bureau said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has immediately notified Taiwanese
authorities to stop all exportation of live pigs, meat and meat
products to the Philippines since the FMD outbreak started in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is primarily importing pig skin and live
breeding animals such as swine from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the reported outbreak of Swine Fever in the
Netherlands and Germany also prompted the Philippines to ban the
importation of live pigs, pork and pork products from the
Netherlands and Germany.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's sowing area this year will
increase by 1.6 million ha, or 1.05 percent, over last year,
according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the sowing area will total 153 million ha this
year.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the planting area for grain, oil-bearing crops,
and sugar crops will increase while that for cotton, linen, and
medicinal crops will decrease.
</P>
<P>
The southern part of the country will witness increasing sowing
area and the northern part decreasing.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the change to the southern parts'
attention to agricultural production, especially grain
production. The northern provinces, suffering from monoculture and
lower grain prices, cut their grain planting area this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, the grain planting area in the country
will reach 112.55 million ha this year, up 0.36 percent from last
year, with summer grain area rising by 2.67 percent.

<P>
MACAO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration on the Question of Macao, which was signed 10 years
ago, has yielded positive results under the friendly cooperation
between China and Portugal, a senior Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said in an interview with Xinhua that the joint declaration bears
"significant historical and immediate importance" and is being
carried out seriously by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The joint declaration has been implemented over the past ten
years under the friendly cooperation between China and Portugal,"
said the director.
</P>
<P>
"Under the frame of the declaration, progress has been made in
the latter period of Macao's transition.
</P>
<P>
The declaration is very helpful to the preparation for the
establishment of a special administrative region (SAR)."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the declaration has played an
"encouraging role in Macao's economic growth and social
stability."
</P>
<P>
Signed on April 13, 1987, the declaration says that China will
resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao as of December 20,
1999, and that Macao's capitalist system and basic life style will
remain unchanged for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"The successful settlement of the Macao issue has ushered the
friendly ties between the governments and peoples of the two
countries in a new stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the joint declaration was a major event in the
history of China.
</P>
<P>
He said "Macao will enter into a new prosperous period under
the principles of 'one country, two systems,' a high degree of
autonomy and 'Macao people governing Macao.'"
</P>
<P>
"The best way to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the joint
declaration is to well-handle two major tasks in Macao -- one is
to keep Macao's economy growing and society stable, and the other
is to prepare for the establishment of the future Macao SAR
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that the two tasks will be fulfilled
through further cooperation between the two countries.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang told a press conference here today that the
European Union's discussion of a statement on the Hong Kong issue
is "inappropriate" and that China cannot accept interference in
its internal affairs in the matter.
</P>
<P>
Before July 1, Shen said, the Hong Kong issue is "a matter

He said the Chinese Government has all along acted in
accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic

that after Hong Kong's return the Chinese Government will
safeguard the democratic rights and freedom of Hong Kong citizens
and will protect other countries' legitimate rights and interests
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the EU will try to understand Hong Kong's real
situation and China's policy toward Hong Kong, and do the
necessary study of the matter," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU should not listen to the words of other people
that contradict reality and should not follow some people in
"playing the international card" on the Hong Kong issue.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Asset, Capital Check-up Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China will expand an experiment in
checking the asset value and capital stock of urban-based
collective enterprises, according to a national meeting that
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The accounting effort is a primary effort to promote the reform
and development of the collective economy and to strengthen
enterprise management, said Zhang Youcai, deputy minister of
finance.
</P>
<P>
"The collective sector is an important basis of China's
socialist, public-owned economy and is a main part of the
socialist public ownership," he said.
</P>
<P>
As China deepens reform and accelerates its pace to build a
socialist market economic system, the collective sector has become
an inseparable force of the national economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The collective economy plays an important role in developing
production, making the market more prosperous, creating job
opportunities, improving people's living standards, and
maintaining social stability," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"To check the asset value and capital stock of the urban
collective enterprises also amounts to a large-scale,
comprehensive survey of China's national conditions and strength,"
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
China launched a pilot program to ascertain the assets and
capital stock of urban collective enterprises last year, covering
13,000 such enterprises in 226 cities and prefectures nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of the State Commission of Economy
and Trade, said that expanding the program will be helpful to
standardizing the property rights relationship of the collective
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li Yonggui, a chief economist of the State Administration of
Taxation, said that the latest effort is of real significance to
cultivating new tax resources and to raising the tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Official records show that China had 495,000 urban-based
collective enterprises at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Urges Delhi to Maintain Ganges Water Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
called on New Delhi to maintain the flow of Ganges waters to the
country as per the provisions of the Indo-Bangladesh Water Treaty
signed in December 1996, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's concern was conveyed to Indian officials at the
just-concluded senior official level meeting on water on Monday,
said the sources.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the water flow to Bangladesh
of the river Ganges has continued being much below the agreed
water level stipulated in the treaty since this February.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Bangladesh officials failed to get any specific
assurance from the Indian officials about increasing the Ganges
flow to Bangladesh, particularly during the current critical
period of the dry season which began in early March.
</P>
<P>
The Indian officials said they will convey the concern and the
outcome of the meeting to their government.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side also mentioned that slow melting of Himalayan
ice and scarce rainfall had caused drop in the water level.

<HEADLINE> 4 Million Tanzanians Face Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said about 4 million Tanzanians are facing food
shortage, needing some 138,765 tons of cereals and legumes to
sustain them in the next five months.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said this in his speech broadcast live by
Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam (RTD) on Monday, adding that the
government has so far spent some 2.83 million U.S. dollars on
easing the water shortage in Dar es Salaam, buying and
distributing relief food to famine hit areas.
</P>
<P>
"In the spirit of truth and transparency, I would like the
public to realize that this year's drought which has caused food
and water shortage will cost the government dearly," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This will imply diversion of funds which were initially
earmarked for development and social services," he added.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the government was striving to ensure
that relief supplies reached all the most hit areas, citing them as
Arusha, Coast, Dodoma, Kilimanjaro, Lindi, Mara, Mwanza,
Shinyanga, Singida, Tabora and Tanga regions.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the public to use food sparingly, saying a
joint evaluation by the Tanzanian government, the World Food
Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the
U.S. aid agency USAID, showed that the situation was grave.
</P>
<P>
He told the nation that WFP has already shown interest of
giving Tanzania 11,000 tons of food, adding that it has so far
given the country 500 tons which have been distributed in Arusha
and Lindi regions.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa also appealed for relief supplies from the
public, religious organisations and various companies for flood
victims in Lindi Region of eastern Tanzania where 59 people have
so far died.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Alleviation Key to Peace in Nigeria: Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Poverty and rural development are
key to future progress and stability in Nigeria, Chairman of the
Vision 2010 Committee of Nigeria Ernest Shonekan said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of a workshop of the committee on the
subject in Abuja, the former head of the interim government of
Nigeria warned that poverty is spreading in Nigeria and could
threaten the peace and stability of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He deplored the failure of all previous rural development
programs and called for a new one to be evolved.
</P>
<P>
About 62 percent of Nigeria's estimated 102 million population
now live in rural areas. In 1991, Nigeria was announced to be the
13th poorest country in the world by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to Shonekan, the level of poverty "has been rising
in leaps and bounds".
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the workshop, Dr. Foluso Okunmadewa of the
World Bank urged the Nigerian government to make "a firm
commitment to poverty reduction by making it the core element of
the development strategy."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of National Planning Ayp Ogunlade said
frequent policy changes has been responsible for perpetuation of
poverty in the country.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Overseas Aid Falls Sharply in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan's official development aid
(ODA) fell 35 percent from 1995 to about 9.6 billion U.S. dollars
in 1996, the first since 1989 that its ODA in dollars terms
dropped from the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop resulted from a 15-yen plunge in the exchange
rate of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Foreign Ministry fears that the drop may make
Japan lose its position as the world's leading ODA donor country,
which it has enjoyed for five consecutive years up to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ODA kept growing in the early 1990s thanks to the
appreciation of the yen against the dollar, even though the amount
in terms of yen did not increase much.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ODA peaked at about 14.7 billion dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Investigate Illegal Immigration Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan immigration officer has
said that he would send his officers to investigate an illegal
immigration ring which brings into Kenya hundreds of expatriates
every year, the East African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper said Coast Province Immigration Officer
Zacchaecus Mboya had ordered for full details of the expatriate
contingent in the province.
</P>
<P>
The local paper today exposed powerful Italian tycoons
operating a Mafia-style tax evasion, thus denying Kenyan economy
millions of Dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the illegal aliens enter the country
disguided as tourists, but were quickly given jobs in a myriad of
Italian-owned businesses.

<P>
According to the paper, the aliens have no bank accounts in
the country, nor the mandatory personal identification number for
any employed person.
</P>
<P>
The syndicate's operations are centered on the Kenya's North
Coast tourist resort towns of Watamu, Malindi and Mambrui, and
the expatriates are mainly employed at Italian-owned holiday
villas, cottages and hotels.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that they were flown in by airlines operated
by the same companies running the hotels.
</P>
<P>
The paper got a list of 300 illegal Italian expatriates from
two of the hotels involved in the ring, who are rotated every
three months to avoid their illegal employment.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Italian expatriates earn a basic salary of between
600 and 800 U.S. Dollars a month which is banked directly back
home in Italy, it added.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Revenue Authority Commissioner-General Yussuf Nzibo
confirmed that his office had received reports of organized tax
evasion by foreigners in the North Coast resorts.
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of these reports and I have passed them on to the
Commissioner of Income Tax to investigate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Boniface Munyao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central
Organization of Trade Unions, said that "we want the government
to check this and deport the Italians involved because they are
depriving Kenyans of their right to employment."

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Use Lead-Free Gasoline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will lead China's use of
lead-free gasoline to reduce air pollution in the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to a municipal plan, Beijing will distribute
lead-free gasoline at more than 300 filling stations in eight
urban districts beginning July 1.
</P>

China's other four large cities, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou
and Shenzhen, will gradually adopt similar measures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the output of lead-free petrol accounted
for 60 percent of the country's total. That figure is expected to
rise to 80 percent by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Hits Monthly Record of Car Output in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's auto production hit a
monthly record in March, said a report of Korea's Automobile
Manufacturers Association (KAMA) released today.
</P>
<P>
Despite a sluggish domestic auto market this year, the total
production of seven carmakers stood at 271,801 units in March, up
8.6 percent from the same month last year, KAMA's preliminary
figures said.
</P>
<P>
The record production brought the total car output in the first
quarter to 632,481 units, 10 percent less than that in the same
period last year, due mainly to labor strikes early this year.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Motor topped the other carmakers by rolling out 120,623
units in March, up 28.9 percent from the previous month and 12.2
percent from March last year. Kia Motor made 67,240 units last
month, up 21.6 percent from February and 0.5 percent from March
last year.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter's sales of 539,368 units fell 17.7 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Slow auto sales are likely to result in an oversupply of cars,
putting a further burden on carmakers.
</P>
<P>
According to KAMA and Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy,
South Korea's car production capacity will be 3.953 million units
this year. However, due to the inventory stockpile, only 3 million
will be actually produced, at an average operation ratio of 75.9
percent, lower than 80.2 percent last year, industry sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Gets Grants For Malaria Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Orgnisation (WHO) has allocated 600,000 U.S. dollars to Tanzania
under a 9-million-dollar malaria control scheme involving 21
African countries.
</P>
<P>
WHO country representative Dr. Dirk Warning made this
disclosure when speaking at the climax of celebrations to mark
the World Health Day here on Monday, saying the money would be
used to support the four-year action plan of the National Malaria
Control Program launched on April 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the action plan (1997-2000) outlines how Tanzania and
WHO would jointly renew the fight against malaria in Tanzania and
reduce the impact of the disease drastically before the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that malaria was a public health problem in many
countries in the world, threatening about 40 percent of the
world's population and that 90 per cent of the affected people
live in Sub-Sahara Africa.
</P>
<P>
Warning further said malaria also has a lot of economic
implications in Tanzania in which about 100,000 out of over 15
million affected people die of the diseases annually, adding that
Tanzania was losing over 100 million U.S. Dollars annually due to
malaria treatment and management.
</P>
<P>
He said this year the World Health Day was being marked under
the theme "emerging and re-emerging communicable diseases" and
that in Tanzania the major communicable disease remained malaria.

BONN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's unemployment fell to 4.47
million, or 11.7 percent, in March from a postwar record high in
February of 4.67 million, or 12.2 percent, showed official figures
released today.
</P>
<P>
About 194,700 fewer people were jobless last month. In western
Germany, joblessness dropped by 130,000 to about 3.12 million
while in eastern part of the country, unemployment declined by
64,700 to nearly 1.35 million.
</P>
<P>
Bernhard Jagoda, chief of the Federal Labour Office, said the
improvement in the country's unemployment situation came as a
result of the annual rebound in construction sector and other
outdoor jobs.
</P>
<P>
Exceptionally mild weather had also contributed to the
increased hiring, he said.

<P>
SANTIAGO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
today met a visiting Chinese military delegation headed by Zhang
Wannian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of China.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they said they were satisfied with the
great development in the relationship between the two countries
and two armies.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the visit is aimed to promote mutual understanding
and friendship between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
He also introduced the defensive military policy of China --
never seeking hegemony, non-interference in others' internal
affairs, non-military alignment and not sending troops to other
countries or building military bases aboard.
</P>
<P>
Frei said that he agreed to the Chinese defense policy and the
two countries, which have identical military policy, should push
forward their relationship.
</P>
<P>
He also said that exchange of visits by senior leaders between
the two countries is helpful to the development of the bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation arrived in Santiago on April 4 for a
four-day visit here following a four-day visit to Argentina. It
will go to Brazil later to complete its South American tour.

<HEADLINE> Manila Wants Talks With Muslim Rebels on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government expressed
the hope today that its low-level peace talks with the rebel Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will open Wednesday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Fortunato Abat, head of the government peace panel, told
reporters his technical committee will come to the scheduled venue
"with or without the MILF panel."
</P>
<P>
The technical committees of the government and the MNLF were
scheduled to meet on April 9-10 in Cotabato city in the southern
province of Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
But a statement made by the MILF earlier this month said it
would boycott the talks until the March 16 bombing in Buldon,
Maguindanao, is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, 10 students and a teacher were killed when
a shell hit a school building in Buldon town, where the MILF and
the military were then exchanging gun fire. Both the MILF and the
military blamed each other for the killing.
</P>
<P>
The government has formed a team to look into the incident and
so far failed to determine which side should be responsible.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MNLF began exploratory talks in January,
but the talks have been on-and-off because of sporadic fighting
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF, a breakaway group of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), is currently the largest anti-government group in
the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The group is opposed to the peace deal concluded last September
between the MNLF and the government and wanted its own peace talks
with the government.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Official, Rebel Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A Uganda senior official and a rebel
representative agreed to sign a protocol of understanding, ''the New
Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Martin Aliker, Ugandan State Minister for Foreign Affairs, and
Alfred James Obita, the Lord's Resistance Army's (LRA) Secretary for
External Relations and Mass Mobilization, had preliminary talks
Sunday in London when they took part in Acholi Tribe International
Conference at which Obita announced the willing of Joseph Kony, LRA's
leader, on peace talks the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The content of the understanding is to be published. But Aliker
said that President Yoweri Museveni had given him powers to talk
peace with LRA.
</P>
<P>
Acholi is a tribe in northern districts of Kitgum and Gulu where
LRA launched a ten-year war against the Ugandan government. Many of more
than 200 representatives of the conference urged both sides to end
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
But in Kampala, Rebecca Kadaga, the State Minister for
Regional Cooperation, said the government will not negotiate with
LRA unless parliament reconsiders its last month's resolutions
rejecting direct peace talks between the government and the
rebels. Kadaga was reacting to Obita's proposal on peace raised
last Saturday on the London conference.
</P>
<P>
But local media reported today that Obita assured delegates of
the London conference that LRA will suspends its abductions of children
as recruits to fill its ranks.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates at the London conference urged LRA to stop abducting
civilians and other atrocities. enditem

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Product Market to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's manufactured goods market
will remain stable in 1997 with prices increasing at a similar
level as in 1996, according to the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that it drew the conclusion after analysis of
the industrial product market in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It noted that 1996's industrial development provided a
favorable environment for the 1997's industrial product market.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the price index increased by 2.9 percent for
industrial products, 11.9 percentage points lower than in
1995. The figure was the lowest since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The market for the means of production maintained a balance in
1996, with price increasing by 3.5 percent over the previous year,
the lowest since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with abundant supply of consumer goods, the price
for consumer products increased by only 2.1 percent, for the first
time since 1994 lower than that for the means of production.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the stable market in 1996 to an
appropriate economic growth rate, twice dropping loan interest
rats by the central bank, and the abundant supply of industrial
products.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Witnesses Rapid Growth of High-Tech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- To maintain the rapid momentum of
its high-tech industry, China expects to shape seven high-tech
industrial development belts by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The seven belts will be formed around Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou in
east China's Jiangsu Province, Pearl River delta areas, Shandong
Peninsula, Liaodong Peninsula, areas along Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu
expressway, Southeastern Fujian Province, and Shaanxi-Shanxi
provinces, an official with the State Science and Technology
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
He said the new development belts are expected to "turbocharge"
a great leap forward of Chinese economy in early next century.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ruiming, director of Torch Program of the State Science and
Technology Commission, said China's high-tech zones will promote
their cooperation with foreign countries in personnel training and
further strengthen technological cooperation with the US and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that 15,000 new and high-tech enterprises
have been set up at China's 110 high-tech industrial development
zones, which employed 1.2 million people by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Those businesses have realized 24 billion yuan (three billion
US dollars) of pre-tax profits and their export value reached 3.8
billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believed that high and new technology of the 1990s
and the 21st century will be the major force for advancing the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
China began implementing in late 1988 its "torch program" aimed
at commercialization, industrialization, and internationalization
of high and new technological research findings.
</P>
<P>
The projects in high and new technology zones cover new
materials, biological technology, electronics and information,
integration of machinery and electronics, new energy, and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Eight-year implementation of the "torch program" proved that
high-tech industry plays an ever more important role in China's
economy, science, technology, and social development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that China launched more than 6,400 "torch
program" projects from 1991 to 1995 and realized 37.3 billion yuan
(4.6 billion dollars) of pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
In China's leading industrial city, Shanghai, the number of
high-tech ventures rose by 20 percent annually from 1994 to
1996. The total output value of the high-tech ventures had an
increase of 18 billion yuan (2.25 billion dollars) from 1994 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech ventures also help technical retooling of
outdated state-own enterprises and bring along regional economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Internationalization is one of the unique features of the
"torch program." So far, the Sino-foreign jointly-run China Torch
Foundation and China Foundation for Science and Technological
Development have absorbed some 200 million US dollars of foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese high-tech zones have forged extensive,
cooperative ties and contacts with more than 20 countries and
regions. And these zones also introduce personnel, technology and
administration experience and information from other countries.

criticizing Turkey's natural gas deal with Iran, saying it was a

<P>
He pointed out that the U.S. had a double standard since it had
never reacted against the European countries which import oil from
Iran.
</P>
<P>
"If you compare natural gas with oil, you'll see that both of
them are hydrocarbons. The U.S. is reacting to the gas form of
hydrocarbons. It is impossible for the U.S. to justify its
attitude," Kutan added.
</P>
<P>
Since the Islamist Welfare Party led by Necmettin Erbakan came
to power last summer, energy-starved Turkey has enhanced its
economic cooperation with neighboring Iran, especially in the
energy field.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns criticized
Ankara in Washington last Friday for importing natural gas from
Iran.
</P>
<P>

European Commission's energy agency, was called to discuss the
energy problems in the Black Sea region.

<HEADLINE> China to Spend 260 Billion Yuan in Major Chemical Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 260 billion yuan
in building 470 large and medium-sized chemical projects over the
next few years to meet the country's demand for chemical
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national meeting on chemical industrial
construction that opened here today, Gu Xiulian, minister of the
Chemical Industry, said that some 400 of the 470 projects will be
launched during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000). In
1996 alone, construction of 30 of the projects was approved by
the central government.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on departments to step up feasibility
studies of the projects to ensure their quality. She emphasized
the necessity of greater use of sophisticated
domestically-developed or -made technologies and equipment to
improve investment efficiency of different projects.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, China will finish seven
major key task programs including complete sets of equipment for
making chemical fertilizers, with natural gas and coal as raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, China added new capacities to produce 6.64
million tons of synthetic ammonia, a rise of 26.2 percent over
that for the 1986-1990 period; 7.14 million tons of chemical
fertilizers, up 30.8 percent; 7.9 million tons of sulfur and
phosphorus, up 35 percent, according to Gu.
</P>

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian youth was shot
dead by an Israeli settler in the West Bank city of Hebron this
morning, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press
service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The settler opened fire randomly at Palestinians near the
Al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the city center, killing Issam Rashad
Kamel Arafeh, aged 17, and wounding four others.
</P>
<P>
This was the second incident in two days, involving Jewish
settler shooting Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a settler of Dolev, north of Ramallah, shot and
wounded two Palestinians in the village of Harbata allegedly
after his car was hit by stones.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police arrested the man, whose name has not been
released, and confiscated his car and his M-16 automatic rifle.
</P>
<P>
The two incidents took place at a time when the
Israeli-Palestinian relations fell into an unprecedented deep
crisis since the Oslo Accords in 1993 as a result of the
right-wing Israeli government's aggressive policy of settlement
in the occupied Palestinian territories.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of China's Central
Military Commission (CMC) Liu Huaqing met here today with Charles
Millon, the first French Defense Minister to visit China since the
two countries set up diplomatic relations in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Millon said that he hoped this visit will help step up
strategic dialogue and information exchanges between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
This kind of strategic dialogue should be carried out on a
regular basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Millon's visit is of great significance for
further development of the friendly cooperative relations between
the armed forces of the two countries. The two armed forces have
had sound relations in the past years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since both countries play an important role in international
affairs, the development of a new friendly cooperative Sino-French
relationship that faces the 21st century will not only be in the
interests of the two peoples, but beneficial for the peace and
stability of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu, also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, refuted the
theory of "China threat" that is disseminated by a handful of
people in the world, saying that China builds defense capability
for the sole purpose of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Millon said that his visit to China will help maintain the
exchange of high-level visits by military leaders of the two
countries and strengthen the friendly cooperative relations
between the two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that France trusts China-- a nation that loves
peace. He said that France wishes to join efforts with China to
maintain peace and stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of the general staff of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA), and Cao Gangchuan, minister in

<HEADLINE> North China Ethnic Region Burgeoning into Granary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, April 8 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, long plagued by grain shortage, has not only
become self-sufficient but begun to export its grains to other
places.
</P>
<P>
The region produced a record grain output of 15.35 billion kg
last year, up 45.5 percent over the previous year, more than its
planned target of 14.5 billion kg by the end of the century, said
officials with the provincial Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
Its per-capita grain output was 667 kg, ranking first among the
provinces and regions. This enables the region to feed its 23
million population and have four billion kilograms for export
annually.
</P>
<P>
The region, inhabited by 50 ethnic groups, has more than 5.5
million ha of farmland. The per-capita share of land is three
times the national average. But the region used to live on resold
grains from elsewhere, shipping in 900 million kilograms annually.
</P>
<P>
The situation didn't change until 1992, when the region yielded
more than 10 billion kg of grain, ensuring adequate food for its
residents.
</P>
<P>
Agro-science is attributed to grain increases. New technologies
like plastic sheeting, seed coating, and desert rice have greatly
promoted agricultural productivity. Science and technology are
said to contribute 34 percent to agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1990, the region aroused 10,000 scientists and
technicians annually to help peasants farming, setting up
agro-science pilot projects in 100 townships, spreading
standardized farming techniques to 1.3 million ha, and training
two million farmers.
</P>
<P>
While its 40 agriculture-related colleges and institutes and
more than 40,000 agronomists are doing their best to ensure
successful harvests, the autonomous regional government spares no
effort to invest in agricultural production, and sets aside 10
percent of the increased revenue for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the region put 1.03 billion yuan into agricultural
development last year, a rise of 14.4 percent, and will invest
another four billion yuan by the year 2000 to improve medium- and
low-yield farmland, open up arable wasteland, and institute
agriculture support systems.

<HEADLINE> New Wildlife Species Discovered in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Scientific researchers have
discovered new wildlife species in the 11,000-hectare triple
canopied rain forests in the Philippines' Subic Bay, an official
from the bay authority said today.
</P>
<P>
An on-going research showed that the well-preserved forests in
Subic Bay have yielded a bat about the size of a small finger and
two individual rodents belonging to two genera, said Richard
Gordon, chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority.
</P>
<P>
These findings are the result of the eight-month old
Biodiversity Project being sponsored by the Department of Science
and Technology and the Philippine Council for Agriculture,
Forestry, Natural Resources Research and Development.
</P>
<P>
The bats, which belong to the Tylonyoteris Pachypus or Lesser
Flat-headed Bats, are about 60 to 62 millimeter long. They were
found in a relatively dense vegetation consisting of the
predominant bamboo species identified as Schizostachyum Lumapao.
</P>
<P>
The rodents were recently found by another scientific team. One
of the two rodents, belonging to Chrotomys, was described as a new
record of wildlife while the other one was said to belong to the
Phloemys Pallidus, may even belong to a new species.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Perry Ong, leader of the project, said both of the rodents
are being kept at the Institute of Biology of the University of
the Philippines for further verification and study.
</P>
<P>
He added that they are preparing a full research report to be
presented to the workshop of the Wildlife Conservation Society of
the Philippines on April 22-25.

NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has told diplomats and other foreigners in the country to keep
off Kenya's internal affairs, the Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president asked foreign friends of the country to desist
from telling Kenyans how to run their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at public rallies on Monday in Bomet District in
western Kenya, Moi said many countries in Africa had faced
numerous problems because of succumbing to external influences.
</P>
<P>
President Moi referred to some envoys' participation in the
National Convention on Constitutional Reform held by opposition
parties last week in Limuru near Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"The convention claims that even diplomats were there to speak
on behalf of Wananchi (people). Among the diplomats were
Americans and Britons... who have the right to decide the fate of
others?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Moi stressed that it was wrong for the envoys to interfere
with the affairs of Kenyans by attending such conventions, adding
that "we have a right to live our own lives, the problems in
Rwanda and Zaire was started by outsiders like these ones."

<HEADLINE> Yangpu Special Economic Zone Forging ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Yangpu Development Zone, in
northwest Hainan Province, has become China's largest
export-oriented bonded zone with an area of 30 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The zone and Shanghai's Pudong New Area are the two remaining
"special zones" in China in which foreign investors can still
enjoy preferential treatment in fields as import and export,
taxation, foreign exchange, and custom services.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang Shangzhou, director of the Yangpu
Development Administration, conditions are ready for large-scale
construction.
</P>
<P>
To woo more overseas businessmen, Yangpu has invested heavily
in infrastructure. The developers have poured four billion HK
dollars into building a 315,000-kw power plant, a 43-km-long road
net, and a telecom network with 2,200 telephones lines, 150 mobile
phones, and paging services.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan provincial government has invested 2.2 billion yuan
in paving an expressway linking the zone with Haikou, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
The state-funded Yangpu Harbor now has two berths for ships of
20,000 DWT and another berth for ships of 3,000 DWT. The three
berths have a combined handling capacity of one million tons of
freight a year.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase construction of the harbor will be due
soon. Upon completion, the harbor will add three new berths for
vessels of 20,000 DWT and increase its handling capacity to 2.5
million tons of freight a year.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang, some 30-odd major projects with a total
investment of 100 billion yuan are underway or at the "final stage
of negotiations," ushering in a new wave of investment.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission (SPC) has approved the
construction of China's largest chemical fertilizer plant in
Yangpu. The project, at the cost of 15.58 billion yuan, is set to
produce 900,000 tons of synthetic ammonia and 1.6 million tons of
carbamide annually upon completion.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a 1.3-billion-US-dollar pulp plant, also set in
the zone and funded by a foreign investor, is expected to be
approved by the SPC.
</P>
<P>
Executives from such multinational corporations, such as
Japan's Misushita, German's Siemens and BMW, and Daewoo from the
Republic of Korea, in recent years visited the zone and showed
interest in the area.
</P>
<P>
Jiang vowed to better the investment environment this year
by promulgating more regulations and efficient administration
to attract more overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> Sci-Fi on Human Clone Wins Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- "Empire of Clones," a
science-fiction story was awarded the "Galaxy Prize" by "Science
Fiction World" magazine this month.
</P>
<P>
Published last April, the short story by Pan Haitian forecast a
disaster brought about by unrestricted clone technology in the
22nd century.
</P>
<P>
In the story, Earth is controlled by an empire whose citizens
are human clones. A cruel emperor produces millions of people
every year, using them as slaves and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Human nature is distorted, life absurd, and without rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The story's protagonist is not a clone, but one whose love is
destroyed by the cloning process.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that the technology described in the story is
similar to that which produced "Dolly" in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Dolly", a sheep, was the first animal cloned with a cell
obtained from a mature animal's body.
</P>
<P>
The issue has aroused ethical debates throughout the world
since February this year. Many countries have vowed to ban the
cloning of human beings.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists suggested that measures be adopted to
prevent biological technology from becoming a weapon that might
destroy man.
</P>
<P>
Chen Minzhang, Minister of Public Health, said that China will
strictly ban human cloning to avoid dangerous technological,
social, and ethical consequences.
</P>
<P>
Pan is a student studying in the prestigious Qinghua
University, China's top college for sciences and engineering. He
is regarded as one of the most talented Sci-Fi writers of the new
generation.
</P>
<P>
"Science Fiction World" magazine, which gave the award, was
named as the "Best Sci-Fi Magazine" by the World Sci-Fi
Organization in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The magazine bestows prizes every April to ten authors who
created the best works in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Together with "The Empire of Clones", nine other short stories
have won the prizes. They touched issues like cyberspace, time
travel, and the exploration of the Mars.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China will need a total of two
billion integrated circuits this year -- about 1.2 billion for
household appliances and 800 million for telecommunications

focus its electronics industry on the telecommunications and
computers sector during the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000)
period, explained a local official.
</P>
<P>
"China will give its top priority to the production of
integrated circuits, electronical components, computers, and
complete sets of electronic equipments," said the official.
</P>

The prospect is so attractive that international
micro-electronic producers are trying to get a foothold in the
market. some 500 company representatives from 22 countries and
regions, including the United States, Japan, Germany and
Switzerland, are coming to a Shanghai international exhibition on
electronic equipment and micro-electronics, scheduled to open on

<HEADLINE> Chinese Environmentalist Stops at Nothing in his Efforts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The single most exciting thing for
Qu Geping, who has devoted 25 years of his life to environmental
protection in China, was when China closed 60,000 small factories
because of serious pollution problems, last year.
</P>
<P>
"In the history of mankind, no other country could do something
like that," he said, "The huge economic loss and social burden
caused by the move shows the tremendous determination of the
Chinese government to protect the environment."
</P>
<P>
Qu, who is a professor and chairman of the Environment and
Resource Protection Committee of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, told Xinhua that, during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan, a total of 450 billion yuan (56 billion US dollars)
is expected to be spent on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"The ratio of the GDP spent on environmental protection in
China will remain the highest among developing countries, and in
some provinces like Shandong, the proportion is expected to reach
or even exceed that of developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qu, 67, is regarded as a pioneer in China's environmental
protection endeavor, which started 25 years ago. He is still
hard at work in his office near the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing.

Qu became the first Chinese representative to the UN
Environment Programme (UNEP), the first Chinese director of the
Environment Protection Bureau, the first Chinese winner of a top
UN environment protection prize, the first Chinese minister to work
with the UNEP on a book, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
He still remembers the situation 25 years ago, when the Chinese
government sent a delegation, himself included, to the UN
conference on environment in Stockholm in 1972.
</P>
<P>
"The UN conference on the environment actually opened a window
for China to see its environmental problems," he noted, "When
Premier Zhou Enlai heard our reports on the theme of the
conference, he said that immediate action should be taken to
control the already serious environmental problems."
</P>
<P>
"So, the year 1972 marked the starting point and a very
important milestone for China's environmental protection work," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It was also the year that Qu started his career as both an
environmental protection official and an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
He said that, after 1973, four national meetings on
environmental protection were held by the State Council, China's
highest administrative body, to attach greater importance to the
issue and increase awareness of environmental protection among the
public.

<P>
As a leading official in charge of environment protection in a
country with 1.2 billion people and a rapidly growing economy, Qu
has long been one of the busiest officials in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that China should adopt the approach of "controlling
pollution while developing the economy" and not the western method
of "first causing pollution and then controlling it."
</P>
<P>
He has participated in formulating an environmental protection
policy with Chinese characteristics, putting forth the principle
that "whoever causes pollution must be held responsible for
controlling pollution." This has made him one of the first backers
of a market mechanism in China.
</P>
<P>
As a scholar, Qu is also the author of many books and articles,
some of them published abroad.
</P>
<P>
In his "Environmental Management in China," published by the
UNEP, he outlined his ideas about the environmental assessment
system, the environmental responsibility system, the fee
collection system for pollutants, and the quantitative management
system for urban environment cleaning.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNEP official, Qu "has developed the theory of
environment management," and "China has set a good example for all
developing countries to follow in protecting their environment."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current environmental protection situation in
China, he said that, for historical and financial reasons, China
still faces tough environmental challenges, and painstaking
efforts should be made to halt the worsening trend in
environmental problems by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But he also showed confidence in China ability to meet its
environmental protection goal: "With the attention of leaders at
all levels and the participation of all residents, China will
certainly be able to create a good living and ecological
environment by the year 2010."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A million-dollar plate of glass
made in the United States has been transported to Beijing Zoo,
to be installed in the Beijing Aquarium as the second largest
aquarium panel in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 10-meter-long, six-meter-high, and 23-ton-weight glass wall
is second in size only next to the one installed in an aquarium in
San Francisco, in the US. The other 16-meter-long and
5.5-meter-high window designed for the sharks pool has also
arrived.
</P>
<P>
Made of acrylic, the windows are all better than ordinary
glasses as far as their transparency and solidity are
concerned. Although the glass is 22 centimeters wide, its
transparency reaches 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The Beijing Aquarium's need for acrylic panels constitutes
almost half of the total world market demand in 1995," said Zheng
Gong, manager of the business department of the Beijing Landa
Aquarium Co. Ltd, which undertakes the Beijing Aquarium project.
</P>
<P>
The aquarium, co-sponsored by Beijing Zoo and Pexlanda
International Ltd. of Hong Kong, will occupy an area of 35,000 sq
m in Beijing Zoo, with a total investment of 56 million US
dollars. The construction of the project is underway and the
aquarium is expected to go into operation in early next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded enterprises have

<P>
HONGKONG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Video taping spectators at the
Mongkok Stadium is unnecessary and impractical, a senior Hong Kong
police officer said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Mongkok Divisional Commander, Chan Lik-kin, was responding
to an earlier suggestion put forward by Hong Kong Football
Association (HKFA) chairman Victor Hui Chun-fui.
</P>
<P>
Hui had said that filming the spectators would make it easier
for police to identify and arrest troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
"I personally don't think video tapes will do much to help.
The stadium is too big for our cameraman to cover at the
spectators. And you never know when and where a disturbance will
happen," Chan was quoted by today's English-language newspaper
South China Morning Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
A video tape will help if useful shots are obtained but the
cameraman would find it difficult to be on the spot whenever
trouble occurs, he said.
</P>
<P>
To make arrest, all police need are eyewitnesses, not video
tapes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police handling of an ugly scene for Thursday's First
Division League match between Instant-Dict and Sing Tao at Mongkok
have been criticized and allegations were made that police took no
on-the-spot actions.
</P>
<P>
Missiles were seen being thrown to the families of Sing Tao's
expatriate players who had to flee from the attack believed to be
launched by supporters of the South China team. A Sing Tao
player's two-year-old daughter was nearly hit by a plastic water
bottle during the incident. Police were accused of not having
arrested the troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
Chan said police did take actions but no arrests were made.
"Instead, our police officers asked a few of those who started the
trouble to leave the stadium," he said. Once they left the site
the situation returned to normal, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"Arrests were not always the best way to control crowds," Chan
said. But no arrests at the time did not mean that no actions had
been taken by police, he added.

HONG KONG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Basketball
Association (HKBA) has joined in the ranks to celebrate the
historic handover of Hong Kong at the midnight on June 30 this

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
dealt with 32,533 cases of fake products last year, valued at 540
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province has made initial success in the campaign against
fake and shoddy products, according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the province shut down 2,021 workshops for
producing fake goods and destroyed 248 million yuan-worth of such
goods.
</P>
<P>
The province, an economic powerhouse in China, became a key
spot for producing fake goods in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To protect consumers' interests, the provincial government
redoubled its efforts to crack down on the production and sales
of fake goods.
</P>
<P>
Leading government officials at various levels are asked to
take the job upon themselves and the people are being encouraged
to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province launched a thorough check of 21 key
markets and severely punished the illegal stands.

<HEADLINE> U.S. TV Industry to Poll Parents on Rating System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- America's TV industry is to ask
parents about the need for major changes to the three-month-old
rating system, Jack Valenti, the executive who oversaw its
creation, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The industry would be talking to the nation's roughly 1,600 TV
stations to get parental feedback on the effectiveness of the
six-tier age-based ratings, Valenti, also the president of the
Motion Picture Association of America, told the National
Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
But he wouldn't be drawn on what results would be required to
trigger major changes to the age-based ratings that went into
effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 1000 parents, selected at random, will
start next month, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Studies carried out so far say parents want more detailed
reeffectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Ranging from "TV-G" for all audiences to "TV-MA," mature
audiences only, the voluntary ratings have been criticized by
lawmakers and children's advocacy groups for not providing parents
enough information about the sexual, violence and language content
of shows.
</P>
<P>
But broadcasters and basic cable networks that depend on
advertising as their main source of revenue fear they may lose
advertising if shows are flagged for sex and violence.

<HEADLINE> Popular Movement Day Marked in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand said today that Nepal has made big strides in terms
of the institutional development of democracy following two
general elections since 1990.
</P>
<P>
But the country's progress in the economic and other sectors
has not been commensurate with the people's aspirations, Chand
noted in a public message issued on the occasion of the Popular
Movement Day today.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has witnessed lower economic growth in recent years after
a multi-party parliamentary system was introduced in 1990, mainly
due to the frequent change of government, economic analysts here
said.
</P>
<P>
The political instability in the country, resulting from the
fact that no political party holds a single majority in the
powerful lower house of parliament, has led to the interruption of
the continuous implementation of economic policies and measures,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The country last month saw the fifth government since 1990
while Prime Minister Chand happened to be the last premier under
the partyless Panchayat legislature system.
</P>
<P>
Chand, a leader of the National Democratic Party (RPP) mainly
comprising former Panchayat legislators, managed to forge a ruling
coalition with the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) in early March after the former government led
by the Nepali Congress (NC) party lost a confidence vote in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The two major forces leading the 1990 nationwide popular
movement which ushered in the multi-party parliamentary system,
the NC and the CPN-UML, have finally become arch rivals in
parliament with 88 and 90 MPs respectively in the 205-seat lower
house.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, various programs have been organized across Nepal
these days to mark the 1990 nationwide popular movement.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government decided to observe the Popular Movement
Day on every year's April 8 to commemorate the historic
announcement by King Birendra to abolish the partyless Panchayat
legislature and reinstate the parliamentary system seven years
ago.
</P>
<P>
In the southern Nepali town of Bhadrapur, over 850 political
activists, including those who had been put into prison due to
their involvement in the movement, were honored at a function held
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mass meetings and processions were also organized in other
major cities with the participation of students, local youths,
intellectuals, and political and social workers.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Development zones in north
China's Hebei Province have spurred economic growth by expanding
an export-oriented economy, according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 19 economic and technological development
zones and two national-level hi-tech development zones, covering

<HEADLINE> Singapore Investors Cut Back Equity Stake In US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Investors based in Singapore
sharply reduced their investment in equities in the United States
to a net 2.2 billion US dollars at the end of last year, down 60
percent from the record 5.58 billion US dollars as at the end of
1995.
</P>
<P>
According to a Business Times report today, the reduction came
despite a spurt of buying in the fourth quarter, when a net 1.3
billion US dollars of equities was bought against heavy net
divestment of 2.1 billion US dollars in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
In addition to equities, Singapore-based investors also bought
7.7 billion US dollars of US government treasuries in 1996, down
from 8.9 billion US dollars for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Singapore was the fourth biggest foreign buyers of US stock in
1996 while Britain topped the league with 4.1 billion US dollars.
British investors were also the biggest buyers of Treasury
securities, with a portfolio of 64.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The biggest Singapore investor is widely thought, as the report
said, to be the Government Investment Corporation (GIC). The GIC,
which normally does not reveal its investment, manages Singapore's
foreign reserves, estimated at 100 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
A sizable chunk of its portfolio investments is thought to be
in the United States, the Business Times said.
</P>
<P>
Other Singapore-based investors in the US securities, in
particular equities, include high net worth individuals from the
region, it said.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Shortage in Pakistan Sparks Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The wheat flour crisis in
Pakistan has sparked violence in several major cities despite
assurances from the government.
</P>
<P>
Violence by protesters demanding adequate flour supply was
reported Monday from various parts of North West Frontier Province
and Punjab Province as mobs attacked the flour mills and the
special outlets used for the sale of flour.
</P>
<P>
Protest rallies were also held Monday in Rawalpindi, the sister
city of Islamabad, where people bitterly criticized the government
for not making arrangements for smooth supply of the most
essential commodity.
</P>
<P>
Incidents of looting of flour bags and blocking of roads also
took place on Sunday in Lahore, the capital city of central Punjab
Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite the involvement of district administration
in the distribution network and supervision of flour mills,
black-marketing of flour continued.
</P>
<P>
The government has promised to take all possible measures to
overcome the flour shortage.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced Monday
that transportation of imported wheat from the Karachi port was on
a "war-footing" to alleviate shortages in the country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman blamed unidentified "vested interests" for
creating an "artificial" shortage of flour, which has lasted more
than a month.
</P>
<P>
A judicial inquiry into the crisis would be conducted and those
responsible would "not be spared", he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly was tangled in a prolonged discussion on
Monday on the country-wide wheat crisis after members sounded
ominous warnings to the government that the situation could get
out of control.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the situation might improve over the next
few days when the imported wheat will reach the four mills and
adequate supply of flour will start.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sues German Firms for Chemical Supply to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran today asked representatives of
24 German firms and some German government officials to appear in
an Iranian court on charges of chemical weapons supply to Iraq
during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by a spokesman of the Iranian
judicial authorities following a meeting of judicial officials in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iran had concrete evidences in proof of
Germany's supply of chemical weapons to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The evidences included pictures, films and testimony given by
German technicians who had cooperated with the Iraqi Army in
deploying the chemical weapons, he added.
</P>
<P>
The relatives of the Iranian victims and the disabled by the
chemical weapons demanded compensation and punishment of those
German chemical weapon exporters and a number of German officials
who permitted the export of chemical weapons to Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The claims by the families of the victims have been studied
and the crime and damage happened inside the Iranian territory,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Without naming the 24 German firms, the spokesman said that
those names had already been listed in the law suit, and the third
Tehran General court had been authorized to handle the case.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Iran had accused 84 German companies, including
Toysen, Zigma and Hebergerbau, of supplying chemical weapons to
Iraq during the war.
</P>
<P>
Abdollah Mazandarani, Iranian Secretary General of the
Association for Helping Victims of Iraq's Chemical Warfare, said
that some 25,000 Iranians had been killed and 65,000 others
injured by chemical bombs in the war.
</P>
<P>
Most of the chemical weapons delivered to Iraq had been
disguised as pesticides, he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Iranian charges against the German
firms and some officials might be a retaliation against a German
court, which had accused some Iranian leaders of ordering to kill
three Iranian Kurdish dissident leaders and their interpreter in
Berlin in 1992.

market share," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IA has floated a global tender to buy five Airbus aircraft

<HEADLINE> China, Czech Republic to Further Develop Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China and the Czech Republic will
further develop political and economic relations, said visiting
Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Czech newspapers Pravo (Right) and
Hospodarske Noviny (Economic News), Wu said, "China attaches great
importance to the development of its relations with the Czech
Republic."
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to maintain the long-term friendship and
mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries on the
basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries have potentially complementary economies,
and the ties will develop in a satisfactory way with the joint
efforts of the two sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the issue of China's joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Wu said that the rapid growth in China's
foreign trade as a result of its policy of reform had paved the
way for China to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said China's joining of the WTO serves the interest of both
China and the world at large, as both sides need each other.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the human rights issue, the Chinese vice premier
said that China had made great achievements in protection of human
rights and freedom.
</P>
<P>
China has always maintained that countries should conduct
dialogues and discussions on the human rights issue on the basis of
equality and mutual respect, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Wu held talks respectively with Czech
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, Chairman of the Deputies Chamber
(lower house) Milos Zeman and Vice Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Josef Zielenice.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who arrived in the Czech Republic on April 3 after visiting
Ukraine and Belarus, will also go to Finland and Sweden to
continue his five-nation Europe tour, which began on March 29.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Sacks Deputy Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
today dismissed Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pinzenik, widely
regarded as the architect of the country's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Pinzenik, who has been in charge of Ukraine's reform program
since 1994, tendered his resignation last Wednesday, accusing the
government and parliament of dragging their heels on approving
the 1997 budget and tax changes needed to underpin the spending
plans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today after Kuchma's announcement,
Pinzenik said the Ukranian authorities lacked the political will
to continue the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Pinzenik, 42, took much of the credit for the successful
introduction of the new currency hryvnia last year, and his tough
policies helped bring inflation down to 39.7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister, seen as a Western-style reformer,
has constantly complained in the past months about low foreign
investment and ineffective reforms.
</P>
<P>
And he reportedly became frustrated at delays in passing the
budget which would have paved the way for Ukaine to receive a 2.5
billion to 3 billion U.S.-dollar loan from the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Pinzenik's exit from the government is the latest in a
string of sackings and departures in the cabinet over the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma has sacked ministers of the economy, finance, energy and
agriculture as he was unhappy about the state of the economy which
has been in crisis since independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here expect Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko to submit
his plans for a cabinet reshuffle to the Ukrainian parliament on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Job Hunt A Big Lesson For College Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Large numbers of college graduates
in China are this year set to learn the toughest lesson of all --
the lesson of life, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese students winning degrees this year means
they have to face fiercer job competition in the summer compared
with last year, officials at the State Education Commission said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 900,000 college students -- 849,000 college students
and nearly 50,000 students with master or doctorate degrees, will
graduate in July, compared with about 860,000 who graduated last
year, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the demand for graduates equals supply, but to
different students things are not the same, said a commission
official yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The specialties in demand are engineering, medicine,
pharmacology and teacher-training, while the students of
literature, history, agriculture, forestry, finance and economics
and some natural sciences will find it harder to secure
satisfactory jobs.
</P>
<P>
Employers want graduates with a higher education background,
ability and the membership of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Graduate students are the most popular in the job market this
year, while the demand for two or three-year-college students have
been reduced by half, a situation worse than last year. The demand
for undergraduates is in the middle, according to commission
sources.
</P>
<P>
The source said that there is a great demand for graduate
students and students of key universities, in job assignment,
especially students from prestigious universities.
</P>
<P>
A teacher in charge of the job assignments at Beijing's Qinghua
University said that up to now, most graduates of Qinghua
University have found jobs.
</P>
<P>
Except for the students who are going on to study in graduate
schools and those who plan to go abroad at their own expenses,
only about 40 percent of graduates of Qinghua University plan to
find jobs this summer.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing Normal University, every student who wants to be a
teacher has two jobs to choose from on average, more opportunities
than the students of non-teacher-training specialities.
</P>
<P>
Because the status of teachers and income have been greatly
improved in recent years, more students of non-teachers'
universities are happy to work as teachers.
</P>
<P>
Higher degree means more job opportunities, but the college
graduates are urged to lower their job expectants and are
encouraged to find jobs in medium-sized and small cities and
inland regions where there is an urgent need for college
graduates.

HELSINKI, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo
arrived here today for a three-day visit aiming to reinforce ties
with Finland.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued on his arrival, Wu said he has
come here to enhance the friendship and cooperation between China

</P>
<P>
Wu said China and Finland cherish a traditional friendship.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Finland in 1995 and last

promoted the friendship to a new stage.
</P>

During his stay here, Wu will meet senior Finnish leaders and
businessmen and will visit factories and enterprises. Finland is
the fourth leg of Wu's 15-day European tour which has taken him to

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks in Indonesia Required to Lend to Small </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the central bank,
has made it compulsory for joint ventures and foreign banks to
participate in the development of small businesses in the country
by lending them money.
</P>
<P>
"This policy was taken in line with the provisions of the World
Trade Organization, which does not want discriminative approaches
to local and foreign banks," the bank's director for credit
Mukhlis Rasyid said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the bank said joint ventures and foreign banks in
Indonesia did not have to meet any minimum lending requirement to
small businesses, but they must allocate 50 percent of their
lending as export credit.
</P>
<P>
With the new policy, they now must allocate at least 12.5
percent of this calendar year's increase in their outstanding
rupiah and foreign exchange credit to small businesses, Mukhlis
said.
</P>
<P>
Next year, they will have to give at least 17.5 percent of
their total credit expansion to small businesses. The quota will
rise to 22.5 percent in 1999, he added.
</P>
<P>
But foreign banks will no longer have to give 50 percent of
their credit as export credit. Instead they must lend 80 percent
of their offshore borrowings as export credit.
</P>
<P>
According to the new ruling, banks that can not meet the set
lending ratio will have to pay two percent of the difference to
Bank Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, banks which exceed the mandatory small-business
lending ratio up to 30 percent will get 0.5 percent of the excess.
</P>
<P>
Banks with small business lending ratio of between 30 percent
to 40 percent will get one percent while those with over 40
percent ratio will get 1.5 percent.

<P>
AMMAN, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan today
called for a closer cooperation between Jordan and Palestine to
promote the Middle East peace process and for the benefit of the
two countries, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Coordination between Jordan and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) should materialize into concrete political and
economic steps that serve the vital interests of both peoples,
Hassan said during a meeting with senior PNA official Mohamoud
Abbas at the Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation could help Palestinian negotiators in the
peace talks and regain the legitimate and inalienable rights of
the Palestinian people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hassan also called for bilateral efforts in shaping
comprehensive security, including social and economic security, in
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Abbas said the PNA was keen on ending the tension caused by the
stalled talks with the Israeli government and resuming the peace
talks with Israel, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Palestinian and Jordanian businessman announced a
plan to raise a 100-million-U.S.-dollar fund for investment in
Arabian East Jerusalem in a bid to counter Israeli settlement
activities in the city. This was the latest act of economic
coordination between Jordan and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace has stopped since Israel started
building a new Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem last
month. The project has also triggered violence in the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, recuperating from cancer treatment at Mayo
Hospital in the United States, met Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu earlier today to discuss the latest developments in the
peace process.

MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Al Hariri today called on Russia to help revive Middle East
peace negotiations which have stalled over Israel's building of a
new Jewish housing settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Hariri told reporters after a meeting with Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov that Israel should observe the
resolutions of the U.N. Security Council and adhere to the
principle of land for peace which was agreed at Middle East Peace
Conference in Madrid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia would put forward proposals on the basis
of the Madrid principle. He stressed that if Israeli conflicts
with Lebanon, Syria and Palestine can't be resolved, peace
throughout the Middle East will be difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Hariri is in Moscow on a three-day visit to boost trade and
economic ties between the two countries. But with Russia a
co-sponsor with the United States of the peace process and seeking
to play a larger role in the talks, Hariri has called for Russian
support to restart Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
</P>

The talks stopped after Israel broke ground for a new
6,500-home Jewish settlement last month on Har Homa in disputed

<HEADLINE> Egyptians Vote in Calm Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Voting for municipal councils all
over Egypt went on quietly today, with some 5,000 heavily-guarded
polling stations operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
About 58,000 candidates were running for the 47,682 seats on
local councils in Egypt's 26 provinces, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Democratic Party headed by President Hosni
Mubarak is expected to net a lop-sided victory since the
opposition parties have failed to field candidates in many areas
in the vote for a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Official results will not be available until Tuesday, but the
ruling party reportedly won all 1,013 seats by default in the
Ismailiya province, about 120 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfy said that no major violence
occurred at polling stations and no police intervention was
observed in the voting.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 33 people were killed in two rounds of the last
parliamentary elections in November and December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Alfy estimated the turnout at 40 percent in Cairo and
Alexandria, the country's biggest and second largest
cities. Twenty million of Egypt's 62 million people are eligible
to vote.
</P>
<P>
One main opposition party, the Wafd, boycotted the vote while

<P>
MOSCOW, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Lebanon today signed a
package of intergovernmental agreements on scientific, cultural
and educational cooperation, and the setting up of an
intergovernmental commission on trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The accords were signed soon after Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri arrived in Moscow on a three-day official visit, the
first ever visit to Russia by a Lebanese premier since the two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also modified an agreement on trade and economic
cooperation signed in Beirut in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing today, Russian Prime Minister Viktor

<TEXT>
<P>
As for jobs and salaries, the Cepal said that during this
decade, most of the jobs being generated correspond to the
informal sector.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates made by the International Labor
Organization (ILO), 84 out of every 100 new jobs created between
1990 and 1995 corresponded to the informal sector, the sector to
which 56 percent of all those who have jobs belong.
</P>
<P>
It added that in 1995 the real minimum wage in 13 of the 17
Latin American and Caribbean countries that supplied information
was below the 1980 level.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, in 7 of the 11 countries that provided
information about increases in social spending, the levels reached
surpassed those at the beginning of the eighties. Public spending
on social prgrams with respect to the GDP increased an average of
1.8 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The housing deficit in the region has reached 50 million
units. This figure includes both the need to build new housing and
the need to rehabilitate their houses. The deficit is growing by
2.7 million houses per year.
</P>
<P>
Sixty of every 100 households in the region have adequate
housing, 22 require improvements and 18 need new housing or the
rebuilding of the houses it occupies.
</P>
<P>
The Cepal mentioned that "in order to advance in a more
efficient way in the compliance of the commitments made at the
Social Summit, an integrated focus of the economic and social
policies is required."

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Favourite China recorded its
second win at the four-nation Golden Jubilee Women International
field Hockey Tournament on Monday after beating Azerbaijan 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan suffered their second successive defeat in the
five-day event being held in Lahore, capital of Pakistan's Punjab
province when they were beaten by Singapore 3-1 on the second day,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
China which crushed Pakistan 10-0, established 3-0 supremacy
against Azerbaijan after wasting five penalty corner due to
erratic shooting and lack of planning.
</P>
<P>
Out of their seventeen short corners, China earned twelve in
the second half but surprisingly failed to exhibit required
technique to score in direct or indirect drills.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan custodian Nokuline did excellent job under the bar
by foiling most off these sitters with brave clearance from mid of
the circle.
</P>
<P>
Azerbiajan defence proved a house of cards when Liu Lijie, Cai
Xuemei, Li Congrong, Qu Bo anticipated skilful stick work plus
vast stamina to create scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
China settled down in the 5th minute when Gao Min found roof
nets and five minutes later Lu Feng enhanced lead in a field
attack. Gao scored her second goal after beating entire defence

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (9-10) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 1997, the Hong Kong SAR will have greater autonomous
powers than not only the country's ethnic minority autonomous
regions but also members of federal states.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, for example, no individual states enjoy
such autonomous powers as the following to be enjoyed by Hong
Kong: the formulation and implementation of independent economic,
trade and tariff policies, independence in customs affairs,
independence in finances, the right to issue its own currency, the
status of a separate customs territory, and independent entry and
exit controls, not to say independent judicial power, including
that of final adjudication, as well as the right to handle external
affairs independently.
</P>
<P>
In fact, in administrative and economic areas and in
legislative and judicial systems, no local government of any other
country in the world and no member of any federal state enjoy such
numerous and extensive autonomous powers as the Hong Kong SAR will
have.
</P>
<P>
Question: What does "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
mean? Why should patriotic Hong Kong people form the main
governing body of Hong Kong?
</P>
<P>
Answer: It means that Hong Kong will be administered
independently by the local people. For more than 100 years of
British rule, Hong Kong has been under the autocratic rule of
governors appointed by the British Crown.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, the Chinese government, in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems," will implement the policy
of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong." This shows the central
government's deep trust in the six million Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
When Deng Xiaoping met with some Hong Kong visitors in June
1984, he said: "There have to be some requirements and standards
for Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong. That is, patriots should
form the main body of administrators."
</P>
<P>
"Who are patriots? They are people who respect their own
nation, sincerely support the motherland's resumption of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and do not harm Hong Kong's prosperity
and stability."
</P>
<P>
It is a natural requirement of the "one country, two systems"
policy that patriots should form the main body of Hong Kong's
administrators. This is because it is part of China and the great
majority of Hong Kong residents are Chinese.
</P>
<P>
If administrators do not love their country and Hong Kong, how
can they do a good job? Implementation of the "one country, two
systems" policy will not be possible, nor can the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong be maintained unless Hong
Kong is administered by a local government staffed mainly by
patriots.

<HEADLINE> Cepal Advocates Economic Growth With Justic To Erradicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The organization said that the fundamental objective of the
meeting is to contribute to a reflection on how to overcome
poverty, the generation of productive jobs and social integration,
the 3 issues dealt with at the World Summit on Social Development
that was held in Copenhague, Denmark in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Cepal is analyzing regional socio-economic evolution in the
90s and is proposing a set of political options oriented to the
simultaneous achievement of economic growth and fair distribution,
with priority also given to the efficacy and efficiency in matters
of social policy.
</P>
<P>
In its study, the Cepal said that the growth rates of the gross
domestic product (GDP) in Latin America and the Caribbean "have
been moderate (3 percent per year between 1990-1996), inferior to
the historical performance of 5.5 percent per year between 1945
and 1980 and to the levels believed by the Cepal to be necessary
to tackle technological and social gaps.
</P>
<P>
The important accumulation of social gaps generated during the
economic crisis of the eighties are diminishing slowly, especially
in 3 interelated aspects: the job situation, the poverty rate and
the actual exclusion.
</P>
<P>
The Cepal emphasized that "both the macroeconomic balances as
well as the way to reach them are crucial for an accelerated and
more equitable growth.
</P>
<P>
"Together with reducing the inflation rate and strengthening
the fiscal equilibrium, it is also necessary to attain a
sustainable deficit in current accounts, a level of internal
savings in accordance with the investment process, an adequate
exchange rate level and a level of internal spending compatible
with sustainable uses of the productive capacity, he added.
</P>
<P>
The lack of advance against poverty in the region continues to
be associated to the lack of economic growth, to its weak impact
on the labor market and a virtual stagnation in the labor
productivity average, a vital aspect if international
competitiveness is to be improved and if sustainable rates of
growth are to be reached, said the Cepal. (to be continued)

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Hard-up Beijing college students
will be offered more helping hands, all bearing money, to enable
them to finish their studies, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
About 13,000 students are living on less than 14 US dollars a
month in the capital, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
A special fund will be set up this year for poor students
attending the 67 colleges and universities in Beijing, the Beijing
Education Administration (BEA) announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The BEA also announced that a scholarship foundation will be
established to provide financing to financially burdened students
who volunteer to work in remote and poverty-stricken areas after
graduation.
</P>
<P>
The administration will also formulate regulations concerning
loan management to encourage students to make efficient use of
borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
The BEA called on colleges and universities to offer students
more work-for-study activities on their campuses. About 8,000
students now participate in work-for-study programs in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Poor students often have difficulty paying for meals and
tuition, said Liu Qiang, a BEA official responsible for the
affairs of college students.
</P>
<P>
Some students can't qualify for scholarship funds because of
their poor academic records. They don't apply for loans because
they are not sure if they can pay off the loans. And they don't
participate in the work-for-study program because they are afraid
their classwork will suffer, he said.
</P>
<P>
The BEA conducted a survey of poor college and university
students in Beijing last year. The survey found that 13,000
students, more than ten percent of the capital's college student
population, were living on less than 14 US dollars a month.

<HEADLINE> Quality Counts in Drive to Promote Rural Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- An experiment to raise the
standard and quality of production in China's vast rural areas has
been hailed as a success, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
After just a year, the pilot program at factories in 52 of the
country's county areas has led to higher quality standards and a
more economic use of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The successes have helped to promote local economies. And it
has emphasized the urgent need for a system of standardizing
quality and production methods in rural industries.
</P>
<P>
"We first introduced the experiment in the counties on a
voluntary basis in April 1995, aiming to examine the experience of
coping with the problem of production being operated without any
proper definite standards. The experiment also promoted technical
progress in factories in the counties," said Yuan Huanan, an
official at the State Bureau of Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The experiment in a second group of another 50 counties,
selected last year, is nearing an end, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
County economies are becoming an important part of the national
economy, with the total output value of county industries reaching
44 percent of the country's total industrial output value in 1995,
official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid development, county economies face such
dilemmas as a weak technical basis and poor management. These
factors have led to substandard products, a waste of natural
resources and a weak competition.
</P>
<P>
Before 1995, an average one-third of the industrial products in
the 52 counties were produced without any definite technical
standards every year, according to the findings of investigations
into more than 57,000 kinds of products produced by nearly 5,000
factories.

Beijing Administrative Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
Part of the area in which relics were found was ripped up when
foundations for the villas were laid.
</P>
<P>
The illegal construction occupies 1,000 square meters of the
protected zone, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The zone runs along the 12-kilometer city wall, which was put
up during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). The zone was created in
1984 and was preserved for parkland.
</P>
<P>
The remaining northern and western sections of the old wall
were among the first ancient artifacts to be nominated as city
cultural relics in 1957.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the villas began at the end of 1996. Local
authorities halted the work in January.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (9-10) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (9-10) in
a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What is "a high degree of autonomy?" What autonomous
powers does the Hong Kong SAR enjoy?
</P>
<P>
Answer: "A high degree of autonomy" means the full enjoyment
of powers to independently administer local affairs. The
autonomous powers of the Hong Kong SAR have the following features:
</P>
<P>
First, non-interference. The central authorities will not
interfere in affairs within the autonomous power of the Hong Kong
SAR.
</P>
<P>
Second, finality of decision making. The Hong Kong SAR will
have final power over matters within its autonomous power as
prescribed in the Basic Law. No approval from the central
authorities is necessary.
</P>
<P>
And third, the right to choose executive means for the exercise
of such power. The government of the Hong Kong SAR may, within
limits as prescribed by the Basic Law, independently choose
executive means for the exercise of its autonomous powers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, the autonomous power of the Hong
Kong SAR refers mainly to executive, legislative and independent
judicial powers, including the power of final adjudication.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the executive power, the Basic Law, aside from
authorizing the Hong Kong SAR to handle its own administrative
affairs, gives the Hong Kong SAR autonomy in finance, economy,
industry, commerce, trade, transport, development and management
of land and natural resources, education, science and technology,
culture, sports, public order and entry and exit controls.
</P>
<P>
Most notably, the law stipulates that Hong Kong have
independent finances, that its revenues be not handed over to the
central government, that the central authorities levy no taxes in
the region, that Hong Kong may formulate monetary and financial
policies on its own, that the Hong Kong dollar remain to be the
legal tender in the region, and that the authority to issue Hong
Kong currency be vested in the government of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
With respect to legislative power, the Basic Law stipulates
that the Hong Kong SAR may, on its own, enact laws without
violating the Basic Law and continue to enforce previous laws that
do not contravene the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Laws enacted by the SAR should be reported to the National
People's Congress Standing Committee for the record. Only when it
considers that a law enacted by the SAR legislature is incongruent
with the Basic Law, will the NPC Standing Committee reject the law
in question; the Standing Committee will not amend it.
</P>
<P>
Rejection by the NPC Standing Committee means the law's
immediate invalidation. Such invalidation will have no
retroactive power.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR also has independent judicial power,
including that of final adjudication.

<HEADLINE> CEPAL Advocates Economic Growth With Justice To Erradicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL, its acronym in Spanish)
fought today for economic growth with justice to erradicate
poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
In absolute terms, the number of Latin Americans and Caribbeans
living in poverty, totalling 210 million, is the highest ever,
pointed out the Cepal in a report entitled "The Distribution Gap,
Latin America and the Caribbean and the Social Summit".
</P>
<P>
"Growth itself does not guarantee better distributional
effects," pointed out the Santiago-based organization which is
affiliated to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Cepal disseminated the study to facilitate the debates of
the first regional follow-up conference of the World Summit on
Social Development being held this year in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of economic growth and the reduction of inflation
is the first determining factor for reducing poverty; the second
is a persistent effort to increase social spending and, more
recently, assigning it more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that, on the average, poverty decreased
from 41 to 39 percent in Latin America during the first 5-year
period of the 90s and that this progress is insufficient to offset
the increase in the last decade (from 35 to 41 percent). (to be
continued)

<HEADLINE> Repairs on Second Ring Road to Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyclists and drivers will have
smoother rides on Beijing's bumpy second ring road from next
month, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Road repairs which began on March 18 are scheduled to be
completed by then.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 vehicles an hour use the second ring road.
</P>
<P>
This is far more than that the road was designed to accommodate
when it was constructed in the 1970's, according to a spokesperson
at the Beijing Municipal Engineering Administration.
</P>
<P>
Winter's icy temperatures and summer's abundant rains are
responsible for deep cracks in the road which has been heavily
utilized for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
A lack of funds for road repairs led to the second ring road
remaining untended for a long time, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The more than six million yuan (722,000 US dollars) repair
project is the biggest since the road was built.
</P>
<P>
To avoid interruption of normal traffic on this major artery in
the capital, the workers begin their work at nine pm and end at
four or five am the next morning.
</P>
<P>
"We ask the workers to try to avoid making noise that would
affect the residents' lives and to clear away refuse before
leaving," said Xie Shimao, director of the third construction
brigade.
</P>
<P>
Under supervision of construction brigade leaders at the site,
about 30 workers can repair an area 80-90 meters long and 60 wide
in one night.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Discover Antarctic Ecosystem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have discovered
a large ecosystem on Antarctica's snow-capped land while studying
environmental evolution since the late Pleistocence (about
2,500,000 to 10,000 years ago), a span that included the great ice
age.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) obtained,
by means of drilling, a 701.62-meter-long ice core and a
64.3-meter-long lake core.
</P>
<P>
They found that nutritive elements in the lake core were such
that it was possible to start an ecological chain.
</P>
<P>
This led them to conclude that there was a large ecosystem on
the Antarctic snowmass, following studies on the Antarctic
shoreline and in the southern ocean.
</P>
<P>
They also got a clearer picture of the distribution of krill in
the area, leading to Chinese development and use of krill.
</P>
<P>
China started its research on Antarctica in 1980. The first
Chinese Antarctic research station, Changcheng Station, was built
in 1985, followed by the Zhongshan Station, four years later.
</P>
<P>
China has sent 13 groups of researchers to Antarctica over the
past 12 years. Research on the role that Antarctica has played in
global climate changes is the focus of Chinese scientists for the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).

will drop 4 percent to 6.05 million tons this year compared with
that in 1996, said the National Federation of Meat Production.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Breakthrough in Detecting Coal Spontaneous Combustion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China has made an important
discovery in monitoring the spontaneous combustion in coal fields,
research on which has possible international use.
</P>
<P>
Spontaneous combustion in coal mines causes vast waste of coal
resources and severe damage to the environment and miners' lives.
</P>
<P>
For many years, major coal-producing countries of Russia, the
United States, Mongolia and India have put a great deal of capital
and manpower into trying to find a solution, but with little
progress in developing a complete monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid close attention to the solution
to the problem in coalfields. In 1993, together with the ITC
Research Institute of the Netherlands, the State Science and
Technology Commission and the Ministry of the Coal Industry
launched an international cooperative project for monitoring
spontaneous combustion in coalfields in north China.
</P>
<P>
The joint research project has made great headway, developing
monitoring systems in the northwest, north and northeast parts of
China, and in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It has also
developed models for measuring dangerous coal gas levels and for
policy-making for investment in key projects.
</P>
<P>
The official source said that research findings have drawn
international attention, and that India has invited China to help
it solve problems in its spontaneous combustion monitoring in
coalfields.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest commercial center
plans to survey its wildlife resources in two years, to find
better means of protection, according to a local source.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has a large proportion of the country's species of
wild animals, with 40 species of mammals, 429 species of birds, 14
species of amphibious animals, and 32 species of reptiles,
including 58 that are under special state protection.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Wild Animal Zoo alone has 5,000 animals of nearly
130 species. The zoo has succeeded in breeding 50 animals from 16
species in recent years, including 5 tigers and 14 African lions.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Shanghai surveys wild animals every ten
years, paying close attention to distribution, number, and the ecology
related to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has set up a special investigative team that has invited
many experts as advisers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says to Have Frank Talks with Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Monday that he had a "specific, frank, candid and long
talks" with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the
Middle East peace process, which, because of Israel's violation of
Israeli-Palestinians peace agreements, has gone aground.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton declined to provide details of their discussions,
only saying: "We'll do our very best" to pull the peace process
back on track.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Netanyahu at the White House, Clinton
made some remarks, obviously biased for Israel, that Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat should first denounce terrorism as a
precondition for peace negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Under any sense of human rights and human decency, we ought to
have zero tolerance for terrorism," Clinton told reporters at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes have continued for more than two weeks since
Israeli bulldozers broke ground in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, and outraged Palestinians, out on streets in strong
protests, were confronted with Israeli soldiers coming for
suppression.
</P>
<P>
Israel's violation of the peace agreements were greeted with
world-wide condemnation and U.N. Security Council had twice made
resolutions demanding Israel to relinquish its decision to build
6,500 homes for Jews in east Jerusalem, but was twice vetoed by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, once made a gesture for peace by criticizing Israel's
housing project as not helpful for building confidence between the
two sides, this time concentrated his pressure, not on Netanyahu,
but on Palestinian leader Arafat, saying "zero tolerance" was a
precondition for resuming the suspended peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I think the important thing is to create the environment in
which the steps can be taken which will make peace possible. And
one precondition of that, obviously, is the absence of terrorism,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also indicated he was not prepared to set up a
David-camp-like summit meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat under
U.S. auspices.
</P>
<P>
"It's important not to jump the gun on that," he said. "The
first thing we have to do is get the process going again. There is
a preexisting process. There are a whole lot of agreements."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, knowing the United States would stand by Israel when
he brandishes an anti-terrorism wand while deliberately
obliterating the real cause of violent clashes on the West Bank.
ceded not an inch from his government's decision to build the
Jewish neighborhood in Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Clinton on Monday, he declared that 75
percent of the land in which Jewish homes were under construction
in east Jerusalem was owned by Jews.
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with this?" he said at a Jews' gathering in
Washington. "Nothing. People get married, have kids, build homes."
</P>
<P>
Arafat had demanded the housing construction be halted before
preace talks are resumed. But Netanyahu refused, saying: "We are
not going to do this."
</P>
<P>
Following Netanyahu's talks with Clinton, a Palestinian
delegation is due in Washington later this week for talks on the
impasse in the Middle East negotiations.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that there
might be some new ideas and hard work for resumption of the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It is a moment in which the peace process needs new ideas and
hard work and the president is prepared to deliver," he told
reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in New Delhi
that it was "quite possible" the General Assembly would convene in
special session on the Middle East issue in response to an appeal
by Arafat.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Surges to 51-Month High Against Japanese Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surpassed 125
Japanese yen for the first time in more than four years Monday and
surged against the mark.
</P>
<P>
The higher U.S. interest rates and optimism over Europe's
single-currency plan played a major role in dollar's surge.
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed in New York at 125.56 yen, up from 124.31 yen
Friday, almost strongest since mid-January 1993. The dollar is up
8.31 percent against the yen this year and up 57 percent since
reaching a postwar low of just under 80 yen two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Against the mark the dollar rose to 1.7109 marks, up 1.5
percent from 1.6854 Friday and the highest level in a month. The
pound cost 1.6295 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6355 U.S. dollars. The
dollar rose sharply in most other dealings.
</P>
<P>
And rebounding U.S. stock prices also contributed to the
strength in the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
Further dollar buying was spurred by Bundesbank President Hans
Tietmeyer of Germany, who suggested that G-7 central banks aren't
terribly worried about the U.S. currency's latest hikes and
weren't likely to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Expectations that Japan's low rates won't rise soon further
attracted Japanese investors.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Friday: 1.4674
Swiss francs, up from 1.4427; 5.7530 French francs, up from 5.6740;
1,684.00 Italian lira, up from 1,667.20; 1.3867 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.3920.

<HEADLINE> European Shares up on Wall Street's Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Major European stock markets
extended last Friday's recovery and all ended sharply higher
Monday, supported by a firmer Wall Street and the strength of the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The London market, the largest in Europe, closed just off its
session high, 35.1 points up at 4,271.7, helped by a sharp rise on
Wall Street in early trading.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said that lingering worries about higher interest
rates and political uncertainties ahead of Britain's general
election tempered London's advance.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices ended with good gains, driven by
Wall Streent's recovery last Friday and higher bonds, against
expectations, with the DAX-30 index 67.95 points higher at
3,312.88.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that chemicals and banks benefited from the
dollar's strength.
</P>
<P>
Shares on the Paris bourse also closed sharply higher on the
back of the Dow's rally, a strong domestic bonds market and the
dollar's revival, with the CAC-40 index 54.34 points up at
2,572.31.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended up 35.1
points at 4,271.7. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index finished 67.95
points higher at 3,312.88. In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed 54.34
points firmer at 2,572.31.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
moved higher modestly again on Monday, propelled largely by major
technology shares.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones finally rose 29.84 points to 6,555.91.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock measures also advanced for the second session as
bond-market interest rates backed away from Friday's seven-month
high.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was relatively
light at 453.42 million shares, down from 537.27 million on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P 500 rose 4.23 to 762.13, and the NYSE composite index
rose 2.66 to 400.68. The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.62 to
1,251.35, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose
3.71 to 560.44.
</P>
<P>
But many investors still held that a correction is not over and
major stock indexes might move down again.
</P>
<P>
Stocks also gained support in the bond market, where prices
rebounded, lowering the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 7.06
percent. On Friday, the yield shot to 7.12 percent, the highest
closing level since September.
</P>
<P>
IBM, which slid sharply last week amid fears the computer giant
won't meet earnings expectations, was the Dow's strongest issue
Monday. In Nasdaq trading, meanwhile, Cisco Systems and Microsoft
also rose remarkably.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's other big gainer was Boeing which rose after The Wall
Street Journal reported that the leading aircraft maker is
preparing to increase its production pace by 10 percent.

WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The federal government Monday
declared a state of "major disaster" in the states of North Dakota
and South Dakota as a result of heavy storms and flooding over the
past weeks.

</P>
<P>
Daschle and his colleagues said Clinton agreed almost
immediately to provide the declarations, as well as to dispatch a

Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
Witt said he expected a request for a disaster declaration

<HEADLINE> First NPT Preparatory Committee Begins Two-week Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The first nuclear
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) Preparatory Committee (Prepcom)
since the Treaty's indefinite extension in 1995 began on Monday a
two-week session.
</P>
<P>
As part of the package of agreements that led to indefinite
extension, PrepComs have a new substantive role, focusing on ways
to implement the NPT and the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear
Non-Proliferation and Disarmament agreed at the 1995 NPT Review
and Extension Conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, there will be three preparatory committee
meetings respectively in 1997, 1998 and 1999 to be followed by a
Review Conference in 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, the
nuclear-weapon states also pledged to pursue in a determined
manner systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear
weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those
weapons.
</P>
<P>
But while Non-aligned countries insist on reviewing both the
procedural and substantial issues, the West favor only procedural
ones. The Non-allinged countries hope that the PrepCom can become
"mini-Review Conference", but the West refused, arguing that would
pre-empt the outcome the Review Conference.
</P>
<P>
A lot of Non-governmental organizations have also come to the
meeting and urged PrepCom to take up substantial matters and use
the opportunity to push nuclear disarmament foreword.
</P>
<P>
"The first PreCom will determine the future of the
non-proliferation regime," said Dan Plesch of the British American
Security Information Council. "It must make progress on issues of
substance."
</P>
<P>
"If the PrepCom is forced to deal primarily with procedural
issue, this will undermine the 1995 agreements," he warned.

ATHENS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- One in five Greek enterprises in
Albania have been destroyed in the recent riot, a report released
by the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) from Tirana said
today.
</P>
<P>
An inventory being carried out by the Greek Embassy's
commercial section has so far reported damages at 60 of the 250
Greek-owned businesses in the strife-ridden Albania.
</P>
<P>
The damage to each of these was reportedly valued at between
200-400 million drachmas (about 52,000 to 1,04 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The collapse of pyramid investment schemes sparked nationwide
protests in Albania which later spilled over into armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Most enterprised, including Greek-owned ones, remain closed due
to continuing fears of attacks by robbers.
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Athens by Albanian Prime Minister
Bashkim Fino, a group of Greek businessmen had presented him with
a petition calling for protection by Tirana of their investments.
they also requested compensation for the damages they suffered.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Debt Up 6.7 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The consumer credit in the U.S.
increased at annual rate of 6.7 percent in February following a
sharp gain in January, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed said that consumer debt rose to 1.21 trillion
dollars after an increase at a 10.3 percent rate in January, the
largest since last July.
</P>
<P>
The gain in January was revised up from an earlier 8.4 percent
estimate announced one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending in the U.S. represents about two-thirds of
overall activity in the country. Borrowing by consumers has grown
every month since May 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report said that much of the increased borrowing is
coming in credit card debt, which grew at a 12.7 percent annual
rate in February after surging higher at a 21.6 rate in January,
the biggest gain in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
However, automobile borrowing slowed to a rate of 0.3 percent
rate after rising at a 3.1 percent rate in January.
</P>
<P>
Other kinds of consumer debt, including loans for mobile homes,
education, boats and vacations, rose at a 5.5 percent rate in
February following an advance at a 2.9 percent rate the month
before.
</P>
<P>
The latest report fits with other evidence suggesting that the
U.S. economic growth in the first quarter continued at around the
same pace of the fourth quarter. The U.S. economy expanded at a
rate of 3.8 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe Americans' borrowing binge will begin to
slow this year.
</P>
<P>
They expect the Fed, which nudged short-term interest rates up
by a quarter of a percentage point late last month, to continue to
increase the cost of borrowing in an effort to slow economic
growth and prevent inflationary imbalances from developing.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
deploy troops in Albania, the State Department said today,
expressing concern about the continued unrest in the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is greatly concerned about the continued
unrest and political polarization in Albania," said Nicholas
Burns, the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino's convoy was attacked on
Saturday on its way to addressing a group and political tensions
are still rising in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 people have reportedly been killed and hundreds were
hurt while more than 13,000 people fled to Italy from the country
since the chaos started in Albania.
</P>
<P>
"We call on all Albanians and all groups in Albania not to
interfere in the process of reintegration and stabilization, and
to pursue their concerns through dialogue," Burns stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of all Albanians to ensure the
success of the government of national reconciliation, which was
formed with the agreement of all major Albanian political
parties," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman affirmed that the Albanian government enjoys
"broad international support."
</P>
<P>
"The United States remains committed to working with this
government -- as do, of course, all of the other countries that
are working in Albania," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
However, he declared that the U.S. will not plan to deploy any
forces in the troubled country, saying that it supports the
efforts of Turkey, Greece and Italy to try to stabilize the
situation.
</P>
<P>
An international peacekeeping force of 5,000 to 6,000 troops,
which was approved by the United Nations and formed by France,
Greece, Turkey and other European countries, will be sent to
Albania on April 14. The force is led by Italy.

<HEADLINE> Britain Unlikely to Join EMU in First Wave: Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's main opposition Labor
leader Tony Blair has indicated that a Labor government would keep
open Britain's option on joining the European Monetary Union
(EMU), but it was highly unlikely that Britain would join in the
first wave.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview on BBC television this evening, Blair
said: "The option remains open. But it is highly unlikely we'll be
in the first wave and that then reduced the probability that you
would enter in the next parliament."
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose party is tipped to win a landslide victory in the
coming general election, stressed that it was important that
Britain should remained engaged in the European Union (EU)
negotiations because it would be affected whether it stayed in or
out if EU partners moved to closer European integration.
</P>
<P>
The Labor party, which maintained a pro-European stance, has
recently hardened its position on Britain's membership in the EMU,
by effectively ruling out joining the single currency within the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
Labor's shadow foreign secretary Robin Cook was reported as
saying on Sunday: "If you didn't join (single currency) in 1999,
it's very difficult to see a government that has taken the
decision that Britain wasn't ready in 1999, coming to the decision
it would be ready by the year after or the year after that."
</P>
<P>
"In the event of that Britain doesn't join in the first wave, I
would have thought the probability is that one is looking towards
the subsequent parliament," he added.

which the steps can be taken which will make peace possible. And
one precondition of that, obviously, is the absence of terrorism,"
he said.

Clinton also indicated he was not prepared to set up a
David-camp-like summit meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat under
U.S. auspices.

first thing we have to do is get the process going again. There is
a preexisting process. There are a whole lot of agreements."

he brandishes an anti-terrorism wand while deliberately
obliterating the real cause of violent clashes on the West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
launched eight pilot projects on the information society and its
link to employment and local development, it was learned here
today.
</P>
<P>
Each project will develop local strategies and action plans and
will be based on wide regional consensus on how to integrate the
information society concept into employment and development
policies at the local level.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the initiative, Padraig Flynn, European
commissioner responsible for employment and social affairs, said,
"Strong local involvement is the key to ensuring that the impact
of ICTs (information and communication technologies) on skill
requirements and employment policy is seized upon as an
opportunity and not a risk."
</P>
<P>
The projects will run for between 18 and 24 months, each
receiving up to 250,000 ECUs (some 325,000 U.S. dollars) of
co-financing.
