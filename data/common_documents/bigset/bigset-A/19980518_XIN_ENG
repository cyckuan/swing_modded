<HEADLINE> Pakistan Weighs Nuclear Option as Speculations Arise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Speculations have already begun
to arise as Pakistan is still weighing its options very carefully
several days after India exploded its nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
In a one-sentence statement released here Sunday afternoon, a
spokesman from the Pakistani Foreign Office firmly denied reports
that his country conducted a nuclear test earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"This is a motivated rumor," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after a Western news agency Sunday reported
that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, "quoting reliable
information," said in Birmingham, England, that Pakistan had
carried out a nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
been under mounting domestic pressure to make a "matching
response" to India's testing on Monday and again Wednesday of five
nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
The Sharif government has been keeping its options open over
how to respond to India's tests while strongly condemning the
Indian action as a "provocative defiance of international opinion
and an immediate and grave threat to Pakistan's security." It has
been also urging the international community to impose severe
punitive sanctions on India.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a party workers meeting Sunday in Lahore, about 300
kilometers east of here, Sharif however made it clear that
Pakistan possesses nuclear capability and it can go nuclear
"within 12 to 24 hours."
</P>
<P>
"We have not taken any decision in haste in this regard and we
are monitoring the sharp reaction of the world toward the Indian
nuclear explosion," he said while reaffirming the solemn pledge
not to compromise national security at all for any monetary gains.
</P>
<P>
He said India, in view of its internal political instability,
conducted nuclear tests to establish supremacy and to make some
political gains in the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying the international scenario carefully and
taking into account the situation judiciously arising as a result
of Indian nuclear tests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some big powers including the United States and
Japan have been urging Pakistan to exercise restraint and not to
follow India's suit.
</P>
<P>
The United States sent a high-caliber delegation, led by Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, to Pakistan on Friday in a bid
to woo Pakistan away from a nuclear option.
</P>
<P>
Special Envoy of Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto, Seiichiro
Noboru, also arrived here on Sunday to urge Pakistan to show
restraint in response to India's tests.
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the U.S. delegation's departure from here
Saturday, Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad ruled out
the possibility of giving up the nuclear option and vowed that it
would not submit to any brow-beating.
</P>
<P>
"Why are you trying to dissuade us from an option which is of
vital national interest for us," Shamshad said while responding to
a Western journalist.
</P>
<P>
However, he said his country has assured Washington that it
would not act in haste and its final decision will be driven by
its supreme national interests and the scope of the threat posed
to its security.
</P>
<P>
"Our response will be well-considered, mature, sober and
comprehensive," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Parties Apply for Postponement of Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- In a dramatic turn in the run-up
to the Lesotho general elections, the country's three main political
parties have demanded a postponement of the election because of
alleged irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Basotholand Congress Party, opposition Basotho National
Party and the Marematlou Freedom Party, have lodged an urgent
application in the Lesotho High Court asking for the postponement,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not say when the application was filed.
</P>
<P>
The parties asked the court to put off the polls, due to be held on
May 23, to enable the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to
investigate the alleged irregularities.
</P>
<P>
According to papers filed in the high court, one of the alleged
irregularities is that about 80 percent of voters in one village were
registered as having been born on a New Year's day.
</P>
<P>
The three parties said that the IEC had not allowed political
parties sufficient time to examine the final voters' list.
</P>
<P>
The case will be argued in the high court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of Basotho converged in Maseru on Sunday to
attend the final election rallies organized by the main parties.
</P>
<P>
The commomwealth secretariat in London has sent a special team of
observers to monitor the election.

<HEADLINE> Kazibwe Still Being Uganda's Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The State House of Uganda
announced that Specioza Wandira Kazibwe remains the vice
president of Uganda, putting to rest mounting speculation that
she was dropped out in the latest cabinet reshuffle by President
Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
A brief statement from the State House said Saturday night:
"There has been some confusion arising out of the re-organization
of ministries regarding the position of the vice president. This
is to clarify that Specioza W.N. Kazibwe remains vice president
of the country."
</P>
<P>
"It was thought superfluous to state this (that Kazibwe was
still vice president) in the document," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
It said that the predient's office was prompted into making
the statement because of the confusion Friday night's
announcement created.
</P>
<P>
Friday's announcement only named Kazibwe as Minister of
Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Hope Kivengere, the Press Secretary to the President, was
quoted by Sunday's Monitor newspaper as saying that the omission
on the reshuffle list might have been a typographical oversight.
</P>
<P>
Museveni announced a surprise cabinet reshuffle list Friday
night, with the name of Kazibwe only mentioned as the
Agricultural Minister. This triggered front-page coverage of
Kazibwe's assumed fall from grace.

<HEADLINE> Museveni, Nguesso Hold Talks on African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
and President of the Republic of Congo, Sassou Nguesso, held
talks here Sunday evening on bilateral economic cooperation
and African integration.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, which were held in the State House, the two
leaders discussed ways of actualizing the real integration of
Africa and stressed the vital necessity of building
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Museveni noted that one of the bottlenecks in creating
integration in Africa is the lack of physical linkages across the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the signing of the African common market treaty in
Abuja some years ago, Africa still lacks road, rail and air
linkages without which the common market cannot become a reality.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said Uganda is opposed to diving Africa into
Francophone and Anglophone groupings, adding that Africa's
historical links with Europe should be used to make more contacts
for Africa but must not be allowed to divide the African people
permanently.
</P>
<P>
Nguesso, who arrived here Sunday, said his country's present
leadership is totally committed to promoting regional bodies that
will advance African integration.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to cooperate in economic field and as a
first step, to exchange business delegations to explore business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
They also promised to strengthen air connections between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Oil Sector's Recovery Depends on Getting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has said its oil sector can
restore the production and export capacity to the 1990 level in
just six months if getting the spare parts for the defunct
machines.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Planning and Study Department at the Oil
Ministry, Falih Hassan al-Khayat was quoted by Iraqi News Agency
as saying Sunday that Iraq can produce 2.56 million barrels of
crude oil on a daily basis, of which 2 million for export -- two
months after the arrival of basic equipments Iraq has applied for
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has not decided yet on the Iraqi
recommendations included in the report of the technical team sent
by the U.N. Secretary-General to Baghdad in mid-March to evaluate
Iraq's oil production and export capacity.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil production and export capacity has been much
undermined by the lack of spare parts of machines and basic
equipments as the result of the 1990 imposition of U.N. sanctions
for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, however, is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil every six months for buying back food and medicine
for its suffering people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, May 17 (Xinhua) - Tony Blair, British Prime
Minister and the President of the G8 Summit, highly praised
China's positive role in dealing with the Asian economic crisis
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
How to respond to the recent Asian economic crisis is one of
the main topics on the Summit's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the end of the Summit, Blair told reporters:
"We paid particular tribute in the discussion we had this morning
to the work that China has done in the aftermath of the Asian
economic crisis and to its very strong commitment to financial
stability."
</P>
<P>
Blair said that the more stable the economic and financial
system in China is, the better it is for Asia and the economies of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"What I wanted to say and draw attention to in my remarks to
you was in a sense to congratulate China on the very firm position
it has taken particularly in respect of ruling out devaluation,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, commenting on how China has contributed to the process
of bringing back stability to Asia, Blair said, "I think there is
a recognition that there is still a long way to go in that region
generally."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French President Jacques Chirac also paid to the
Chinese government for its highly-respected response to the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He stressed if the Chinese currency were devaluated after all,
the Asian financial crisis would have produced "catastrophic
consequences" to the world economy.

BAGHDAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Cabinet expressed
dissatisfaction on Sunday with the United Nations Security
Council's presidential statement on its nuclear file, the Iraqi
News Agency reported.

<P>
At a session chaired by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the
cabinet maintained that to transfer International Atomic Energy
Agency's (IAEA) activities in Iraq to permanent monitoring phase
by July as stipulated in the statement does not respond to Iraq's
minimal rights in view of the great sacrifices of its people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. statement issued three days ago urged Iraq to continue
cooperation with IAEA so that the council can close Iraq's nuclear
file by July.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi cabinet said Iraq is awaiting positive response from
the council as demanded in an open letter the country presented to
it on May 1.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Iraq demanded the U.N. Security Council to
implement Article 22 of the U.N. Resolution 687, which provides
the lifting of trade embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in
1990 after its invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions will not be
lifted until Iraq is certified that it has destroyed all the
weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons.

BAGHDAD, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq warned Ankara on Sunday
against Turkey's territory claims to the northern Iraqi city of
Mosul, cautioning that it would cost Turkey its relations with
Iraq and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that if Turkey made such a
claim, Iraq could also reclaim many territories now part of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on remarks of Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel in a symposium at War Academy in Istanbul that
Mosul is part of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Turkish president's remarks came at a
time Iraq underlined its good-willed policy towards Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish president, to the astonishment of Iraq, has made
such remarks which are inconsistent with the said principles or
with historical facts," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"With full confidence, we can say that the Iraqi territory,
called the Provincial State of Mosul during the Ottoman rule, had
enjoyed historical position well-known throughout Iraqi
civilizations," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Raising such a issue could trigger wider relevant questions
of which Turkey would turn out a loser," warned the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Global Polio Eradication to Get Huge Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Rotary International, the global
non-governmental organization, has committed 304 million U.S.
Dollars for worldwide polio eradication, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 86 million Dollars will be used for the
eradication in Africa, the report said, quoting the "Current
Facts and Figures" issued by the club.
</P>
<P>
According to the bulletin, 119 nations have benefited from
grants for polio immunization and eradication efforts while over
one billion children have received oral polio vaccine from 1985
to 1996 and are successfully protected from polio.
</P>
<P>
"Today, as many as four million children who might have been
polio victims are walking and playing normally," the fact sheet
states, adding "more than 500,000 cases of polio are prevented
each year."
</P>
<P>
It says that 154 countries reported zero cases as of 1996
while in the same year, there might have about 40,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, more than 400 million children in 82 countries
received oral polio vaccine during national immunization days,
representing 60 percent of all the world's children under the age
of five.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the club, the World Health Organization, the United
Nations Children's Fund and the Center for Disease Control in the
United States, as well as governments of individual countries,
are contributors to the eradication effort which has set its
target for the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Report: Starr Increases Office Space, Hires More Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr has hired 10 new lawyers and more than doubled his
Washington office space since January to expand his investigations
and shift the focus of his activities from Arkansas to the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
"The jurisdictions have been expanded," Starr spokeswoman
Debbie Gershman said on Sunday. "Some of these are public. Some
are not."
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman confirmed figures reported by U.S. News &AMP; World
Report which said Starr's office rented an additional 7,400 square
feet of office space in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Starr's inquiries, that began as a probe of Arkansas land deals
involving President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, have
expanded to include the president's relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, the possible misuse of FBI files and
other matters. Starr now employs 27 lawyers -- six in Little Rock,
Arkansas, and 21 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
A General Accounting Office audit released in March showed that
Starr and former Whitewater investigator Robert Fiske cost
taxpayers 35 million dollars by the end of last September.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Arab Efforts in Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf Sunday called for strengthening Arab solidarity and
enhancing joint Arab efforts to lift the U.N. embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, the Iraqi minister said the
resumption of Arab common action would be helpful not only for
Iraq but also for all the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that relations between Iraq and the rest of the Arab
Gulf nations, particularly Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates
and Bahrain, are improving.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has proposed that Saudi Arabia and Iraq each set up an
interest office in the other's capital, al-Sahhaf added.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Baghdad will continue to work with the
U.N. Security Council and the U.N. Special Commission on
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, with a view to
lifting the embargo.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the embargo is "a strategic mistake"
because it is impossible to isolate Iraq from the international
community, especially from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister went on to say that the aim of the current
Iraqi diplomatic move is to make clear that his country has met
all its obligations, thereby the embargo should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the reported Iraq-U.S. dialog, al-Sahhaf said "we
believe that dialog is the right way to solve problems," adding
that "however, we are not running after it with the United
States," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay here, al-Sahhaf met Tunisian
President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali and conveyed him a message from
his Iraqi counterpart Saddam Hussein on the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Iraqi minister to Tunisia is part of Iraq's
diplomatic move to lobby support from Arab, African, European,
Asian and Latin American countries for lifting the embargo which
was imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf left here Sunday afternoon for Kenya to continue his
Arab and African tour.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Polls Organizers Slate Opposition Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC) said Sunday it was sad that three main
opposition parties demanded a court order to postpone the
forthcoming general election.
</P>
<P>
"Their action is terrible because it's going to dampen the
spirit prevailing amongst the Basotho nation... an atmosphere
conducive for elections," South African Press Association (SAPA)
quoted IEC's Chairman Sekara Mafisa as saying.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the court action was wrong and very drastic,
Mafisa said.
</P>
<P>
The election will be held on May 23 in the tiny mountain
kingdom, the country's third democratic election since its
independence in 1966.
</P>
<P>
The Basotholand Congress Party, Basotho National Party and the
Marematlou Freedom Party have filed an urgent application on the
Lesotho High Court to have the polls postponed because they want
the IEC to investigate alleged irregularities.
</P>
<P>
One of the alleged irregularities was that about 80 percent of
voters in one village were reportedly born on a New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the parties' complaint that the IEC did not give
them sufficient time to examine the voters' list, the IEC
chairman said it was ironic because the same parties had rejected
the IEC's previously proposed poll date of August this year.
</P>
<P>
"They rejected our proposal... stressing they wanted the
elections... We had to give a short period of six days to inspect
the provisional list made public on April 14," Mafisa said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was sad that the leaders took the court action
knowing that the IEC is operating "on a tight time table".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy, which
was formed after breaking away from the Basotholand Congress
Party last year, on Sunday also criticized the opposition's court
move.
</P>
<P>
More than one hundred international observers have arrived in
the country and election materials have been sent out to various
voting stations.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants Land Rather Than Peace: Hamas Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Palestinian Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) Sheikh Ahmed Yassin accused Israel on
Sunday of seeking to usurp Palestinian land and humiliating the
Palestinian people rather than making peace.
</P>
<P>
"The sons of Palestine are the victims of the Zionist
aggression on their lands and homes," Yassin said in a meeting
with Yemeni Speaker of the House of Representatives Sheikh
Abdullah Bin Hussein Al-Ahmar, the Yemeni News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yassin arrived here on Thursday for a visit.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity to unify the Palestinian ranks and
efforts and avoiding differences.
</P>
<P>
All Muslims have the religious duty to defend the Al Aqsa
Mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, in east Jerusalem against
Israelis' attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli extremists reportedly damaged one of the seven gates
leading to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound on Thursday. The
Palestinian National Authority has condemned the aggression.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmar stressed that to help solve the Palestine question,
which has been at the core of the Arab-Israel conflicts for half a
century, is the responsibility of all the Arab and Muslim nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Muslims should never stop supporting the Palestinian
people, who are facing up to the extermination war waged by the
forces of the Zionist injustice and arrogance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni parliament speaker expressed concern for the stalled
Middle East peace process and Israel's hardline policies.

KUWAIT CITY, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi-based Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC) said Sunday that it is worried about
the recent Indian nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The OIC Secretary General Ezzidine Laraki said in a statement,
a copy of which was obtained here, that the tests "constitute a
threat to the security of southeast Asia and undermine the efforts
to establish a nuclear free zone in the region."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed OIC's "solidarity with Pakistan in face of
the dangerous threat to its national security" posed by India's
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
India conducted a total of five underground nuclear tests on
May 11 and 13, claiming Pakistan and China are its security
threats.
</P>
<P>
The tests drew harsh criticism from across the world, with some
countries like the United States, Japan and Canada announcing
sanctions.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Middle East Envoy Viktor
Posuvalyuk Sunday briefed Egyptian officials on the results of his
recent visits to a number of Mideast countries, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister
Ahmed Abu el-Gheit, and Posuvalyuk, also Russian deputy foreign
minister, the two evaluated the current situation in the Middle
East and the U.S. efforts to activate the peace process on the
Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat has paid visits to Palestinian self-rule
Gaza area, Syria and Lebanon and held talks with Palestinian,
Syrian and Lebanese officials on how to revive the Arab talks with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also examined Israel's conditional
application of U.N. Resolution 425 on withdrawal from south
Lebanon and Russia's contacts with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israel decided to endorse the resolution but
conditioned its withdrawal from south Lebanon on Beirut's security
guarantees for the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk also conveyed to el-Gheit a verbal message from
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa on preparation for a visit by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to Egypt early next year.
</P>
<P>
Russia was the co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process together

<HEADLINE> Euro-Med Partnership Affected by Stalled Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said on Sunday the latest
developments in the Mideast peace process have negatively affected
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, or Barcelona process.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona process is affected by the Mideast peace process
as many of its participants are also involved in the peace march,
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister for European Affairs Fathi
Al-Shazli said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shazli made the remarks before leaving for Brussels,
Belgium, to attend meetings due on Monday of senior officials of
the Barcelona process participants.
</P>
<P>
He described the Euro-Med partnership as a "comprehensive
strategic style."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official voiced hope that the Barcelona process
would be accelerated so that it would help promote the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Euro-Med partnership is aimed at developing security,
political, economic, cultural and social ties between the 15
European Union members and 12 countries along the southern
Mediterranean basin.
</P>
<P>
The first partnership conference was held in Barcelona, Spain,
in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
It includes eight Arab countries, namely Algeria, Egypt,
Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestinian National Authority,
Syria and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the aforesaid Arab countries will hold
a meeting in Beirut to coordinate stances before foreign ministers
of the Barcelona process states meet in Palermo, Italy, on June
3-4 to review the resolutions adopted at the Barcelona meeting.
</P>
<P>
Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority
have signed partnership agreements with EU's Mediterranean
countries.

Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Algeria are expected to be among the
countries which will conclude similar agreements with the EU in
the near future.

CAIRO, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni council of ministers has approved a project
to modernize the oil refineries in Aden and Maareb through the
participation of new investors who can manage, operate and market
the products both locally and internationally.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Qader
Ba-jammal said Saturday that the Yemeni government will hold no
more than 30 percent of the refineries' shares.
</P>
<P>
The modernization program will approximately cost 360 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran has announced to lower its "economic ties" with
Buenos Aires, after Argentina recalled all diplomats here except
the charge d'affaires, and reduced diplomatic relations "to the
minimum."
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio on Sunday quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi as saying that Iran made the decision following
the repeated "baseless accusations" that Iran were behind two
blasts in Buenos Aires in 1992 and 1994 which killed 114 people.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman failed to mention what measures will be
actually taken to effect the reduction of "economic ties."
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran has invited international bidding for the
project of building a pipeline to transfer oil from the Caspian
Sea to the Persian Gulf, local daily Iran News reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) said the 392-kilometer
pipeline, linking Neka in the northern province of Mazadaran, and
Rey near the capital Tehran, will be built through exchange
programs with Iranian oil.
</P>
<P>
The NIOC estimated the project would cost 300 to 400 million
U.S. dollars in a period of two years, hoping the construction
would begin by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March
21, 1999).
</P>
<P>
The pipeline is to have a daily transferring capacity of
380,000 barrels, and probably make Iran the quickest and cheapest
route for shipping oil from the Caspian Sea region to the outside
world, earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced the construction of this pipeline after some
Caspian littoral states decided to lay a pipeline on the Caspian
seabed between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan Republic, a move
rejected by Iran on the ground that it might pose a serious threat
to the sea's environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma
Sunday called for debt relief for developing countries,
especially for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 1998 Southern African Economic Forum in capital
Windhoek, Nujoma said the developing countries's economic
activities were constrained by heavy debt burdens, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"What I am advocating here is for the debt of the developing
countries to be written off in order to allow them to spend their
resources on industrial change, human resource development and
productive economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is where we can move away from debt serving and
development aid and concentrate on trade and economic
prosperity," he said to warm applause from the about 850
delegates from 60 countries who were attending the summit.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma expressed disappointment at the low level of foreign
investment in the region, which had been almost exclusively in
resource-based activities.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that Africa's natural resources are
exploited and exported in raw form and the prices of these
commodities have remained low," he said, adding that goods
produced were then imported at a very high prices.
</P>
<P>
He said his country is looking for a balance in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, Zambian President Chiluba appealed to
northern hemisphere countries and international organizations to
eliminate African states' debts as a recognition of the
countries' efforts in introducing economic and political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who is attending the economic summit, said countries
of the north could not "say they were helping Africa to reform
while they were holding a gun to its head."
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting was jointly organized by the World
Economic Forum and the 14-nation Southern African Development
Community (SADC) trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe, Democratic Republic of Congo President
Laurent Kabila and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano attended

NEW DELHI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- India's industrial growth rate
slipped to 4.2 percent during 1997-98 (April 1, 1997-March 31,
1998) from 7.1 percent in the previous year, according to official
data available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The robust 6.8 percent growth in the electricity sector and a
4.9 percent growth in mining during the period were offset by a
very low growth of 3.6 percent in the manufacturing sector,
considered the engine of industrial growth. The manufacturing
sector had a growth rate of 8.6 percent during 1996-97, the data
said.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of the manufacturing sector was largely
due to a negative growth in the capital goods sub-sector. As
against a 5.9 percent growth in 1996-97, this key segment of the
manufacturing industry posted a negative growth of four percent
during 1997-98, the data said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition sharing the
experience of local and French architects in building modern city
projects was opened Monday at the Hong Kong Science Museum's
Special Exhibition Hall.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which is jointly presented by the Provisional
Urban Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
the Consulate General of France in Hong Kong, will be open to the
public starting Tuesday until June 21 as one of the highlights of
Le French May Festival.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "From the Building to the City: France and Hong Kong
Experiences", the exhibition features examples of architectural
projects including Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok, the
new World Cup stadium in Paris (the Stade de France), and four
other outstanding French architectural projects built in different
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
These include the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, the
Shanghai Opera House, the Nam Seoul Station for high speed train
in South Korea, and a new town in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
On display are seven models of the projects and a large number
of photographs, plans, drawings and videos to illustrate how
aesthetically appealing and technical infrastructures in urban
city are designed.
</P>
<P>
The New Hong Kong International Airport is the highlight of the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the biggest infrastructure projects in the world
and is made up of 10 core projects comprising an airport with
world-class facilities, six railway and highway projects, two
reclamation projects and a new town.
</P>
<P>
The Stade de France is the new stadium built to hold the
spectacular 1998 Football World Cup.
</P>
<P>
This disc-shaped structure is an award winner in the
international architectural design competition Le Grand Stade de
France in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Pudong International Airport, which is scheduled
for completion in 1999, has been built following the basic
principle of flexibility to allow for future expansion needs.
</P>
<P>
The design concept of the Shanghai Opera House is the winning
proposal in an international architectural competition among 18
teams representing six countries including Canada, Japan,
Australia, United States, China and France.
</P>
<P>
The structure is under construction in the People's Square in
the center of the city of Shanghai, the biggest city in China.
</P>
<P>
The Nam Seoul station project is one of the six new stations
established along the new Seoul to Pusan line High Speed Train.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study: Uninsured Children Eligible for Medicaid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A government study finds
previous assessments greatly underestimated the number of
uninsured children who qualify for Medicaid in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The new count of 4.7 million children -- up from the nearly 3
million previously calculated -- comes as states begin to enroll
children in a new health insurance program designed to cover those
missed by Medicaid -- the federal insurance program covering
millions of poor, elderly and disabled Americans, including those
on welfare, low-income children and pregnant women, and the
elderly poor who need institutional care.
</P>
<P>
The earlier estimates did not account for children who became
eligible for the program because of states' efforts to expand
eligibility beyond the federal minimums, said a co-author of the
study, which was being released Monday.
</P>
<P>
With about 10 million uninsured children, Congress and
President Bill Clinton agreed last year to a new program for
children who are not poor enough for Medicaid but whose families
cannot afford to buy insurance on their own.
</P>
<P>
The program is attractive to states because the federal
government pays a larger percentage of the cost of insurance than
it does under Medicaid, which is also funded by a combination of
federal and state money.
</P>
<P>
The higher number of potential Medicaid children may have
financial implications for states who aggressively recruit
children into the new program. If states find children who are
Medicaid-eligible, they must enroll them into Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
Even before the higher estimates surfaced, the Clinton
administration was concerned that so many eligible children have
not enrolled in Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
The administration is also encouraging states to make it easier
for children to sign up.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Forest Fire Still Raging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A serious forest fire which broke
out in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on May 13
had still not been brought under control today.
</P>
<P>
About 4,500 people, including forest farm staff, have been
mobilized, as well as five planes and 100 vehicles, to fight the
blaze, which had destroyed 13,000 ha of forest land by this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out at a forest farm in Xing'an League
(county), in the middle part of the Greater Xing'an Range, and
rapidly spread to neighboring Hulun Buir League on May 15, to the
northwest of the range.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the cause of the fire was lightning
strikes as a result of high temperatures and strong winds during a
two-week drought in early May.
</P>
<P>
The fire is difficult to put out because the terrain makes
access to the blaze area difficult, and the thick leaf layer on
the ground enables the flames to travel swiftly, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Moderate to strong breezes with drizzle started tonight over
the affected area and are expected to continue into tomorrow,
bringing conditions favorable for controlling the fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments will try to induce artificial rain
tonight in the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held a surprise
talk here Monday to discuss the stalled Middle East peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Albright telephoned Arafat, who was in Oslo to attend a
Socialist International meeting, in the middle of the night to
invite him for the surprise talks in London.
</P>
<P>
Albright has been trying to broker an interim deal under which
Israel would hand over a further 13 percent of the occupied West
Bank in return for extra Palestinian security measures.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have already accepted the U.S. proposals but
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far refused to
give up that much land.
</P>
<P>
Before flying into London, Arafat told reporters in Oslo, "I
hope she has achieved something with Netanyahu."
</P>
<P>
Albright met Netanyahu twice last week in Washington without
achieving a breakthrough, and U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross
had a further meeting with the Israeli leader Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some progress was reported to have been made at Sunday's
meeting, aimed at breaking the deadlocked Arab-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Arafat said the Palestinian president could
hold a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair after the
talks with Albright.

<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international meeting
on gender and good governance started in Harare Monday to map out
strategies to increase the number of women in politics.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony Monday, Zimbabwe's National Affairs,
Employment Creation and Cooperatives Minister Thenjiwe Lesabe
said the participation of women in politics and decision-making
was essential to achieve transparency in governance.
</P>
<P>
She said the few who manage to reach top echelons often found
it difficult to make any impact on decisions which were being
made.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by women in development division of
the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with
the royal Netherlands embassy here.
</P>
<P>
It will provide a forum for women and men who are involved in
politics, decision-making in government and policy-making or in
empowering women in the political arena.
</P>
<P>
Netherlands Ambassador to Zimbabwe Wim Wessels told the
meeting that the Beijing conference on women held in 1995 had
increased the international commitment to the eradication of
inequalities between women and men.
</P>
<P>
''More equitable relations without exploitation, violence and the
denial of human rights should be pursued,'' Wessels said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Africa, Asia and Latin America are attending
the meeting to discuss the role of women in good governance and
democratic processes.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Non-essential staff at the
South African embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, have been evacuated
following massive rioting in the country's capital, the Foreign
Affairs Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The evacuated people are on their way home, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
There were wide-spread riots and looting in Indonesia's
capital city of Jakarta over the past few days, during which
hundreds of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said hundreds of shops and buildings were
also destroyed during the rioting.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors had postponed their investment plans in the
country as a result of the riots.
</P>
<P>
South African spokesman Linford Andrews was quoted as saying
that while Jakarta appeared to be calm, high-ranking South
African diplomats had been moved to a hotel as a security
precaution.
</P>
<P>
Andrews said the embassy would be closed for most of the week.
The situation was being monitored closely and a decision would be
taken on Friday whether to reopen the embassy.

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport Offers Expresslink Service to Central HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- An expresslink service will be
launched on Tuesday to help passengers using the Macao
International Airport get quick and easy access to/from central
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Macao International Airport Company
(CAM) on Monday said that the new service, which combines speed
ferry, bus transfer, baggage handling and check-in service, will
be launched jointly by CAM and the Far East Jetfoils, the major
operator of high speed ferry services between Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Passengers using the new service will get quicker and easier
service from central Hong Kong to the Macao airport, or vice
versa. Customs procedure will be simplified with the service.
</P>
<P>
The new measure is believed to aim at improving the
competitiveness of the Macao airport as the Hong Kong new airport
is to be inaugurated very soon, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao airport has opened air routes to more than a dozen
destinations, mainly in China's inland areas, Taiwan, some
Southeast Asian nations and parts of Europe. Its main favorable
factor in the upcoming competition is believed to be its cheaper
price, according to some analysts.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese JLG Vows to "Seek Common Ground" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Portuguese chief
representatives of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG)
have agreed to seek common ground while reserving differences in
the final stage of Macao's transition.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side, and his
Portuguese counterpart, Antonio Carlos, agreed at a meeting here
on Monday that the best and most effective way to handle the work
of the JLG in the remaining days before the handover is to "seek
common ground while reserving differences."
</P>
<P>
Han told reporters after a four-hour closed-door meeting that
the two sides exchanged ideas on four major topics of concern
during the meeting. They include:
</P>
<P>
-- the participation of the Chinese side in the preparation of
the budget for 1999 and for the year 2000 in Macao;
</P>
<P>
-- the pension system of retired civil servants in Macao;
</P>
<P>
-- the conditions for the transition to the future Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of foreign advisors and
technicians currently hired by the Macao Government;
</P>
<P>
-- the formulation of detailed regulations on the
implementation of both official languages -- Chinese and
Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the importance and complexity of the issues, we have
different views on them. But we have exchanged ideas in a
practical way and that helped us know each other's stand better,"
Han said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China is sincere and determined to carry out
the policy of "one country, two systems" and "Macao people
administering Macao under a high degree of autonomy."
</P>
<P>
Carlos said he agreed with Han, adding that "we will work in
accordance with the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the
instructions of our (Portuguese) political leaders."
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to hold further talks on those issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
have said that they back an orderly and peaceful implementation of
reforms in the country, official Antara News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
ABRI are keen to carrying out reforms, Lt. Gen. S. Bambang
Yudhoyono, chief for sociopolitical affairs, said here late
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"As what the defense minister and ABRI commander (Gen. Wiranto)
has said, ABRI are seriously preparing a comprehensive concept on
political, economic and legal reforms," Yudhoyono said.
</P>
<P>
However, he reminded that the needed reforms should be "from
the people, by the people and for the people" and that they
require not only "structural but also cultural steps."
</P>
<P>
The reforms, he said, as student activists across the country
have been demanding in the past three months, should also have a
clear agenda.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that unity should be maintained because it will
serve as a vehicle that will haul the country out of its economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
ABRI welcome constructive ideas on the necessary reforms, he
added.

<HEADLINE> China to Educate and Rectify Procuratorial Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Strengthening education and
rectification work of the procuratorial force is a precondition
for the procuratorial organs to do a better job, chief procurators
from all parts of the country announced at a meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, which closed today, was held to encourage
procuratorial organs at all levels to strengthen education and
rectification work of the procuratorial personnel across the
country.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't make the utmost efforts to strengthen the work, it
will not only hamper the healthy development of our work but also
make it difficult for us to consolidate the progress we have
already achieved," said Liang Guoqing, deputy chief procurator of
the Supreme People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
More attention should be paid to the quality of work, he
emphasized, adding that no quotas should be imposed on the number
of cases handled, and handling cases just to make profits is
strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The supervision system should be strengthened to make the
procuratorial force strictly abide by the law, and there is no
pretext upon which it may break regulations or laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the meeting should be carried out among
procuratorial organs at all levels, especially grassroots levels,
asked Liang.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Cooperate With China on Hydro Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Water Resources Shailaja Acharya said here Monday
that her country supports China's initiative for setting up a
joint-venture corporation to tap Nepal's huge water resources.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with a Chinese business delegation, Miss Acharya
said that electric power is needed for Nepal's economic
development. Now Nepal prefers small-and-medium-sized hydro-power
stations to large ones, because the former produce an instant
effect while the latter are more costly and cause disputes among
the political parties.
</P>
<P>
She said that her country will extend its full cooperation to
the Chinese side in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Yan Keqiang, vice chairman of All China Federation of Industry
and Commerce and vice minister for water conservancy of China,
said that non-governmental cooperation between China and Nepal has
been strengthened after the Nepal-China Non-governmental
Cooperation Forum was established in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said his delegation comprises private entrepreneurs and
experts on hydro power, and he hopes that his visit is fruitful in
the two aspects.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of Nepal's water resources is good
for the country's economic development, so there is a great
potential for Sino-Nepalese cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member Chinese delegation arrived in Kathmandu on Monday
for a six-day visit, which aims to explore the possibility of
joint-venture projects in Nepal especially in the field of hydro
power, and further strengthen trade and economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Yan Keqiang also called on Nepali Finance Minister
Ram Saran Mahat and Minister for Industry and Labor Dhundi Raj
Shastri. They both expressed their support for a joint-venture
corporation in Nepal for the construction of
small-and-medium-sized hydro-power stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese entrepreneurs discussed with their
Nepalese counterparts the possibility of setting up joint-ventures
in Nepal.

<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Monday that the European Union (EU) had reached an
agreement with the United States to waive U.S. sanctions on EU,
Russian and Malaysian firms.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after a EU-U.S. summit meeting in Downing
Street, Blair said: "What we have established today is at least a
basis for a lasting solution to these problems."
</P>
<P>
Three companies, one from each country, are involved in a
disputed 2 billion U.S. dollar gas deal with Iran. The companies
are Total of France, Russia's Gazprom, and Petronas of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Blair hailed the deal as "a real step forward" though there is
still more work to do.
</P>
<P>
"We have avoided a showdown over sanctions, with which we don't
agree, and we have done it in a way that at least provides the
chance of a solution to the problem in the future."
</P>
<P>
Blair said the deal would cement EU-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the leaders also launched a new bilateral trade
initiative called the "Transatlantic Economic Partnership." They
have also agreed to work to promote multilateral trade
liberalization and dismantle trade barriers on both sides of the
Atlantic Ocean.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey announced on Monday that
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is scheduled to arrive here
on Tuesday for discussions on Turkish-European ties.
</P>
<P>
Cook's upcoming one-day trip is believed to be part of European
Union's (EU) efforts to mend the fences with Turkey. Britain is
currently holding the rotating presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Cook will hold talks with Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem,
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan told a weekly news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on ways of promoting the Turkey-European
Union relations, Utkan said, adding that the British foreign
secretary will also set forth EU's strategy for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The ties between Turkey and the EU have been tense since Ankara
was excluded from EU's enlargement process last December for
various reasons, particularly the strained ties with
Greece. Ankara has halted political dialog with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have noted that Cook, whose visit to Ankara has been
postponed for several times, is expected to persuade Turkey to
attend the routine Turkish-EU Council meeting due on May 25.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Government Continues Efforts to Tackle Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Wong, secretary for
education and manpower of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, reaffirmed here Monday the government's determination to
do all within its power to help the unemployed to re-enter the
labor market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing on Monday, Wong said that he was
acutely aware of the difficulties faced by the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest labor force statistics released Monday
by the Census and Statistics Department, the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate for the period January-March 1998 was 3.5
percent, and the underemployment rate was 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the period February-April 1998, the provisional seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate was 3.9 percent, while the provisional
underemployment rate was 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Our prime tasks remain to help the unemployed find jobs, and
to provide them with training and retraining in the requisite
skills to stay competitive in the work force, so that they can
secure and hold down a job," Wong said. "We have been making
substantial progress on a series of measures," he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rise in unemployment rate, the Labor Department
managed to find jobs for an increasing number of job-seekers over
the past few months, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The number of placements in April was 2,540, up 34 percent than
 that in March, and there are some 15,000 live vacancies on the
register of the Labor Department, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
On May 13, the Education and Manpower Bureau organized a
seminar to publicize to some 400 employers the latest services
provided by the Labor Department, the special tailor-made
retraining program of the Employees Retraining Board (ERB) and the
 various training programs of the Vocational Training Council.
</P>
<P>
"The seminar was well received," Wong said. "We will continue
to reach out to employers and with these pro-active efforts and
the fully computerized Local Employment Service of the Labor
Department, we should be able to place more unemployed in jobs,"
Wong said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Securities Market Scores Notable Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The fledgling securities market in
China has scored rapid expansion, with 775 companies listed on the
domestic stock market and another 43 overseas at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
The expanding market had claimed a capitalization of more than
two trillion yuan by the end of April, up 18.7 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the nation's securities investors had exceeded 33
million by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
The number of securities intermediaries had risen to 327 at the
end of April, and more than 2,440 securities operations branches
have been set up across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts say the emerging securities market and
increasing number of securities investors has enabled the
securities market to play an increasingly important role in
China's overall economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the first four months this year stock
placement helped Chinese enterprises raise 30 percent more funds
than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
China's securities market has entered a development period of
standardization and become an indispensable part of the country's
market economy system, Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has helped raise more than 250 billion yuan
through stock placement, which has not only pulled cash-strapped
state enterprises out of financial difficulties but also
facilitated the transformation of their management mode in the
direction of becoming more market-sensitive.

<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that China has been closely following the development
of the Middle East situation and wishes to advance the Middle East
peace process together with the international community.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also General Secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) Central Committee, made the statement at a meeting with
a visiting delegation of Syria's Arab Baath Socialist Party led by
its Deputy General Secretary Abdulla al Ahmar.
</P>
<P>
China has always supported the Arabian people in their just cause,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The realization of an all-round, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East not only conforms to the interests of Syria and other
Middle East countries, but also benefits the peace and stability
of the world as a whole, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Syria has, in recent years, placed particular
importance on its external relations, positively promoted the
Middle East peace process, and is playing an increasingly
important role in the region, a fact that has received universal
attention.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China and Syria have a traditional friendship, and
the frequent exchanges of visits between leaders of the two
countries in recent years and their exchanges of views on issues
of common concern have furthered mutual understanding and bolstered
the constant development of the friendly cooperative relations in
various sectors of the two countries.
</P>

JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- South African national soccer
team on Monday received high-powered support ahead of their
departure for the World Cup finals in France when they met
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
After the players were treated to tea and pastry, Mandela told
them: "On behalf of the entire country, I say to you: God speed."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was proud of the players and described them as
good ambassadors for the country.
</P>
<P>
He shook hands with all the team members, saying their
participation in the World Cup was not only about winning, but
about performance.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the slightest doubt you will return with honors,"
the 79-year-old president said.

<HEADLINE> Debt Relief Debated in Southern African Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The issue of whether
impoverished African states' debts should be forgiven is the
subject of a heated debate at the ongoing southern African
economic summit in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano Sunday called
on the west to cancel debts in those countries which had
undertaken political and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
However, economists attending the conference said Monday that
governments would have to give something in exchange for debt
forgiveness, such as commitment to structured recovery plans,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Nico Czypionka, group economist for Standard Bank, a major
bank operating in a number of southern African countries, said it
did not look good when African leaders called for debt relief and
arrived at the conference in Falcon 5000 jets.
</P>
<P>
He warned about the dangers of creating a populist
ground-swell against debt repayment, saying the financial markets
would punish those countries seen as unlikely to pay back loans.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist for another leading bank, Rand Merchant Bank,
echoed his view, saying conditionalities should be attached to
debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit, aimed at promoting economic cooperation
in southern Africa and building bridges between the region and
the rest of the world, was opened Sunday in Windhoek. It drew
senior government officials and business leaders from 60
countries.

<HEADLINE> Thai Parliament Leader Praises Chinese Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Wan Muhamad Noor Matha, speaker of
the National Assembly of Thailand, heading a 23-member
parliamentary delegation, paid a two-day visit from May 16 to 17
to the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China which has
some 1.7 million people of the Hui (Moslem) nationality, or one
third of the region's population.
</P>
<P>
In Daxin, a suburban town of the regional capital Yinchuan, Wan
walked into one of the farm houses built in distinct Islamic
architectural style, and was invited to taste Hui snacks and had a
good chat with the house owner, Yang Yongshan.
</P>
<P>
Yang's family earns over 30,000 yuan (about 3,750 US dollars) a
year by growing grain and vegetables, and Yang has sent his
daughter to study at a university.
</P>
<P>
It's just amazing, said Wan, also the speaker of the Thai House
of Representatives. Though Ningxia is classified as one of the
less-developed regions in China, people here are living far better
lives than we thought, he said.
</P>
<P>
He was especially attracted by the Xiguan Grand Mosque in
Yinchuan. The mosque has a history of over 300 years and is the
main place for Moslems in the city to carry out religious
activities.
</P>
<P>
Xie Shengling, director of the region's Islamic Association,
told the Thai parliament leader that there are over 2,700 mosques
in the autonomous region, which are managed by about 1,600
imams. So far, more than 1,700 Huis in the region have made
pilgrimages to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Wan also visited the Second Northwest Nationalities Institute
to learn about the funding of the institute of higher learning for
ethnic minorities, the employment prospects for the students and
how it helps to protect the languages of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
He said he was impressed by what the Chinese government has
done for people of ethnic minorities, its educational policies in
these regions in particular.
</P>
<P>
From what he saw in ningxia, the Chinese government's policies
toward ethnic minorities and religious beliefs have achieved great
success, he remarked.

BRUSSELS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Netherlands
decided on Monday to charter additional aircraft to operate
shuttle flights to Singapore for Dutch citizens living and working
in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
A military KDC10 was also put on standby in Singapore to

</P>
<P>
"This is not an evacuation, but offering the maximum
opportunity to leave," said Foreign Ministry Secretary-General
Dirk Jan van den Berg.
</P>
<P>
Such "departure" flights have been transporting Dutch citizens
from Indonesia, a former colony of the Netherlands, for the
past few days, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A crisis center was set up to monitor the latest developments
in the Indonesian situation, and the center is advised through
video-linked consultations with Jakarta twice a day.
</P>
<P>
Other countries have also begun to provide evacuation flights
during the past few days as riots in Indonesia increase.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) should resist protectionist pressures following
the Asian financial crisis, said WTO Director-General Renato
Ruggiero here Monday.
</P>
<P>
It would be "wrong to underestimate the effects of the Asian
financial crisis," Ruggiero told trade ministers at the opening
session of the second WTO ministerial conference.
</P>
<P>
"The repercussions on current accounts are just beginning to be
felt, which means that protectionist pressures could become much
stronger," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the ministers to send "a strong signal" to demonstrate
their resistance to the pressure, and to emphasize the point that
keeping trade open is the road to renewed growth.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the industrialized members to do more to help
the poor, and to overcome an "unacceptable level of poverty and
inequality" in the world.
</P>
<P>
WTO is holding a three-day conference here in Geneva on May
18-20.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, expected to address the conference
this evening, will make an argument similar to Ruggiero's that
open trade is vital for prosperity.

<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak left
here Monday for France on a three-day visit aimed at drumming up
European support for the Middle East peace process and expanding
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Mubarak and French President Jacques Chirac
will issue a "special statement" on the Mideast peace process,
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The statement would outline the two leaders' visualization of
the immediate steps to be taken to spare the region a whirlpool of
violence and get out of the 15-month impasse in the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents are expected to brief each other on last
week's Group-15 summit of developing nations held in Cairo and the
summit of Group-8 in Britain attended by seven most developed
western countries, including France, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say France' historical ties with many countries in the
Middle East make it an ideal advocate of Arab political and
economic interests in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Apart from international and regional affairs, Mubarak is to
exert efforts to promote bilateral trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Public Business Sector Atef Mohamed Ebeid
has said that more than 120 businessmen travelling with Mubarak
are expected to boost Egypt's exports, offer at least 15 projects
to French investors and reach deals on technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
France is Egypt's fourth largest trading partner. In 1997,
bilateral trade volume stood at 1.4 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China treasures the traditional
friendship with Surinam and is ready to collaborate with it to
forge a long-term and stable friendly relationship of cooperation
oriented toward the 21st century, President Jiang Zemin said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and his Surinamese counterpart Jules Wijdenbosch held
talks in a cordial and friendly atmosphere this afternoon, in
which they had an in-depth exchange of views on bilateral
relations and other issues of common concern, and reached a
wide-ranging consensus.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Wijdenbosch's ongoing China tour will surely serve
to further promote bilateral relations, and make bilateral
friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation score more
successes.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries cherish a deep traditional
friendship and, since they established diplomatic ties 22 years
ago, bilateral cooperation in the political, economic, military
and cultural sectors have been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, Jiang went on to say, the two nations
have supported and closely cooperated with each other. "We are
satisfied with the great development in China-Surinam relations,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the Surinamese government and Wijdenbosch
for their positive contributions to enhancing bilateral relations
and for their understanding and support for Chinese people's
endeavour for peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese government regards Surinam as an
important cooperation partner in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Wijdenbosch said that he was glad to visit China, and praised
the Chinese residing in his country for their hard work and
contributions to furthering the friendship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said his government values Surinam-China relations and
bilateral friendly cooperative ties extend to all areas.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that his government will continue to
stick to the "one China" policy, and join the Chinese government
in promoting bilateral friendly cooperation in the political,
economic and cultural fields to score new progress.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Registers as Voter for Congress Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime Minister
and Vice President of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) Hun Sen has
registered as a voter for the upcoming congress elections.
</P>
<P>
He and his wife registered Monday afternoon at the Teacher
Training College in Kandal province, which is not far from his
home and often referred to as the ``Tiger's Lair.''
</P>
<P>
It was the first day for voters to register for Assembly
elections on July 26. Voter registration will last for 28 days
until June 15.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian people need the elections and the international
community also hopes to see the elections take place, Hun Sen said
to reporters after registering.
</P>
<P>
He said the congressional elections would take place as
scheduled and that attempts to postpone the elections would be
doomed to failure, referring to a request for postponement by the
National United Front (NUF).
</P>
<P>
The NUF, which consists of the Funcinpec, the Sam Rainsy Party,
the Son Sann Party and the Cambodian Neutral Party, said in a
joint statement on Monday that the elections, if conducted under
present conditions, would be illegal and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
They are demanding that the elections be postponed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Sam Rainsy Party has charged that
registration officials have allowed only those people accompanied
by CPP unit leaders to register.
</P>
<P>
This suggests that only those who have promised to vote for the
CPP are being allowed to register, the Sam Rainsy Party said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
It is urging all observers, Cambodian and international, not to
turn a blind eye to these gross abuses of voter rights.

<P>
The two presidents also exchanged views on the further
strengthening of economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the two nations share a good political relationship,
sincere desire for cooperation, broad markets and rich resources.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also undertaking economic reforms, he
said, adding that all this has laid a solid basis for bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, shown remarkable potential and
provided good opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic and technological cooperation between the
two countries has brought about good economic and social results.
</P>
<P>
So long as both sides make further efforts on this basis and in
line with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and
actively explore ways of cooperation catering to the needs of the
two countries, the economic and trade cooperation will surely
reach a new level.
</P>
<P>
Wijdenbosch said Surinam values its ties with Asia, the
economic and trade ties with China in particular, as this is the
focus of his current China tour.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped that Surinam-China economic and trade
cooperation would be further expanded and bilateral ties score
more tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to further expand bilateral non-governmental
and cultural exchanges in an effort to increase the understanding
and strengthen the friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
On China's relations with Latin American and Caribbean
countries, Jiang said that in recent years bilateral relations in
various fields have been advancing in a steady way.
</P>
<P>
The high-level exchanges of visits and multi-channel dialogues
have expanded mutual consensus and strengthened political
relations between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, Jiang continued, both sides share
identical or similar views and cooperate well.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to promote comprehensive friendly relations of
cooperation with Latin American and Caribbean countries, and
promote common development in a bid to safeguard world peace.
</P>
<P>
During the talks both sides also briefed each other on their
respective countries' social and economic situations.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a ceremony to welcome
his Surinamese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two leaders attended a signing ceremony
for agreements on bilateral economic and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen was among those present at the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Wijdenbosch arrived here earlier today as Jiang's guest.

<HEADLINE> EC Not Ready to Consider Legal Action Against Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) said
it's not ready to take action against Microsoft after the software
company and the U.S. government failed in their negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Rating, spokesman for European Competition Commissioner
Karel van Miert, told the press that the commission has not yet
begun to deliberate on whether or not to take action against the
software giant as it has done before in other anti-trust cases.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between U.S. government lawyers and Microsoft
collapsed without any sign of resuming. The government and at
least 20 U.S. states will soon file two separate but similar
federal anti-trust lawsuits against Microsoft in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The EC spokesman said the commission would prefer to wait for
the Americans to implement action.
</P>
<P>
When pressed by a question that it might take the Americans
years to take action, the spokesman said that it may just as well
take years for the commission to take action.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's new Windows version was accused of breaching
U.S. anti-trust laws by illegally using its market power to
suffocate competition in the market for Internet browser
software.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has included its own browser for free in its Windows
98 to be shipped on June 25.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, previously launched an investigation into allegations that
Microsoft allegedly breached anti-trust laws with its earlier
version of the Windows software.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned About Kurds' Meeting in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Monday expressed its
concern about the upcoming meeting of several Kurdish groups in
northern Iraq, which will be held in Cairo, capital of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly press conference here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said that the Turkish Embassy in
Egypt will be closely following the meeting scheduled for
May 27-28.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) will not be
invited to the meeting in a formal or informal way," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, which has been declared by Ankara as an illegal
organization, has been fighting a 14-year-old war against the
Turkish government for the establishment of an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo meeting is organized by a non-governmental
institution called Asian-African Solidarity Organization,
according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question by Cumhuriyet, a leading Turkish
newspaper, Egyptian Ambassador to Turkey Muhammed Mehdi Fathala
said that the meeting has no connections with the Egyptian
government.

<HEADLINE> ``Non-Communists Need to Contribute to Re-Employment Efforts'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China's non-Communist personages
should contribute actively to helping the work of guaranteeing the
basic livelihood and re-employment of laid-off workers, said Wang
Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), here today.
</P>
<P>
The remark came when he gave a briefing on the guidelines for a
work conference on re-employment to the leaders of China's
non-communist parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce (ACFIC), as well as some personages without party
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is also head of the United Front Work Department of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said
that guaranteeing the basic livelihood and re-employment of
laid-off workers is an important way for the non-communist parties
and the ACFIC to participate in political and government affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the non-Communist personages would give full
play to their role in contacting people of all walks of life and
helping laid-off workers form a new concept of employment in line
with the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The ACFIC, as a non-governmental business organization linking
China's non-state-owned economic sectors, should organize and
direct more non-state-owned enterprises to participate in this
work, and encourage them to recruit laid-off workers and their
children, he said.
</P>
<P>
Big privately-run enterprises should be encouraged to
participate in the reform of the state-owned enterprises by such
means as merger and purchase in order to reduce the number of
layoffs and ease the pressure for employment, Wang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
United States President Bill Clinton, and European Union
Commission President Jacques Santer launched discussions over
EU-US trade disputes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials predicted the meeting would lead to "some
progress both on ILSA and Helms-Burton."
</P>
<P>
ILSA, known as the D'Amato Law, allows Washington to penalize
foreign companies investing more than 40 million U.S. dollars per
year in the hydrocarbon sector in Iran or Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Law penalizes foreign businesses which engage
in business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The EU has strongly opposed the U.S. laws, saying
"extraterritorial" laws that seek to bind other countries break
international law.
</P>
<P>
Just hours ahead of the summit, EU External Trade Commissioner,
Leon Brittan, said progress had been made in talks to end the row
and a deal is in sight.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't got it in the bag, but we've made huge progress. We
have been negotiating intensively over the weekend, and I very
much hope we can now bring it to a conclusion," he told BBC.

<P>
SOFIA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Midfielder Ilia Gruev was cut off
from the Bulgarian World Cup squad by coach Hristo Bonev, who
abandoned earlier promises to help the player clear his name of
doping charges.
</P>
<P>
Bonev said he had talked the case with the head of the
Bulgarian doping control laboratory and then decided that Gruev
would be out of his World Cup plan.
</P>
<P>
Gruev has already been suspended by the Bulgarian soccer
federation, faces a two-year ban after last month testing
positive for the banned anabolic nortestosterone.
</P>
<P>
Bonev reacted strongly in Gruyev's defence 10 days ago then. "I
will struggle tooth-and-nail for this lad as I know him very well
and I am sure that he cannot not do such a thing," Bonev said.
</P>
<P>
"He is innocent and I will prove it. Ilia Gruev will play in
the World Cup finals," he said, adding he would send a fresh
Gruyev's sample to an internationally-recognized laboratory in
Cologne.
</P>
<P>
The coach then named the 28-year-old from Neftochimik Bourgas
in squad for a training camp beginning on Monday and Bonev said
the final squad of 22 players would be named only one day ahead of
the June 2 deadline set by FIFA.

<HEADLINE> 3 Lebanese Civilians Wounded by Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Three Lebanese civilians were
wounded by Israeli artillery shelling in south Lebanon Monday,
Lebanon's Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The three were wounded at dawn of the day when Israeli shells
landed at the village of Majdal Silm in the western sector of the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also swooped down on several villages in the
Iqlim Toufah area on the edge of the central part of the zone,
according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
These places are believed to be the bases used by Lebanese
guerrillas to launch offensives against Israeli posts inside the
zone.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a
statement that one of its units had set off a roadside bomb when a
group of Israeli soldiers were patrolling on a road inside the
zone.
</P>
<P>
The attack killed or wounded some of the Israeli soldiers, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The latest clashes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah began
late last night in the western sector of the zone, in which
Israeli troops fired surface-to-surface missiles toward their
targets, according to Lebanese security sources.
</P>
<P>
Another Lebanese anti-Israeli occupation military group Amal
Movement, led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, also announced
that it launched separate attacks on Israeli posts inside the zone
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon with the aim of protecting its northern areas from
Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
There have been frequent clashes since the establishment of
the zone in 1985 between Israeli troops and guerrillas who are
trying to oust them from the region.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Urged to Press Ahead with Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa would have to
press ahead with economic reforms despite the fact that they may
cause short-term hardship, Botswanan President Festus Mogae said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing businessmen on the second day of the southern
African economic summit in Windhoek, Namibia, Mogae said Botswana
was trying to diversify its economy away from mining and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried about our excessive dependence on those," said
Mogae, the former finance minister and one of the architects of
Botswana's present economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Attracting foreign investment was a priority and one way of
doing this was to deregulate further, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the process had to take time but there were
constraints, including trying to persuade labor that policies
which would result in jobs in two years' time "were not pie in
the sky", Mogae said.
</P>
<P>
Botswana had the world's fastest-growing economy between 1965
and 1996, the World Bank's latest figures showed. The country's
gross national product (GNP) grew by 13 percent over the 31-year
period and its income per capita grew by 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on regional trade cooperation, Mogae suggested that
South Africa was not doing enough to ensure free movement of
goods within the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), which
also groups Lesotho, Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
He said he sometimes had the feeling that South Africa and
Zimbabwe introduced non-tariff barriers against Botswanan goods.
He said Botswana's ability to reduce tariff barriers was
dependent on the SACU.

securities and futures market supervision, both parties agreed.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), said at the signing ceremony that China's
securities market has entered a development period of

JAKARTA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah closed at
12,500 against the U.S. dollar at the Jakarta spot market Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah traded at 10,800 per dollar on May 14. However,
trading was sluggish since last week's widespread rioting in
Jakarta sent jitters to market players, a trader said here.
</P>
<P>
"Investors are still taking a wait-and-see attitude, There was
still a slight volume of activity in the market," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rupiah liquidity was relatively tight with overnight inter-bank
call money ranging from 52 percent to 53 percent, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The value of rupiah has lost more than 70 percent against the
greenback since July last year.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Issue Tenders for Tilt Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel is going to issue tenders
soon for the purchase of rail systems using the new "tilt"
technology, Israel Radio reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Israeli National Infrastructure Minister
Arie Sharon has ordered the Israel Railway Authority to prepare
the tenders.
</P>
<P>
The "tilt" technology enables trains to take curves at higher
speeds, and is therefore expected to encourage passenger traffic
on winding routes such as the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem line, a route
which, currently, is largely shunned by commuters because it is
so slow.
</P>
<P>
Sharon's decision follows the recent successful experiment with
the new system on the railways of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The tenders will be for the immediate purchase of seven
systems, at a cost of 25 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the new systems will constitute a
revolution in Israel's public transportation industry. They will
help bring the peripheral areas closer to the center of the
country, and will thereby promote employment and economic growth
in these areas.

<HEADLINE> Economic Cooperation Expands Between China, Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- China sees infrastructural
construction, technical renovation of state-owned enterprises, and
cooperation between small and medium-size enterprises of China and
those of other countries as the key areas for foreign investment
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, made the remarks during a meeting with Canadian
Industry Ministry John Manley here today.
</P>
<P>
China will introduce more foreign investments in those areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China is confident of meeting its goal of an 8-percent economic
growth rate this year, said Sheng, who became head of the
commission in a government restructuring in March.
</P>
<P>
He said the major areas for investment are energy,
transportation, environmental protection and water conservancy
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the technical renovation in China's industrial sector
"provides a great deal of opportunities for overseas investors."
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises in China will adjust production mix,
reduce use of energy and materials, and improve efficiency
through extensive technical renovation in the next few years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises, which were "large in number and
extensive in field," could recruit a great amount of laborers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the state enterprises became a key area for
investment because they needed to enhance cooperation with
foreign partners to become more competitive in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Manley said Canada was interested in the Sino-Canadian
cooperation in small and medium-sized enterprises as well as in
water power industry and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation could be carried out on a more extensive scale,
he said, such as in the framework of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Canada is ready to invest in the key projects in central China,
he added.
</P>
<P>
During his China tour, the Canadian minister will visit the
construction site of the Three Gorges Dam in central China with a
delegation of Canadian companies before going to China's densely
populated city of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Canada plans to open its fourth consulate in this new
municipality, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Sheng and Manley agreed to sign a bilateral memorandum of
understanding on economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade departments are consulting on signing the
agreement for the protection of mutual investment.
</P>
<P>
High-level visits between the two countries are frequent this
year. Canadian ministers of international trade and international
cooperation have visited China since March.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the Chinese Customs, the bilateral
trade volume reached 3.91 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> PNA to Reject Israeli Redeployment Plan: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said Monday that Palestinians will reject a reported Israeli
proposal to carry out a 13 percent redeployment in the West Bank
without a third phase withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) planning and
international cooperation minister, said that the PNA will insist
on a third phrase withdrawal. The present U.S. proposal for a 13.1
percent withdrawal has already been "a huge compromise" on the
Palestinian part, he added.
</P>
<P>
A report from the U.S. said that during talks in Washington
Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to
a 13 percent pullback from the West Bank provided the Palestinian
side gives up the idea of a third phase redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The report said this came after Washington threatened to
withdraw from the whole peace process if Netanyahu rejected the 13
percent pullback in the second Israeli troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
flied to London Monday to participate in the U.S.-European Union
summit, will meet PNA President Yasser Arafat there Monday
afternoon to brief him on the latest talks she and U.S. Middle
East peace envoy Dennis Ross held with Netanyahu in
Washington. Arafat will arrive in London from a visit to Norway.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, after his five-day visit to the U.S., would return
to Israel Monday afternoon. He had said in Washington that he was
prepared to "make any compromise" if it does not endanger
Israel's security.

<HEADLINE> Financial Difficulties Force IBF to Cancel Tournaments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The financial crises in Southeast
Asia had forced the International Badminton Federation (IBF) to
erase some of the scheduled tournaments off the calendar, a
leading IBF official disclosed here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
IBF, badminton's world governing body, had a very difficult
year with regard to the financial situation in the region, said
Datuk Punch Gunalan from Malaysia, vice-president of the IBF and
chairman of the IBF's Open Committee.
</P>
<P>
The federation had to cancel such events as the Korea Open,
Thailand Open, Vietnam Open and the Russia Open. And the Chinese
Taipei Open had been postponed from November this year to January
1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
But many tournaments would still stand, he said. As one of
them, the Indonesia Open would not only be held in August as
scheduled but also the Indonesian Badminton Association would try
to make it a Four-Star event. Such grade of tournament requires a
total prize money of at least 120,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This year's Grand Prix Final will be held in February 1999, to
give way to the Asian Games set for Bangkok in December this year,
said Gunalan, who is also secretary-general of the Asian Badminton
Confederation.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the Grand Prix Final, the world's top 16 for
men's singles and top 12 for women's singles, will be decided
according to the year's final world rankings which could be
finalized after the year-ending tournament, the Hong Kong Open,
which had been set for November.

<HEADLINE> Handphones Used During Driving Are Confiscated in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in Singapore,
five motorists had their cellular phones confiscated by the
Traffic Police for making calls while driving on Monday, the first
day the new traffic measure went into effect.
</P>
<P>
As of 5 p.m. Monday, five motorists had their cellular phones
confiscated by the police for handphone-driving, Singapore
television said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to confiscation of the mobile phones, the offenders
will also chalk up nine demerit points and pay a composition fine
of 170 Singapore dollars, or a bit more than 100 U.S. dollars, for
each offense. The confiscated handphones will be given to the
courts for disposal, the television said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Traffic Police decided to implement the new
handphone confiscation rule effective this Monday, because more
people have been committing the offense of handphone-driving.
</P>
<P>
The Traffic Police statistics showed that in the first four
months of this year, the number of handphone-driving offenders who
were booked by the police rose to about 220 a month from about 180
a month last year.
</P>
<P>
Police said that confiscation had been considered since last
year, when a blitz in October caught 300 offenders. Since then,
the police had been warning motorists repeatedly over the media
that it would introduce additional measures should the problem of
handphone-driving persist.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Has Highest Polio Cases in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has the highest polio cases
in Africa, with 942 cases reported in 1997, the World Health
Organization (WHO) has said.
</P>
<P>
WHO's representative in Nigeria, Evarist Njelesani, made the
disclosure at the weekend in Lagos, at the meeting of the Rotary
International Sub-Sahara Africa Regional Polio Plus Committee.
</P>
<P>
Njelesani said Nigeria was followed by the Democratic Republic
of Congo with 219 cases.
</P>
<P>
As the WHO has set the year 2,000 for total elimination of
polio in the world, the official pointed out that in Africa,
polio-free zones are emerging in the Southern and Eastern belt.
</P>
<P>
Njelesani said surveillance for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP)
has been initiated in each country which has conducted National
Immunization Day (NIDS) with a network of 13 laboratories for
stool specimen investigation.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, he said, four rounds of NIDS had been conducted in
the last two years, increasing coverage from 46 percent in 1996
to 95 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has actively assisted the Nigerian government to set
up a surveillance system for AFP, with over 2,000 health
personnel trained at the federal, state and local council levels.
</P>
<P>
The result is an increase of the number of cases of AFP from
only three reported in 1997 to five in January, nine in February,
17 in March and 25 in April 1998, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee to Visit Nuclear Explosion Sites on May 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee will visit the site of five recent nuclear tests in
Pokhran Range of Rajasthan State on May 20, official sources said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
India held five nuclear tests within 48 hours in May 11 and 13
at Pokhran, inducing strong reactions and sanctions from the
international community. The thermonuclear (45 kiloton), fission
(15 kiloton), and the low yield (0.2 kiloton) nuclear devices were
detonated simultaneously on May 11 and two more sub-kiloton
nuclear devices (0.5 and 0.3 kiloton) were triggered on May 13.
</P>
<P>
After the five nuclear tests, India announced that it acquired
nuclear weapons capability.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
is taking advantage of the nuclear tests for the party. "Partisan
euphoria is sought to be built around the country's new-found
nuclear weapons capability," the reports quoted former prime
minister Inder Kumar Gujral as saying Monday. Other political
parties have time and again warned the BJP against taking
advantage for itself. Some reports even said that with this
advantage the BJP might call snap elections to secure a majority
in Parliament to get rid of its present coalition troubles.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, however, ruled out mid-term elections to Parliament
to tap the goodwill generated by the nuclear tests Monday. He said
that there was no question of BJP taking advantage of the national
achievement.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, after the nuclear tests, residents of
Khetolal village at Pokhran have started complaining of various
complications. Over a dozen people so far complained of excessive
bleeding from the nose, skin and eye irritation, vomiting and
loose motions. The villagers said this started immediately after
the twin explosions on May 13 and continued thereafter.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Ministry to Vaccinate Kids against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will vaccinate
all children under five against polio in the latter half of the
year, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian Monday quoted the statement as saying that
Tanzania is implementing strategies toward complete interruption
of transmission of the virus causing poliomyelitis, popularly
known as infantile paralysis.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed over the weekend by the acting
Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Dr. G. Upunda,
said the move has been in line with a World Health Assembly (WHA)
resolution aiming at eradicating poliomyelitis in the whole world
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the vaccination days for 1998 will be
August 1 and 2 and September 12 and 13.
</P>
<P>
"All children, aged 0-5 years, are eligible to the vaccination
rounds irrespective of their immunization status and whether or
not they were vaccinated during the previous national
immunization days," it said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania conducted polio mass vaccination in 1996 and 1997 to
interrupt the transmission of the virus, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Senator Warns of Indian Expansionist Designs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Senator Akram Zaki
Monday said New Delhi's nuclear tests are a "brazen expression of
its expansionist designs."
</P>
<P>
"The Western world should not perceive the Pokhran explosions
as a luxury to climb to nuclear power status -- they have unmasked
the real face of India which harbors expansionist designs like the
Nazi Germans of the 1930s," said Zaki in an interview with the
official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
Zaki, who is chairman of the Senate's Standing Committee on
Foreign Affairs, said Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's
announcement that India will use nuclear power when attacked is
"an unambiguous confirmation of New Delhi's designs."
</P>
<P>
With its elaborate missile program, the Indian blasts
constitute a grave security threat to the entire range of
countries from those in the Middle East to New Zealand, Zaki said.
</P>
<P>
"Any miscalculation on the part of the Western world will be a
repeat of the mistake that took place before World War II when
they failed to perceive Nazi Germans' expansionist designs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He called for a change in the Western perception that India is
a peaceful country as propagated by New Delhi. "The illusion
should no longer be there -- the Indian designs of aggression are
clear and manifest."
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the world reaction in the event
of a Pakistan nuclear test, he said Pakistan has become immune to
sanctions as it has been subjected to them discriminately and for
a long time.
</P>
<P>
Zaki is a member of the delegation that leaves for the United
States in a couple of days as part of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's diplomatic drive to apprise the international community
of Pakistan's security concerns in the wake of the Indian nuclear
blasts.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will meet top U.S. senators and congressmen to
underscore Pakistan's steps for its security as "a necessity of
survival."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the delegation will also mobilize the Pakistani
community in the United States to convey their country's
legitimate security concerns to the Clinton administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan Monday expressed the hope
that Pakistan would exercise "utmost restraint" in its response to
Indian nuclear tests last week.
</P>
<P>
After a 45-minute meeting with Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan Monday, Japanese special envoy Seiichiro Noboru told
reporters that "we hope that Pakistan would exercise utmost
restraint."
</P>
<P>
Noboru said in a brief press talk that the foreign minister did
not tell him if Pakistan has decided to explode a nuclear device
or not.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is carefully reviewing the situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question what Pakistan will gain by not
carrying out a nuclear test, the Japanese envoy said, "the world
opinion is already very sympathetic with Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
To another question what Japan will do if Pakistan detonate a
nuclear device, he said, "you will know it very soon."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Noboru, who arrived here Sunday, asked
Gohar to convey a message from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Japanese leaders have indicated that it would impose sanctions
against Pakistan when it follows India's lead and conducts nuclear
tests.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Prune Varsities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The 23 federal universities across
Nigeria may be reduced to six in line with the country's
geo-political zones under a new policy on the future of
education, the Daily Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The six geo-political zones are Northeast, Northwest, North
Central, Southwest, Southeast and Southsouth, believed to be
divided for a balance of tribal interests.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the funding and management of the six
universities would be the responsibility of the government, while
those left would be transferred to the 36 states all over the
country, the report said, quoting Education Minister Alhaji Dauda
Birmah.
</P>
<P>
The policy was fashioned by a seven-man inter-ministerial
committee headed by the minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy, the federal government would continue
to establish model secondary schools and maintain its own
tertiary institutions when the states are responsible for the
management of the remaining universities, polytechnics and
secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
The minister said primary education would henceforth be the
sole responsibility of local governments and private initiatives
in the geo-political zones with each zone at liberty to determine
the status of its primary education.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister at the weekend, the federal
government would in the next 45 days announce the establishment
of a National Commission for Secondary Education.
</P>
<P>
Also being considered was a proposal to decentralize the
present National Primary Education Commission into a six zonal
structure with each zone having its own commission.
</P>
<P>
Education in Nigeria has been reported in crisis, with absence
of mass education, lack of direction, inadequate expansion, poor
primary school foundation and commercialization of education
identified as major factors hintering the education sector.
</P>
<P>
The government has been urged to adopt an urgent realistic
policy to rescue the system from impending collapse.

<HEADLINE> Currency Depreciation not to Affect Budget: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The recent sharp depreciation of
Uganda shilling against U.S. Dollar will not affect the country's
budget, a finance official has said.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "the
effect should be neutral. The value of imports in Dollars will go
up so that even if imports fall revenue will remain quite
stable."
</P>
<P>
"Our greatest concern is to ensure a smooth transition from
one exchange rate to the next. We do not want instability in the
market," he added.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly financial indicators report, the Bank of Uganda
announced that the Shilling had depreciated 6.7 percent against
the Dollar from 1,156 to 1,234 at the end of April this year.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic fall in coffee exports caused by the adverse
weather conditions brought by the El-Nino weather pattern was
blamed for the sharp devaluation of Shilling. Coffee accounts for
60 percent of Uganda's total foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
The official said the government had expected the revenue
collections this year to reach 840 billion Shillings (840 million
Dollars) and now had to adjust it to 810 billion Shillings (810
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, he said the shortfall will not be carried on to the next
fiscal year since they would contain it within this financial year by
cutting back on expenditure in non-priority areas.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has offered to help boost

<P>
"Their stress is on boosting the rearing of freshwater fish, "
Sulaiman said, adding Malaysia must step-up freshwater fish
breeding because of the drop in marine fish resources.
</P>
<P>
Freshwater fish could also be used as feed for the livestock
industry in place of maize and soybean which are mainly imported
at a high cost, he said.

He said the Cabinet had asked Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi, who is to visit Cuba soon, to further discuss the

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Who Is Actually Making Nuclear Threat? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The explosion of five nuclear
devices by India last week posed a grave threat to peace and
stability in South Asia and the world, undermining international
efforts for non-proliferation and a complete test ban of nuclear
weapons and arousing strong condemnation world-wide.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to justify their nuclear tests, Indian leaders however
have repeatedly made smearing attacks on China.
</P>
<P>
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes publicly accused China
of being "India's potential threat number one."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee also claimed that India is
bordered by a country known to have nuclear weapons that invaded
India in 1962 and that despite improved relations with it in the
last decade, an absence of trust persisted because of unsettled
border disputes.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, China has all along pursued a foreign
policy of peace and friendship. The Chinese government has stated
many times that China's small quantity of nuclear weapons is not
aimed at threatening anyone, but is solely out of the need for
defense. China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons at
any time or under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has signed the Treaty on Non-proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and has
been faithfully fulfilling the obligations of the two treaties.
</P>
<P>
China is a responsible country that keeps its promise on the
issue of nuclear weapons. India's argument that it conducted
nuclear tests because of having a nuclear-equipped neighbor is
totally untenable.
</P>
<P>
As for Vajpayee' claim of China's invasion, historical facts
brook no distortion.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that after its declaration of independence
in 1950, the Indian government kept pushing forward its northern
boundary and occupied some 90,000 square kilometers of Chinese
territories in between the traditional line in the eastern section
of the borders and the illegal McMahon Line.
</P>
<P>
In October 1962, the Indian government continued to pursue its
policy of expansionism and started a large-scale war of invasion
against China.
</P>
<P>
Driven beyond the limits of forbearance, China's border troops
fought back in self-defense. Even under those circumstances, China
ceased fire and withdrew troops on its own initiative and called
for resumption of negotiations to seek a peaceful end to the
border conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Chinese government has persistently worked
for a peaceful resolution of the border issue and taken measures
to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China in
1988 and Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to India in 1996
helped to move bilateral relationship in the direction of
friendship and good-neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a series of agreements, including one
on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the line of actual
control on the Chinese-Indian border and another on confidence
building measures in the military field along the line of actual
control in the China-India border areas.
</P>
<P>
These agreements helped to create favorable conditions for the
two countries to enhance mutual trust and resolve their border
issue eventually and reasonably.
</P>
<P>
But at a time when the Sino-Indian relations were being
improved, the Vajpayee government came up with statements on
so-called absence of trust between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Such lame excuses India has made for conducting underground
nuclear tests at the expenses of the overall interest of
Sino-Indian relations have been criticized by the world public
opinion as well as many people of insight in India.
</P>
<P>
"China threat" advocated by the Vajpayee government is not a
fact. But the interference from a group of Indian political
figures with China's internal affairs is a matter of record.
</P>
<P>
India tried in vain to obstruct peaceful liberation of China's
Tibet in the 1950s and allows the Dalai clique to use its
territory to carry out splitting activities against China.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Dalai clique gave its backing to India's
nuclear tests reflected the sinister relations between the Indian
government and the Dalai clique.
</P>
<P>
India has not only threatened China, but also other neighbors
as well. This cannot be more clearly shown when Vajpayee said
after the nuclear explosion that India had become a country
possessing nuclear weapons and that India would not hesitate to
use nuclear weapons when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts are of the view that with the nuclear
explosion, India seeks to develop nuclear weapons, barge into the
world's club of nuclear powers, and then seek regional hegemony,
which would not only do harm to regional peace and stability, but
also pose a threat to world peace.
</P>
<P>
It has been proved by history that any countries that practised
regional or global hegemony would, contrary to their wishes, get
them nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the two major themes of the world
today, as well as the common wishes of the Chinese and Indian
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Being the two most populous developing countries in the world,
both China and India are facing a huge task of developing their
economies. An improvement in bilateral relations would be in line
with the fundamental interests of the two countries and be
conducive to peace, stability and development in the region and in
the world.
</P>
<P>
We hope that the Indian government would have a clear
understanding of the current trend of development and stop
immediately the development of nuclear weapons, which is against
the wishes of the people the world over.
</P>
<P>
We also hope that the Indian government would stop spreading
rumors and stop doing anything detrimental to the development of
friendly relations between the Indian and Chinese peoples and
instead do something that is favorable to the peace and stability
of South Asia and the world so that the bilateral relations
between the two countries could return to the normal track of
development.

<P>
LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Anti-Tobacco Alliance
has urged the government to urgently curb the excesses of
manufacturers and advertizers of tobacco products in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Media Research, Hugo Odiogor said in a recent
statement that it is appalling the way the Federal Ministry of
Health closes its eye to the massive "catch them young" tactics
of marketing and advertizing companies.
</P>
<P>
Odiogor accused the companies of employing musical jamborees
and social events to recruit young smokers through distribution
of free packets of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to implement the Decree 20 of 1990
which bans smoking in public places and to stop the installation
of cigarette bill boards on school vicinities as a way of
discouraging students smoking.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations Human Index has in the past six years
listed Nigeria as one of the countries with low life expectancy
rate; it is therefore, unthinkable that health authorities would
stick to social habits and culture that further exposes its
population of working age to habits that would further worsen the
situation," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Poll Organizers Vow to Continue Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC) vowed Monday to hold the country's
general election on its due date on Saturday despite opposition
parties' attempt to postpone it.
</P>
<P>
IEC chairman Sekara Mafisa said Monday he would fight with
every legal means against the three main opposition parties,
which applied to the Lesotho high court to have the polls put off
for alleged irregularities.
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to go to the high court this afternoon to fight
for the Basotho nation. Preparations for these elections are so
much at an advance stage that they cannot be reserved as it will
do great harm to the nation's high spirit," South African Press
Association quoted Mafisa as saying in Maseru, the capital.
</P>
<P>
The court hearing is scheduled for this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The election, the tiny mountain kingdom's third democratic
election since its independence in 1966, is scheduled for May 23.
</P>
<P>
The Basotholand Congress Party, Basotho National Party and the
Marematlou Freedom Party have asked for a court order that the
IEC investigate alleged irregularities, including the fact that
80 percent of the residents of a village was registered as having
been born on a New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
Mafisa said it was disturbing that the opposition leaders were
calling for a postponement without identifying an alternative
election date. "How can they demand an indefinite postponement?"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he defended the IEC's poll schedule, saying the
parties had been given enough time to inspect the voters' list.
</P>
<P>
He said it was sad that the opposition threatened court action
knowing the IEC was running on a tight time table.
</P>
<P>
Voting has already taken place at Lesotho embassies abroad,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, those involved in the election, including security
forces, government officials and political parties officials,
will vote ahead of the 1.3 million eligible voters.

</P>
<P>
Abdul Aziz Al Khawaitar, special advisor to Saudi King Fahd bin

Meanwhile, Seiichiro Noboru, special envoy of Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, visited here Sunday to urge Pakistan
to show restraint in response to India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
These visits are taking place after a high-caliber U.S.
delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, left
Pakistan on Saturday failing to woo Pakistan away from nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and some other big powers have been
urging Pakistan to exercise restraint and not to follow India's
suit, indicating that severe sanctions would be imposed on
Pakistan if it also goes nuclear.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a week after the Indian nuclear tests, the Pakistani
government, which is facing mounting pressure at home to make a
"matching response" to India, has been weighing its options very
carefully as how to respond to its arch rival's actions.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming the solemn pledge not to compromise national
security, Prime Minister Sharif made it clear on Sunday that
Pakistan possesses nuclear capability and can carry out a nuclear
test "within 12 to 24 hours."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan has also declared that his
government has decided to test a nuclear device. "It's a matter of
when, not if... the decision has already been taken by the
cabinet," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the government, as Prime Minister Sharif has said time
and again, will "make no irrevocable decisions in haste. We are
monitoring the sharp reaction toward the Indian nuclear
explosions."

<HEADLINE> Japanese Paper Blasts Controversial Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese newspaper on Monday
criticized the controversial Japanese film "Pride -- the Fatal
Moment" which whitewashes Japan's aggression against neighboring
countries during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable to put on show the film which distorts
historical facts and damages trust between Japan and its
neighboring countries at a time when Japan needs to deepen
mutually trustful ties with these countries," the International
Trade, a weekly newspaper affiliated with Japan's Association for
Promotion of International Trade, said in a commentary carried on
its latest edition to be published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan is in a period of learning from history and winning trust
from other Asian countries by making contributions to peace,
stability and economic development in Asia, the commentary
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
But the film will seriously harm the trustful relations between
Japan and its neighboring countries, the article said, adding it
will surely be condemned by the international community.
</P>
<P>
The commentary called on Japan to make efforts to deepen trust
with other countries in the world as the next century approaches.
</P>
<P>
The film, to be put on show later this month, deals with the
trial and last days of General Hideki Tojo, Japan's wartime prime
minister, who was executed as an A-Class war criminal by the
International Military Tribunal for the Far East in November 1948.
</P>
<P>
Distorting historical facts, the film also depicts Japan's
aggression against neighboring countries during World War II as
self-defense and denies Japanese troops' war crimes including the
Nanjing Massacre in which about 300,000 people were slaughtered by
the Japanese army.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- On the occasion of the World Museum
and Cultural Heritage Day Monday, Iran put the remains of a "Salt
Man" of 1,700 years ago on display at its National Museum in
downtown Tehran.
</P>
<P>
This is the debut of the remains of the man, known later as the
"Salt Man," since he was found in 1993 during excavations at a
salt mine in Hamzehlou village of Zanjan province, about 300
kilometers west of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was inaugurated by Iran's Minister of Culture
and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani. Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami sent a message which was read at the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The remains, including the head and one leg, have been
naturally mummified as a result of lying in salty conditions.
</P>
<P>
After studies on the man's remains and his belongings
discovered, scientists believed that he might be a hunter or a
prince of about 40 years old, who had been wounded for yet unknown
reasons a short while before his death.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Officer Released by Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine Army officer, who was
abducted early this month by suspected members of the leftist New
People's Army (NPA), has been released by the rebel group, the
Philippine News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Army Master Sergeant Ricardo Castro was set free Sunday in
Quezon City, Metro Manila, after 15 days of captivity, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
He was turned over by a representative of the National
Democratic Front (NDF), which led the NPA, to representatives of
the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Castro's release was negotiated by representatives of local
non-governmental organizations and the religious sector.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, a leftist alliance created by the Communist Party of
the Philippines in the late 1960s, has been fighting the
government for decades.
</P>
<P>
The insurgency of the NDF reached its peak in the 1980s with
its armed wing NPA having a membership of more than 20,000. But
the strength of the NDF later weakened considerably due to
military operations and factionalism.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, U.S. Hold Live-Fire Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States has launched
month-long, live-fire military exercises with Jordan, involving
marines and sailors of the U.S. Navy's 5th fleet, semi-official
Jordan Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a U.S. Defense Department statement issued
Sunday as saying that the joint exercises began Thursday. But it
did not say how many troops of both sides were taking part in the
drill and where it is taking place.
</P>
<P>
Army officials here are not immediately available for comment
on the exercises codenamed "Infinite Moonlight '98."
</P>
<P>
But a similar live-fire mock war last year, involving 500
Americans and a similar number of Jordanians, was held in the
desert town of Qatrana, 120 kilometers south to Amman.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the latest maneuver was designed to
demonstrate U.S. commitment to regional security and increase
cooperation between U.S. amphibious forces and Jordanian armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's official news agency has said that the drill from May
14 to June 16 was held to help raise the efficiency and skills of
Jordanian armed forces, enabling them to gain combat experiences
and learn about advanced and modern military equipment.
</P>
<P>
Since Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994,
Washington has donated 300 million U.S. dollars worth of military
supplies, including F-16 jet fighters, tanks and helicopters, to
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces have conducted joint exercises with several
Arab countries, including Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> India Offers Early Dialogue with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Chairman of India's
Planning Commission Jaswant Singh said Monday that India had
offered dialogue with the United States and other western
countries over the recent five nuclear tests in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. White House has said that India had engaged in
deception as it carried out a surreptitious nuclear weapons
program and conducted five successful tests.
</P>
<P>
"I think, (there has been) on the part of the Indians a
deliberate campaign of deception since March. They have said
they'd exercise restraint," U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy
Berger said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting foreign correspondents here, Jaswant Singh said there
was no panic about U.S. sanctions and asserted that India would
meet them effectively.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the sanctions are estimated at 20 billion
U.S. dollars. India would have to be depending on selling its gold
reserves to stem the effects of sanctions. Jaswant, however,
described the reports as "speculative".
</P>
<P>
New Delhi was ready to engage in a meaningful discussions with
key interlocutors on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
issue, he said. He did not elaborate on meaningful discussions on
the issue. The Vajpayee government has rejected the present form
of CTBT.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether India's economy would be adversely affected
as a result of the sanctions and the huge amounts spent on nuclear
projects, Jaswant Singh said that the country's nuclear program
would not be at the cost of the Indian economy. He parried
questions on any substantial hike in the defense budget or
recasting of the general budget.
</P>
<P>
Indian senior officials have time and again warned that the
future budget, to be presented to Parliament on June 1, would be
"tough". Prices of petroleum products might be raised in the
budget, etc..

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Seizure in Namibia Surges Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 38 kilogram of
cocaine was confiscated in Namibia last year, which was more than
sixfold of the amount seized in 1996, a Namibian paper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The commanding officer of the Namibian police drug law
enforcement unit, Lousi Mensah, told the high court in Windhoek
on Friday that the amount of cocaine seized in the country had
"increased heavily" every year in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 595 gram of cocaine was confiscated in Namibia, and
the amount rose tenfold to 5,953 gram in 1996 and further shot up
to 38,552 gram last year, Mensah said.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine seized last year was estimated to be worth at
least 13.49 million Namibian Dollars (2.7 million U.S. Dollars),
Mensah told judges during a trial of a Nigerian and two Namibians
charged with drug dealing or possession.
</P>
<P>
Cocaine smugglers were increasingly using Namibia for the
transit of drugs, mostly to South Africa, where drug dealers find
a larger, more affluent market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine found in Namibia originates mostly from South
America, Mensah said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac: France Sees Eye to Eye With Egypt on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac has
said Cairo and Paris share identical views toward the Mideast
peace process and will work together to save the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
In an article exclusively contributed to the Egyptian Al Ahram
newspaper Monday, Chirac said there should be a just and
comprehensive peace in the region, which is the guarantee of
development and security.
</P>
<P>
It is the right of the Palestinian people to have an
independent state, Chirac said, adding that in return for full
security Israel must give back the Golan Heights to Syria, and
Lebanon likewise must enjoy full stability and sovereignty over
its southern territory.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks on the Palestinian track have been stalled
since March 1997 when Israel began construction of a Jewish
housing project in Arab East Jerusalem, and negotiations on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks are on ice since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The land-for-peace formula is the sole way for reaching
positive outcome," Chirac said in the article, which comes out
just as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's starts his three-day
visit to Paris.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's talks in France will focus on methods of confronting
impediments obstructing peace efforts in the forms of extremism
and intransigence, Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
"France, while understanding Israel's desire for peace, sees as
a must that Tel Aviv respects the timetable of its troop
redeployment in the West Bank in order to ease up tension in the
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Calling settlement-building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem
an illegal act, Chirac rejected any move aimed at changing the
status quo of Jerusalem and any prejudgement of the final status
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Chirac are expected to issue a "special statement"
on the Mideast peace process in Paris, outlining their
visualization of the next steps to spare the region a whirlpool of
violence and to get the peace process out of impasse.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency here said the two leaders will call
for adherence to the U.N. Security Council resolutions,
continuation of the land-for-peace principle, implementation of
the signed agreements and resumption of talks on the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks from where they stopped.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders have often exchanged visits. Chirac visited
Egypt three times in 1996 while Mubarak toured Paris last summer.
</P>
<P>
But Mubarak's trip this time is of particular significance in
view of the 14-month deadlock in Palestinian-Israeli peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Chirac has said he shared Arab frustration over the pace of
peace talks under the right-wing Israeli government of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say France's historical ties with many countries in
the Middle East make it an ideal advocate of Arab political and
economic concerns in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Study Reveals Child Labor Situation in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- About 17 percent of child workers in
Bangladesh have to work for 15 to 19 hours a day and up to 65
percent for nine to 14 hours, according to a joint study by the
International Labor Organization and the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
The study, entitled "Child Labor Situation in Bangladesh: a
Rapid Assessment" also showed that 14 percent of child laborers in
the country work for five to eight hours everyday while 4 percent
one to four hours as part-time workers, the independent United
News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the study did not mention the total number of child
laborers in this South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The children were found "to do almost all kinds of jobs that
adults do in urban areas, and children are involved in 300 types
of economic activities while the number is 90 in rural areas,"
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
But, the study said their income is very low. The average
monthly income of self-employed children is 793 taka (17.2 U.S.
dollars) while that for children employed by others is only 363
taka (about 7.9 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some 27 types of jobs the child laborers are doing have been
rated as hazardous for children, the study stated.
</P>
<P>
Their jobs include those exposing them to flame, chemical
substances, gas, fume and dust, handling garbage, high-speed
machinery and sharp equipment and working with electricity,
extreme heat or cold, insufficient light, heavy load, stressful
working conditions and non-stop working with ice and water, the
study observed.
</P>
<P>
The study further said about 48 percent of working children
never attended schools, 43 percent ended school earlier and only 9
percent of them continued to attend school or got some form of
education provided by the non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
When these children were asked whether they would be interested
in getting enrolled in school if opportunities were available, 74
percent replied in the affirmative, the study added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has almost eliminated child labor in ready-made
garment industries and it plans to abolish it in hazardous
industries by the turn of this century and all forms of child
labor by the year 2010.

PARIS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After an eclipse which did not last more than two years,
Alexander Lebed, 48, returned to power on the political scenery of
Russia by easily winning the post of the governor of Krasnoyarsk
in Siberia. His accession to the head of a key region gave him a
formidable springboard to the Russian presidency.
</P>
<P>
-- As the host of the Great Eight summit, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair avoided to let a dispute appear among the
leaders of the eight most industrialized countries by
side-stepping the issue of nuclear tests by India. But,
U.S. President Bill Clinton wished to take financial and trade
sanctions against India, in order to persuade Pakistan, and
perhaps Iran, not to follow suit. France and Russia opposed such
measures.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Great Eight Birmingham summit expressed a timid concern
about the social problems faced by the Western countries, because
the liberal economists fear that the backlash from the economic
globalization in the social field will encourage a reappearance of
protectionism.

</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill

</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. government Monday is expected to launch a landmark
legal battle against Microsoft, the world's largest software
company, after compromise talks collapsed at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Tony Blair was accused Sunday by

as a "hoo-ha".
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The leaders of the rich nations Sunday turned a deaf ear to
the pleas of the world's poor for more effective debt relief.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

Unionists to cast aside their doubts about the Good Friday
agreement and back it whole-heartedly, as government worries

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Higher in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in Tokyo
Monday on buying spurred by an advance in futures prices.
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the
First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 141.61 points or
0.93 percent from last Friday's close to 15,384.47.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, advanced 2.24 points or 0.19 percent to
1,209.17.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the the major section thinned to an estimated 320
million shares from Friday's 400 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Motor was Monday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Stock prices went down soon after the market opened in line
with a fall in the Japanese yen to the 135 yen level against the
U.S. dollar, selling prevailed at first on the stock futures
market, pushing down the key June Nikkei futures to 15,030 at one
point in the morning, traders said.
</P>
<P>
But basket buying on behalf of public funds prevented the
Nikkei average from falling below 15,000 and helped eventually to
prop it up, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,331 issues listed on the First Section, losers edged
gainers 554 to 509, with 188 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins Military Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army has begun a
monumental reshuffle of its General Staff following the
appointment of Major General Shaul Mofaz as the new chief last
week, Israel Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The army announced six top appointments late last night.
Maj. Gen. Uzi Dayan, head of the Central Command, was promoted to
replace Maj. Gen. Mofaz as deputy chief of the General Staff. His
post in the Central Command was given to military intelligence
leader Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon.
</P>
<P>
Dayan, 50, the nephew of former military leader Moshe Dayan who
led the Israeli army in the 1967 Middle East War, participated in
peace talks with the Palestinians and with Syria and helped
formulate the interim agreements with the Palestinian National
Authority while he was head of the army's planning branch.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Maj. Gen. Yaalon, a veteran paratrooper and
commando, surprised some Israelis because he was widely assumed to
be named head of the Northern Command.
</P>
<P>
But military experts said that he was the best person for his
new position because he knows very well the situation in the West
Bank since he was in charge of the Israeli army in the areas in
1992. They believe that the Central Command, instead of the
Northern Command, has become the most sensitive front.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four-year-old Maj. Gen. Gaby Ashkenazy was appointed
head of the Northern Command to replace Maj. Gen. Amiram Levine,
who has been named deputy head of the secret agency Mossad.
</P>
<P>
A former commander of the Golani Brigade as well as head of
Israel Defense Force (IDF) forces in Lebanon, most of Ashkenazy's
career has been spent in the North.
</P>
<P>
The place of Maj. Gen. Yaalon as Head of Intelligence was
given to Maj. Gen. Amos Malka, 45. Appointed head of the Ground
Corps Command in 1996, he has been exclusively in the Armored
Corps in his 26 years of military career and never held an
intelligence command. Veteran Maj. Gen. Moshe Ivry-Sukenik would
replace him as head of the Ground Corps Command.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Yaacov Amidror, military aide to Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, was named commander of military
colleges. He becomes the first observant member of the General
Staff, aside from the chief chaplain, in over two decades.
</P>
<P>
This was the first round of reshuffles expected in the General
Staff, Israel Radio said. 12 of its 18 positions are expected to
be reassigned.

<HEADLINE> Central China City Attracting Overseas Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province, has made actual use of 4.38 billion U.S. dollars
of overseas investment since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 150 of the world's top 500 multinational
firms have made inspection tours to Wuhan, an advantageously
positioned city commonly known as a "thoroughfare linking nine
provinces," and 40 multinational companies have come to invest in
this central Chinese city, said Sun Huaiyu, head of the city's
overseas investment affairs office.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment opportunities are now available in the
city's general processing industrial business, infrastructure,
basic industry, agriculture and high-tech industrial enterprises,
with the ways of using them including starting joint ventures,
using foreign governmental loans, performing processing and
assembly, using loans of international financial organizations,
international leasing and compensation trade.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has used overseas investment to help
complete construction of a number of major urban infrastructure
projects, including a new international airport, an expressway to
the airport, a highway bridge across the Yangtze River, which
separates Wuhan into three parts -- Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwestern
China is making an effort to increase contacts with the outside
world to get more international aid for its economy.
</P>
<P>
The most recent sources are Canada, Germany, Australia, and
Japan, with more than 20 projects, worth over 100 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The province managed 58 projects with free foreign government
or organization aid last year, worth 35 million U.S. dollars that
included World Food Program agriculture and poverty relief
projects, UNICEF social development projects in impoverished
areas, and an EU irrigation training center.
</P>
<P>
The province has established long-term relations with the
UNDP, UNICEF, and United Nations Fund for Population Activities
for poverty relief and education in poor areas, using agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Germany and the Netherlands joined the effort by
provided aid for drinking water, healthcare, technical training
for ethnic minority women, and handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
Government departments have increased their efforts in aid
applications and implementation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said here Monday his government has made a strong-willed
commitment to reform programs, which aim to bail the country out
of economic woes and restore investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
"We know that we are still at the early stages of a painful,
but constructive reform process," said the Prime Minister, who
delivered a keynote address here Monday at the fifth annual Credit
Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA) Investors' Forum.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai told more than 1,000 global investors: "When my
government assumed office last November, our first priority was to
stabilize the value of our currency and quickly restore confidence
in our economy."
</P>
<P>
Rapid action was taken on three fronts -- to stabilize the
Baht, facilitate the rolling-over of private foreign debt, and
reform financial institutions, said the 60-year-old Prime
Minister, who has been involved in politics for 29 years.
</P>
<P>
The Thai currency devalued by 46 percent to 45 Baht to one
U.S. dollar in nine months after the Asian financial crisis first
stroke Thailand in July last year. Thanks to the strict
implementation of a comprehensive reform package, including
cutting public spending, raising taxes and curbing inflation, the
Baht now has been stable at just below 40 Baht to the green back.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government also took decisive action to reform its
financial sector -- closing down over half of finance companies,
taking over four ailing banks, tackling non-performing loans, and
enhancing transparent regulation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister laid out three challenges to the recovery
of the Thai economy: accelerating export growth, expediting
corporate restructuring, and committing to real reforms and good
governance.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, exports of Tailand rose
substantially in Baht terms, but fell by 2.7 percent in U.S. dollar
terms. But the prime minister predicted that measures to ease the
liquidity problem would help boost exports in the second half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
On corporate restructuring, Chuan Leekpai said: "The best way
to accomplish this task is to maintain an open economy, subject to
the full forces of competition." Restrictions on foreign
ownership have been relaxed, allowing foreign investors to acquire
majority stakes in domestic financial institutions for up to ten
years, and privatization of a broad range of state enterprises is
also under way, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed the importance of clean
governance, saying that his government is committed to effective
anti-corruption measures, transparent decision-making, prevention
of conflict of interest, and appropriate checks and balances to
ensure full accountability.
</P>
<P>
He finally expressed strong confidence in the recovery of the
Thai economy. "A road to full recovery will never be straight and
smooth," the prime minister said, adding "we do not believe in
miracles -- just plain hard work, with a dose of determination."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia Into Top Four at Thomas Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Both defending champions
Indonesia and four-time winners Malaysia qualified for the
semi-finals after their respective second Group B matches at the
20th Thomas Cup Badminton Finals here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won over South Korea 4-1, losing the second doubles
match due to what the team manager later described as "mental
problem" of one player.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, four-time champions which failed though to make the
top four at the last championships here, whitewashed lowly-rated
Netherlands 5-0.
</P>
<P>
With two victories each, Indonesia and Malaysia are now in an
unbeatable position for taking the top two places of Group B. The
two teams are to meet each other on Wednesday to decide which will
be the group winners.
</P>
<P>
"We did what we'd expected of us. One Ewe Hock did quite well
in the first singles today, which gave Malaysia a good start,"
said Malaysia's head coach Morten Frost, who is from Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is a very strong team and it gives all the other
teams a lot of pressure. If everything is going to work, they can
take two points from the doubles," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be very happy if we can split a doubles," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with our team's performance here today. Losing the
second doubles, due to mental problem of one of the players, means
that we had to make more efforts to improve," said Indonesian team
manager Agus Wirahadikusumah.
</P>
<P>
He predicted Wednesday's tie against Malaysia to be "very
tight." But he declined to say who are to be fielded for the last
group match.
</P>
<P>
"We never rely on the selection of players to win matches. It
is the players' performance that matters. We will field the best
team in best performance in the semi-finals, either against China
or Denmark," he added.
</P>
<P>
In Group A actions Monday evening, China will play Hong Kong,
China, while Denmark will take on Sweden.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Dongguan city in south China's
Guangdong Province has attracted more foreign investors in
developing export-oriented agriculture in recent years.
</P>
<P>
An official from the city government said that exports of farm
products from Dongguan exceeded 100 million U.S. dollars last
year, twice that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, investors from more than 10 countries and regions
such as the United States, Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong
established 151 agricultural enterprises in Dongguan with an
investment exceeding one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the center of the Pearl River Delta area, Dongguan
was formerly an agricultural county. To bring its advantage into
full play, the city government set up a special agency for
the introduction of foreign investment in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Now, agriculture in Dongguan has become a magnet for foreign
investors, who also brought with them advanced technology, funds
and markets. Agricultural products such as flowers, vegetables,
and fruits are exported to Europe, the United States, and
Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges G8 to Write off Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has appealed to Group-8 donors to write off the debts of the
heavily indebted African countries, Zambia Daily Mail reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon Sunday in Windhoek, capital of Namibia,
Chiluba said the debts had a lot of negative impact on the
African economies.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who went to Windhoek to attend a three-day Southern
African Economic Summit which starts Monday, stressed that the
amount of money Zambia spends on servicing its debt denied the
country the chance to plow back the resources into development.
</P>
<P>
As long as the G8 do not write off the debts, African
economies will remain poor, said the Zambian president, adding
that the heavy debt which has reached 7.2 billion U.S. Dollars by
the end of 1997 has been eating Zambia's resources for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
When asked on the future of Zambia's two largest copper mines,
Nchanga and Nkana, which is going to be privatized, Chiluba said
that his country has the best grade of copper in the world and
there is no doubt that the remaining mines will also be sold.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he is interested in seeing that only good
investors come to Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cultivating Rice Seedlings In "Workshop" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Some farmers in central-south
China are in the process of phasing out the centuries-old method
of cultivating rice seedlings in paddy fields, and turning instead
to "workshops".
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the town of Quantangzi in Hunan Province now buy
their rice seedlings from a local greenhouse where agronomists
develop seedlings assembly fashion instead of on fields.
</P>
<P>
A conveyor belt moves along slowly and soil, seeds, and water
being added evenly in a process that takes only about a minute,
and in 10 days, the seedlings are ready for sowing.
</P>
<P>
The "ready-made" seedlings save farmers a lot of trouble and
are fairly high in quality, one farmer said.
</P>
<P>
The local agricultural technology station has signed an
agreement with farmers that said it will pay for any losses caused
by faulty seedlings.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up four of these "workshops" as part of a
commercialization process, and this year plans to use the
factory-produced seedlings on more than 300,000 hectares of paddy
fields.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Factionalism Said to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The internal fighting and factions
within the ruling Zanu (PF) party is a national crisis that
should be resolved as it affects the whole country, a senior
Trade Union official has said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions Morgan
Tsvangirai said Zanu as a ruling party led the country through
its policies and ideologies, hence the nation could not afford to
have open hostility and factions within the party.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a University of Zimbabwe student
representative council-organized meeting on tackling the current
national socio-economic and political crisis facing the country
at the end of last week, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the internal explosion within Zanu where people are
creating factions to the point that there is no direction and yet
this is a ruling party is a national crisis."
</P>
<P>
On the country's economic crisis and escalating cost of
living, he said Zimbabwe was slowly moving toward a serious state
of decay mainly due to political discontent within the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
"This crisis is not a laughing matter, we need to build a
Zimbabwe which is not divided but one that moves toward national
integration, work out logistics that will see prices of basic
commodities going down," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for decisions to be made to improve the
country's economy and the president cannot avoid this," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there was also need for a national anti-corruption
commission to be set up to look into several senior government
officials and ministers and their activities with a view to
recovering national resources that were squandered to benefit a
few individuals.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, member of parliament Margaret Dongo said
Zimbabwe should not treat constitutional reform as the only
remedy to the current socio-economic and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
She said under the new constitution, parliament should have
the power to pass a vote of no-confidence in the president with
all MPs being democratically elected.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Helping Small State Firms in Northwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A marriage between the private sector
and small state-owned businesses is now in vogue in the capital of
China's Shaanxi Province, where 151 private enterprises have got
involved in restructuring state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
They use stock transfers, acquisitions, leasing, and management
agreements. This practice started when the provincial government
set up policies to revitalize small state businesses and to
encourage the non-state sector to participate.
</P>
<P>
Combining state firms' resources and equipment with private
businesses' greater flexibility and awareness of market
competition has had some successful results.
</P>
<P>
Two private pharmaceutical companies, for example, put 5.58
million yuan into a state-owned pharmaceutical factory in 1996 to
form the Shaanxi Dongsheng Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, which had
profits of 10 million yuan last year, making it one the province's
best pharmaceutical companies and a source of employment for 180
laid-off employees of the state-owned enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The city has more than 10,000 small state-owned businesses,
most of them troubled by poor performance and some even teetering
on the brink of bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Chief Leaves for Russia for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi left here for Moscow Monday on a five-day
visit to try to talk the Russians out of a missile sale to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
According to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency, Haradayi's
visit was also aimed at cementing Turkish-Russian military ties.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Karadayi will do his utmost to dissuade
Russia to go ahead with its S-300 missile deal with Cyprus, which
could become a potential flashpoint in the region if handled
improperly.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials have said the missiles will be delivered to
Cyprus in mid-August and argued that Turkey should withdraw its
40,000-strong troops from the divided island first.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government decided last year to purchase Russian
S-300 surface-to-air missile system to upgrade its defense
capability.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reacted strongly to the deal and threatened to block
the delivery of the missiles and, if that fails, to destroy them.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed on the island and took over the the northern third in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained around 40,000 troops in northern
Cyprus, which was declared unilaterally by Turkish Cypriots in
1983 "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only by
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish army chief, in addition, will discuss with Russian
officials alleged Moscow's support to Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party, which has been fighting Ankara since 1984 for the
establishment of an independent Kurdish state in southeast
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Spend 4b Shillings on Rural Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said the government is to spend 4 billion Uganda Shillings (4
million U.S. Dollars) on road maintenance in rural districts.
</P>
<P>
Museveni was quoted by Monday's New Vision newspaper as saying
the money would keep at least 75 percent of the feeder roads in
good conditions.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read by the Second Deputy Prime Minister Moses Ali
in Kampala Friday, Museveni attributed the bad road conditions to
lack of road maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The president urged district officials to cooperate so that a
good road network can be built.
</P>
<P>
"Even if you are not prepared to cooperate in other areas, I
urge you to at least cooperate in the road sector area. Plan,
construct and repair your roads jointly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of roads is
the legal obligation of district councils, he added.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains brought by the El-Nino weather phenomenon
destroyed many feeder roads across the country, hindering the
local produce from reaching the market. Now many feeder roads are
still characterized by poor or non-existent drainage and broken
culverts.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will be the sole member
state of the East African Cooperation (EAC) which is set to win
its revenue collection target for the 1997/98 fiscal year ending
June.
</P>
<P>
Both Uganda and Tanzania -- the other two EAC members -- say
they will not be able to make it mainly due to the heavy El Nino
rains, the East African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's projected revenue for the year totals 160 billion
Shillings (2.7 billion U.S. Dollars), compared with the 146
billion (2.4 billion Dollars) collected in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA)'s Commissioner-General John
Msafari said it is new measures to curb dumping and diversions of
transit goods such as sugar, textiles and tyres, onto the
domestic market that boost Kenya's revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
Kenya introduced cash bonds for goods in transit last year.
The move was widely criticized by the Ugandan business community,
but has reduced the malpractices and boosted revenue collection,
Msafari said last week in Entebbe, Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Counting on improvements in revenue administration and
widening the tax base, Kenya has further emphasized customs and
excise duties as the main areas of revenue collection, he said at
a meeting of the EAC revenue authority bosses.
</P>
<P>
And unlike Uganda and Tanzania which rely heavily on
agriculture, Kenya has a booming financial market (which it taxes
heavily) and a lucrative insurance business, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Of Uganda's projected total revenue of 840 billion Ugandan
Shillings (700 million Dollars), 829 billion Ugandan Shillings
was expected from taxes accruing from improved tax administration
by the Uganda Revenue Authority for the year.
</P>
<P>
The balance of 11 billion Ugandan Shillings was expected from
appropriations in aid.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania could not meet the projected revenue of 631 billion
Tanzanian Shillings (949 million Dollars) for the 1997/98 year,
although it has imposed high tax rates on agricultural products,
including an export tax of two percent stamp duty, said Tanzania
Revenue Authority boss M.E. Sanare.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's total revenue in the 1996/97 fiscal year was 550
billion Tanzanian Shillings (827 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sanare blamed the adverse weather as the main reason behind
his body's failure to meet the target.
</P>
<P>
"It is becoming difficult to achieve the targets because of El
Nino," he said.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains in the region since last October caused damage
to the railway linking land-locked Uganda to the Port of
Dar-es-Salaam, thus leading to a substantial decrease in Ugandan
cargo, denying Tanzania Harbors Authority and Tanzania Railways
Corporation revenue.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Sharp Rise in Cement Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Numerous construction projects in
Nigeria may soon ground to a halt following an acute shortage of
cement which has suddenly shot up the price of a 50kg bag of the
product by 66.7 percent, the Business Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly, dealers in Lagos, the business center
of the country, blamed the hike on a sudden increase in demand
which has made it difficult for both local producers and
importers to ensure adequate supply to the market.
</P>
<P>
The price of cement is even higher in the national capital
Abuja where the on-going boom in construction projects have
caused massive diversion of cement from other parts of the
country but the supply is still far from enough.
</P>
<P>
The work on the completion of many abandoned building projects
across the country and the numerous road construction work going
on in Abuja and other parts of the country also contribute to the
nationwide short supply of cement.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources at the same time also blamed the inability of
Nigeria's six functional cement manufacturing companies to meet
the sudden jump in demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly, there were fears last week that the
federal government's ambitious housing plan and that of the
states may suffer a serious setback if the dangerous trend in the
cement market is not rectified immediately.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Ban Chemical Fishing in L. Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has embarked
on a campaign to stamp out chemical fishing in Lake Victoria to
save the country's fishing industry worth five billion Shillings
(83.3 million U.S. Dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
The use of a chemical known locally as "Ambus" to harvest fish
in the lake is likely to complicate the crisis facing the
industry, following a ban on east African fresh fish exports to
European Union market, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Governmental chemists in Nairobi have found the fish to be
contaminated with the "Ambus" chemical and declared it unfit for
human consumption. Some fishermen have also been arrested on
suspicion of using the chemical.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have established that "Ambus" originated from
Uganda, said fishing expert Mathias Waful.
</P>
<P>
Fi;4ermen sprayed the chemical in water and returned five
hours later to collect their catch, which would be floating on
the surface of the lake, the second largest fresh water lake in
the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Bonded Zones Focus on High-tech Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Futian Bonded Zone near the
Shenzhen River has been known for its large warehouses, but now
multinational corporations such as IBM and Chia Tai of Thailand
are locating high-tech industrial businesses there.
</P>
<P>
"Land resources in the bonded zone are limited, so we will give
priorities to developing high-tech sectors and advanced
industries," said Qiu Shuming, director of the zone's
administrative bureau.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong province where the Futian Bonded Zone is located
approved the formation of six bonded areas, four of which are
operational, and used 1.27 billion U.S. dollars of overseas
investment by the end of 1997, including 276 million last year,
which mainly went to high- and new-technology projects.
</P>
<P>
The Futian Bonded Zone is making greater efforts to restructure
its storage and distribution-based industries in a bid to have 60
percent of industrial production and 15 percent of contributions
by newly emerging sectors within three years.
</P>
<P>
The Shantou Bonded Zone opened six high-tech foreign-funded
ventures last year involving diamond cutting tools, disinfectants
and computers.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Bonded Zone is now busy negotiating with foreign
partners on building a computer city in the area, aiming to
produce three million computers, 2.5 million central processing
units, and 300,000 laptops annually over the next few years.

<HEADLINE> Biotech in Silicon Valley Still Hot for Venture Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Biotech and medical companies
in Silicon Valley received almost 100 million U.S. dollars of
venture capital in the first quarter this year, according to a
survey by the consulting firm Price Waterhouse.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the sector, which has been a hot area for venture
capital, drew 532 million dollars. In 1996, it received 377
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of total venture dollars devoted to biotech in
Silicon Valley has declined from 25.7 percent in 1994 to less than
15 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But analysts say that the relative decline reflects the boom in
information technology, not a turning away from biotech.
</P>
<P>
To attract venture capitalists, biotech companies have to prove
not only the effectiveness of a new technology or a new drug, but
also their ability to contain costs in health care.
</P>
<P>
Two of the hottest areas of interest for venture capitalists
are medical devices and the so-called "tools" such as databases
and research software.
</P>
<P>
Two companies, which received a total of 27 million dollars,
are developing micro-catheters to diagnose and treat heart
disorders and bypass devices used through the skin.
</P>
<P>
Venture capitalists have been even more enthusiastic about the
marriage of computer technology with biomedicine.
</P>
<P>
Among those receiving the big money are companies which, helped
along by the Human Genome Project, attempt to offer a range of
databases and ways of analyzing disease.
</P>
<P>
The project is meant to identify the roughly 100,000 human
genes. Its ultimate promise is to enable a doctor to prescribe
treatment knowing particular genetic structure of the patient. But
before researchers arrive at that point, a great deal of work must
be done. Now by using existing databases and the computational
programs offered by these companies, a researcher can cut the time
needed to design tests.

<HEADLINE> Africa, US Corporate Fraud Rates Highest: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Africa and the United States have
the highest rates of corporate fraud in the world, a survey by
Ernst &AMP; Young, an international management firm, has shown.
</P>
<P>
The rate in the two regions was pegged at 88 percent of the
organizations polled, while 30 percent of the respondents had
suffered five or more frauds in the previous year, the East
African weekly quoted the survey as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released this month, is based on questionnaires
sent to senior executives in 11,000 large organizations in 32
countries. Kenya and South Africa were the only African states
covered in the survey.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the organizations interviewed had been
defrauded in the last 12 months, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
A key finding was that 84 percent of the worst frauds
worldwide were by employees, usually those who had served for
five years or more. The worst culprits were in management.
</P>
<P>
The high incidence of employee fraud suggested inadequate
internal controls in many organizations.
</P>
<P>
Examples from Denmark and Southeast Asia showed that a
thorough understanding of an organization's entire business
operations by its directors could help curb the incidence of
fraud.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to common opinion, fraud is not something peculiar to
banking. More than 60 percent of the worst case frauds over one
million U.S. Dollars were outside the sector.
</P>
<P>
Of the 628 million Dollars lost in "worst case frauds" in the
previous year, only 485 million Dollars was recovered, and that
included insurance recoveries.
</P>
<P>
The main areas of fraud are listed as misappropriations of
cash and assets and purchasing fraud.
</P>
<P>
Reliance on proper internal controls and internal audits are
listed by the survey as the two top effective ways of preventing
and detecting fraud. External audits, change of management and
reliance on internal "whistle-blowers" are ranked far lower in
the ladder.

<HEADLINE> China's Ethnic Areas Looking For Grain Self-sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
in southwestern China is planning to produce 18 million tons of
grain by the end of the century to become self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The region has only 0.05 hectare of farmland per capita but
produced 16.7 million tons of grain last year, or 350 kilograms
for each person, basically making it self-sufficient in grain, but
it still buys fodder grain elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
It has formulated 150 policies and regulations in the past few
years to promote agricultual production and increased the area
planted in grain from 3.53 million hectares in 1993 to 3.73
million ha in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It has also spent at least 6 billion yuan in the past decade to
help solve food problems in impoverished areas, and in the process
reduced the number of poor people to 3.6 million, compared with 15
million in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The region has been successful in projects that increase grain
production. A dry growing technique, for example, was used on 1.3
million hectares last year, and helped raise per-hectare grain
output by 630 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
If a poor region like Guangxi can be practically
self-sufficient in its grain supply, then China as a whole can
feed itself, says Hu Angang, an economist at the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.

 More Green Land for People Tomorrow
</P>
<P>
To change the backward outlook of Bozhou's afforestation, the
staff of the Bozhou Horticultural Management Bureau, under the
leadership of the Bureau chief Tian Chengshan, have in recent
years been actively implementing the policy set by the municiple
government to turn the city into an "outstanding city along the
Jing-jiu railway (the railway linking Beijing and Kowloon).
</P>
<P>
In years before 1994, there was not a single park in the city,
and the per capita green land only accounted for 3.2 square
meters. However, in recent years, the city has gradually increased
its input on horticultural construction, with a total of more than
10 million yuan spent on afforestation. There are more than 40
hectares of new green land in the city today, or a per capita
share of more than 7 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Emperor Tang's Tomb is a significant
event in Bozhou's horticultural history. So far complete sets of
the park have been finished. Decorated with green trees and
blooming flowers, the park has been an agreeable public place of
entertainment for people from all walks of life and is widely
commended.
</P>
<P>
Bozhou is a city with an ancient civilization. Places of
historic interest can be seen everywhere. The municiple government
has restored and reopened the Huatuo (who is a famous ancient
doctor) Memorial Hall, the Huaxi Building, the Three Kingdoms
Exhibition Hall and the Martyrs Cemetery, etc. It newly increased
30,000 square meters green land. In making city programme, the
horticultural bureau has strictly adhered to a fixed ratio between
new areas and the old ones. For instance, in restructuring the
Xinhua Road, Renmin Road and Bozhou Road, enough spaces have been
saved for future afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Through perfecting local laws, setting up a contracted
responsibility system for afforestation, synthetic control and
volunteer afforestation, Bozhou has brought its afforestation and
forest management onto a new stage.
</P>
<P>
This far, afforestation areas in the city almost make up fourty
percent of its total land. The volunteer afforestation move of the
masses also yielded notalbe results, with 45 new gardens
appeared. Measures to reinforce its afforestation laws also
worked. A supervising unit set up to guarantee the responsibilty
for afforestation was properly held by designated ones.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to such efficient measures, the city sees no incurrence
of infringing on public green land and the survival rate of trees
stays at above 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bozhou, the city already in green, will have a greener
tomorrow.

</P>
<P>
-- A introduction to Bozhou's private enterprise reform
</P>
<P>
With the comprehensive benefit of its village and township
enterprises ranked second in Bozhou in three successive years,
Bozhou, a nationwide model city for east-west cooperation, has
taken the advantage of all favourable policies granted to it at a
on-the-spot meeting aimed at accelerating the development of
village and township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The city has focused on heavy input, outside-oriented services,
businesses restructuring, intensive management and fostering new
economic growing points. With the concerted efforts of 270,000
employees, village and township enterprises have demonstrated its
vitality.
</P>
<P>
As Yu Lin, head of the Bozhou Village and Township Enterprise
Committee (BVTEC), puts it, the features of the city's township
enterprises are as follows.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the deepening of reforms has faciliated the
redirecting of capital. Through renting, merging, agglomerating,
auctioning and purchasing enterprises, Bozhou's village and
township enterprises benefit from an improved structure of
capital and accelerated capital redirecting. According to
uncompleted statisitics, Bozhou's village and township enterprise
reform, centered on reforming ownership, has set 520 enterprised
which were closed down or on the verge of bankruptcy in motion
again.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, under the principle of mutual benefit and making use
of each other's advantages, Bozhou towhship enterprises have
strengthened their cooperation in economy and technology with eastern
regions. A successful example is the cooperation between Bozhou's
Laojing brewery and the Baile brewery in China's Sichuan province,
which led to the formation of "China's Anhui Huisha Group" , a
group comprising 13 enterprises. The mega-merge was approved by
the national agricultural ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the city has been seeking efficiency through
implementing modern management, upgrading enterprises with science
and technology and adopting the strategy of building "famous
brand". As a result, Bozhou now has two village and township
enterprise groups at the state level, six provincial "star
enterprises" , 45 enterprises considered "honest" and
"trustworthy" for their products' good quality. The city also
created 35 high-quality products of its own.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the 753 private enterprises in Bozhou
has strengthened the city's basic industry and improved traditional
industries as well. Some traditional industries, such as the
processing of medicines, Chinese parasols, flour, brew and
textiles, become leading industries.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the development of township enterprises, Bozhou
has attached great importance to collecting capital through
diversified channels and increasing input. In 1997 alone, finance
departments channeled in 3.8 million yuan for township
enterprises. The reform on enterprise ownership has changed the
enterprise financing from a unique one to diversified ones, thus
completely brought money-pinching private enterprises from their
financial crisis.

 A Work of Love
</P>
<P>
 -- On Bozhou's Civil Administration
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of "sharing burden with the central government
and easing worry for the masses", Bozhou's civil administration
bureau have concentrated on reforms, development and stability. It
won many awards for its efforts to improve the city's welfare
system, help settle down veterans and building old people's homes.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Licheng, chief of the Civil Administration Bureau, and
Yao Qishun, secretary of the Communist Party of China in Bozhou,
attributed the encouraging achievement to measures stated below:
</P>
<P>
Strengthen the basis and work on improvement. The Bozhou
municiple government have in recenty years given priority to civil
administration work, setting up offices in charge of civil affairs
in villages and towns, completing grass-root civil administration
network and building old people's homes and memoriors, etc.
</P>
<P>
Advocate socialism ethics. The Bozhou civil administration
bureau and its subsidaries have made unremmitting efforts to build
socialism ethics. It has worked out a 5-year plan designed to
coordinate its material and ethics drives. The bureau has been
honored by the municipal government as a model unit.
</P>
<P>
Take the whole situation into consideration and try to maitain
stability. The Bozhou Civil Administration Bearau has successful
managed the disaster relief work and helped the poor, guaranteeing
to the maxium extend that all relief money in the city's budget
goes to its due places. It has continuously improved its work to
support helpless elders. Among the 39 old people's homes in 29
villages and towns in Bozhou, two were elected models in Anhui
Province, three were elected "civilized ones". A social security
system covering both the city and the rural regions is now taking
shape.
</P>
<P>
Strengthen national defense and help servicemen and their
families. For its work helping servicemen and honoring those give
up their lives for the country, the Civil Administration Bureau
has been praised by the provincial government in two years.
</P>
<P>
Pay close attention to grass-root management. Under the Civil
Administration Bureau's instruction, elections have been held to
740 village and residents' committees. Schools have been set up
for training village cadres.
</P>
<P>
Develop economy. The Civil Administration Bureau has put much
efforts to establishing welfare enterprises. Now, disabled people
who are still capable of working all have access to a job.

 -- An Interview with Bozhou Taxation Bearau Chief
</P>
<P>
In recenty years, the Taxation Bearau of Bozhou city has
collected more than 0.64 billion yuan for local finance. It has
played an important role in improving the industrial structure,
faciliating the adjusting of its industrial structure and
monitoring local finance.
</P>
<P>
The Taxation Bureau, set up in August 1994, now has eight
divisions, six branch bureaus, 28 local taxation offices and one
taxation center, with a total of 293 employees.
</P>
<P>
On the current situation of Bozhou's local taxation, the bureau
chief Ma Zong Yuan sumed up four striking features:
</P>
<P>
First, the tax income has been in a stready increase and making
a growing share in local revenue. Local tax income have increased
from 72.03 million yuan in 1994 to 0.2 billion yuan today.
</P>
<P>
Second, the bureau's control over the overall economic
development has been remarkably strengthened. Taxations conducive
to economic development have been encouraged and those unjustified
under certain laws have been curbed.
</P>
<P>
Third, the structure of tax sources becomes more reasonable,
with taxation on industrial and commercial enterprises making the
main part, taxation on personal income in a sharp rise and
taxation on the added value of land, the usage of veicles, the
house ownership and stamp duties having yet potential to tap.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, reform on tax levying and management is now in the
ascendant. Since 1996, 2.4 billion yuan has been invested to build
a multi-functional modern tax center, which will increase not only
working efficiency but also the tranparency of taxation.
</P>
<P>
Ma Zongyuan said the tax bureau will work harder to make new
contribution to Bozhou's economic development.

Meet the Challenge
</P>
<P>
 -- Bozhou Labour Bureau Chief Lu Wenzhao
</P>
<P>
After being awarded the title of "the advanced unit in human
resources mangement" by the labour department and the personnel
department of Anhui Province in 1996, Bozhou Labour Bureau in 1997
again won the first place in six special respects, namely the
employment of workers, their payment, workers' safety,
arbitration of related disputes and work supervision.
</P>
<P>
To gain the achievements, the Labour Bureau chief Lu Wenzhao
worked hard and shed too much sweet.
</P>
<P>
When Lu took office as the labour chief in October 1991, he
knew little about his new post. However, less than a year later,
he learnt by himself all needed academic knowledge and won related
diplomacy. Under his leadership, the Labour Bureau worked out a
package of laws and regulations to guide their work, and greatly
helped the building of a clean government.
</P>
<P>
Lu said: "The re-employment of the layoffs affected numerious
families, and it also bears impact on the country's economic
development and social stability" .
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem of unemployment, Lu and his colleagues
bend on increasing channels for workers' reemployment. Using media
reports to show the public difficulties laying ahead and win their
understanding and backing, Lu and his colleagues help the layoffs
establish a proper attitude towards their reemployment.
</P>
<P>
They also try to open new ways both helpful to layoffs'
reemployment and the development of economy. The bureau has
resettled 3217 layoffs. Tian Guiying, a woman who lost her job in
an enterprise trimming, now becomes a success with her new career
and is elected a deputy to the provincial people's congress.
</P>
<P>
With government departments being streamlined and Bozhou
becoming municipality directly under the provincial government, Lu
said they are faced with even greater challenge. However, they are
fully prepared, he said.

 -- reforms on financial system of Bozhou
</P>
<P>
For its progess in reforming financial management, Bozhou
Finance Bureau was awarded the title of "advanced unit" by the
Anhui provincial government. It was also honored in two seccussive
years as a nationwide "advanced unit" for its accounts clearing
work.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to development and reform, Bozhou's financial
departments in recent years have accomplished great reform to its
tax and finance system, great conversion of concept of how to
manage money, and great increase to its revenue.
</P>
<P>
The revenue of the city has maintained an annual growth rate of
37.2 precent in recent years. The net annual increase of revenue
remains close to 0.1 billion yuan. Revenue has made up 10.1
percent of the city's overall income.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a series of major steps by the municipal government
to develop economy, the city's financial resoures have been
adjusted and become more reasonable. Its ten development projects,
headed by the Gujing Brewery, have been further improved and its
service sector is developing rapidly. A number of newly-built
enterprises, such as the new tobacco company, the battery company
and the diamond company, become new financial resoures for the
city.
</P>
<P>
More financial spending go to some chosen projects, which means
a more efficient use of the revenue. The finance bureau has made
concrete measures to reduce public money spent in meetings and
telephone fees. Mangement of personnel has been tightened and
reform on the state-paid medical care system has been carried
on. With the continuous bettering of the financial spending
composition, money going to production and construction increases
year by year. Now there has been a total of 385.54 million yuan
spent on production and construction.
</P>
<P>
Management of village finance has been improved. Villages are
now given more freedom to handle their finance, and are also
responsible for the mangement of their revenue. As a result, the
revenue at village-level has been increasing by 62.2 percent
yearly, bringing its share in the city's total revenue up to 35.1
percent. There are 9 villages with a revenue of more than 10
million yuan, among which two villages' revenue exceeded 20
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Financial organs also strengthened the control over capital out
of the government budget. After several years of investigation,
some 80 million yuan out of the budget has been placed on bank
accounts opened by financial organs. With the comprehensive
management of capital out of the budget, the portion of money has
been handled in a more standard, scientific and legal way. And
the continued bettering of financial laws leads to an overall
improvement of financial work.#

</P>
<P>
Chinese TV brands like Changhong, Konca, Panda, and TCL sell
for about half the price of foreign brands and have come to hold
nearly a 90-percent share of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Changhong now has 38 percent of China's color TV market, and
has begun to venture into the world market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 81 percent of the VCD products in China are made
by domestic manufacturers, and Chinese computers now have 60
percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Electronics have grown at an average of 27.5 percent since
1992, and are now competitive in quality, and more and more in
price as well.
</P>
<P>
China has had rapid growth in integrated circuit production, an
important part of the sector, in the past few years, and the
country's first miniature integrated circuit assembly line is
now under construction.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Protection of Yellow River's Source Considered Urgent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Pictures taken by satellite in the
1970s, '80s and '90s reveal that large areas of grassland at the
Yellow River's source have been taken over by sand, according to
today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, China's second longest, has its source in
northwestern Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
People can easily see that the color of the region has turned
from green in the 1970s to yellow on today's pictures, a result of
ecological deterioration, reported the country's leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Due to climatic changes, over-harvesting of trees, excessive
washing for gold and lack of funds for grassland development, the
ecological environment at the river's source has deteriorated
quickly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The paper said yearly desertification along the river source
has increased by 20 percent, compared with only 3.9 percent in the
1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
And environmental deterioration has also contributed to
frequent stoppages at the river's lower sections.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that serious water shortages and soil
erosion there had caused a reduction of farmland and intensified
droughts, which had an impact on the life of local families. Sixty
percent of the province's 669,000 poor people live in desertified
areas.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the State Environmental Protection
Administration as saying that, due to harsh natural conditions on
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as "the roof of the world", it's
very hard to restore the ecological balance once it has been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Experts urged setting up a station along the river source for
ecological change reporting, while excessive logging of tress,
digging of herbs, especially hunting and washing for gold should
be strictly prohibited.

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough in Genes Identification Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists announced
here Monday that crops could provide the raw materials needed to
make industrial chemicals and polymers, such as plastics, thanks
to the genes identified by Australian, Swedish and English
scientists.
</P>
<P>
"We have identified genes which when introduced into plants
could see the plants operating as mini factories and offering an
alternative to petrochemical oils," said Dr. Allan Green from
Australia's leading research body the Commonwealth Scientific,
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO).
</P>
<P>
The possibilities are immense: Components of detergents, nylon,
glue, paints, lubricants, plastics could all be produced from
plants, rather than fossil materials. Plants could provide a
renewable, biodegradable source of these high-value speciality
products, Green said on behalf of the Australian, Swedish and
English team.
</P>
<P>
"Raw materials used to make polymers and speciality chemicals
are modified forms of fatty acids," he explained in a media
release.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, these modified fatty acids are produced from
non-renewable petroleum or by chemical processing of vegetable
oils."
</P>
<P>
"We have identified genes from wild plants which carry out
these modifications inside the plant" without any chemical
processing and polluting waste, he added.
</P>
<P>
"These genes can now be transferred to our major oilseed crops
to create highly productive, biodegradable and renewable sources
of these raw materials."
</P>
<P>
"The isolation of these two genes means that we have
accomplished the first important step toward producing oilseeds
with high yields of important fatty acids."
</P>
<P>
One gene identified produces an enzyme responsible for
creating epoxy fatty acids, the major components in the production
of polymers, used for products such as araldite.
</P>
<P>
The other gene is responsible for a different enzyme which
produces acetylenic fatty acids, important for the synthesis of
speciality chemicals, high quality surface coatings and
lubricants.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in the world anyone has isolated a
gene responsible for the production of an acetylenic compound.
Nobody even knew that such a gene existed before our work
started," said Dr. Sten Stymne of the Swedish University of
Agricultural Science.
</P>
<P>
The researchers transferred the genes into Arabidopsis, a
plant often used as a model by scientists because of its short
life cycle and well understood genetics and produced plants
containing significant levels of either epoxy or acetylenic fatty
acids in their seeds.
</P>
<P>
"The genes we identified come from wild plants not suitable for
farming because of their characteristics such as low yields, so we
are introducing these genes into oilseed plants," Green said.
</P>
<P>
This research has revealed a family of enzymes that perform a
range of chemical modifications to fatty acids and the knowledge
should enable the team to isolate other genes from the family and
further expand the types of oils produced in plants.
</P>
<P>
He said there is still substantial work to be done before
plants producing high levels of these fatty acids are widely
available.
</P>
<P>
An article on the achievement will be published soon by the
U.S. magazine Science, a CSIRO spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Portfolio Investments Swell in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Despite the unrest in Indonesia and
the looming political uncertainty in the Philippines, renewed
confidence in the Philippine economy has pushed up portfolio
investments in the country's financial market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign portfolio investments in the country reached 425
million U.S. dollars in the first three months of this year, up 8
percent from the year-ago level, the Philippine News Agency
reported Monday, citing a recent report from the Central Bank of
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of these investments were spent in purchasing
government securities, equities and bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
Senior economist Gilbert Garchitorena was quoted as saying that
owing to the inflows of portfolio investments, the local composite
index at the local bourses exceeded a seven-month high of 2,311
points.
</P>
<P>
The rising portfolio investments in the country are an
indication that foreign portfolio investors seemed undaunted by
whatever the results of the May 11 polls, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to an unofficial count of votes in the May 11
presidential election, the highly-controversial Vice President
Joseph Estrada has garnered at least 38 percent of the total votes
of 34 million and is heading for an irreversible victory.

</P>
<P>
Two C-130H transport planes of the Air Self-Defense Force
(ASDF) will leave the Komaki air base in Aichi Prefecture, central
Japan, on Tuesday for Singapore via Manila, Japanese government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry recommended that
family members of the Japanese working in Indonesia leave the
country on fears that demonstrations to be held Wednesday on the
anniversary of an independence movement may lead to further
rioting in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 13,600 Japanese nationals and an
unconfirmed number of Japanese tourists in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second time for Japan to send its military
aircraft abroad to evacuate Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Japan had been keen to send military planes overseas since a
1994 revision of the Self-Defense Forces Law under which
deployment of ASDF aircraft for evacuations became possible.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Japan sent three military transport planes to
Thailand for a possible evacuation of Japanese nationals from
Cambodia after fighting erupted between rival factions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Japan withdrew the planes without sending them to Cambodia as
the tensions there eased.

GUANGZHOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Direct sales companies in south
China's Guangdong Province that have had to stop their direct

<P>
KAMPALA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Port Bell pier at Luzira is likely
to be submerged by the rising water levels of Lake Victoria, an
official of the Directorate of Water Development at Entebbe has
warned.
</P>
<P>
Monday's New Vision newspaper quoted the official, who
declined to be named, as saying that Kampala-Port Bell railway
line was also threatened by the rising lake levels.
</P>
<P>
"The extension of Lake Victoria waters inland will affect
Nakivubo drainage system in Kampala to the extent that any amount
of rainfall will cause floods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The landing bay for Clovergem fish factory near Entebbe
international airport had already been submerged, he added.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper issued on May 7 said the flooding waters had
submerged 20 buildings at Gaba landing site, southeast of
Kampala. The water level in the lake was recorded at 12.30 meters
above zero datum, only 0.5 meters away from the highest water
level recorded 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The dock is the water gateway for Kampala and handles big
volumes of imports and exports. The pier connects Uganda's
railway system with those of Kenya and Tanzania using wagon
ferries.

<P>
LANZHOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Lanzhou, capital of northwest
China's Gansu Province, improved its investment environment by
investing in the city's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Major projects included the completion of two expressways to
alleviate auto traffic, electricity reconstruction of the
Lanzhou-Wuwei railway and an expansion of Zhongchuan Airport.
</P>
<P>
A city official said that Lanzhou also increased its investment
in posts and telecommunications. In 1997, Lanzhou accelerated the
installation of optical fiber lines between Xi'an, Lanzhou and
Urumqi, and between Lanzhou and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
At present, all districts and counties in Lanzhou have
program-controlled telephones. The telephone capacity in Lanzhou
has reached 442,000.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reconstruction program of the old city, Lanzhou
expanded more than 20 main roads in the city area, which totally
changed the traffic jam situation in the city.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou built a gas plant with a daily production capacity of
540,000 cubic meters, and more than 400 kilometers of gas
pipes. Two sewage treatment factories were also built, with daily
treatment capacity of 116,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Plus, the city also put in 200 million yuan to plant trees and
grass, bringing the green coverage of Lanzhou to over 7,300
hectares.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists showed Sunday they
can lengthen the lives of some terminally ill breast cancer
patients with a medicine that thwarts the defective genes causing
their disease.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the new drug, called Herceptin, will come
on the market next fall and could quickly become a standard
treatment for one-quarter or more of breast cancer patients whose
tumors are driven by multiple copies of a gene called HER-2.
</P>
<P>
Results of the first large studies of Herceptin were presented
Sunday at an annual meeting of American Society of Clinical
Oncology in Los Angeles, attended by about 18,000 cancer
specialists.
</P>
<P>
The new treatment substantially boosts the power of ordinary
chemotherapy and carries none of the usual cancer drug side
effects, such as nausea and hair loss, researchers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture
Minister Kumbirai Kangai has warned land-hungry Zimbabweans to
desist from occupying farms designated for compulsory acquisition
until the resettlement program begins.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to reports that more than 800 landless
peasants last Friday had invaded and occupied three white-owned
farms in Nyamandlovu District of West Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News
Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The angry crowd Sang liberation war songs and vowed not to
move out until the government agreed to allocate them land for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The villagers accused the government of employing delaying
tactics in the allocation of land.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said, "people should not be occupying farms now since
the resettlement program still has to start."
</P>
<P>
He said relevant authorities in the district will deal with
the situation accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the crowd, most of them women, were clearing land
to erect dwellings.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government designated about 1,500 white farms
for land resettlement.
</P>
<P>
It is, however, uncertain that the land resettlement program
will begin in June as scheduled due to lack of funds.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Companies Fined for Monopoly Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Two natural gas suppliers in
southwest China's Sichuan Province have been fined 50,000 yuan and
150,000 yuan for illegal monopoly performance.
</P>
<P>
During a recent law-enforcement inspection, the capital's
industrial and commercial department found that the natural gas
supply company in Chongzhou city was conducting unfair competition
by forcing other gas businesses out of the market.
</P>
<P>
Applicants for gas supply had to buy gas stoves at the
company's shops or they would be charged extra service fees for
stoves they purchased elsewhere, officials said. As a result,
consumers' favorite choice, the Chengdu Qianfeng Geyser Factory,
had to give up its local sales outlet.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas supply company in Qionglai city was another
example. It had long been taking the advantage of its monopoly
status to force gas users into buying stoves at its shops,
officials said. What's more, it reportedly asked property
developers to pay for gas stoves and pipes in advance, and would
not provide gas to those who did not pay the fees in time.
</P>
<P>
Related department have issued a notice calling for fair
competition and a smooth market order.

CHANGCHUN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Major grain-producing provinces
in China have launched operations to eradicate rats which eat or
destroy 20 million tons of crops annually in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Jilin, one of the top grain producers in northeast China's
Jilin Province, a large-scale operation has been launched on 3.6
million hectares of farmland where about 66 million rats were
killed last year.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said the killing of millions of rats has
avoided the annual loss of more than 600,000 tons of grain, valued
at 600 million yuan (72 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In northwest China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, soldiers
also helped kill so called "big-eye" rats to safeguard grain
storage.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, scientists are engaged in a large-scale test in
Daxing County of a pharmaceutical that affects the fertility of
rats.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the popular use of the pharmaceutical, which is
non-toxic, is of great importance to grain producers.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economic Growth Seen to Weaken Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's overall economic
growth will weaken further this year as the impact of the regional
economic turmoil filters through the economy, the Ministry of
Trade and Industry predicted on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There remains much uncertainty over the regional political and
economic situation," the ministry said in its economic survey for
the first quarter of 1998, adding that it has retained its 1998
economic growth forecast of 2.5-4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry stressed, however, that this assumes no major
deterioration in the external environment.
</P>
<P>
It said the Singapore economy will continue to be shaped by the
disparate growth performance in the Asian, U.S. and European Union
(EU) economies.
</P>
<P>
Sectors highly exposed to regional and domestic demand will
continue to slow down while those exporting to the United States
and the EU will be supported by healthy growth in these economies,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the ministry predicted that hub services like transport
and financial services are expected to slow down further. Segments
in the commerce sector like retail, restaurants and hotels will
similarly be affected by the decline in visitor arrivals and
weaker consumer sentiments.
</P>
<P>
But, manufacturing is likely to remain generally healthy due to
strong growth in the United States and the EU, it said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, construction will be supported by public sector
projects awarded over the past two years while the communications
industry is also likely to continue enjoying healthy growth, the
ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors: Linezolid to Kill Drug-Resistant Germs in 21 Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Doctors revealed Sunday that
they have successfully tested a new antibiotic that may kill
drug-resistant bacteria in the next century.
</P>
<P>
At a conference on infectious diseases held in Boston, doctors
said the new antibiotic, called Linezolid, is part of the first
new class of antibiotics to be developed in more than a decade and
to be selected for trials among humans.
</P>
<P>
"There is a real need now for new drugs," said Dr. Robert C.
Moellering Jr., a Harvard Medical School professor.
</P>
<P>
"This drug is exciting. It is unique in terms of the way it
works, which means that many resistant bacteria will not be
cross-resistant to this drug," he said.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of common bacteria strains have mutated to
become resistant to common antibiotics, sending doctors and
researchers scrambling to come up with new medicines.
</P>
<P>
In its most recent trials, Linezolid, being developed by
Kalamazoo, Mich-based Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, was tested on more than
300 hospitalized patients. Success rates for treating pneumonia
and other illnesses were 90 percent or higher.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, doctors
said, Linezolid would be used to fight bacteria which cause such
ailments as pneumonia and skin infections.
</P>
<P>
Moellering predicted the new drug would be available at the
turn of the century.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Lake Victoria's waters, whose
level rose last week, destroying many homes and crops, is
continuing to submerge more land in southwestern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Local residents said the volume of water in the world's second
largest fresh water lake has increased tremendously and is
spilling over into its basin from Busia in Western Province to
Migori in southern Nyanza Province.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families in Busia, Siaya, Bondo, Nyando, Rachuonyo
and Suba districts fled their homes to escape the lake waters,
the Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit area is the flooding-prone Nyando, where
schools, homes and farms have been swallowed up by the advancing
lake, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the Kenyan government to rescue the displaced have
been hampered by poor roads, made impassable by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The report said many of the displaced are crammed into
schools, churches and market centers in the affected region and
were in dire need of food and anti-malaria drugs.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon was last witnessed in 1961. Some locals said it
is a result of the prevailing heavy rains but a marine expert,
Captain Joseph Mucuthi, said it is caused by the hyacinth weed
which has covered most parts of the lake.
</P>
<P>
The roots and leaves of the hyacinth and other water plants
have collected at the bottom of the lake, making it shallower,
hence the overflow, said Mucuthi.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the increasing water volume to the
shrinking shoreline.
</P>
<P>
The shoreline, "which is now shrinking toward the lake," has
not been surveyed for more than 50 years, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Wind-Power Center Built in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A wind-power center with a
generating capacity of 63,600 kilowatts (kw) has passed the state
technical assessment, the overseas edition of "People's Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The center lies in Dabancheng, in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region and cost 500 million yuan to complete.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 200 power-generating units are in
operation at the center. Another 20 sets of 600-kw units and 51
500-kw units will be installed later this year, bringing an
expected added capacity of 37,500 kw by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The generating capacity of the center makes up one-third of the
total installed wind power capacity in the country, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, the largest inland province-level area in China, has
nine wind zones covering a combined area of 150,000 square
kilometers. The total generating capacity in the zones is
estimated at 80 million kw.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Bracing for Information Age (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Africa, a continent marginalized
by the march of information technology in the early 1990s when
the rest of the world witnessed an unprecedented growth in
telecommunications, is striving to catch up with the galloping
world information development.
</P>
<P>
The inexorable progress toward an information-driven society,
particularly one which places heavy reliance on the electronic
exchange of information, is making telecommunications development
for all countries a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
"Governments across Africa are now recognizing the enormous
importance of telecommunications... and are using their political
will to implement change and upgrade their infrastructure," said
Pekka Tarjanne, secretary-general of the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU), at the just concluded Africa
Telecom 98' in Johannesburg, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
As perhaps the world's biggest potential market for improved
telecommunications, Africa represents one of the last great
opportunities for external investors.
</P>
<P>
While most of the industrialized world takes access to
telecommunications for granted, fewer than one in every 100
Africans has access to one telephone line. The figure can be as
low as two in 1,000 in sub-Saharan areas.
</P>
<P>
The International Telephone Union believes that 70 percent of
all Africans are yet to make their first telephone call. Average
waiting time for a telephone to be installed in Africa could be
as long as five years.
</P>
<P>
It's encouraging to find that some African countries have made
telecommunications a priority and are installing digital switches
with fiber optic inter-city backbones and the newest cellular and
mobile technology.
</P>
<P>
Botswana and Rwanda, for example, claim to have the world's
most sophisticated national networks, with one hundred percent of
the main lines are digital, compared with 49.5 percent in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
But at the other end of the scale, countries like Madagascar
and Uganda have highly unreliable analogue telephone systems and
poor national links between urban centers.
</P>
<P>
Most African leaders realize that the information revolution
offers Africa a dramatic opportunity to leapfrog into the future,
breaking out of decades of stagnation or decline.
</P>
<P>
One of the technology marvels is the Internet, which has
spread rapidly through Africa over the last 18 months. Two years
ago only 16 countries had full Internet access, now 47 of the 53
nations on the continent have developed some form of Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
Currently, around 700,000 people use basic Internet services,
among them, about 600,000 are in the technology-thirsty South
Africa, leaving only 100,000 among the remaining 700 million on
the continent.
</P>
<P>
This works out at about one Internet user for every 5,000
people, far below the world average, which is about one user in
every 40 people.
</P>
<P>
Along with the emerging internet services, cellular phones and
other wireless systems, funded partly by private capital, brought
a more promising solution to Africa's telecommunications needs.
</P>
<P>
Research shows that while the number of telephone services in
Africa has reached a standstill, the mobile sector has developed
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The number of global system for mobile (GSM) communications
subscribers in Africa represents three percent of the world's GSM
users, a dramatic increase from zero three years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cellular telephone services are now available in over 35
countries in Africa, mostly in the capital cities and some
major towns.
</P>
<P>
However, it is astonishing to note that there are more
cellular telephones in Thailand than in the whole African
continent, and more Internet host computers in Estonia than in
sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa).
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of the sector that is occurring in some of
the countries will undoubtedly improve this situation
substantially over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, South Africa, Senegal, Morocco, Tunisia, Cote d'Ivoire
and Mauritius are among the 69 countries which had made their
commitment to open their telecoms markets to foreign companies
under a recent World Trade Organization pact.
</P>
<P>
However, in many countries, such as Ethiopia, governments
still see the telecoms sector as a very important part of their
revenue base and the public network operators are not free to
re-invest their profits in network development.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that if this continues, it may be an even
greater constraining factor than the moves to allow private
sector involvement that are now taking place.
</P>
<P>
African ministers of communications attending the Africa
Telecom 98' in Johannesburg have agreed that for the vision of
communications-based Renaissance for Africa to be materialized, a
coherent policy and regulatory framework should be developed for
the continent.
</P>
<P>
They proposed a policy framework that separated the duties of
government, regulators and operators; established independent
regulatory institutions; and that developed local communications
industries toward global competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
They are also working on programs around human resource
development, and to deal with financing and funding of
telecommunications development in Africa. The ministers have
resolved to set up an African Telecommunications Development Fund
with the aim to establish data banks in the fields of education,
agriculture, health and medicine, Internet which are identified
as very crucial building blocks for Africa's strategy into the
future.
</P>
<P>
One of the major obstacles to the development of
telecommunications in Africa is the lack of finance.
</P>
<P>
The continent attracts a mere 0.2 percent foreign investment
in telecommunications and would need eight billion Dollars if the
target of 50 million new main lines were to be laid in the next
five years so as to attain an average of one telephone line per
100 inhabitants in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, as South African President Nelson Mandela noted, the
investment needs of this rapidly expanding sector cannot be met
by the public sector alone, but through partnerships with private
sectors. Such cooperation, he believed, will promote a climate
for sustainable investment in infrastructure that guarantees good
returns and at the same time helps bridge up the information gap.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, a number of large scale telecommunication
infrastructure building projects have been announced which are
likely to substantially improve the Internet infrastructure on the
continent before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The most notable of these is AT&AMP;T's Africa One, a 1.3-
billion-U.S.-Dollar scheme which plans to encircle Africa with
39,000 kilometers of undersea fiber-optic cable that will link
countries of Africa to each other and the rest of the world. The
project, once completed, will enable 240,000 phone calls to be
made simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
An African Information Society initiative launched by the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, concludes in a
study: "The information revolution is one that Africa cannot
afford to miss... the price of being left out is an
insurmountable development gap between information rich and
information poor nations. If a swift response is not made the
opportunities lost will see Africa's people relegated to second
class status in the new world order."

<HEADLINE> Bohai Oilfield to Produce 10 Million Tons Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bohai Oilfield near the largest
port city of Tianjin in north China has decided on a new offshore
oil development strategy that may help it boost annual production
to 10 million tons by 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Shaodong, president of the China Offshore Oil
Bohai Corp. (COOBC), the Bohai Oil Field, covering 60,000 square
kilometers, has gone through 30-odd years of exploration and
development. It will be the country's first offshore oilfield to
pump more than 10 million tons of oil annually.
</P>
<P>
He explained the strategy as scientific planning and overall
development over four different oil exploration centers within the
Bohai Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The four are: the Liaobei oil exploration center, consisting of
the Jinzhou 20-2 and Jinzhou 9-3 oilfields; the Liaozhong center,
based on Suizhong 36-1; the Shijiuzhai center, based on
Qinhuangdao 32-6 oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Exploration activities in recent years have proven that the
Bohai Gulf abounds in oil and gas resources, with geological oil
reserves topping 800 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Suizhong 36-1 and Qinhuangdao 32-6 oilfields in the Bohai
Gulf are the country's largest offshore oilfields, each with oil
reserves exceeding 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Bohai will use different oil
exploration and development methods according to the conditions in
the four centers to meet its goals, mainly including exploration
across both onshore and offshore, fast drilling, and joint
exploration by linking pipelines.

<HEADLINE> Experts Encourage Children to Go out and Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Parents should encourage
children to go out and play for an hour to several hours every
day, according to the first physical activity guideline drawn
specifically for elementary school-age children in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"Children who enjoy expending calories when they are young are
more likely to do so later in life," recommended the National
Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) in a report
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Those who are inactive as kids are likely to be slugs when they
get older, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Judith Young, executive director of the NASPE, a professional
group of physical education teachers, coaches, and exercise
scientists, said that parents who keep their children heavily
scheduled with organized sedentary activities such as piano or
computer lessons ought to adjust their priorities to make physical
activities part of children's life.
</P>
<P>
The report encourages children to get more variety than regular
routine of walking, running and weight-training skills
characterized by much adult exercise.
</P>
<P>
Most of children's time should be in activities such as
climbing, tumbling and other things that have few rules and little
formal organization, the NASPE recommended.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Promote Forest Products Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Primary Industries
Minister Lim Keng Yaik appealed to ASEAN countries Monday to
cooperate closely in market promotion for forest products in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Opening the first meeting of ASEAN senior officials on forestry
here, Lim said individual countries of ASEAN might be competing
for the same export markets for tropical timber products. "But
considering the numerous problems we face, it is not difficult to
recognize the usefulness and necessity for member countries to
pool resources for mutual benefits."
</P>
<P>
The nine-member grouping should adopt export-oriented policies
and produce better quality forest products to counter competition
from the Pacific islands, Africa and South America as well as
temperate hardwood and softwood, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN should source more from each other and welcome the
proposed mechanism of bilateral payment arrangement, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, a major tropical forest region in the world with forest
covering some 180 million hectares or 60 percent of the land area,
 is the most important supplier of tropical timber products in the
world, accounting for more than 70 percent of the international
trade of these products valued at more than 15 billion U.S.
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the grouping has thus far been able to withstand
several attempts to discredit tropical timber by way of adopting
common positions on international forestry and timber issues.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials at the three-day meeting will discuss mainly
an ASEAN Vision Statement on Forestry, in particular the
cooperative efforts and a strategic action plan for consideration
by the Sixth ASEAN Summit to be held in Hanoi in December.
</P>
<P>
The officials are expected to discuss flagship projects which
will be initiated by particular member countries.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Cambodians Begin Voter Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Cambodians began Monday to head
for the Buddhist temples and schools, voter registration centers
for the general election scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
Registration opened about 7:00 a.m. local time and would last
28 days to June 15.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, with a population of 10.45 million, has 5.43 million
eligible voters who will elect 122 parliament members in the
election.
</P>
<P>
The number of registration of the first day was lower than
expected, maybe because of rain, or lacking of media propaganda,
with many still didn't know which centers would be operating.
</P>
<P>
However electoral officials said there were reports of
equipment failures and shortages of registration materials that
could have caused the low registration.
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult for us, but we will do our best to
resolve the problems," they said.
</P>
<P>
The election, the second general election since 1993, is
estimated to cost more than 26 million U.S. dollars, for which the
international community will pay for at least 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's 1993 election organized and supervised by U.N. cost
tow billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Public Invited to Choose Names for Four Baby Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A hot-line telephone in the Beijing
Zoo has been ringing off the hook with enthusiastic citizens
calling in to choose names for four baby Manchurian tigers.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 200 names have been proposed for the four
baby tigers, which were born on May 1 in the zoo, according to
Zhang Jinguo, vice-director of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
The mother tiger, named Jisheng, has become the heroin of the
zoo. Since 1993, Jisheng has given birth to 18 babies, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The number of Manchurian Tigers has decreased sharply in recent
years, and the endangered animal has been put under state
first-class protection.
</P>
<P>
"This year is the year of the tiger according to China's lunar
calendar," said Zhang, adding that, "Choosing a name may help
raise public awareness of protecting the animal."
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the phone calls were from not only Beijing but also
cities in other provinces. The zoo has set up a name-selection
committee. The four winning names will be announced on May 20.
</P>
<P>
Since 1956, the Beijing Zoo has artificially propagated more
than 100 tigers.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bank to Receive Money for Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Cash-strapped Thai farmers are
likely to obtain loans at an affordable rate from the Bank for
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative in the near future, as
the bank is to receive 10 billion baht (263 million U.S. dollars)
low-interest loans.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Monday quoted Deputy Finance Minister Pitchout
Phanvichartkul as saying that the money would come from the
government's 5 billion dollar global bond issue.
</P>
<P>
Projects eligible for loans include shops in rural communities,
processing and production of agricultural products, and planned
central agricultural markets.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the cabinet approved law changes, allowing
low-interest loans for the above mentioned purposes. The changes
are waiting for the consideration of the parliament next month.
</P>
<P>
The Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative obtains
financial support from various sources such as the World Bank. But
the 11 percent interest rate makes it impossible for the bank to
relend money to farmers at rates which they can afford.
</P>
<P>
But if the bank could obtain funds at 8 to 9 percent, it can
pass on the benefits to farmers.

Dhaka, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has been committed to
protecting the rights of children, The Independent daily reported

</P>
<P>
This was stated by Mozammel Hossain, state minister for women
and children affairs and social welfare, while inaugurating a
workshop on promoting good practices in implementing the
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in Dhaka Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Grows by 5.6 PCT in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy grew by 5.6
percent in the first quarter of this year, the Ministry of Trade
and Industry said on Monday as it released the Economic Survey of
Singapore for the first quarter 1998.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter economic survey showed that the
manufacturing, construction and financial &AMP; business services
sectors all turned in moderately healthy growth on a year-on-year
basis.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the regional economic slowdown has begun to
bite, with growth momentum slowing in the first three months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
All sectors showed weaker year-on-year growth, as compared to
the previous quarter, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
It said that manufacturing output rose by 6.1 percent, partly
due to the low base in the first quarter 1997, and partly because
of the strong growth in the chemical and transport equipment
industries.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry increased by 4.6 percent, with strong
growth in semi-conductors, printers and printed circuit board
assemblies.
</P>
<P>
The financial &AMP; business services sector expanded by 6.3
percent, down from 9.6 percent a quarter earlier. Growth in
financial services was dragged down by a slowdown in regional
financing and a tapering off in volatility in the foreign exchange
markets.
</P>
<P>
The commerce sector saw a significant slowing in growth
momentum in the first quarter of the year as consumption demand,
both external and domestic, moderated. Overall sectoral growth was
a sluggish 1.2 percent in the first three months, down from the
3.2 percent a quarter earlier.
</P>
<P>
Growth in transport and communications moderated to 6.1
percent, on the back of the continued slowdown in trade and
economic growth in the region, the survey said. It added, however,
that the communications sub-sector remained healthy, supported
mainly by increased competition in the mobile communications
segment.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector continued to turn in double-digit
growth of 11 percent. Construction activity remained healthy,
given the strong pipeline in recent years, it said, pointing out
that public-sector residential building and civil engineering work
supported the growth.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Imports of Luxury Goods Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand saw a sharp fall in luxury
goods imports during the first two months this year compared with
December 1997 and the same period of the previous year, the Nation
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Finance Ministry, imports of 17 luxury goods
categories in January this year totaled 25.61 billion U.S.
dollars, down 14 percent from December 1997 and 68.86 percent from
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
The top six import items in January this year were cameras and
accessories, liquor and spirits, perfumes and cosmetics, fruits,
watches and accessories and optical lenses.
</P>
<P>
As for February, the imports of the 17 categories of luxury
products were up 10 percent from the previous month but down 48.26
percent from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has launched campaigns such as "Thais-Help-Thais" and
"Do It Right for Thailand" in a bid to encourage people to buy
domestic products to reduce the foreign currencies outflow caused
by importing luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government also raised import duties on luxury goods
in February this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Pioneer Earthquake Prediction (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several years of experimentation have shown that the method is
particularly suitable for forecasting earthquakes in island and
coastal areas. Out of the 34 successful predictions made between
January 1990 and May 1997, 11 were of quakes which occurred in
Taiwan, eight in Japan and four in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Qiang further explained that a large quantity of a kind of
hydrate, which is made up of a methane molecule and five water
molecules, exists 200 m to 300 m under the surface of the
ocean. The increasing stress force before the earthquake may cause
the hydrate to release large quantities of methane gas and form a
low-lying cloud, and this may lead to a sharp increase of
temperature.
</P>
<P>
Qiang said that he believes that an anomalous temperature rise
which is not caused by meteorological factors is the precursor of
an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, clouds may obscure this and cause
difficulties for prediction.
</P>
<P>
A quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale jolted Zhangjiakou
Prefecture in northern China's Hebei Province on January 10 this
year. The quake was not predicted because the area was overcast
for several days before the quake, Qiang explained.
</P>
<P>
But this may be overcome by using microwave remote-sensing
technology, said Qiang, adding that China is designing a system of
seven small satellites for this purpose, equipped with microwave
radiometers.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert K. Vincent of the Department of Geology of Bowling
Green State University, Ohio, has introduced the earthquake
prediction method developed by Qiang Zuji and Dian Changgong in
his newly published textbook, "Fundamentals of Geological and
Environmental Remote Sensing."
</P>
<P>
Vincent says that the technology is compelling enough to be
included in his book because of its potential for being one of the
greatest contributions that remote sensing can make to mankind.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were

anti-government militants raided Colombia's main oil town before
dawn on Sunday, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The attack in Barrancabermeja, in northeastern Santander
province, was the latest incident in a wave of violence that is
part of a paramilitary campaign to sow terror before the May 31

"There are 30 people either confirmed dead or reported

MEXICO CITY, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 50 people have died
fighting forest fires in Mexico so far this year, which is hit by
a record low rainfall because of the El Nino weather phenomenon,
official reports said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With rainfall at one tenth of average levels, Mexico is plagued
by its worst drought in 70 years, said Environment Minister Julia
Carabias following a visit on Saturday to the southern state of
Chiapas, where raging blazes have turned it to a disaster area.

Some 1,500 firefighters were trying to check a deadly fire
burning ancient rainforests in southern Oaxaca state, home to
thousands of rare species of plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
According to La Jornada newspaper, 25 million acres (10 million
hectares) of farm land in Mexico have already been lost to the
drought and the government will have to increase imports of basic
grains by 12 to 17 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Pioneer Earthquake Prediction Technology (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The dream of many scientists to
accurately predict earthquakes several days in advance will come
true in a foreseeable future, thanks to the joint efforts of
Chinese seismologists, meteorologists and their colleagues in
other branches of science.
</P>
<P>
Two recent quakes, which hit Okinawa in Japan and Tangshan City
in northern China on May 4 and April 14, respectively, were
successfully predicted by a group of Chinese scientists who
employed a thermal infrared remote-sensing method using a satellite.
</P>
<P>
A thesis on this subject written by Qiang Zuji, Dian
Changgong and Li Lingzhi, researchers at the Satellite Prediction
Research Center for Natural Disasters under the China Aerospace
Corporation, will be published in the latest issue of the
journal China Science.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1997 a total of 80 predictions were made, of which
41 were accurate in terms of time, location and magnitude,
according to professor Qiang, "And the accuracy is increasing."
</P>
<P>
Writing in the US journal Science last year, several US
seismologists said that it was impossible to predict earthquakes
accurately with the present technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese scientists believe that satellite thermal
infrared technology, combined with technologies borrowed from
other branches of learning, can bring new accuracy to earthquake
prediction.
</P>
<P>
Qiang, who earned his master's degree in the late 1950s in the
former Soviet Union and has been studying earthquakes for decades,
explained that before an earthquake strikes, local rock formations
are under great pressure, and cracks may appear around the quake
center, releasing carbon dioxide, hydrogen, nitrogen and methane.
</P>
<P>
These gases may release thermal energy and produce thermal
infrared anomalies, said Qiang.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon can be detected with satellite remote sensing
technology. Then, combined with research on geological structures,
the distribution of quake belts, and other meteorological data,
the time, location of the epicenter and magnitude of the quake can
be predicted, he added.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Think of Cutting-Across-Frontiers Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan reminded American students that too many people are still
thinking about international issues "in local terms, constrained
by boundaries."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Sunday at Macalester College in St. Paul,
Minnesota, where he was to receive an honorary degree.
</P>
<P>
He said issues in the face of the 185-member-state United
Nations such as environment, drugs, pandemics, sustainable
development are all issues cutting across all frontiers.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the challenges of our age are problems without
passports; to address them we need blueprints without borders. The
United Nations is there to provide them."
</P>
<P>
"And yet, this same United Nations is undergoing a financial
crisis, the unpaid dues owed by the United States amounts to 1.6
billion U.S. dollars. While this is a critical sum for the United
Nations, it's slightly less than the money Titanic has made around
the world in a matter of months."
</P>
<P>
"Reflect for a moment on what 1.6 billion dollars actually
means to a great country like yours. On a per capita basis, it
represents just over six dollars per American to repay a debt
built up over a decade."
</P>
<P>
"That amount would not buy you a pitcher of beer at O'Garea's."
</P>
<P>
Annan completed his studies in economics at the college in 1961
when he was 23, following his studies at the University of Science
and Technology at Kumasi, Ghana, his home country.

<HEADLINE> North Chinese Province Opening Property Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
has decided to start a secondary property market in the latter
half of the year for government-subsidized apartments bought by
employees of state-owned enterprises or institutions.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that provincial authorities have been working
hard to come up with ways to standardize trade on the secondary
market and they will start by halting the practice of distributing
apartments as a welfare form.
</P>
<P>
The province will use special construction funds of different
institutions for the housing market and provide subsidies to
workers to cover the expense of buying their own apartments and
for repaying housing loans.
</P>
<P>
Various departments, state-owned enterprises, and institutions
will have to sell newly-built apartments and vacant flats at cost,
the sources say.
</P>
<P>
By July 1, the cumulative public housing fund is expected to be
enough to cover all employees of state-owned or collectively-owned
enterprises. State banks will also provide apartments loans in
medium-sized or larger cities.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has increased its original investment for housing this
year to 15 billion yuan and it expects to add 20 million sq m of
apartments this year.
</P>
<P>
It will also try to improve 5 million sq.m. of old apartments
to add to the market.

<HEADLINE> Low-cost Desktop PC Market to Balloon --Analysis Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Low-cost personal computers,
which touched off a price war in the U.S PC industry last year,
may gain large share in the U.S. as well as global PC market.
</P>
<P>
Computers pricing at around 1,000 U.S. dollars will account for
a quarter of global desktop PC unit shipments by 2001, a U.S.
firm, which provides information technology data, analysis and
consulting, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, low-cost PCs had a standing of 12 percent globally.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, said International Development
Corporation (IDC), a commercial transition to lower price points
will help the low-cost category maintain the growth momentum
established over the past year, with sub-1,000-dollar unit
shipments swelling to over a third of the market in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Falling component prices, vendor price aggression and the rise
of Internet are the key factors that led to the enthusiastic
reception and rapid adoption of low cost desktops. IDC said that
these factors will continue to drive the market for
sub-1,000-dollar systems. Increased pressure on component
manufacturers to reduce cost and continued market share
consolidation among the top PC vendors will accelerate the shift
among commercial and consumer buyers alike over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
Although continued price erosion puts increasing pressure on PC
companies and component vendors, users will benefit from gains
both from even lower prices as well as more robust configurations
at existing price points. Advancing technology will allow for more
function integration and software implementation for key
sub-systems, enabling feature-rich, capable systems at prices even
lower than today's.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another market analysis company, Dataquest, said that
today's battles in the PC industry will serve to push technology
and marketing campaigns further in the future. The outcome will
be a positive total computer systems market.

<HEADLINE> Crime in U.S. Keeps Dropping, Says FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Serious crimes reported to the
police in 1997 in the United States declined for a sixth
consecutive year, with reductions in every region, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
However, Attorney General Janet Reno warned against
overconfidence, saying new problems always are possible.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures released Sunday reflected a cumulative four
percent decrease in seven major crimes recorded by 9,582 police
agencies around the nation.
</P>
<P>
The violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated
assault dropped five percent nationally. Far more numerous
property crimes of burglary, auto theft and larceny-theft dipped
four percent.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic declines were in murder, for which statistics
are the most reliable and uniform. Homicide was down nine percent
nationwide but 14 percent in cities of 250,000 to 500,000; 11 per
cent in cities over one million and in suburban counties; and 10
percent in cities of 500,000 to one million people.
</P>
<P>
"We can never relax our vigilance about crime, about
enforcement, about prevention," Reno said, because "there's going
to be a new problem down the road."

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Remains Hot Place for Venture Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Valley absorbed 830
million U.S. dollars of venture capital in the first quarter of
this year, 48 percent more than the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The money went to 156 companies in the 50-mile-long stretch of
real estate south of San Francisco, according to a survey
published Saturday by the consulting firm Price Waterhouse.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the average investment was 5.3 million
dollars, an increase of 39 percent over the first quarter last
year.
</P>
<P>
Software, telecommunications and net-related companies
continued to top the list, respectively accounting for 31 percent,
25 percent and 16 percent of the total investment.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, venture capitalists invested 3.6 billion
dollars in the first quarter. Silicon Valley took away 23 percent
of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two companies in Silicon Valley received funding of 10
million dollars or more. They raised 39 percent of the venture
capital invested in the area. A year ago, only 10 companies
received such large amounts. Typically, the money went to
companies that already have a product and can demonstrate revenue.
The single largest investment, 33 million dollars, went to a
company producing the architecture to enable two-way data
communication through cellular phones and other wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
Home to 7,000 electronic and software firms, Silicon Valley has
been in the midst of a production and employment boom that places
it in the forefront of the U.S. economy. Santa Clara County in
California, where Silicon Valley is located, now leads the United
States in exports, outpacing New York and Detroit and making up
five percent of the U.S. total.
